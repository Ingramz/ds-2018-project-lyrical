Bis,"I got the automatic freestyle
A walking contradiction, I walk for miles and miles
Yes, and now discos in the house
What's it all about, what's it all about, y'all?

Good God, I got an itching in my feet
Gotta dance, gotta dance to the disco beat
It's automatic, but it's so freestyle
I might dance like a robot but it's all mine

So why you dancing like that?
Wearing your pork pie hat
I guess that now we know
Why they call you disco

So why you dancing like that?
You'll be itching and scratching like you was a cat
Got you all in check
But like the wu-tang say, ""Protect ya neck""

We be getting down with the disco crew
We start the dancing and we say fuck you
To all the people who treat us like toys
We be kicking it down like were the beastie boys

So why you dancing like that?
Wearing your pork pie hat
I guess that now we know
Why they call you disco

Kicking like you're Bruce Lee
With your partner ally
I guess that now we know
Why they call you disco

She can't take more ridicule

And now she's gone
Gone where no one can hurt her

And get into the press
And get your story straight
For your prepared test

You think that it's all new
And its something to say
Maybe someone should tell
You've gone around it the wrong way

Forget what's been fought for glamor won't hide the truth
Just you forget the facts, it's more fun to tease
The only ones you influence are the naive

How will your message fare

Just underscore and then repeat it

We eat what is left, all we deserve
Inclusion is power, a superpower
Is there some space within a song?
This is where I live, so move me

They're listening, there is no sound
Go round in circles, I cannot hear you
We eat what is left
(Tfel si tahw tae ew)
We eat what is left

Bis,"I'm sure you won't remember me
I'm not the man I used to be
I couldn't even say goodbye
Let me explain the reasons why

If I could talk to you today

I know exactly what I?d say

Yes I was wrong, for what it?s worth

I never tire of looking back

My expectations always rise
(I won't be cruel) 
Just at the point that all hope dies

You and me, we?re complicated, in the stars my noise abated
I've spent too much time in this world, understand I'm not in your world
If I thought just for a second, I could have some life injected
Picture me on open highway, driving through the night til the day
I'll be back onto your level, don't believe I am the devil
If you will not break my fall, deny it all
I can't survive here on my own

(So powerful) 
I think I should be getting home

You couldn't even break my heart

Bis,"When the routine bites hard 
And ambitions are low
And the resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
Taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold?
Turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect run so dry

Wet, there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep?
All my failings exposed
Get a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold

Is it something so good
Just can't function no more?

And you insult intelligence

When you remove my need for common sense
Don't let the rain come down

The same day every week

I'll listen as you teach
Just follow, chant and learn
Sign here you must repeat

Now we all look the same
Eight a.m every day
I knew I could change

Will never miss a point
Counting throughout the day
It's me now that they want
I'm so much better

Four years try be like me
You must regret it

Biscuit Boy,"Whilst other couples look for love
In a love so obviously dead
Ours still takes us by surprise
Like a bar-stool over the head

Whilst she cowers away in a cupboard
And he cowers away in the she'd
Ours still takes us from behind
Like a bar-stool over the head

We could swap this helta-skelter ride
And take tranquility instead
But excitement and uncertainty
Are the girl you actually wed

For so many love is a minefield
Spent fearing where you tread
But ours just flies across the room
Like a bar-stool aimed at head

And if your down on your luck
Just duck
Chances it'll probably miss
And if it ever hits
And your head splits
It's a hell of a good night kiss

A hell of a good night kiss

And the day you feel like ordinary loving
When we've grown too old for the stools
We can bring our bruised bodies together
And start loving like ordinary fools

Biship G,"Now little Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop told them lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag; take the pennies out the drawer
Lil' Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day yet listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots and black hat
He's gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs then could get a soccer ball
That's what my commander says
How old? Well I'm like ten, eleven
Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government wants me dead so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher but I'm still to young
This candy gives me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear

If it comes not just too tall for you
You find you something small to use

Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A McCar parade of the toys he made
And in shimmer shades who looks half his age
About half the size of the flags they waved
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
Cause the ones off dead soldier hang a little loose
With AK-47 that they shooting into heaven
Like they trying to kill the Jetsons
They struggle little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, avoided of all childish ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words on their own graves
Think you gangsta popped a few rounds
These kids will come through and murder a whole town
And sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down

Yanked you now, pow

Imagine if I had to console
The family of those
Slayed that I slain on game consoles
I aim I hold, right trigger to squeeze
Press up and y one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs, press pause for your moms
Make the room silence she don't approve of violent games
She leaves resume activity
Start and blew hearts, with poor harsh wizardry
On next part I insert code
To sweeten up the purses of murder work load
I tell him he work for
CIA with A
And operative, I operate this game all day
I hold a controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder, he's only seconds older than me
We playful but serious, now keep on mind for online experience

A stranger in the rain
She was calling out a name that wasn't mine
She grabbed me by the shoulders

And maybe I believed that she was there looking for me
And maybe I just wanted to be found

When the first ship cleared the Panama Canal
For the shipping lanes would mend and change their fortunes and their fates
Well, I'm glad that they can't see what I see now

For there's rubble and driftwood
Where they pulled their dimes to pay for the most majestic dock in the Pugit Sound
And when they cut the ribbon
The county brass band played
What a sad moment it seems they struck up now

No one ever could say why
But oh, the ships just passed on by
And they still don't understand

And how long did I think I could keep up the masquerade
And how much did she know it was a lie
When every bond I'd ever made, I'd broken or betrayed
What made me think that I could step into a life that wasn't mine?

I wrote a note and slipped away
It said, ""Oh, I just can't explain""

Take the shells that you've collected
Sow them with your favorite silver thread
Now you jingle, now you rattle with every step
Skeletons upon the stairway
Showing up the teeth inside their heads
Is it you or are they laughing at what you said?

And when the day came,
You had the same name,
You let your town down

Way down

And when the day came, 
You had the same name
You let your town down
Town down
Way down

In the dark and down the hillside
Run until you cannot catch your breath
Get the band to play a love song...at your request
Smell the cinnamon and chocolates
Marigolds: yellow, pink and red
On the ground you spread a blanket to be your bed

And when the day came,
You had the same name
You let your town down
Town down
Way down

And when the day came,

God is speaking to someone
Right now
I don't know where you are, who you are
God has a message for you
You see, oh, thank you lord

See, whatever it is
That you've been searching for
Searching and looking
Looking all over
You're searching and you're trying to find it
You don't know what it is, god is gonna show you
He's gonna show you right there
What you're looking for
And all you have to do is say yes
Help me

I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes

I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes

All of my life, i'll say
(shhhh!)
Make sure you get this now

My friend said he needed someone
Not searching for just anyone
I recommend the name of christ
He said he didn't need him in his life
But mother's sickness, daddy's lung disease
Financial burden found him on his knees
He searched his heart and realized
Although i'm down, my soul can rise

Am i lost in sin? (i'll say yes)
Is there anyway that i can be saved? (i'll say yes)
If i run to you, will you, will you hear my cry? (i'll say yes)
Will you dry all these tears from my eyes? (i'll say yes)
So many questions, lord

All of my life, i say yes
But i'm ready
And i'm willing
To go all the way
Yeah, say yes

You're spinning around on a ferris wheel
Trying to find what's really real
Now old confucius is wise, i'm told
But him and buddha can't save your soul
Ol' elijah didn't die for you
It's time for someone to tell the truth
When critics say, it don't make sense
I'm the living evidence

When it feels like i can't go on
I'll just say (i'll say yes)
When the world say no
You'll still hear montell, when he says (i'll say yes)
When i'm talked about, and lied on, and criticized
(i'll say yes)
Even then, he'll make everything alright (i'll say yes)
I want to testify

All of my life, i'll say
Through the storming rain
You know i'll say yes
Heartache and pain
You know i'll say yes

You know i'll say yes

I should've never drank that liquor
I should've used a condom
But that's my bad something I got to live with it
If I had my choice to do it all again
I would've kept it moving without even acknowledging your existence
About the deadest beat, mama a child could never have a coke
Using alcoholic, you foul with no class
Sitting, waiting on the checks the arrive that you cash
Don't even spend it on my son then wanna turn around and ask me for more money
Trying to get more from me, bitch I got 7 seven mouths to feed
You think that you the only person with a kid
Trying to pay the bills, how about getting off your lazy ass
To work at a job it's been years
You think that just because you provide a place to live
That's raising them? nah that's just rumor in your crib
Your ol mama said I need to come and grab it quick
That's a shame when the grandma saying you wanna fuck

Because your life ain't shit so when you get hurt from the truth
Go and take it out on him cause life ain't working for you
He looking for a job and I'm bout to buy him a car
You ain't never had a job and you live at the local bar
Sleeping with everybody and being the ho you are
When he graduated he coming straight to me and his step mama
Smack in the face saying you mad cause
I make payments out to his grandma
Cause she got my son back faded
While you got the courts up in our business about a back payment

What I do for my 7 kids most niggas wouldn't even do
For one why you talking, you think because I'm tuned
And I got money out the cooling bitch, you better to walking
It's about the q tip that we spend when it over
Nothing about you and me but you bending me over
Trying to fuck with no grease I be fuse to be over

I know I've spent my whole life running from you
Even though there's been some things you needed me to do
I did it my way and hurt you over and over again
But you were preparing me
To carry out your plan
Though you said that you'd walk with me, some won't believe
Cause the messenger you chose sings R&B
So the man that you rescued me from is the man that they still
And I don't know what to say
I need you to speak for me

So Lord, this is my prayer

Once your promise is fulfilled, the world will be watching anxiously
Lord help someone to see, the YOU in ME

In the midst of your struggles, in the midst of your pain, in the midst of your
Confusion
You wonder, â??why am I here?â?? Glad you asked that questions
God said, You're set apart for a special work, for His glory
That others will see you, but not see you and see HIM
Oh you need to hear this; you need to hear this because
You've been listening to the wrong people
He ordained you, and you don't need anyone else's approval
You've come fully equipped to do what God ordained you to do
You existed with God, even before you were formed in your mother's womb
God knew you
It is amazing
You've tried everybody and everything
Jesus says, â??stop fighting Godâ?? stop fighting
He's knocking at your heart, saying, â??let me inâ??
You're so special
Let the glory of the Lord come through you, in the midst of all your confusion
He loves you

I'm asking you, I'm begging youâ?¦
When you're promise has been fulfilled, and the world is watching anxiously
Come on and help someone, Oh Lord
I don't want nobody to see Montell, if they can't see you
I'm talking to somebody, can I get a witness
You gotta see past the man, in order to see the You in me

What you just heard is real life
It's real life for you, it's real life for many
It's about where you been, yet at the same time you
Hey, you find yourself, in the midst of conflict and turmoil
Yes I'm talking to you, in the midst of conflict and turmoil
Cause you realize hey, it's, time to change right now
And in the middle of that I wanna say this
The Bible says that when I was a child, I spoke as a child
I understood as a child, I fought as a child
Hey, but when I became a man
I put away those, childish things
Did you not know that your environment has shaped you?
Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghetto's
In the upper downtown, wherever it was
The people around you, the things around you
Cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn
But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book
God called you a prophet
When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out
And it commands attention, it commands change
I'm talking about the power, that's inside of you
And in the midst when you're, starting to understand
That I caught the wrong message, and now it's time
I'm hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God
He said, ""Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation""
Old things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold
Everything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you
It's time to stop the killing
I said it's time to stop the stealing
It's time to stop disrespecting our women
It's time for us to come home and raise our children
It's time for us, to really mold our communities
It's time for us, not to get hooked up in religion
But to get hooked up in relationship, with God
And the amazing thing about it
Is wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess
And you can tell God ""I'm sorry;
I had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing
I was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasn't right
And now that I'm getting it right, I'm asking you to forgive me
And I may have done the things, that they said I did
But I'm not, who they say I am; I am who you made me to be
And I'm changing in that, and it takes a few moments
But every time I fall down, I'll get right back up
And every time I make a wrong turn, I'll get myself back in line
Because I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this!""
You can't resist the change
And you're not condemned by your yesterday
If you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny
Move, change, and be, now!

Searching so long, lost in the clouds
Trying to stay strong, and make you proud, make you proud!

And he did it suddenly

Bishop Edgar Jackson,"Uh
I exist
Spoken in a confident voice
Can worlds shift in continent hoist
Look under for the plunder
A rich man’s song that gets sung for a sum out the lungs of a stunna
But life turns to a station and a hustler to a hummer
Went from speaking and now not even sinking
The game is karaoke ‘til it tries to punish poke me
Kinda throw me words slowly fade degrading in the foley
Waving metal sheets make thunder
Fool when I was younger, fool me when I’m older
Fool me now, screw me down to the sofa
Taking so much, drinking soda, eating vulture
Tweeting vulgar, playing Madden getting fat
And getting cultured with the quotes
In the hopes people will get the jokes
If it rains you will get the float
But only if they’re still building boats

But your values system says you believe in sleep more than you believe in grinding
Your values system says you are a consumer and not a producer
That you're spending more money than you're making
Why because you're a consumer
You're reading all the books and you're saying everything the books are saying
But those books are not in alignment with your values!
And you’re gonna go to the next level
Your values are gonna have to change

Drunken Fist versus Praying Mantis
Was it God’s plan or man mismanaged to turn New Orleans to Atlantis?
They lie in the streets to lambast
The black land swam at like a HE MAN in a bathtub
Fire! Cup up the bad blood
Hope hand thugs can write after the lackluster backrubs
Or half structured, or tech hubs, or wack love
That’s stacked as if chance in community chest
God said, “Don’t you ruin me yet
Until I give them everything
And there’s just 2 of these left”
Black bumper slow fades into a vista
Rapid cuts a stock footage which freezes on a listener
Give me love, lovers!
I read it like blood color on the head of a flooded structure
Can’t keep the duck rubber under
Fundamentally it’s buoyant
It rises like court rooms to swoon for your enjoyment

Every single word you say
Well you say it to me
Well it stays with me

I heard every single word you say
Well you say it to me
Well it stays with me

Trap music meets trapezoids, fake his own death
They roll rocks like asteroids to the crest
Think outside the box
I wrap a toy in a cheque
Then watch a sissy fuss with a boy in a dress
Mad at the world
In a voice of a man, with a bag of a girl
She just avoids the success
It’s what he said
Or what she said
Double entendre no matter how you play it
Then he takes the sex tape and destroys the cassette
And puts the ribbon in the sky like the limited of eye
Then prepares to utter, what’s been a symbol in its side
Against the ticker take scene
In a Silver Lake dream
Sorta orders the lungs to unmilitate screams
Shouts to afford sun with imitate beams
In a blue sky filled with pornographic strings
Getting caught up in the trees
I still believe in Jesus!

Our purpose is to ensure
That literature and art sit well
Into the whole revolutionary machine
As a component part
That they operate as powerful weapons
For uniting and educating the people
And for attacking and destroying the enemy
And that they help the people fight the enemy
With one heart and one mind

Every single word you say
Well you say it to me
Well it stays with me

I heard every single word you say
Well you say it to me
Well it stays with me

There was a man who wrote many things
But Carlyle said, um, that we could not be ruined
Because no lie could live forever
William Cullen Bryan said, ""truth crushed to earth, would rise again”
And James Russell Lowell, made it more plain
That we would not be ruined or destroyed
Because he said that
“Truth, forever on the scaffold, lies, forever on the throne
But that scaffold sways the future
And, behind the dim unknown
Standeth God within the shadow
Keeping watch above his own”
These powerful scriptures were also used by the man
In whom we celebrate his birthday today, Dr Martin Luther King
And Dr King told us to practice non-violence and the power of love
Non-violence and the power of love has brought us thus far
The agape love that we have for ourselves
That we have for our people
Is the reason why our people
In this particular diaspora called, North America
Have not been totally ruined
We have not been totally destroyed
We have not been exterminated
So therefore, uh, my dear brother, um, Wasalu
We thank you for what you’ve asked me to do
And we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under God
Workman that needn’t not be ashamed
Rightly this dividing the word of truth
And so at this time, in this city
Where young men’s lives are not worth much
In this city where our people have been discriminated against
And kept from the resources which we
Rightly deserve as a majority of people in the city
We are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world
That I call Elohim Jehova
And we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling
To keep us from being ruined
To keep us from being exterminated
And we thank, the almighty, for the privilege of being here with my niece
Is to impart these words, and I hope it would be of assistance in this project
God bless you and thank you",Quotations From Chairman Fred,2018
Bishop G,"Now little Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop told them lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag; take the pennies out the drawer
Lil' Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day yet listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots and black hat
He's gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs then could get a soccer ball
That's what my commander says
How old? Well I'm like ten, eleven
Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government wants me dead so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher but I'm still to young
This candy gives me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear
If I'm in your dreams then your end is near

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you, there's a war
If it comes not just too tall for you
You find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
Yanked you now, pow

Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A McCar parade of the toys he made
And in shimmer shades who looks half his age
About half the size of the flags they waved
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
Cause the ones off dead soldier hang a little loose
With AK-47 that they shooting into heaven
Like they trying to kill the Jetsons
They struggle little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, avoided of all childish ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words on their own graves
Think you gangsta popped a few rounds
These kids will come through and murder a whole town
And sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you, there's a war
If it comes not just too tall for you
You find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
Yanked you now, pow

Imagine if I had to console
The family of those
Slayed that I slain on game consoles
I aim I hold, right trigger to squeeze
Press up and y one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs, press pause for your moms
Make the room silence she don't approve of violent games
She leaves resume activity
Start and blew hearts, with poor harsh wizardry
On next part I insert code
To sweeten up the purses of murder work load
I tell him he work for
CIA with A
And operative, I operate this game all day
I hold a controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder, he's only seconds older than me
We playful but serious, now keep on mind for online experience

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you, there's a war
If it comes not just too tall for you
You find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon

Bishop H. Daniel Wilson & Voices Of The Valley,"I wake up in the planet's dawn
To find you here beside me
Through the blinds the bands of light
Throw circles round your hair

The passion of the here and now
The sweet taste of the coming
On your lips and in my heart
So naked and so honest

Children laughing in the street
The world grows underneath our feet still yearning
Flowers bursting through concrete
And everything keeps turning

Leaders rise and soldiers fall
But gravity will take us all
Tomorrow dips away
This moment's where I'll stay

This love is mine today
Today
Let me tell you something about myself
And I don't talk too easily

That scented room on the nineteenth floor
Short stories on cordless phones
I quit smoking but drink too much
Don't try and analyze me

Found a smile inside my life
Now nothing feels so frightening
Children laughing in the street
The world grows underneath our feet still yearning

Flowers bursting through concrete
And everything keeps turning
Leaders rise and soldiers fall
But gravity will take us all

Tomorrow dips away
This moment's where I'll stay
This love is mine today
This is love is mine today

And down on the darkest street
The day is waiting to begin
So draw back the curtains now
And let the love come rushing in

Children laughing in the street
The world grows underneath our feet still yearning
Flowers bursting through concrete
And everything keeps turning

Leaders rise and soldiers fall
But gravity will take us all
Tomorrow dips away

This moment will not fade
This moment's where I'll stay
This love is mine today",Today [Contemporary],1996
Bishop Kenneth C. Ulmer,"He came to be, so meek and mild, a savior yet and humble child
A holy Lamb, precious lamb, they called him Lamb of God
It was the greatest demonstration of love that the world would ever know
God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son
And this son came as a lamb, he would become a conquering King
But he came as a Lamb, He would be king of kings
And Lord of Lords but he came as a Lamb, and he came for you
People came from miles around, all to worship and bow down
Oh the privilege, the privilege it was, they called him Lamb of God.
Sheppard's came seeking this lamb, and their lives will never be the same
The angelic host formed a choir, and sang from the heavenliest 
Wise men were wise enough to seek and bow down to this Lamb
He came to seek and to save the lost, he came because he loves you
It's great to know that God so loved the world
But more important to know, that God loves you
Now here it is, many years have passed
They say his time has come and passed
Oh but I'm so glad, that it remains
You're still the Lamb of God
John looked over the horizon and saw one walking as no man walked
And he said behold the, Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world
He's still saving, he's still redeeming, and he's still there for you today
Receive him, say yes to him, and he will change your life
Time can not change him and ages do not time him, he's still the Lamb of God

Bishop Lamont,"[Chorus]
I'm sorry I met you
I'm sorry I hurt you
I'm sorry I killed you
I'm sorry I murked you
Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me
I wish I could go back to where we began
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again
I wish we had more paths to cross
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss
My killer's remorse

For me we are the same should be laughed at
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that
You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately
I'm so christian I'm so muslim
Super size on your mom trigger get push up
I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking
And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is coked
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off
I said memories fade just as blood washes off
Hope to see you soon

[Chorus]

I feel so guilty my hands are filthy
From decorating your face all over the building
I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear
I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam
I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie
We smoked you like the weed in the bong

Have you ever seen the bloodstain
And know that person has returned from every once came
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing
What's done is done chop that shit up to the game
You're still dead when I'm still alive
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi

[Chorus]

Started the bullshit escalated to violence
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence
Now I feel empty not even existing
My worst enemy is no longer against me
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me
And you felt the same thing but never could move me
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards
The dirt on your casket
I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out
And I just sold out and wait for the contact
And life for the combat and now we be on that
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

The dance we shared beneath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known you'd ever say goodbye
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain
But I'd have to miss the dance
Holding you I held everything
For a moment wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey who's to say you know I might have changed it all
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance
Yes my life is better left to chance
I could have missed the pain but I'd of had to miss the dance",Dance,1999

Better grab your reds it's about to get epic
So shoot it in high res while they aligning with the message

Enslave us Africans, raised me to carry gun

Trap with Fox scuffing, kicking knowledge
Tired of seeing ghetto children with nothing
Kids robbing fo' their three squares
Sticking up three squares
Hands to the sky, soul searching, wearing cheap airs
Guns busting, blades sticking
Bandanas covered the stricken
Many of my niggas ain’t niggas
The story was written by the corrupted who’s only goal is to oppress
If I ain’t believe in jah, put a hole right through their chest
But I'm civilized, focus on breaking into their system
Stacking paper isn’t the goal, it's the intermission
Direct your mind’s energies, not on your enemies
But rather on increasing your charity over centuries
This is meant to warfare with solidarity
My legacy is something to celebrate over centuries

Bix Beiderbecke & His Gang,"No use of talkin' no use of talkin'
You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.
There's jazz-copation blues modulation,
Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.
Most everybody likes the blues

Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, 
Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, 
But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues,1999

Biz Markie,"On the mic at this time in the place to be
I'm the inhuman orchestra called Biz Markie
That made you dance, make the music with my mouth and all
But I'm here to talk about the Albee Square Mall
A place where people shop in downtown Brooklyn
Where I can be found, if you're lookin' for me
The B-I-Z, so just come check me out
'Cause 24/7 I'm micin' the house
So when I come in the mall, and then I start to roam
You wouldn't think it's a store, you would think it's my home
'Cause when I come in the place, then I hang up a sign
Reads 'home sweet home', this house is mine

Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall

I been to many malls from state to state
But I've never been in, say, one this great, I hate
To say, about the other shopping centers that's left
But the Albee Square Mall is the doo-doo-def
I be in there everyday, walkin' around chillin'
From when they opened all the way until when
It's about time for the place to close
I'm just running things like a pair of panty hose

They all know me, the Biz Markie
I get more respect than the average employee
Could work in any store in the mall
Because the place is my house from wall to wall
If I could move in, party people, I just might
So I could stay forever, and it will be just like
A bum that you see sleepin' on a park bench
How will it be when you see Biz Markie
I fade them all, been havin' fun
See, to me this mall is like number one
And any other shoppers that try to compare
There ain't no way they could hang out with Albee Square

Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall

I step in the place and shop around for a while
Buy some jewelry for Treny and Ali, and after that I'll
Go take a stroll inside of Gibb's Pups
Then buy some fresh silks, Bally's too
Next stop Olympic, wanted to buy some sneakers
Then hit the Boom Room to pick me up a Caesar
Stroll around with a fly female
While security's riffin' about leanin' on the rail

After that I go eat some food at Wendy's
In the Albee cafeteria, could be shoppin plenty
From store to store just stuffin' my face
And I do the pfrr-one-two while sayin my grace
Finally I step off all alone
Up to the top level to use the telephone
Never use a quarter, 'cause I got a calling card
So I can reach out and touch everybody I know
That's where I be until the day is done
Just coolin' in the place that's number one
So next time you be in Brooklyn walkin around
Play like Price Is Right and 'Come on down'
And

Go shoppin'
Go shoppin'
Go shoppin', let's all go shoppin'

Go shoppin'

I'm just as good as Clint Eastwood, so won't you make my day

Markie the original, yes I am the boss
And I can rock the microphone for you and yours
Go 'til my voice is hoarse
Then take a pause and you know, of course
I can rock a party, with so much force
I'm the greatest entertainer Marley came across
Puttin' pictures in photomat to give 'em a gloss
And I don't eat spaghetti without the meat sauce

Biz Markie,"Now this may sound disgusting and like very gross
But it's sure to have your trippin'
So yo listen close
It's not bright as the sun or sweet like sugar
But it's rather on the bug tip and it's called ""Pickin' Boogers""
Now what I'm emceein' might not seem kosher to you
But it's still somethin' we all have to do
So go up your nose with a finger or two
And pull out one or a crusty crew
Yo, don't try to front like it's so gloomy and gray
'Cause we all pick our boogers sometime every day
Whether out in the open or on the sneak tip
With a finger, tissue, or even a Q-Tip
Take it from the Biz Markie because I'm jokin'
And also, remember this slogan
""Hey, ma, what's for dinner?
Go up your nose and pick a winner""

Pickin' boogers
Pickin' boogers
Pickin' boogers
Pickin' boogers

Let me tell you what happened to me on the train, man

I was coolin' one day with my partner Kane
Headed up to the Rooftop, ridin' the D train
When this man sittin' next to me was so profane
He'd stick his finger up his nose, then do a drain
(You should 'a moved)
I was just about, but all of a sudden, homeboy just pulled out
A big green slimy, nah, I'm not never gonna say it
But it weighed a good pound if you tried to weigh it
He sat there for a while with it in his hand
So I tried to play cool and like ignore the man
So I laid my head back to catch a quick a nap
All of a sudden he plucked it dead in my lap
Now Kane sat there laughing like it was all a joke
But a brother like Biz Markie had almost choked
So I dug up my nose and pulled out about five
And plucked every last one of them dead in his eye
Then the man jumped up and said ""what's wrong with you""
And wiped them off his face and said ""I can't mess with you""
Like if I did something that was so full of shame
But yo you got to know the name of the game

Pickin' boogers
Pickin' boogers
Pickin' boogers
Pickin' boogers

Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Back in public school with my partner Kane
When I was class clown, and he was my brother
Sittin' at the desk pluckin' boogers at each other
Never doin' work as we was supposed
'Cause we was too busy diggin' up our nose
And in the lunchroom you would talk about rude
God forbid the person that'd leave his food
No matter who you are we didn't give a damn
We even put teachers down with the program
Whether if it was a woman or if you're a man
We put boogers on our fingers then shake ya hand
Catch anyone from anywhere
But the best fun about it catchin' Kane out there
Especially when we playin' ball in the gym
I put boogers on the basketball and pass it to him
Now we're grown up and things have changed
But we still be playin' the pickin' boogers game
Just last night, when Kane was gettin' ready
I slipped a little green one inside his spaghetti

Pickin' boogers
Pickin' boogers
Pickin' boogers
Pickin' boogers

Let me tell you what happened to me with this girl

One night at Latin Quarters I was standin' at ease
I saw this gorgeous young lady that I wanted to skeez
I didn't show enough that I really did want it
So, no half steppin', I pushed up on it
Pulled out the gold cable and a knot that was phat
Had a spotlight beamin' on my BizMarck hat
But when she stepped in the light and she got real close
I saw a tiny weeny booger on the tip of her nose
She was dressed real def and her body was hooked
But that dried up booger just ruined her look
I wanted to tell her about it but I couldn't be bold
So I played if off and said ""that's a cute green mole""
I was hopin' from that she would wipe it away
But she didn't do nothin' I guess she wanted it to stay
I said before you get my number, I don't mean to diss you
But write it in your hand because your gonna need the tissue",Pickin' Boogers,1988
Biz Markie,"Ayyo ayyo, ayyo Biz what up?
Yo what up Marl?
Yo man 'member when we first shocked everybody
With a funky fresh beat?
Yeah with the ""Biz Dance,"" and you know
And ""Make the Music"" and all
Word!
Yo remember we had the ""Biz Dance""
Yo we should get a funky beat and redo it man
Yo, I'm I'm bringin' it back out
It's gon' be called, ""The Return.. of the Biz Mark""
 
I'm the Biz Markie, I'm known for beatboxin' and rap
And now it's time, to bring my funky dance back
And once again, puttin' you in a trance
In case you all forgot it it's called the Biz Dance
A movement by the body that's made like a puppet
I'm here to bring it back, and party people love it
So everybody knowin', and those who want to learn
Get up and move your body as I return

Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark
Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark
Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark
Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark

Well I'm here to show you like a dance that never dies
That's put inside within yo' TV Guide
A movement of the body that can't be beat
It's like done by the creatures on Sesame Street
Now I can move my body when I'm dancin' at a party
Like a ballerina that's drunk on Bacardi
I start to think of pop-and-twist
You think James Brown is wild, ah bust this!

Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark
Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark
Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark
Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark

Now, this dedicated to everybody out there that know how to do it
And those who wanna learn, this how you do it
You gotta get funky! You can't get funky, you got to get dooky!
You can't get dooky you got to get doo doo!
And this the way you gotta do it, a little somethin'
You gotta like, swing your hips like this and jump
And then you gotta throw your hand up to your head
And then your leg gotta hit your ear
And then your hand gotta hit your head
And your leg gotta hit your ear and jump
And this the way to do it
Say one, two, one, two, three

Now all the party people that's standin' still
Get on the dance floor and let's all get ill
Kick your legs 'til the right is into the left
And do a dance that is known as the doo doo def
Because to this day, it's still kickin' live
And if I dance with y'all I will revive it
It is of the words and isn't goin' away
I will make it come back like Sugar Ray",Return of the Biz Dance,1988
Biz Markie,"This is another hit from Biz Markie
Dedicated to the radio, not he or she
Be-cause it's time for them to get recognized
This is my version of the Nobel Peace Prize
That's why I'm comin out my face like this
Far as negativity, you never get dissed
If it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radio

This rhyme is dedicated to the radio DJ's
That play all the hits on seven days
And even on the weekends, the DJ's will be freakin
Without a doubt because everyone is unique-and
The way they cut the records, and be talkin
It sound doo doo EXTRA CRAZY DEF on the Walkman
To all the disc jockey's that's on the go
This is something for the radio

Now I'ma kick it like this

I'd like to thank all the people state to state
For requestin my records on the radio great-ly
Appreciate what you've done for me
And my reward to you is my M-U-S-I-C
Straight up, I make the music just for you
So you can do the extra crazy Biz Mark dance too
Or even do the dance made up by yourself
As long as you're in good phy-sical health
Because you're the one that make the radio hype
Like fresh tobacco and a brand new pipe
A program director always pick the right hits
Like puttin some salt and pepper and butter on grits
I ALWAYS look up to program directors
Cause they're the ones, the jam selectors
A couple of years ago when I didn't have a record player
On the radio I thought to myself sayin
If I ever get the chance to playin my stuff
I'm gonna make everything extra tough
Cause radio will last to infinity
As long as my name is the B-I-Z
Emmezah-A-R-K and I'm hear to say
Number one entertainment form in the like U.S.A
Cause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radio

This is the conclusion of just the beginnin
Of hip-hop on the radio, mix never endin
Story and fightin, just to get the right and
Have our respect on a station that's excitin
In about two years, I will be a superstar
Be able to buy anything I want, even a car
Cause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radio

Yo I'd just like to say it like this",This Is Something for the Radio,1988
Biz Markie,"Aaaaaahh yeeea
The diabolical is back again
But now I want the Killerforce Connection
And we gonna do it in harmony like this

We're the Killerforce MC's
The best in New York city
So let us put it to perfection
While we change it to the Biz Mark connection
Other crews in this section always try to ban the connection
They got together and they combined
Tried to hurt us from time to time
But it didn't work as you see
The Biz Mark is in the place to be
So come on party people, get into the groove because
Biz Markie is gonna bust the mood

Biz Markie hey that's me
You know that I body rock to the T-O-P
And I'm the born sure-shot you can't resist
I'm gonna take your girl with my sweet kiss
And he's TJ Swan that's his name
And if you're rockin' to the beat, I'm to blame
I got the power to get you up off the wall
And get you on the floor, so you can have a ball
The cut master Cool V
He is the man that's at the top of the key
Of course he is fast you know that he is slick
So many fly girls jumpin' on his dick

So let's rooock!, until we reach the toooppp!
And we'll never stooop!, the rhythm must must to roooock!",Biz in Harmony,1989
Biz Markie,"Yo this is kinda slow
But I know the Jeeps goin' be pumpin' it
But this is, this is one subject, that nobody don't know about

Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
When you hear my golden voice, you know it's me
The poetical, energetical rap MC

Well that's not the subject matter of to be cool
I'm just tellin' you girls and fly kids, stay in school
I always reminisce when I was in class, well
But you feel like a simpleton when you get expelled

Or, even if you have a couple of days in detention
It's just as good as one bad suspension
So when you're grown up, you'll say the same thing
To your kids, be in class before the bell ring

But you know, kids is kids
To them high school is like a three year bid
I'm not gonna tell a lie, I used to cut class
Until the principal straight got in my ass

He said, ""Biz the only way you're gonna get a BM 
Is to get your education instead of hangin' with him""
So I got my head together, and chilled the hell out
And now all the break-breakers says is check him out

[Chorus]
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house! 

Now this is the second part of this lesson
I'm sayin' it this way cause it's my profession
You don't have to go to high school to be an MC
But you got to know the value and means, of money

'Cause a lot of parents, they are taxpayers
So it's real stupid, when you disobey a
Principal, vice principal or even a teacher
'Cause when you do that, you know you'll never reach a higher level, 
Or even your goal

Because, you don't wanna listen to what you're told
So please take heed, to what I say
I hope I'm not sayin' it for my health today
'Cause if I am please tell me, so I can stop

It's not like I'm your mother sister brother or pop
So come on and listen to me without no doubt
So you can be educated and have, clout

[Chorus]

I'm just tellin' young people to stay away from drugs
'Cause if you mess with that it'll make you bug
Whatever you wanna, like call it, I'm tellin' you
Don't become a drug addict or alcoholic

Because it will mess with your mind and brain
And only thing you wanna do is fiend and complain
'Cause I'm tellin' you just like this off the top of my head
Don't mess with it, cause you will be misled

By other people, devils and demons
I'm Biz Markie, I'm not Alfred Simmons
I'm just tellin' you to do this, without no doubt
'Cause I'm the Biz and I got the clout

Biz Markie,"Now this is a difficult subject 
About something that's crazy
Oh, what the heck
They know they have something that people don't like 
And they still continue to disrespect

The thing I'm talkin' about is an essence 
A foreign fragrance with a presence
That you can't see with the naked eye
But to the nose it's a nuisance
It comes in so many forms, it's camouflaged 

And it will sneak upon you like espionage
You might not know it cause it won't show it
And you will swear it's just a mirage
It can be with you when you're talkin' 
It will be so close, you think it's hawkin'

With a bit of a twang, it got its own slang
Is even known in New York, and
Everybody know what I'm sayin' 

From here to the Himalayan
If you don't know, you must be doo-doo
This is what I'm sayin'
About the dragon

I think i should go more into depth 
About a secret that is quiet as kept
If you have it like Richochet Rabbit
It can ruin your rep

There are ways of preventin' this 
Check your hygienist and your dentist
You might think I'm messin', but this is a lesson
Godliness is cleanliness

But if you think I'm misguiding you 
By sayin' there's somethin' inside of you
That bothers everybody when you're at a party 
And your reactions to it is, ""pee you!""
You're sittin' there baffled and puzzled 

Whatever you have, you wish you was muzzled
But if you want a clue, between me and you
It could be the beverage you guzzle
But if you listen to me 
The diabolical energetical B
The I-Z Mza-Mza-a-r-k-i-e 
I'm tryin a give you h-e-l-p
So I'm a end it off like this 
Before you give somebody a kiss
For the one you adore, check them before 
You get a crazy whiff
Of the dragon

I once knew a guy by the name of Tock
He was one of them kids from like around the block
The kid was cool, had the right gear, and slim 
The only thing was wrong, he smelled like a gym
In secret tellin' rumours, his right guard went left

And his band was playin' a song that was funky to def
He was kickin' like Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly
Word is bond, that kid was smelly
Even if he would shower and shower
Or sprinkle a day, wouldn't last for a hour

He would always wanna like hang around
His underarms had bass with scents around
I tried to tell him, but he just wouldn't listen
He thought from my heart I was tryin' to diss him
I started beatin' around the bush cause he thought I was naggin'
I said, ""Yo Tock, you got the dragon!""",The Dragon,1989
Biz Markie,"One two, one two
You're listenin to the grand groovin sounds
Of the diabolical energetical B-I-Z
Emmezah-A-Rrrah-K
And this goes out to my DJ
The cutmaster that no one cuts faster than
C-double-oh-L V
Drumroll V

It's a different kind of sound that's in the air
It's not shots, firecrackers, or a car that's there
A little different noise for your listenin' pleasure
A sample from a record that's a four bar measure
Adults think this music is just a big headache
They think all this hard work, is just a piece of cake
They must be buggin', right out of they socks
Why don't they get up and try to do, the human beatbox
'Cause back in the days when there was just block parties
A DJ would set up his equipment, and start these
live performances, and DJ tricks
A lot of different DJ's was on the mix
It is a proven fact, music is a universal language
From the tip of Long Island to the Verrezano Bridge
We won awards and served them by the millions
The more more years go by, the more we be killin' 'em
They said it's just a fad, it will never last a year
All of a sudden, ten years later ""I hear music""

[Chorus]
""I hear music""

Cool V, give me a drum roll

I can't believe how hip-hop has progressed
With more and more groups that have finesse
We have groups on the East and West coast with different names
We all play a part if we didn't we'd go in flames
We all got to stick together as one
But at the same time, still have fun
'Cause you don't wanna lose the love for the music
When you have it keep it, and make use of it
This is a lesson from the S-K Biz
'Cause nobody else is gonna tell you like it is
Everyone thought that rap was just a phase
But it still continue, to muse and amaze
It gives people chance to show they true talents
Instead of submittin' to the crime and violence
People said to me the S-K-B
Is rap gonna stay until infinity?
As long as me and V be makin' up the beats
You will hear people sayin' ""I hear music""

[Chorus]

Cool V, give me a drum roll

This is the ending, conclusion, kapiche?
Of this new hip-hop masterpiece
About people countin' chickens before they're hatched
Recollatin' on somethin' that they can't match
They're creatin' sounds of a hip-hop human bein'
Whether you're American or European
Or even if you're from the West or East coast
I'd like to thank all of you, save the most
Don't diss each other by sayin' who's better
Just do it the best way, and stick together
With different rhyme techniques and DJ cuts
And be crazy ambitious, and have a lot of guts
And the people buyin', thanks for your support
Cause if it wasn't for you, we'd all fall short
As long as there's radio, cars and jeeps
You know what you will hear?

What, what?  What, what what what what?
Yo V, yo yo what what what what what what what you hear?

'Cause everything you hear, I'm doin' it

And what I need on my BMW is a kit

And my man Benny Hill, got a lot of wit
The rhymes that I say are the ultimate
And the way out anywhere is called an exit
A real short play is called a skit
And New Balance sneakers are legit

I'm not even gonna get into no rhymin'
I just want everybody to listen to the funky beat
While my DJ Cutmaster Cool V, cut up what the name of this dance is

You know, I can't really do all that stuff
You know I'm not into that cuttin', but
I want everybody to the dance, let me show you
You see, you gotta act like you crippled
Like you just got one leg, and you know you just gotta just
You gotta just, ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-just gotta relax
And just, let the music take over your body and just chill
'Cause this is the Diabolical B-I-Z, Emmezah-A-Rrrah
You know me from, ""The Biz Mark, Biz Mark""
I already said that already, but it don't even matter
Bring the bassline back in, now bust this out

I'm just talkin' about, this is gon' be the new thing to take over
The next century, cause it's gettin' ready to be the 90's
And I want this to be one of the hottest dances comin' out
It's called the ""Mudd Foot""
You know, you you can't do ""The Butt"" off this music
You can't do ""The Wop,"" can't do nuttin' else off it
Can't do the ""Michael Jackson""
Only thing you can do off this music is the ""Mudd Foot""
Can't be doin' that ""Arsenio Hall
I don't know I don't know how he do that, m-heh-heh
Or that I.O.U.'n, Scoob and Scrap'n
And anybody else dancin'
Only thing you can do off this, is, the ""Mudd Foot""
So c'mon, do the Mudd Foot

Yo, I, see, you know I been here
I been in this studio for about a month
I'm tryin' to teach Swan how to do the ""Mudd Foot""
I don't know what the heck he doin', he-heh-heh
Marley can't even do it, yo
I'm tryin' to teach, Cool V how to the ""Mudd Foot""
He doin the ""Butt Foot"" I don't know what the heck he doin'
But, the way you gotta do the ""Mudd Foot""
You gotta just kick it, it gotta be like flowin' y'know?
It gotta be flowin'!
I know everybody from Uptown, by the Apollo
Uptown way Uptown, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens,
Manhattan, Staten Island, Long Island!  
Everybody from out of state, like Kansas City, California, 
Everywhere, I can't forget New Jersey, Newark, y'know",Mudd Foot,1989
Biz Markie,"This is a different type of dedication
To a guy that was a different kind of inspiration
Only people that knew him, know what I'm talkin' about
And at the end of the story, you will say without a doubt
This wasn't your typical case, of fast livin'
Anything he was makin', he was givin'
To his moms, pops, his brother and his girl
'Cause they, meant, the most to him in the world
Around Suffolk he wasn't known
But in Eastern Long Island, he did have a home
Called L.I., is where he stayed
Where there was no need for D-Con or Raid
He was cool with everybody, he had no enemies
I'm makin' this record, cause he's a friend of me
'Cause he's a hard workin' kid, I've just stated
That's why this record, is dedicated
To my man Rich

Yo yo, this is for you my man
God bless you

Let me tell you what happened in the early 80's
When we wasn't thinkin' about gettin' all the ladies
Me and Rich was thinkin' about survival of the fittest
You can ask Keith or Kevin, cause both of them were with us
We'd try to get a job everyplace that it takes
We was even at the factory they call {?}
Everywhere we went they said they'd call us back
Or even said they're not hirin' to throw us off track
But Richie Rich said, forget that stuff
Even though, times was rough
We kept searchin', searchin', lookin' and lookin'
It seems everywhere we went, the jobs was tooken
Still Rich didn't give up the faith
He found a job that wasn't safe
Even though it was dangerous, it wouldn't switch
That's why this is dedicated to my man Rich

Yo this is to you my man Rich
Cause you know you go way back, you go way back
Word up, God bless you

The way the story end, is just a tragedy
I wish upon a star that it didn't have to be
Endin' this way for my man Richard
'Cause still in my mind, he's still as pictured
Like, he just had gone yesterday
For sellin', C-R-A-C-K
His dream was...to be a boxer
So, he could knock the socks off of
An Ivan Barkley, or even Mike Tyson
But on the streets, he was sacrificin'
For his family, and his wife
'Cause he struggled, he struggled all his life
He wasn't a straight up, criminal or villain
Or even tryin' to get, stupid or illin'
Was messed up for takin' somebody's life and shit
That tried so hard, and just wouldn't quit
This is a slow record, with a switch
Because it's dedicated, to my man Rich

To you my man
This is to you, Rich
Peace",My Man Rich,1989
Biz Markie,"I once knew a girl by the name of Monique
She was my childhood sweetheart every day of the week
Whether PS46, or 151
After school I'd go to her house, to have some fun
We both lived in Colonial Projects
I lived in building forty eight, she lived in building twenty six
We used to play Ringling, Coke or 1-2-3
But when I'm in Monique's presence, I would just freeze
The relationship began when I was five startin'
She was in nursery school, I was in kindergarten
We was more closer than a hand and glove
This is what you call real puppy love
When we'd go trick or treating, I would carry her bag
When we moved to Long Island, it was all such a drag
'Cause I know it would be difficult to see her again
I wouldn't miss her more than I'd miss all of my friends
Even though we was little this love was unique
And this is what I say to my love Monique, because

[Chorus x4]
""She's not, just another woman
 She's not, no no!""

Let me tell ya a little somethin', about Monique
Even though we was little she had a physique
Indian brown skin with a nice complexion
She always gave me tender love and affection
I knew she was different in her own little way
I used to knock at her door bout every single day
I remember when we used to go trick or treatin'
I used to snatch bags, so she could sink her teeth in
Crazy big variety of a lot of candy
She would share it with her friends Kim Ron and Fran and 
Lee-nette, the girl she called her cousin
We never had an argument, oh we was never fussin'
That's why me and her got along so good
Anything I asked her to do, you know she would
We would have family day, in back of building seventy
I would win her a prize, so she could treat me heavenly
I don't care what nobody say, because
This girl would make my day, and

[Chorus]

Now this is the epilogue of this story
About a young little girl, especially for me
No matter how many years ago I can't forget
But then again 1986 hit
She looked just the same, but in a bigger version
My mind started goin' on a love excursion
I started reminiscin' to her bout old times
She began to smile, I guess I rang her chimes
I didn't see her again until 1988
And I saw her again, and she still was straight
Now this time I had enough courage to speak to her
I told her would you be with me, and what would occur
Then I asked was, she swingin' any capers
She said no not me, nobody got no papers
I couldn't believe, after all of these years
I was so happy she waited it brought me to tears, cause

[Chorus]",She's Not Just Another Woman (Monique),1989
Biz Markie,"And yes y'all, yes y'all
This is, a different type of dedication
To my man Marcus from Kansas City
But I'm just tellin' ya straight on up
Don't be messin' with no drugs
Whether you're young, whether you're old
Whether you're bad, whether you're bold
Don't mess with it cause it's not for the soul
And we gonna do it a little somethin'

With three subjects like this

Subject one is about a brother by the name of John
Who was sellin' crack, just like it was Avon
And you know y'know the reason I say ""was""
Because that's no longer what my man John does
There was a time when he was wearin' much gold
Drivin' a Benz, Jaguar and a Rolls
The lifestyle he lived was far from penny ante
Yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, word to granny's panties
'Cause he would make dough-roll, and swing it like a yo-yo
Bein' broke, was just a no-no
But then the day came when John got caught
And he was dropped like pantyhose without support
You shoulda thought about, what you did in the past
To realize, this fast livin' wouldn't last
But, the same guy that was a big hoodlum
Is now in jail, waitin for someone to duke him

[Chorus x4]
Things get a little easier
Once you learn to understand it

Subject two, and this one is a doozy
A messed up story about a girl named Suzy
Now when you're on WIC, the problems may seem enough
But you know she had to get Scotty to beam her up
On a crack mission, no type of ambition
Make blunts disappear better than a magician
Her eyes got dim, her body got slim
She said there's nothin' in the world like a good ol' stem
On and like on and, and it was strong
Grabbed her pipe and sung a song
""I want to get high, so high!""
""I want to get high, so high!""
She'd go out buy a nice rock just to suit her
Then hit the weed spot to be blessed by Buddha
Bum offa Lucy to complete her stimulation
Put it all together for a perfect combination
I mean this girl would actually buy a rock with
The very last dime she got in her pocket
And when she saw her friends, comin' from the spot
Like Prudential, she got a piece of their rock
That's why

[Chorus]

Subject three, finally, the
E-N-D about a girl by the name of Marie
She used to be hot, most beautiful to the utmost
I mean this girl was blessed with an overdose
Of curves, swerves, word to the mother my brother
And boy did the B-I-Z love her
But then those were the days
My friend we thought they'd never end
And she looked alright, to the S-K Biz Markie
But then she got on drugs
Started wearin' extensions and rugs
And let me tell you what say happened to Marie
Because nowadays Marie don't look so hot
Every time that I see her, she's headed for the spot
Her hair is all knotty, got Scotty got her body
And her underarms kickin' like the ho know karate
Her clothes are real dirty, and usually the same
As for money she don't have a dime to claim
Because when I saw the girl the other day
She was puttin' a pack of Now-or-Laters on layaway

[Chorus]",Things Get a Little Easier,1989
Biz Markie,"Play it again Polo, cause I just can't stand still
I burn while the tables turn like windmills
A swift reactor rap, to impact up the track ?
I flow like a sailor

Rhymes remain hittin hard like Nighttrain
With lyrics that came from the brain of Mark Twain
So if you can't handle the man please go and change the channel
Rappers are gettin smoked like Camels

To weather the brainstorm, fellas better grab your umbrellas
People run inside the cellars
As I teach you're attached to my rhyme like a leash
Takin the S off my speech to fight peach

Take the P off the peach because now you want each
And every rhyme to teach and reach
You need a fixin, for your fake rhymes lyrics and weak mixin
You robbin em blind like Nixon

Some got shook when they took a look
I'm burnin you up, like the lyrics that are pages of a cookbook
I attract more kids than Wonderama
Rhymes got more drama, than black momma white momma

You get defeated decapitated captivated
'Cause you hated the fact G. Rap made it
So if you slow you blow like a hoe, so here's a solo
Ah-yo, play it again Polo

Here's a fellow, sayin hello, Polo, mellow
P-O-L-O, shake em like Jell-o
Sonny you're funny like Johnny Carson
So I'm a enjoy, watchin your butt burn up just like an arson

These rhymes here can kill son
You try to rips it just call me the ? Flip Wilson
And rhymes I got em down pat
Release this hit like the Superfly soundtrack

Too dope of a type windpipe full of hype
And I sideswipe the suckers I snipe
The mic so hot, it can weld when it's hell
And assassinate, like Lee Harvey Os-wald

Rough on the radio, Sony or Sanyo
Rappers get slayed and played like a banjo
When I illustrate, stiller rhymers is iller
Battle me, you better swallow a bottle of painkillers

I go faster and faster, skills of a Grandmaster
Makin you fall like plaster
Amazed, grammar plays like gamma rays
Chumps are caught in the blaze and dumped in ashtrays

You pussy willow, I can see your sihlouette
You're scared, and tears of fear made your pillow wet
You want to tic-tac-toe with a big rap pro?
Yo, play it again Polo

Guys are weary, eyes be teary, survived and leary
Your rhymes are eerie, that's my theory
I'm here to jam and slam like Bam-Bam
Damn, Polo play it again like Sam

Cuts in harmony, you ain't harmin me
Your beats are moist and your sweet voice is charmin me
Not flexible, your style needs to be twisted
Plus your name's unlisted

Rhymes are tough like gristle, watch the boy sizzle
Your brainstorms don't even drizzle
But my brainstorms gives lots of pain, lots of rain
Long spins, the strong winds of a hurricane

You get sunken when I hit a punk and
Rag a fag, makin him stagger like he drunken
You can't stop treatin my hip-hop
Like a Blo Pop, chew up the slop like a gumdrop

Makin you sweat like a death threat, slow when I flow
I'm a let, Polo wet up the whole set
Yes the final, death wish to sucker MC's
Gets granted, with rhymes makin em stand planted

I start blowin blows, and my rhymes are like a bolo

Biz Markie,"Hey I'd like to tell you a little story
About my man named dee
Yo, even from when he was little
He was like kinda on a tough tip
Doin all that stuff
But, I'ma tell you the way..
.. it should really go like..
.. the way he would say it now check this out

When I was young, he always dreamed of bein rich
But compared to then, that'd been a big switch
Drivin big cars, wearin rings and ropes
But man without a plan all he had was hopes
So he sat down, and thought, what he wanted to be
But it seems, no occupation had appeal to dee
He didn't wanna be a doctor, he don't like school
It wasn't that he was dumb, he just thought he was too cool
Cause all the moneymakers and the big-time crooks
He never ever seen none of them carryin books
He used to be on the block, do whatever they pleased
Never had a nine to five, but still clocked g's
Harold reuben, freewood ave would make a man of them too
And he thought, yeah that's the life, he wanna do like they do
So he start to flip and cut class with the big boys
Take other kids toys, cause he didn't dig noid
He'd rather run the block and watch the hustlers play
And he'll say, he wanna be just like that one day
He used to run in the stores, steal cookies and candy bars
Watchin the pimps roll by in they fancy cars
But never did the thought even pass
At the time, he 'posed to have his behind in class
So when report cards came, all he received was a f jack
And he got his neck smacked, for cold gettin left back
But yet and still, he didn't care
Cause to him, school's for the birds so he didn't belong there
When he was only eight he hung out with the pros
And he went, from stealin candy, to boostin clothes
He used to dip out the class, go straight to the mall
And he'll take, anything from anybody at all
His neighbors used to ask his mother ""brown what's wrong witcha child?
He done robbed my damn house again, yo that kid is buck wild..""

Yo, I don't know whassup, but he be buggin word up
Yo that yo.. I'm just sayin like this
I don't whassup, but
I think you will understand a little bit more of the situation
I'ma say like he would say it, on this second part
So just check this out aight?
Just kick it one two three, go head, go head man, go head

He was a crook -- at the age of nine
Do whatever it took -- he'll rob you blind
Snatchin pocketbooks, robbin blind ol men
Way back when.. when he was only ten
Then when he was in 5th grade, he carried a switchblade
Tried to stay rich to keep him and his bitch paid
And if he ever had to travel somewhere far
Take a bus? pssh - he'd go steal him a car!
He'd always choose to live his life the wild way
Tag? ! russian roulette is what he'll play
His moms and pops told him when he first reached junior high
The way you live determine just how soon you die
And he didn't care because to him it was fun
And he was only thirteen when he got his first gun
He robbed stores and did stick-ups frequently
Gave a new name to juvenile delinquency
And yeah you know that, he, was on the go
Seven days of the week, he kept his pockets full of dough
But he was headed for a dead end fast
Cold riskin his ass for petty cash that didn't last
Went back and forth to jail six times
For stolen cars and stick-up and various crimes
So when he sit in his cell, he reminisce as a child
It don't pay to do crime today, so don't be buck wild..

Ay that that that's a little bit of a lesson
For all the kids out there you know now
Yeah yeah yeah you know what I'm sayin
And this is comin from
The grand high exalted mystic ruler
Ain't no one cooler
In 7th grade I had a teacher named mr. dulah
Who used to wear his pants up to his chest
And I want you to just listen
Cause.. this is no joke, so don't be buck wild..

I was sittin home, all alone
When I heard the ring, on my telephone
I picked it up, to see who could it be
This girl I just met, her name was Tammy
See I was surprised, cause she called me first
She was one of the baddest in the universe
I was just buggin cause she gave me a ring
It was a Monday, and it started off with a bang
She start the conversation over how was your weekend
I did this that and the other with my friend Monique
And Shaneeda, (She need a new hairdo?) We both laughed
How you long you gonna be home? I gotta take a bath
So I gave her two hours then I called her back
You know I was ready, when I rolled a headcrack
Cause when I asked, can I? She cut me off so tough and
I gotta call you back - aww baby, you busy doin NUTTIN

Let me tell you a story bout a girl named Gilda
She was from out of state, I was wonderin will the
Same thing happen to me like the deja vu
Let me keep quiet, and go into a tale
See I was chillin at the Chapter 3
Word is bond she looked divine, she looked as fly as can be
I thought she was different cause she was by herself
She looked real wholesome, and in good physical health
I walked by, she said hi
Ain't you the be	-I-Z-the-emmaza-emmaza-A-are-K-I
I said yes can I have the number to your home
Are you allowed to call Jersey on your phone?
She chuckled we exchanged, I went home joked about it
How she was gonna be mine, with no doubt about it
But everytime I call I say whassup muffin?
I'm doin somethin now - aww baby, you busy doin NUTTIN

[Chorus]
[BizMarkie]
Ahhhh, don't give me that!
The last episode was at a club in the Bronx
I was rockin with Capri who got a good response
It was Backspin June, and Limo Driver Mike
You chill in the car, cause clubs he didn't like
So me and V went in just to look around
Seein girls that had bass with sense around
Then we all got on stage and rocked the house
There were no fights in, not even out
Slide, then we got in the car
Saw two trillzadills shinin like a star
One was with Mike, the other was with June
Yo it's not gonna be theirs for soon
So V got with Mike and hooked me with her sister
If I knew she was like that, I woulda had dissed her
Cause everytime me and V called them both up and
They both were busy?! Nah - they're busy doin NUTTIN

[Chorus 3X]
[BizMarkie - speaking over last 2X]
Ahhhh, don't even give me that!
That's junk
This goes out to all you bitches doin nuttin
Ka-ka-cause that's all you be doin
Am-am-I right be	, am I right Doc
Am I right Shell, am I right V
Am I right am I right Sahai, am I right ?
They don't be busy doin NUTTIN
They go nowhere fast and then go backwards
With Bart Simpson in the background
All of a sudden roll like they got shot by the Apollo though
Word up, I didn't even.. okay
Bblabaldblablballl, ah!!",Busy Doing Nuthin',1991
Biz Markie,"This is for those who didn't believe
That me, myself they said I couldn't achieve
My goal or even get to my destiny
To be the s-k-be-I-z
It was a rough road, for me to pursue a
Career in rap to make you say hallelujah
For those who did, I'm not talkin to you
Cause I couldn't be there with-out you
Everytime I see you they always say
I knew you was gonna make hits someday
But then when I was strugglin hard, word
A peep of help from them was never heard
I always knew that, I was gonna make it
No matter how much beef and aggravation I take it
And if you try to hold back me and my crew
Remember, I told you..
I told you..

I'ma give you one incedent from my past
When I had short money, goofy pants off my ass
I used to go to block parties my cousin had served
And see how people who made it, kicked others to the curb
And then I said if I was in their spotlight
I would treat everybody, equally right
To get where I'm at now, I used to hand out flyers
From school to school, for new york and l.i.ers
It was me and mike from ike and then they used to do it
He said if you wanna be like them you gotta keep to it
So I kept at it, cause it was hard work
I told em I was makin a record, they gave me a smirk
Like if I was incapable of doin the deed
Or virtually impossible for me to succeed
You must be crazy if I wouldn't pursue
Only thing that I can tell you is I told you..
I told you..

Now now now this is how it's endin
Just like any other story, it is splendid
I said to ty if you let me come out with a cut
They will never ever stop shakin they butts
So I came out with ""make the music with your mouth biz""
An introduction to me, and told it like it is
Some said it was beginner's luck, with this record
Then I showed em with ""nobody beats the biz"" and got respected
I threw em off with my song ""pickin boogers""
It was acquired taste, for different kind of sugars
I got international like twin skyscrapers
With my album ""goin' off"" and my single ""the vapors""
Since I produced my own, they said it would end
Cause it took a year and half to come out with ""just a friend""
It went platinum, my album went gold
Altogether it was one point five records sold
So don't ever try to hold back me and my crew
Only thing that I can say is, I told you..
I told you..

So when anybody try to, mess with your head
Just go for what you wanna go for in life, aight? chill

Biz Markie,"Once about a time there was a kid
Who didn't have a bicycle or a car that skid
Only thing he had was Pat and Turner
He didn't know the future but the lesson to learn-ah
Way to get started in the music biz
Just listen to the story as I tell it like it is
I was a youngster from East Junior High School
Who thought somebody with Adidas sweat-shirt was cool
It symbolized somethin, but I don't know
I wanted to be down really really bad so
I asked one of my best friends Derek Mangareu
""see'mon man can I be down can I be down witcha crew?""
He had one by the name of Masters of Control
I wanted to be down, so I could play the role
He said, ""No you're not good enough we have ours Mark""
I went home and sat in the room with no lights in the dark
And this is gonna be a rough rendezvous
And that's why I sing this song to you

I'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..
Many miles from home..
With a heart that's heavy..
And with.. a will that's strong

I got a little older, three years to be exact
When a crew named Midnight Express gave me a crack
It consist of one MC and two DJ's
And the way Kevin D cut had me amazed
It was like I just joined the Lakers
Or even Rock Steady or the New York City Breakers
I was in 11th grade, at ?? High
They was sayin they was sayin hey what's wrong with this guy
Because all he do, is bang on tables and mumble
And doin music with his mouth like a band ensemble
Or the human beatbox wasn't thought about
And the teachers they thought I was crazy without a doubt
I guess they didn't understand what I was comin from
Since I was into MC'n, they thought I was dumb
Then there was a teacher by the name of Ms. K Parke
Since I was good at rememberin numbers she said I was smart
But that don't got nothin to do with this rendezvous
And THAT'S why I sing this song to you!

I'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..
Many miles from home..
With a heart that's heavy..
And with.. a will that's strong

I was a walkin son of a gun before the day I begun
I'ma tell you how it started, from day one
Well me, I lived in >??I was ambitious and devoted til the day I'd die
I used to get on Fair Islip, take the S-42
Get off at Bunanan Street, and go to the house of the crew
I would walk from C.I., to Bay Shore
Just to see if I really had the rhymes galore
I'd go to house parties here, go to house parties there
Walk the ?? ?? pants off my derriere
Like if I was David Carridine who played ""Kung Fu""
Who would walk from China to Japan without a shoe
Hummin beats, sayin rhymes, kept me goin
From givin up or bein crazy, or just stop flowin
My teachers and parents said, I should just stop
Just go to army go to college get a job witcha POPS?!
I can't take no more of this rendezvous
And that's why I sing this song to you!

I'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..
Many miles from home..
With a heart that's heavy..
And with.. a will that's strong

This is a incident that always occur
With the opposite sex, other word is her
No matter what nationality color or creed
Or wherever you at, there's always a bad seed
They're always talkin about wantin to be alone
You're spendin too much time witcha friends, all night long
I'm sayin yo what the heck, I am single
It's no reason why I shouldn't try to mingle
So I met this girl by the name of maxine
Her breath didn't stink she used listerine
She looked crazy a-ight, and the whole nine
But this situation was one of a kind
Because I wanted her.. all to my own
So I called her on, my mickey mouse telephone
I said, ""hello pretty momma it's the guy you just me
Uhh what are you doin tonight? "" she said, ""nuttin,"" I said, ""bet""
So when I went to pick her up, I was in shock
Cause she brought her friend along for a road block

[biz sings]
American woman! why you do it to meeeeee?
American woman! why you do it to meeeeee?
Is it because I'm the bizmarkie?
No I think it's because I have the are-a-p
I think you think I'm ugly makin cash money
Yo I think all the girls is funny..
American woman! why you do it to meeeeee?
American woman! why you do it to meeeeee?

(yo biz you know you don't usually be with things like that
Why you let her get away with that? )
I thought she was buggin just to see what I'd say
I said nuttin, let her friend come anyway
Okay now listen what she wanted me to for her friend
(what she want biz? ) expected me to pay her way in?
It's not like kid from stingy cheap or my name's ebenezer
But I'm here to please maxine, not to please her
So I still let it go by, and got her in the movie
Thank the lord I bumped into my cousin named cool v
I said please vaughn, take her friend off my hands
So I can be alone, and get my man
He said alright I'll introduce, she act like she was wit it
But when we try to split, she looked and said forget it
I don't know whassup vaughn, she must be buggin
I thought you was in the way she was kissin and huggin
Soon as I said - wanna make music like sebastian bach?
I'm not leavin my friend with a guy but it's another road block

[biz sings]
American woman! stay away from meeeeee!
American woman! why you do it to meeeeee?
Is it because I'm the bizmarkie?
No I think it's because I can are-a-p, no
I think you think I'm ugly makin cash money
All of this is funny..
American woman! stay away from meeeeee!
American woman! stay away from meeeeee!

So I was highly upset, and you would be too
If an icicle's in your way, stickin to you like glue
I mean it's the end of the night, time to move on
I'm tryin to kick ballistics so she'd come to my home
I went to, yo bust it, call her when you get to your crib
She said, no and started cryin like a baby with a bib
Now why you wanna bat me up and ruin my night?
I coulda said no but I was bein polite
She tried to pull the I'm stayin over her house bit
Not tonight baby you gon' be stayin at a parkway exit
So they went into the bathroom to get in a huddle
If you keep playin you're both gonna take the shuttle
They both came out the bathroom with a glance
Like the bathroom they were goin to dance
They both approached me with the look of a rock
I look and tell my senses ahh it's another road block..

That's what juliet asked, but I don't know now
Maybe he went to get some roses for you
Yo, I'da I'da I-don't know where he's at ju-li-et
Don't regret, cause he will be back
To come and get you, and bring you to the crillzab
But, there's an obstacle that's in his way
I think it's the-the-the ? that won't decay
Well, I'm the be	-I-z-m-izza-a-are-k
Let me tell you what I hear most people say
That you two people are a part of life
It explains why romeo died by the knife
Or was it - the poison on juliet lips
Or vice versa I don't know it make my mind flips
Whichever way it was, it's very educational
So look at the movie and listen cause it's sensational
And if you hear the music you could never go wrong
I want everybody sing a long, now come on now

Romeo and juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 4x)
To the are-o-m-e-o, and the j-you-l-I-et
I think the thing he did was to get respect
The way that I see it, it was a great deed
Because if wasn't, he wouldn't succeed
At getting juliet's heart, and loving care
And all of the moments they had to share
But I really want you just to check out the plot
Of the movie it is groovy it will hit the spot
It will make you laugh, it make you cry
And that's when you know you will be satisfied
Cause you know I wouldn't tell you nuthin that wasn't right
Cause the diabolical is outta sight
Yo, romeo and juliet should be household names
They names should be in the hall of fame
With my funky beat, you can never go wrong
I want everybody sing this song, now bust it out now

Yo be	 take it from the top
Yo be	 take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo be	 take it from the top
Yo be	 take it from the top (wellllllll)

[Verse One]
Well I demand respect, so everybody salute
And by the way Backspin, is my attribute
You may or may not, know who I am
But frankly my dear.. I don't give a damn!
You may know me from 'Rockin' With Biz Markie'
Or Shante, when she used to battle Sparky
You might have seen in some videos with other folks
Sittin on the bench while me and Biz was tellin mother jokes
The meaning of my name some people may, try to guess
Yes yes I'm fresh to the flesh, so let me manifest
I make romance, I'm not a freelance
I spin records; BITCH I don't breakdance!
I scoop girls around the world that's what be	 does
The name Backspin means that be	 was
Born.. as a creative, cut king
Supreme poet, inferior to nothing
Call me the teacher, since I'm the one who taught you
(What's that?) Myyyyyyy DICK! (CAUGHT YOU!)
I'm signin off because my rhyme's complete
I say peace to Chancellor Avenue and Bergen Street

[Chorus]
Yo Cap take it from the top
Yo Cap take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo Cap take it from the top
Yo Cap take it from the top (wellllllll)

[Verse Two]
Well get a grip and, yeah the Capital's rippin
More than just a ordinary style, cold flippin
Those that attempt to diss, or try to take this
Title away what? I think you better forget it
Pit-pat this Jack, get off of the crack black
It's the true fact, your record hit the pillow sack
And now you're wonderin how make a comeback
But don't make me laugh, your studio's a two-track
Biz hits the bassline, then I rip the real line
Together it's combined and designed to a master rhyme
A little touch from Cool V himself
An overnight process then it's ready for the shelves
Perfect shit on wax is made
Then bring it to the radio and let it get played
There's no joke and only time to get fanatical
So listen up or pay attention to the Capital
I'm done with the rhyme for the time, so you can have 'em
Aiyyo guys, why don't you throw somethin funky at 'em

[Chorus]
Yo Shell take it from the top
Yo Shell take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo Shell take it from the top
Yo Shell take it from the top (wellllllll)

[Verse Three]
Why'all know me, as the Original D
Like to the I say with the A and hey
Bust this, M-O-N-D
I grab the mic and recite rhymes in your left ear
 
It's always def and different
Never somethin from the previous years
I'm quite slim, but rougher than a pair of Timbs
The Diamond Shell will never trip stagger fall or bend
I don't smoke and never ever have I drank no liquor
Bein smooth keeps my rhyme style, that much quicker
So yo hey chief, bust this technique of speak
I'm feelin sheik and also rather unique
I'm smooth as (?), you can't deny I'm
Innovative with style, and bound to hit primetime soon
As I tour from Kalamazoo to the moon
Give props to the rapper, the brother dresses Dapper
Than Dan cause I'm the man I'd like to make ya toes tap
With the, funky type of flow, I'm smooth as a Lambo'-
-Ghini I dream of Jeannie her hands on my jam
So, once but not twice, this brother's precise
When it comes to snakin girls I get as crooked as loaded dice
Pullin women can't no man compete
I nut 'em all from the Great Wall down to Wall Street
So..

[Chorus]
Yo Fell take it from the top
Yo Fell take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo Fell take it from the top
Yo Fell take it from the top (wellllllll)

[Verse Four]
Ready for the ride I rip rap rapacious
Crews don't slip you're payin penalty slashes
Clashes crashed, but I crash ass or
Ravish the mic, and then I'ma pass all
Hard to handle run a gamble like Vegas
But I never lost the force be runnin wages
Of pages, and pages, biters think I'm cajun
Spice cause I'm so nice and eighteen is my age is
Rappers crumble when I tackle they crackle I ramshackle
Don't even know why they waste time on the pack'll
Of nine cause my rhymes do 'em in like rifles
Stress the word, so you know I live trifle
MC's, metamorphosize to digest
Days from a faze and my praise is like a rajah
I reckon, that crews that step over this way
Think life is a game and they just too pissed to play
Some say, on mics I'm a master
A snatcher, a catcher, a very well matcher
But crews better know that I hit like after,
Effects who's next I wreck from now til then
And then when the then comes, I'ma go hit again
Like rat-a-tat-tat of the tickedy eatin dick-er whore
So every move I make I make sure, it's riggydiggyraw
Biz

[Verse Five]
Mar, kie the original
Everytime I see V, yo I got material
I was just kickin funky records for you
Cause I'm down with the rhythm of a, ah one chk two
Singin, on records, I get respected
It don't matter to me cause you know that I'm connected
With be	-M-V Biz Mark and Vaughn

Biz Markie,"Goes around
What comes around goes around

Sittin here reminiscin back to high school
When everytime I see you, girl, you know that I drool
Day-dreamin in class thinkin what would I say
When I saw you, but you never looked my way
It started freshman year and lasted straight to the 12th grade
I have to give it to you, though, you was top-shelf, babe
I asked myself time and time again: what was it
About me that made me treat me like a buzzard
I speak to you in the hall and you ignore me
You keep walkin and talkin like you never saw me
You didn't have to conversate with me, I can say that
It woulda made my day if you just had waved back
I used to buy you candy, lollypops and gum drops
I even pack a extra-sandwich in my lunch box
You're treatin me like dirt and everyone in the school knows
You call me out my name and crack jokes on my school clothes
If anyone could make you feel good, girl, I could
But you give me that look like you don't want to be bothered
But that's okay, just keep on frontin, see
Cause one day I'ma make it, and you'll be wantin me
Been tryin hard ever since I graduated
To make it big, and yes, I finally made it
Been doin shows, videos and tv
Now everywhere you go everybody knows me
Now the tables have turned and now it's me you're hawkin
Now I turn up my nose, and keep on walkin
You see, ladies marvel me in clubs frequently
And you make it your duty to come and speak to me
Rememberin how she played me in the past
Yeah, we can talk, I'm in a rush, please make it fast
And we can start off with all the men you been with
And don't come poppin that just-a-friend bit
Remember how you used to diss me and play me out, how
Come you got so much stuff to talk about now?
The word's around town that you're on the money tip
But sorry, I can't do nothin for ya, honey dip
So pardon me as I make my way to the dancefloor
And over to the bar because that's what I came for
Cuties pamperin me with champagne and roses
As I think to myself: thank god for showbiz!
Everywhere I turn girlies throwin me rhythm
Drinkin and thinkin who will be my victim
Here comes that girl that used to diss me
She whispers in my ear could she come home with me
Yup, get your coat and we could shoot north
Took her to the crib, and cold knocked her boots off
After I got it, yo, I never did call back
Thinkin how she used to front like she was all that
It's a new game, and the odds are in my favor
She caught the vapors and nothin could save her

For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how this spreaded throughout my crew
Well you all know TJ Swan who sang on my records
""Make the Music"", ""Nobody Beats the Biz"", well, check it
Back in the days before this began
He used to try to talk to this girl named Fran
The type of female with fly Gucci wear
With big truck jewelry and extensions in her hair
When Swan tried to kick it, she always fessed
Talking about ""Nigga please, you work for UPS""
Since he wasn't no type of big drug dealer
My man TJ Swan didn't appeal to her
But now he trucks gold and wear fly Bally boots
Rough leather fashion and tough silk suits
Now she stop fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming to all the shows every single weekend
To get his beeper number, she'd be begging please
Dying for the day to get skeezed

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

I got another partner that's calm and plain
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
Back in the days he was nothing like that
I remember when he used to fight every day
What grown-ups would tell him he would never obey
He wore his pants hanging down and his sneakers untied
And a rasta-type Kangol tilted to the side
Around his neighborhood people treated him bad
And said he was the worst thing his moms ever had
They said that he will grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum
Or either in jail, or someone would shoot him
But now he's grown up, to their surprise
Big Daddy got a hit record selling worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Be saying can I borrow a dollar, ooh, you're a star now

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

Now I got a cousin by the name of Vaughan Lee
Better known to y'all as Cutmaster Cool V
He cuts, scratch, transform with finesse
And all that mess
Well I remember when he first started to rock
And tried to get this job in a record shop
He was in it to win it but the boss fronted
Said, ""Sorry Mr. Lee, but there's no help wanted""
Now my cuz Vaughan still tried on and on and on
'Til the like break of dawn
To put this j-o-b in effect
But they'd look right past him and be like, ""Next""
Now for the year of '88
Cool V is making dollars so my cousin's like straight
He walks into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like, ""Vaughan, welcome to my store""
Offering him a job but naw, he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught from my cousin
The vapors

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

Last subject of the story is about Biz Mark
I had to work for mine to put your body in park
When I was a teenager, I wanted to be down
With a lot of MC-DJ'ing crews in town
So in school on Nobel Street, I say ""Can I be down, champ""
They said no and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected I was very depressed
Sat and wrote some def doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to come to parties they'd make me pay
I would have to beg to get on the mic and rap that day
I was never into girls, I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep it instead of trying to use it
But now things switched, without belief
""Yo, Biz, do you remember me from Noble Street, chief?
We used to be down back in the days""
It happens all the time and never cease to amaze

It may look and sound easy doing the human beat box
But it's real difficult, even knocked me out my socks
It's a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note
I like doing it as a hobby or a job
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
It's not all the props, spitting, breathing hard and doing
You need practice, be ambitious in the schooling
Let me tell you party people, you gotta admit
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
That's why I like doing sounds, that's hard to achieve
Making two or three sounds at one time you can't believe
When I walk down the street, people crowd around me
And say, ""how you make all those sounds at one time Biz Markie?""
I tell 'em it takes a lot of practice, and lip control
I've been doing it since, fifteen years old
And everywhere I do it, the people say I'm good
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
I'm telling you a fact, and just like it is
Even moms pops and cops say, ""What up Biz?""
Everywhere I go, I always rocked the boat
Gonna end this rhyme, with this one note
Not gonna act conceited and say I'm the best
But I'm guaranteed to pass any kind of test
I say def rhymes, with funky fresh lyrics
When I do the beat the party people go into hysterics!

You heard the proceeding, now here's the sequel
All human beat boxes is not created equal
That's why I'm here, to say today
That I'm doing my beat in a special way

Making musical tunes, orally, I have perspective
I'm very well known, and greatly respected
I like to thank people, without no doubt
Peace hi party people it's time to break ou

Biz Markie,"Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Let me tell you a story now

I was in front of the Apollo on Amateur Night
It was after the show, and the moon was right
The ? was really perked off the Red Zone
I was in my MPV, I was all alone
A lot of out-of-town people asking me for
My John Hancock or my signature
I gave it to, all of them cause I was down to earth
And plus the Apollo is my home turf
So I walked across the street 'til I'm on, 125
I saw this pair of shoes that was really live
It wasn't just a pair of shoes, that was on her
From the ground up, she looked like a plate of lasagna
I said, ""Hey shorty, not you, your hair""
She turned around slowly and started to stare
She said, ""Why don't you take picture, it'll last a lil' longer?""
Me liking you grew a little bit stronger
She asked me what's my name I said, ""Emmezah emmezah""
""The name that your momma gave ya is what I prefer""
She asked me what am I driving, and how is my health
I know what you're really thinking baby, let me tell you

I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I can do that alone
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I ain't tryin' to be funny honey

She started arguing with me, and say she's not like that
I know who you are, I don't care if you're living fat
Because I have a mother and father that take care of me
And I'm living in Long Island with a J-O-B
Okay okay I got you wrong, I must admit
I'ma give you a little time to see if you're legit
So we started going out on a regular basis
I was taking her to the movies and my hangout, places
Like the Q Club, The Scene, or The Arcade
I thought this relationship was tailor-made
'Cause she was sweet kind considerate I, was hypnotized
Never thought she'd try to pull the wool, over my eyes
After I smacked it and flipped it, she thought I was whipped
I know she is like a knockout but I'm not getting bull whipped
She asked me why I am so stingy I know you got the ends
Because you got two MV's, two BM's, an SL Benz
What are you my accountant or the IRS?
Why ya clocking everything that I posses?
She want me to waste everything and be small as an elf
Let me tell you something baby, let me tell you

[Chorus 2]
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I can do that on my own
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I ain't trying to be funny honey

Now all her friends boosted her, to get my dinero
Like if I was a drunk Mexican, wearing a sombrero
I knew she had a boyfriend on the side
She told me, yo, she didn't have to hide
She said she cut him because he was too jealous
He always thought I was trying to talk to other fellas
It's now the present, and that was the past
From now on being with me, is gonna be a blast
I know she thought in her mind, it's gonna be great
Juicing and reducing everything I make
With her Victoria's Secrets necklace
She tried to seduce me in every way
She would come out to Jersey rain sleet or snow
She acted too true blue to be after my dough
My man, Jeff told me but I didn't wanna listen
I was too hooked, and strung out, I thought he was dissing
Then she popped the question, and asked me for some dough
I looked her in her face and said, ""Hell no!""
You're a head nurse and you want my wealth?
You must be crazy as hell, cause

I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I can do that alone
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I ain't tryin' to be funny honey

Let me tell you know
All day long, you been talking on the telephone
Bragging to all your friends, about all the cars that I own
But you don't tell 'em, that I'm the one doing it all
While you're out there living it up, and having yo'self a ball

I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I can do that on my own
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I ain't trying to be funny honey

Biz Markie,"Aiyyo here's a tale, about a female I once messed with
Or better yet, skins that I swung eps with
Face full of grace, waist shaped like Vanessa
Del Rio, oh-me-oh, my but the heffer had
Big juicy lips, wide hips you had to call fat
Stacked back to mack, yo the hooker was all that
And lots more, and baby girl I had the hots for
But I'm really not sure, who she spread the twat for

Heard it was a kid across town named Hector
But I don't give a heck, so I still went and checked her
On the down low, he ain't around so
Out of sight, out of mind, get your coat and let's go
So we dipped, hopped in the whip and we was gone
Off to City Island cause they had it goin' on
Two yuks a foo, now the mood was set
Caviar at the bar, Red Star, Moet
Silk suits, spendin' loot like a straight up mack
When I felt somebody finger tappin' me on my back
And turn around quick, but before I could begin
All I seen was a big mac-10, aiyyo it's her boyfriend

[Chorus]
""Hooker got a boyfriend!""
""Why do she do this boyfriend?""
""Ohh ahhh why do she do this boyfriend?""

Check it, yo
I broke camp, ran like a champ, yep I jetted
Off to the trunk for the pump, time to set it
Money kept screamin' some crap that I dissed him
So I started lettin' off  but I missed him
Honey got scared, and called the five-oh
So yo, you know the half Dukes, time for me to go
'Cause I ain't the type to be doin' no bid
For a dame or a lame-brained punk Spanish kid
So I chill, call the hooker up the next day
She told me come over yo, bet I'm on my way
Be there in a sec, yo I'm not too far
She said, ""Park around the back so he don't see the car""
Met me at the door with a kiss and a smile
I said, ""Sorry about last night, money kinda wild""
""Umm yeah I know, small thing don't worry""
Just show me to your room so we can do this in a hurry

Kissed her from her earlobes down to her chest
Went for the bellybutton and to hell with the rest
Got her butt-naked and before a second passed
I had her on the bed with my fingers up her {ahh!}
Now she's ready, set for a good steady bangin'
Until she looked down and seen Moby Dick hangin'
She told me, ""Take it easy yo trust me just chill""
Knowin' once I get up in it yo I'm goin' for the kill
So she spread 'em, thick rich and creamy like mayo
Aiyyo, lay-o, the tip is on the way-o
Pinned her legs back, just about to slide in
When the door burst open {*SLAM*} damn it's her boyfriend!
Did it again!

[Chorus]

Now I'm mad, money done spoiled all the fun
On top of that he beefin' and he ain't got a gun
Flippin' the jibs, I guess he wanted to brawl
So I started hookin' all butt-naked and all
Threw a right, caught money dead in the jaw
Boom with the left and his fronts hit the floor
Now I had him, time to put his head for rest
So I beat him unconscious and I started gettin' dressed

Honey all hysterical and screamin' all hoarse
Said she seen a box car pullin' up in the yard
Just 'bout to jet, yo guess what I saw
Some old big black {hmmm} bust in the door
""Now hold up, what the hell you doin' in my house?
Get your ass off the floor, put your teeth in your mouth
Now everybody better be gone by the count of one
Look, better yet, why'all stay right here
I'm goin' to get my gun""
Now that's it! Enough is enough, I ain't with it
I'm catchin' mad beef and yo I ain't even hit it
Honey looked good and yo the buns was fat
But ain't a coochie in the whole world worth all that
So umm, I got my coat and I was on my way
That's when she started breakin' down, and beggin' me to stay
Knock it off, it ain't that much beggin' in the world
Next time I want some skins, I'll go and hit my own girl
Man I'm out, and I ain't tryin' to see you again
So eff you, eff your pops and your faggot-assed boyfriend!

Biz Markie,"Hey hey hey, know what I heard?
Beauty's only skin deep, ugly is to the bone

Back in the days, I'm not gonna lie
They used to say I'm ugly, a hurting guy
They would crack on my lips, and my powder
Saying I look like yuck without the house or ?Wig Howard?
From junior high to high school they thought I was retarded
Just because the way I looked, they said I farted
I was very very sad and you wonder why
Because my looks and my gear wasn't ultra fly
I wouldn't even attempt to ask a girl out
'Cause she get around her friends and began to shout""
""Guess who asked me out to the movies girlfriend
It was Mark, I told him if the world would end""
But my parents told me beauty's only skin deep
If that's true then why do girls think that I'm a creep?
I even joined the football team to get some recognition
But that didn't spark the key in a girl's ignition
They said I'm so ugly I give Anican a headache
Aw man, that is the icing on the cake!
So I kick this to all the girls from houses to huts
I don't care what you think, cause you all are nuts

[Repeat x2]
I'm an ugly nigga, so what?
If you don't like the way I look, you can kiss my butt
I'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? Ewwwww 

I'm a tell you story that's really bugged
About a guy with a Benz and he's dealing drugs
In the beginning before he got his riches
He was so ugly, he gave me the itches
I mean, if you see him, you think I might be kooky
But homeboy looked like, um, God-zooky
I used to crack and joke and say he looked like a star
And everybody laughed when I said ""Mon-star""
I can't laugh now because it's a new decade
My guzu-friend got the girls and got it made
I guess having jewels, having money, having a vehicle
Makes you sexy, handsome, gorgeous, and adorable
When you're spending money, giving girls what they want
Behind your back they talk about you say you're ugly and you front
Why do you go to bed with someone that you don't like
Just because they got a nice car like Reverend Ike
It would be wrong if he heard what you're thinking
Thinking that he look like, um, Stinking Jenkins
But let me tell you a secret, he has ESP
And this is what he whispered in my ear to me

[Repeat x2]
I'm an ugly nigga, so what?
Just because I got loot, that's why you give me the butt?
I'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? 

Let me tell you how poor I was

Dome to the doo, and doo to the dome
For the dome I go to school and for the doo I use a comb
Now people always ask how are these things known
'Cause the dome does the doing for things that are done at home
That's why I keep a pick in my knappy fro
And for lunch I eat Ragu with my sloppy Joe
But at night I be starving, like Messy Marvin
I get cheap and go settle for the White Castle bargain
They offer me a lot in the army
But I'd rather get it second hand from the Salvation Army
'Cause times are getting harder than boot camp
Man I'm so poor I need to print my face on a food stamp
So if my hooptie breaks down, I just have to suffer
And tell Minekie ""I'm not gonna pay a lot for this muffler!""
So I keep clear thoughts as the weeks run
But even on the beaches, they call me a beach bum
Something ain't right with me, and that really frightens me
'Cause nowadays girls don't even like to sprighten me
Some say I'm embarassing, but I got some comparison
Like if I was on TV, I would be Oscar Madison
Is there another like me? Only God knows
Man I should even rap in church cause I wear holy clothes
But for now I'm just going to do the strut
And this is what I say to girls from houses to huts

For me to use the weird name as ""diabolical man""
Well I got diabolical beats, raggedy clothes
And aw hell, I'm even wearing diabolical drawers
I'm not white as Barry 'cause I'm dirtier than Harry
With a rap that's big and fat that Mariah couldn't Carey
So don't come to me with that same ol' same ol'

So call me the Arthur without the Fonzarelli, or Nelly
'Cause I am so bad when it comes to a rap jam
Even robins scream, ""holy hip-hop biz man!""
I grab the microphone and go every which way but loose
'Cause I'm the ugly ducking that seduces mother Goose
And I don't be using flipping tongue twisters
But I still get better in time like the whispers
But older crews you see can't stay as loose as me
'Cause old school rappers just ain't what they used to be
So up your nose with a rubber hose

Off a funky drummer boom I get hot as Donna Summers
'Cause I reign supreme as a rap brainstorm
from corner to corner, I'm dropping some more on ya
Not Tony Toni Tone, cause I came to warn you
That I even reign in southern California

Like the emt's but the be-I-z
I rap so picture perfect I should just stop and say ""cheese""
So if I step up, who's gonna move me back?
'Cause Scooby Doo can't even do that for a scooby snack
You think you can, you think you can, don't even try it
'Cause instead you need to can it like the Jolly Green Giant
'Cause trying to step to biz, you know I'm a diss them fast
So play like 98.7 and kiss my ass!

I'm down with the zoo crew, some kids who act nutty
Be-danks, Cool V, Everett, Todd, and Jeff
They're my buddies, ha, my buddies, ha
Wherever I go, we go
I pass my April fools in monster may
I pass by so much bull I should say ""ole!""
I got friends named raggedy Ann and Andy
Call my ""bon appetite"" cause I'm sweeter than John Candy
Don't even knock it, till you try me
'Cause the proof is in the pudding, you can ask Bill Cosby
Some think I'm bragging, some think I'm boasting
But even Smokey Robinson would second that emotion
That's why I take through the sky on a natural high
'Cause I'm fly-y-y-y-ying

Biz Markie,"It's me the diabolical, Biz Mark symbolical
I shakes from scripts of hits I made a while ago
Now I'm on the run again starting other capers
And people couldn't catch me even if I was ""The Vapors""
I leave you in trauma with my funky personna
Cause I'm jamming just like Teddy but I'm nasty like Madonna
Cause me without big strong thoughts for a Biz song
Is like Patty LaBelle not singing with a wig on
I don't give a damn if my record gets panned
Cause my style stays fresh like I rap in Saran
When I'm sure that I'm pure like Snapple
Suppose when I write my rhymes like I'm the Big Apple
Or New York or whatever you call it, I don't even care
Cause if I can make it there, I can make it anywhere
So, I walk the walk through the streets of New York
More green I can hawk cause I can talk the talk
So don't try to stalk cause my style brings more
I rock it from the Billy Ocean to the Al B. Shore!
People always want to give dap to everyone
But I've been around the world so I ahhh ???

""I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king""
""Have the people stomping to my beat you bet"" 

Take a pause for the 'cause, 'cause this is a recording
If rap was a prison, then I be the warden
I do the Gator in my snakeskin Jordans
And when it comes to cash I flash more than Gordon
You want me to rock the rhyme cause I got the type you crave
And I heat up jams like I was MC Microwave
And when I drop a style, call it def, call it cool
As long as you don't call me when I'm on a toilet stool
I stoke and swing in a room full of women
When I drop the gold like Meadowlark Lemon
Everywhere I've been I've seen 'em fat and thin
Even girls with hair on their chinny chin chin
But you can be just a friend if you're sporting your own look
Or if you got more chins than a Chinese phonebook
Women love my style from ??? Long Isle
Even got my mother singing ""Thanks for my Child""
My temperature rises every time I'm near a stereo
Cause I catch dance fever like my name was Danny Terio
But I go, on and on and on and on and on and!
From midnight point to the early morning, ahhh!

[Repeat x4]
""I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king""
""Have the people stomping to my beat you bet"" 

It's my way or the highway, I'm ahead of the slow lane
But when I ride to Motown I jump on a Soul Train
Rappers like to flow with all energy and action
But I'd rather take it nice and slow like Freddy Jackson
So don't try to stick to me like somebody's gearshift
'Cause I'll hit you so far west you'll come back Easter
The style I display, but I say it a badder way
I got more rhymes than cartoons on a Saturday
You're still confused cause you don't know how bad he is
Like a pregnant who don't know who the daddy is
Just like a snap I can whip any rapper
That's why probably my grandparents called me a whipper snapper
You're lost in the sofa trying to cross my line
Then run to the lost and found cause you lost your mind
I'm coming on strong cause I'm dropping nothing soft
Still had it going on when ""The Biz is Going Off""
I'm singing in the rain cause I got the audacity
Or some kids want to Sundance with Butch Cassidy
You couldn't shine on my in the spotlight
'Cause your ass couldn't shine if you sat on a flashlight

Aww man  I check it better 
Ah whatcha mean BizMarkie? Whatcha mean BizMark? 
I hit the rhyme with the mayonnaise  that's what I mean 
Ah whatcha mean BizMarkie? Whatcha mean BizMark? 
Man I got beats up my sleeve like you wouldn't BELIEVE! 
Whatcha mean BizMarkie? Whatcha mean BizMark? 

Ah with my ""ah one two"" I substitute about a loop 
So let me serve with the slope, with the Plug of two scoops! 

Mr. Miyag' never did dip for Dove 
Bootleggers my legs and, grit about a hug 
And who gets the Motts, I knots by the chance 
I rain-dance I rain-dance 
But steppin just a bit I don't need another shadow 
Makes makes, is gonna be the new man's motto 
Don't increase the bull, because my pulley is broken 
And my belly is full 
It's a second I reckon on the bone and the ball 
Makin London bridges fall, so check it 
I bring a point to the joints that we change and chop 
But we could bring it back to the beatbox! 

I'm Posdonus Plug Wonder plotter 
Serenade her cause I gotta record 
When in the womb I was naked now I 
Chill with latex cause of how I, enter 
The black wood without a splinter, provin 
I had the chills what helps in movin, asses 
Saw the light cause I got glasses, so we 
Sip the cappuccino slowly 

I'sah makes the big money! 
I drive big 

Cars, serve the bubble like a bar tender 
When in flight like a sender, lace 
Sticks of dynamite on bass, head 

Lace the shoe until he dead 

Run! Cause the cop is gonna come 
This my Plug style 

So they can kiss my, grits 
Hold my balls without a mitt grab 
The mouthpiece to talk the dag nabit 
I keeps goin like that rabbit, ricochet a dame I need a Snicker, 
Satisfy the Norman to the Gladys, Knight 
My glasses help me see the light, so we 
Sip the cappuccino slow 

In life, it's what you see is usually whatcha 
Get, won't take a Drag-without-a-Net, no 
To put the rhythm in the, bone 
Marrow, laid the pipe to please Cari-lou 
I don't know! 
If it's true
That's a fumble
Well catch a fever from the jungle
Chocolate, nubian girls flock to it, sweets 
And if I can't sample beats, get the 
Beatbox equipped with the, dirt 
BizMark and Doug E. works, fine 
Mase work the wheel I tangle lines, hark
The light is thirsty in the dark 
So we 

It's like I saw it in the river but my M wasn't fixed 
Super heavy like a Chevy pump a Maseo mix 
I had some screams in my pockets, and played it kinda hush 
And did the outs (got to check out, the avenue) 
I peeped the Zoah on the gimme gimme, plus we hit the plat' 
Then the amps was on samp's, the villains got fat 
The Natives weren't the neighbor then to, nigga please
It's a hustle for a joint when your settlement G's 
But we still be on the wax because it acts like that 
We still be on the moves because it moves like that 
So there ain't no reason to don't stop 
'Cause we can bring it back to the beatbox!

When I entertain, and love to treat you
Love to see a girl in a nightie that's see-through

Oh you thought that I was rotten? Huh, I beg your pardon
To me getting paid and getting busy fall together
So a man of my ambiance never
Could I be weak, why I'm rather unique
I got style, flavor, grace, and plus a different technique
That I be using and not many can manage
So a brother like me, I do damage
Just by picking up the mic to go solo
I cold turn a party on out, and oh yo
I get physical, mystical, very artistical
Giving party people something funky to listen to
That's why the other MC's can't swing long
I stomp them out just like I was King Kong

It means King Asiatic, nobody's equal

I hate to brag, but damn I'm good

And if rap was a game, I'd be MVP
Most Valuable Poet on the M-I-C
Or if rap was a school, I'd be the principal
Aw fuck it, the Kane is invincible
To be specific, I may die one day
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
It's a certain special skill that takes much practice
I got it good, apparently you lack this
So in turn, sit back and learn
Listen close, this is for your own concern
Let me show you exactly how it's properly done

Did you ever feel like cryin', and think you'd get nowhere
Did you ever see her comin', when the lights were down below
Did you ever whisper God I love her, but how much you never know
Did you ever look into her eyes and see a little prayer
Could you sew a spot, flow to her heart
And think that you were there?
Did you ever wonder where she is, or wonder if she's true?
One day you'll be happy
But that next day you'll be blue

That's why I say well (well) - it feels so good to me
WELLLLL (WELLLLL) - you know just how to set me FREEEEEEE

Yo yo yo yo Cool V, why don't you give me a cue
One more cue, and then I'm ready to go in

Don't you like when the winter's gone
And all of a sudden it starts gettin' warm
The trees and the grass start lookin' fresh
And the sun and sky be lookin' their best
Birds be singin', flowers be bloomin'
A lot of brand new cars be zoomin'
Fly girls lookin' the best they can be
And the guys be dukey dukey Dan you see
Besides all that I like the warm weather
'Cause that's when you can get yourself together
But I like Easter time with a grin
'Cause when I was little we used to go to Coney I-sland
We used to eat a lot of stuff like cotton candy
'Cause back then, it was like fine and dandy
You used to get dressed up in double knits
And your plaid suit jackets, they were the shits
The good ol' days, was back then
And the reason I reminisce, 'cause

It's spring again
Everybody know it's spring again
To the girls and boys and people above
This is the time to fall in love

Now girls have you ever broke up with your boyfriend
And you felt that the world was comin' to an end
Sittin' around the house poutin' for no reason
Just because you thought your man was skeezin'
For a couple of days, look gloomy and gray
Thinkin' about the ol' happy days
All of a sudden, the telephone ring
He beg for your forgiveness and you know what that brings
Joy and happiness into your life
Before you felt like your heart was stabbed by a knife
I'm tellin' you girls, keep the man that you got
'Cause if he cheats, you might need a VD shot
You know two wrongs don't make a right
And if you did somethin' wrong, don't do the same it's not polite
Please don't make this breakin' up a trend, becuase because

[Chorus]

Now fellas have you ever met a girl that tried to front
And wanted you to act like you was on a hunt
I used to see my homeboys frown and fret
For a girl that always tryin' to play hard to get
I know I caught it myself, I must admit
And said anything you want you gotta work hard for it
Me the Diabolical, be obsessed?
And go after somethin' that a girl possess?
They're really on yours like a pair of drawers
They want you to be like Santa Claus
They want drug dealers, and four-wheelers
Truck jewelry, they expect you to steal her
Sheeeeit, I know they must be buggin'
They better hit the streets and do their own muggin'
But in this case, you would just overlook her
Send her on her way and say I can't help you hooker

I was walking down the street, just a minding my biz
I saw this young lady, the ultimate
She had a pair of jugs that was so fine
Then I took a look at that behind
Thirty-six-twenty-four-thirty-six; I looked to her, and I said ""I need a fix.""
I asked her the same blahzay, blahzay
Her name, where she live, and how much she weigh
I got her digits and gave her my one-eight hundred beeper number
You can leave a message under the name of Rhumba
I know you're bugging off, then I will be too
But every time she be walking, she turns the heads of the crew
Word is bond; I wouldn't be messing
With this girl if I knew she was an adolescent
To all the guys over twenty-one; here's the news:
It's the hip-hop version of the Young Girl Bluez

[Chorus]

As the story goes on, I get a little deeper
I got a strange message on my one-eight hundred beeper
Call me loony, crazy, psychotic, or dumb
But I got a good message from a girl named Rum
Come and get me from Mickey D's at eight
That's where I work after school; pick me up for a date
I was so excited that she called my pager
But never thought to ask if she was a teenager
She mentioned going to school, but I didn't think it was high
If you saw what I saw, then you know why
You wouldn't believe or even think of
A bird like that could be a dove
I picked her up in my Lexus coupe
Only God knows what I'm doing is a goof
Am I robbing a cradle?  I'm very confused
I'm stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez

[Chorus]

Now I was seeing her for about half a year
Everything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear
Age ain't nothing but a number; that's what Chi-Ali said
Okay, then why don't you get that through the judge's head?
Proceeding along, I must have to say
It was coming very close to her birthday
I asked ""What do you want?"" 
She said ""A pair of earrings.""
I never knew what an avalanche the future brings
Her birthday came, and she gave a party
I arrive kind of late to the place to be
People was excited for seeing my face
If my mother ever knew, I would be a disgrace
""How old are you now?"" to Rhumba-reen
I was in shock when they screamed ""Sixteen!""
I felt like falling apart when I heard the news
This is the never-ending saga of the Young Girl Bluez!

Roseland, the Hassan?, Madison Square Garden 

Even rock for the ?work fare at Jaffer Center? 

Pardon the way, that I be talkin bout the places I be rockin

When you buy food cheap, you need a coupon

on the mic and like 

Make you co-op-er-ate with the rhythm, that is what I give em 

Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chilsholm 

It might sound confusing, the style that I'm using 

But in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing 

and funny, oh honey, it's just ridiculous 

Don't try to front, come on and admit you was 

thrilled, chilled, your heart was all filled 

So respect the architect, as I begin to build 

Science and my reliance is upon my rap 

Like Carl Lewis I get to it, so let's go the lap...

So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me

I've tried so not to give in
I've said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist, when baby will I know so well
That I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

Don't you know you fool, you never can win

Yeah that's aight
Ahhh man!
Yo G, yo Kool G, yo
I'm doin this right here
We got Big Daddy Kane over there
We all gonna do just one part
Because you know, we came a long way
You know, from back in Martin Luther King days, Malcolm X
[Ain't hard to tell] You know, now now that we see
Nelson N-Nelson Mandela's free
We gonna talk about this, is e gonna talk about this racism
Stop that, you know what I'm sayin', we gonna stop that
So G, why don't you just do your rhymin' part, and then I'll come on after you
(Aight, check it out, here we go, yo)

I'm tryin' hard to explore, I'm not sure
What all the racial war for
It's makin' me more sore
I walk through a color blind corridor
Seekin', for peace in the people I'm meetin'
Black white and Puerto-Rican men are greetin' each other
Just like brothers, there's plenty and many of others
You can discover, kids fathers and mothers
A meltin' pot, no one felt they got prejudice
Listen I could never assist someone diss this
A landscape, with a dark and a light handshake
Havin' fun, without one bein a fake snake
So let's form a rainbow over the mountain
And let's drink from the same water fountain
Let's make our Earth Day a story of
People that walk through the same territories
Color or creed, is no need for a man to bleed
I believe, we all breathe the same seed
Unless it's diluted, for somethin' to intrude it
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
So if you're givin' in your ears I hope your hear me and
Siberian's no better than Nigerian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
I'm no villain so why would I be killin' Indians
My nationality's reality
And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
These are words of a wise man, wisdom
Take a taste and erase the racism

The ink is black, the page is white
Together we learn how to read and write
People are black, got people that's white

In the days of slavery
Some got to run away and many got done away
Inferiority is what some men say
But that shit played out with Kunta Kinte
Then again in the streets of New York
I think of Yusef Hawkins, and I see you're still stalkin'
And when I think of barriers like Bensonhurst
Huh, notice how I mentioned hearse
We got to better this world of prejudice
People, make peace, and learn to live equal
'Cause I don't look at myself as a
Coon or a mooley that would have to say massa
You better believe that I'm an Asiatic descendant
And I know what's been amended and intended
So let's fulfill and get real, and try to build
A united nation, eliminate segregation
I know there's different strokes for different folks
But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes
So don't hate me or try to underrate me
Cause I collect ends drive a Benz and live greatly
And we can all live together in harmony
Without thinkin' what color is harmin' me
If I'm a slave I'm a slave to the rhythm
To E-R-A-S-E the racism

To the black and the white
The red and the yellow
To all the nationalities

And I hope they stop racism and it's comin' from our hearts

Talk slick and be laid out in chalk 
I still stay out in Newark 
And blaze my way into court

Biz Markie,"It's about forty degrees out there 
I know all you out there listenin' to these sounds 
Humpin' and a bumpin' out in your Jeeps 
Well  ahh you tell 'em Moe 
That's right  and right now  we're gonna hit you off 
With one from Redman  and uhh  it's about uhh 
Well ooh ohh ahh ahh he's gon'  let the monkey out 

Ha Chi Town in it 
Yo  yo-why-yo-yo 
Now first of all I be the Doc smokin' blocks of hash 
Alert your fag ass commissioner when I harass because 
Hood regulation is, no infiltration 
If it's hot to your crew, then it's hot to the next patient 
I'm in The Bricks like backspins on the mix 
I'm not a playa, but y'all hatin' me like I'm a pimp 
These cars y'all talk about, the Doc already whipped 
You bout to go downtown bitch, like Tha Shiznit 
Overseas bangin' cot in the parkin' lot 
I'm overdosin' in a Amsterdam coffee shop 
And when you lust for hardcore music to bust 
Trust that nigga who bubble mo' than Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus 
Static, niggaz actin' all dramatic 
I'd rather smoke cabbage, in the chair gettin' tatted 
My P.O. tried to violate me for the habit 
Because I walked in the office rockin' straight karats 

[Chorus] 
Gonna ride in the hoop' with a freak tonight 
Hope to God I don't have to pull the heat tonight 
But uhh, light up a L cause I'm a nigga fo' life 
Hustlers, got the shit that'll keep you high! 
""Gently place the balls, into the mouth, and hum"" 
""Gently place the balls, into the mouth, and hum"" 

Yo, I'm in your local ghetto rollin' a Corona Deluxe 
Bitch you better hit the forty, fuck a margarita! 
Shit I still scam change out the parkin' meter 
And get a bunch of pussies wet overfloodin' peanuts 
Yes, smoke a quarter-sacks, hut one two 
My cerebral will keep the white boys sniffin' glue 
Hotter than Champagne Rump Shaker Part II 
Get dap like the Mad Rapper, ""Who da fuck are you?"" 
The Loaded Desperado, I'm cooler than Rollo 
(Aiyyo, what you hittin' Doc?) I'm hittin' hoes up in the Tahoe 
Gettin' chickens fightin' in the back of the Apollo 
Say, ""Fuck dat!"" if I'm a tough act to follow 
(""Fuck dat!!!"") Disagree I bring the beef gyro 
Only right I spiral the hot shit that I know 

Then buy a six shot Eclipse with plastic grips 

And get a gangsta bitch who love robbin' shit! 

[Chorus] 

It don't stop y'all, it don't stop nigga 
You don't stop y'all, it don't stop nigga 
I turn an independent woman back into a hoochie 
Make a Jew rock a Dashiki and a Kufi 

I be the, Nutty Professor, style aggressor 
Put rappers under pressure, with no cooker 
 
Rock it to a T. like Booker, you're straight shook up 
I can't hang with pussy niggaz who be scared as hell to push up 
Too much money and, not enough time 
It be, too many thugs and not enough nines 
Hey hoe, here come five-oh, stash the blow 
Stop suckin' on my dick and slide on your Kenneth Coles

Good googily goo

Look what the cat dragged in

The mack's back in, we snap-crack in

We got the jokes for you

Uh, look who the Hump bumped into

The old one-two, rhyme sayer, the paper maker

Biz lay the vapours



(Biz Markie)

I'm the vapour sprayer for the himilayas

The M-iza A-ya are-iza K-aya

I'm the mayor

Leavin' emcees in a ditch



(Humpty Hump)
So get ready, we 'bout to start a fight in this bitch




(Biz Markie)

Humpty dumpty had a fight with his moms

He broke both her legs and both of her arms
Tidy Bowl Man tried to throw a fit


I told his punk ass he was full of Shhhh...



(Humpty Hump)

Shut your mouth biz


See you're allways trying to take it further
I heard you bit a burger, with a funky worm in it

well you had to play stupid 'cause you didn't clear the sample

and lordy lord, got you pushing hot dogs



(Biz Markie)

Tupac was the only one that was living large

And Humpty your nose is a two-car garage

I know you got sooooul

I heard you don't eat pussy you be eatin' booty hole




(Humpty Hump)
No my nose be in the booty, my tongue be in her vertical smile

I heard your sister had sex with Colin Powell



(Biz Markie)


Your moms don't brush her teeth
I heard her breath was strong



(Humpty Hump)

Yo you wrong



(Both)

Why can't we just get along?




Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends
Why can't we just get along?

Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends

The odd couple



(Biz Markie)

The city so nice, they had to name it twice

New York, New York, the land of lights

We got the fashion, the widget, the project ditches

The Apollo, the Broadway, The Garden, the Pictures



(Humpty Hump)

So? We got the palm trees, Gs being Hollywood swingin' large

Cars around the block with the stars on the sidewalk

Every stop lights a show case, not lexuses

Brothers in Hummers following other friends in Benzesus



(Biz Markie)

Ya, that's cool, y'all doin' your thing

But look what they did to that man Rodney King

They beat him, and stomped him, like a bunch of grapes



when I seen him he looked like the Planet of the Apes

(Humpty Hump)

Ya you right, police don't act tight but in the riots yo

California niggas wasn't scared to go

at poh poh




(Biz Markie)
So yo, I'll take you down like Mavis

Every Burrough is Thurough, don't forget Larry Davis


(Both, trading lines, Humpty is first)


We got Dre and Quincy Jones, homes



Primo and Puff, Hump



Easy E and Tupac nigga



Scott La Rock and Biggie nigga



Compton



Bronx



Oakland



Brooklyn Bridge



Golden Gate, plus Huey Newton



Malcom X




You got rats


Earth quakes




Well at least you'll never catch me wearing wigs in my videos


Oh, you don't have to go there, with your big, plastic nose



What about your big ass head?



What about your buck ass teeth?



Your moms so black, I looked at her and thought that I was asleep



Your nasty ass moms gave me ear infection over the phone



Come on man, why we can't get along?



Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends

Why can't we just get along?

Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends

Biz Markie,"Yo six o'clock every morning you waking up yawning 
To the sound of your alarm clock alarm 
About an hour from now 
You should be at the place of employment 
Which is annoying cause it's so boring 
Your co-workers are talking too loud for you to ignore them 
It affects your occupational performance 
You wonder why your work load is so enormous 
Because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office 
People get depressed, they get ulcers 
From the stress that the corporate environment causes 
Regardless of how you ultimately want to solve this 
Seems to me like you've got one of four choices: 
You could take a new job offer for more chips 
Stick it out a little longer or forfeit 
But my advice to anybody that wants to quit 
It'll feel much better if you say it like this: 
 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it 
 
Yo, if your boss is a S-O-be	 
Tell him to S-H-O-V-E the J-O-be	 
Put your middle finger up slowly 
Put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely 
Say I ain't workin' here no more 
Who do you think you are? 
Rip your apron off, throw it on the floor 
Run to the door, to the payphone 
Make a toll-free call 
Tell your spouse what happened and where you are 
So they can come and get you in the car later on 
And help you search for a new nine to five job 
If the unemployment line ain't that long 
You can take your time printin' out W-9 forms 
Eventually, you'll get on if you try hard enough 
And you'll get money if you keep punchin' your time card enough 
Maybe you hate it, maybe you love it 
But if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to 
 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it 
  
Yo, some occupations are like slave gigs 
The boss is favored and get placed in something spacious 
While the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces 
Or get thrown down in the basement, get your stapler confiscated 
You constantly waitin' for a paycheck 
Twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet 
Here's a optimistic motto 
If you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow 
Most nine to five's are hard 
'Cause the description in the job ain't no picnic in the park 
People get hired 
Drink coffee to stay wired 
So they don't get tired, sleep late, and get fired 
 
You came in late, you already ate, 
Nowww, you want to take a lunch break!??! 
 
Ay, yo bust it, ain't no need to discuss it 
Just take this job and shove it, right between your buttocks 
  
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it 
 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Ah Ah ah ah ahahah ah 
I ain't workin' here no more 
Take this job and shove it 
I ain't workin' here no more

Ah one two, ah one two
Ah one two, ah one two
I'd like to.. introduce myself..
My name is.. ah Biz Markie..

Well I'm the human ultra called Biz Markie
Makin music orderly is my specialty
When I go {*BOOM*} ah one two, girls get excited
When they hear my lyrics they wanna recite 'em

I know y'all in the mood, just go with the flow
And I can play rappin records and all disco
Like ""Beat It,"" ""Billie Jean,"" by Michael Jackson
Or the Treacherous 3 record, they call ""Action""

When you hear me do it, you will be shocked and amazed
It's the brand new thing they call the human beatbox craze

[Chorus]
  Make the music with your mouth, biz!
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}
  Make the music with your mouth, biz!
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}
  Make the music with your mouth, biz!
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}

Well I don't just do the beatbox, I rock on the mic
And all the rhymes that I say, all the people like
I get the crowd jumpin, get the girl's hearts pumpin
All the party people say, ""Isn't he somethin?""

Rock from New York City all the way down South
Sayin rhymes and makin music, with my mouth
I'm a tell you party people how I began
It started when I'm livin in Long Is-land

Hey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets
Makin sounds with my mouth, all sorts of beats
Grown people, used to say - WHAT?
Grown people, used to say - WHAT'S... 

Wrong with that kid makin that strange noise
It was like, for all the fly girls and all the homeboys
Then I tried it at a homeboy's basement par-ty
They thought it was a record, they ain't know it was me

When they came by the DJ, and saw who it is
They said, ""Make the music with your mouth, Biz!""

[Chorus]

It may look and sound easy doin the human beatbox
But it's real difficult, even knocked me out my socks
It's a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note

I like doin it as a hobby or a job
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
It's not all the props, spittin, breathin hard and doin
You need practice, be ambitious in the schoolin

Let me tell you party people, you gotta admit
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
That's why I like doin sounds, that's hard to achieve
Makin two or three sounds at one time you can't believe

When I walk down the street, people crowd around me
And say, ""HOW YOU MAKE ALL THEM SOUNDS at one time Biz Markie?""
I tell 'em it takes a lot of practice, and lip control
I've been doin it since, fifteen years old

And everywhere I do it, the people say I'm good
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
I'm tellin you a fact, and just like it is
Even moms pops and cops say, ""Whattup Biz?""

Everywhere I go, I always rocked the boat
Gonna end this rhyme, with this one note
Not gonna act conceited and say I'm the best
But I'm guaranteed to pass any kind of test

I say def rhymes, with funky fresh lyrics
When I do the beat the party people go into HYSTERICS!

[Chorus]

You heard the proceedin, now here's the sequel
All human beatboxes is not created equal
That's why I'm here, to say today
That I'm doin my beat in a special way

Makin musical tunes, orally, I have perspective
I'm very well known, and greatly respected
I like to thank people, without no doubt
Peace hi party people it's time to break ou..

And seeing the good he had within him, let him out again

With the rhythm and rhymes and style that I display
If rap was sex, I'd be a porno star
With Sade, and Janet, in a menage-a-trois

Merrily merrily, life is just a dream-ah
First car, I ever had was a Beamer
First girl, I ever had was a screamer
I got out of breath and almost caught emphysema

Put the party people in a state of shock
While Biz compose songs like Sebastian Bach
This is the end of this scenario
Like Robin Harris, ""I gotta go - gotta go!""

Uh-huh, that's somethin' for the DJ's to cut up
They know (funky!)
Okay, break it down

On your mark, get set, let's go, you know it's me
The incomparable, SK, the B-I-Z
I know it's been a long time since you heard me
Do the beatbox and rock an LP
But right about now in 2003
I gotta make one to rock the party
As I change back from DJ to MC
Now it's time to get funky!
For the ladies, for the fellas
East, West, North, South
My style is really outrageous
And when you hear the song it's really contagious
It's simple enough, be understood by all ages
But it will make you go out like gorillas in cages
I used to sing songs myself but now I can't
I need the party people to help with this chant
I need y'all to sing a lil' somethin'

But you know, on the tables I've been doin my thing
Like Lisa Stansfield, I've been around the world
I'm from New York, like Earl the Pearl
But since I live in Washington I'm Redskin like Levon
Hangin' at Dream and V.I.P. like a superstar
But I don't buy the bar, I buy a Red Bull
And sip and look at all the chicks that's, beautiful
Like dark-skinned, light-skinned
White, Puerto Rican, Ital-ian
I like to see them dance and drippin with sweat
Givin' them more than they were supposed to get
Winter, spring, summer or fall
Whether you're eatin' food or drinkin' alcohol
They gonna rock your body all night long

Listen to the brother with the rhythm rhymes I display
Whether you from New York or L.A.
You listenin' to the B-I-Z every day
I was always a class clown, never the teacher's pet
That's why right now I'ma do the alphabet
Like A-B-C-D-E-F-G

That's why a lot of emcees wanna see

Biz Markie,"I saw this girl from like around the way
I told her I was the be	-I-Z Emezah-A
She said she know my reputation, know I got clout
And like to get to know me, without no doubt

So we started havin long telephone conversations
Tryin' to feel each other out, showin' a lot of patience
Was a hook-up from my man, word bond she was bad
If I met her whole family I would kiss her dad

So in my mind I was thinkin' she really liked me
She got a good head on her shoulder and she's no dummy
Me and her, had compatible horoscopes
But she bugged me out so bad I was on the ropes

Now when I was with her, my shoulders shrugged
Because when I reached out for a kiss and hug
She mushed me in my face, and smiles with a grin
And said this question

[Chorus]
Why can't we be friends? We can't we be friends?
Why can't we, be, friends? We can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends? We can't we be friends?
Why can't we, be, friends? We can't we be friends?

I knew she was different, a very special gal
For the time being, hmm I shall
Respect her wishes, she wasn't a groupie
I understand, she said she just had met me

I liked her for that, a woman with morals
She called me every day, so I saw she was loyal
It bugged me out cause I don't usually wait
But on a scale of one to ten she was a twenty-eight

We was goin' out on the reg', movies and dinner
Always stay at my house, way past ten o', clock
I thought she really really liked me
I did the right thing, like my name was Spike Lee

She had her own car so I walked her to the door
Like Busta Rhymes I said, ""Gimme Some More""
So I put my lips out, to get a kiss
And she said just like this

[Chorus]

I knew somethin' was wrong because my mack is correct
Talkin' for six months and didn't hit it yet?
I thought I was slippin, or maybe in a slump
I felt like Eddie Murphy when he was Professor Klump

Naw it can't be, she's here every day
So I don't know why she'd want to treat me this way
I gotta investigate like Magnum P.I.
I just don't understand, why oh why

So the next time I saw her she was unhappy
She had a frown on her face and real jumpy
I said, ""Yo what's wrong?"" I was real concerned
The way she looked her life had took a real turn

She said, ""I went to court today,"" and I said, ""What?""
""If I tell you this, you're gonna go nut""
I said, ""Tell me I can take it I won't pretend""
""I gotta go to jail for life, so..""

I really want to put you under my wing
But every time I try you give me a hard time
Like I'm a murderer, or commitin' a crime
I try to do everything right for you
You're always givin' me excuses, makin' me blue
When I met you at Cancun, at Fiesta Americana
You lookin' tasty like strawberries and banana
I asked you your name you said Lee-Lee from San Fran
She said, ""I have friends but I don't got a man""
I said, ""Really?! As good as you look?
Lookin' like somethin' out a Playboy book?""
I thought I struck gold, ching ching, the jackpot
Just the thought of you it be makin' me hot
When I step to you, you act funny style
You need to marinate on this for a while

[Chorus]

Now let me tell you like this baby doll
I never guessed you would act off the wall
Give me a chance for a little romance
We can dance and dine in Jamaica or France
Somethin' in the way you make me feel
I like your personality, and your sex appeal
But it's all hard, not bein witchu
You're playin' hard to get like catch 22

[Redman]
Yeah, yo, check it out
I'ma walk in gutta, get that butter
Only dude with a weed sign on the chucker
Hood down, car kinda loud from the muffler
Like DAMN when I profile at the Rucker
Bitches (Got Game), I'm (Above the Rim)
Call my gun Magnolia Soulja Slim
Do ""The Freak"" on the floor, two steps to the side
Talk greasy like Popeye's breast and a thigh
I got sour diesel roll
One hit of this bitch, your whole staff is (out of control) {""Ohh!""}
I'm programmed for winnin, Sean John to denim
Fly guy got shoes with fish in water swimmin
You pointed me out, bad guy with the mouth
I'm Oscar, no wonder muh'fucker I'm a (Grouch)
I work around dirt, eyes focused on turf
You tried to hide before your NexTel chirp!
Blaow gotcha, you the best nigga call the doctor
Like Chinese tryin to salsa
It's never gonna be in (Groove), call Stella back
Holiday Inn 'em, then back in the shuttle van
Bitch give me head on the first date, what a fan
Three best MC's I think on the other hand
Stand like an officer, not a gentleman
Niggaz get rich off of stolen car settlements!

[Chorus: Biz Markie (Erick Sermon)]
I say yes yes y'all {""One-two one-two""} to the beat y'all

A New York nigga man back in the mix

Cheese, all out my pocket; can't stop it (uhh)
All you can do now boy is just respect it
I ain't par tomorrow but the E is connected
Look what happens when you spin the records
Hip-Hop at its best, nothin to mess with (yeah)
I'm right here, there's no need to download
I attract hoes, I ain't gotta hound those
I call the shots, no need to brown-nose
Cut the check at 40 grand for shows
I'm (Fresh) like Doug E., I show ya
The beat got it (Clap) like them boys from 'Nolia, I told ya
Yeah, I do it real big by a coat check
With no bling-bling around my neck, yup

I'm what a hip-hop fiend is

Yeah, I also walk in gutta, reppin my clique
A Def Squad nigga yeah, all in your mix
Niggaz talk shit you get your ass kicked
I ain't a Blood, but I'll throw you out the whip (word up)
What you know about Pinot Gregio and roasted duck (huh?)
With a mean street team outside posted up
Toasted up, ready to roast a duck (uh-huh)
When I say street team, I don't mean niggaz that put posters up (word)
Let's be blatant, you achin and ancient
We capered in your hood with dirty machetes and bloody aprons
I'll acquire a tec, quiet your rep
Stay quiet as deaf, or Kanye's choir rep (uh-huh)
As I make another left, quiet I crept, quiet you slept
I'm back with the tec, like I never left (surprise niggaz!)
See frivolous beef'll get you curiously shot (uh-huh)
You fuckin with Keith, I think seriously not (hell no)
I ATTACK like a blue-nose pit off gunpowder (yeah)
And love to soup the beef up just like clam chowder

Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
Got my ass cheeks stuck to a fishin' rod
Where's the dogs? Ain't no frogs
Momma cookin' breakfast with no log

I got my grub on but didn't pig out
No Thanksgivin' so we eatin', carry out
This dude came through my front door
He said I wouldn't live to see a 24

I gotta go 'cause I got on flip flops
If I sold out then my feet 'll drop
Had to stop at the red light
Everybody laughin' at my yellow dirt bike

And everything's alright
I got a beep from Sherry, she's a transvestite
Called up my homies and I'm askin' y'all
Bring twenty bottles of alcohol

Playin' football and I'm trouble
They gave me the ball, I fumbled
And I can't believe my best friend's gay
Today was a bad day

Today was a bad day
Today was fucked up

I bust my ass in the shower
Got on this fresh new baby powder
Kids, just today these fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and got my ass beat

No flexin', wooped my ass in the intersection
Till I shoot, that's the question
Went to Big Fam house to watch the Rap City
Shootin' them craps, I got 50

Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
A circle a niggas, watch me all fake 'em
They beat my ass, I need nine, 9/11
They threw my ass through the back door

They took all my cash flow
Punched me in the chest and kicked me in the asshole
I just found out my best friend's gay
Today was a bad day

Today was a bad day
Today was fucked up

Left my homies, house paid
Picked up this chick, been tryin' rape since the twelfth grade
It's ironic, the pigeons is the man
And Artest fired on a fan

Took a trip to Miami
Got my ass beat at the 21st Grammy
My dick is so weak, so weak
So weak I put my own ass to sleep

Woke her up around one
He didn't hesitate to say that she didn't cum
Ridin' down seven mile coastin',  smoken on the potion
Rubbin' on some baby oil lotion

And nothin' seems to work out
She smacked me in the face and murked out
Today was like one of those bad dreams
Jackin' off with a bowl full of whip cream

Helicopter lookin' for the murderer
Two in the mornin' got the Coney Island burger
Even with the lights of the Good Year blimp
And it read Bizarre ain't shit

Drunk as hell and I'm throwin' up
Pager cut off so you know it ain't blowin' up

To be successful doin' this music thing
Music is a part of my soul
I'll be sixty years old, still on the road

A grown ass man tryin' to make a livin'
A grown ass man makin' grown man decisions
Relax, I don't want you to work
Let me go out here and put in the dirt

I'll buy you a skirt, brand new Coach purse
Whenever I leave, I know it still hurts
What you want a watch, a bracelet or a chain?
How about my chest? A tattoo of your name

Man, I'm sick of all this luggage that I'm rattlin'
Trust me, I'm sick of flights and all this travelin'

Look, your daddy has to hit the road
And I know you're gettin' old enough to notice that I'm gone
And I know I'm your best friend, the one that you look up to
Some people think I'm overprotective but I just love you

And even though I'm gone I'd rather be home with you
And no matter where I'm at your daddy is gon' miss you

And give mommy a big hug for daddy and kiss her

I wish that I could take y'all with me
But it's crazy out here and I don't wanna expose you
To the frustrations of this rap game that I go through

And honestly I don't even do it for me
I do it so we could live life comfortably
And that's why I wear y'all proudly around my neck
And I don't care who last said it, daddy has your respect
And just know that

I wanna thank Mathew Knowles for giving me a chance
Got the advance, now it's time to hit the streets
And I'll be home in three and a half weeks

What college you goin' to? That's your decision
Just know that I'll be here to pay your tuition
The only daddy you know and that's on the real
And I been takin' care of you since Murray Ill

I moved down south, big old house
Got you two horses and a lake full of trout
And Sundays I put on my new house shoes
Lookin' at TV, watchin' the Lions lose

I miss Papi, Pug, Pepper and Patches
Man, I can't go to sleep on that brand new mattress
Even though I mix music in the band
Big Boi and Dave, see you at Lake Ann

And the last couple days I been missing some pay
Do I have AIDS? I'm sniffing and coughing
And really this doesn't happen too often

Maybe I'm tripping, maybe I got the flu
Maybe I'm stressed out, something I'm going through
It's been a week and me and wife ain't have sex

Exlax got me throwing up Big Macs

Nyquil, Advil, Tylenol, Sinus
Carrying my break around like I'm Linus
Maybe it's the pork that I ate in New York
Or maybe my baby mama wanting child support

Or maybe it's the fish that made me sick
Or maybe it's the prostitute I let suck my dick
Or maybe it's just the bottle of vodka

The tip on my dick ain't got an itch
But I couldn't resist the switch
She's the type of bitch made to flinch

Walk passed niggas all in the ass
Or it's because I had a tall glass
I dropped my drawers without my dick wrapped
Perhaps I could catch the crabs

But at that moment that's irrelevant
I knew what I know now, I practice celibacy
And be hesitant from tapping Evelyn
Heaven sent a message when I came back negative
Never fuck a bitch in the ass off a laxative

Doctor, doctor, come put the brakes on me
You better send me home

Having a bad day, stop by my house,
coz most likely, I've got a blunt in my mouth.
So sit down relax and chill, 
and if ya don't smoke weed, then shit, I got sum pills!
Watch ya need girl, 
a fucking refill?
a fat bag a weed
and sum happy meals?
Nah, baby, I don't smoke no porks,
only fat bags of weed in this escort.

[Chorus]

Sunday morning, Bizarre have day,
Blunt in my mouth, watching DJ Dre.
Dangerous my, just like Cudio
Only church I know, a snoop dogg's studio.
Wide out the raps, blowing in my lap,
Rap hennesy, keep the acid tap.
I'm glad, that I didnt't go down south,
Take care of my kids, be the man of the house,
orange mushrooms, and yellow stars,
Fat bags of weed ?
Get in and lap, come on jump in,
Raid a bottle of gin, and two of your freaky friends
O fuck it! Let's go to see the point,
Bring your son alone, shit, he can hit the joint,
Cause rapping, it's a full time job!
All I wanna smoke weed and praise God!

[Chorus]
I wake up praising, God every day, 
I wanna, smoke some weed and roll me the J,
Thankya Jesus! (Thank you Jesus!)
Thankya Lord! (Thank you Lord!)
For lettin' me live another day! Hey! hey!

Break it down, yea
We gonna slow it down rite here
We havin' Church up in here tonight,
It's the Reverend Rufuss Johnson
and we sittin' over here,

Hip hop, (hip hop) That's the way of life
If you think you're nice, then go grab the mic
Let me tell you my story, cause everybody got one
Grab the pen and pad, and start to jot some
Always told myself, that I would never be losin
Man, I ain't have no hood, my mother was always movin
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit
Goddamn, mama, what's the point?
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags
Jump in the truck, with my step-dad
When I was 10 years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older, then the force got stronger
And me and my rap partner wasn't seein' eye to eye
So we picked up and started a group with some other guys
This is hip hop (hip hop)
Man, I won't stop

Ten years later, I'm still in the zone
7 Mile and Foyer where a star was born
United we stand, divided we swore (D12!)
Hell yeah, I looked in my car
Bitch, I was homeless, I slept in a jar
And Dirty Management, I wish y'all the best
But me and my niggas had to do what's best, it was a mess
All them taxes and accounts
Checks started to bounce, niggas couldn't by an ounce
And now that we platinum, they diss our name
Like we won't go the car and get them things
And beef, sometimes you don't have a choice
From the fight with Whitey Ford to the Beastie Boys
To the Ja Rules, Benzinos, and the niggas in the club
To the E Dubbs and niggas that you ain't heard of
And man, I don't know how to use a gun

Man, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop
I'd rather be fishin' in flip flops, flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, and I
Can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar
Riff to Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seeger
When I was younger I was so eager
To have a gun, I would do the same
Couldn't wait to get to the shootin' range
Me and my man Goofy Gary just tryna let loose some steam
Motherfuckers laughin' cause I couldn't aim
So I pulled the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thing
I used to have this theory, keep three bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no C-C-W license
I tried to apply for one, they said it take 5-6 months
What the fuck am I supposed to do meanwhile when rivals come?
Hide that son of a bitch in the glove box or inside the trunk
Now back to what my three-bullet theory was
I'm triple-platinum, I ain't tryna catch no murder 1
Figured I'd shoot the womb, probably missin' at least one
But the other one's fuck his shoulder and his knee cap up
And I'm a say for self-defense how come I had the gun
Is because I was at the range, on my way back from
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I'll get a year for each bullet at the most as opposed to
Havin' a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
But it gave me power, and it made me crazy
And psychotic, I just got retarded
Once I got and I thank God it was empty the night I got caught with it
What the fuck man, I thought that it was supposed to be

Bizarre,"Ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

I'm used to women think it's nasty
That's their opinion but that ain't my point of view
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

Now ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

I'm used to women think it's nasty
That's their opinion but that ain't my point of view
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

When I was young I was sprung off the way women used their tongue
I couldn't nut yet but fuck that, It was still fun to look
I took Vaseline even though it was thick and rubbed it on my dick
Now I'm grown and my bone is so well known hoes wanna get it cloned

Shit, ain't nothin' wrong with you chunkin' that monkey
All up on me 'til the whole room's funky
The negative thoughts, it's time to change
Shit, you a woman, I'm a man

It's all natural and we're compatible
I'll bend you over, knock you down
Slap that ass a little bit but not to hurt you
Like after havin' a full course meal, it's the dessert
Now lay on your stomach, put a arch in your hips
And look back so I can see all four of them lips

Now ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

I'm used to women think it's nasty
That's their opinion but that ain't my point of view
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

I got on Superman drawers
I'm 6 years old, all in my room, all alone
I'm young, dumb, layin' the pipe
Show time, HBO, Friday night

Butt naked on the couch without no clothes
Remote control ready to bust a load
And fuck Roxanne, I want Big Ann
Tight old pants, my mother's best friend

I watch all your movies and your DVD's
I heard you're comin' out with porno CD
I want Janet Jacme to smack me
Take your bikini off, get on the bed and attack me

I love porn but niggaz be hatin'
R. Kelly ain't got nothin' on the shit I be makin'
I'm a freak, I been that way since 7
Me, Big Boi and Devin, bitch is 11

Now ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

I'm used to women, think it's nasty
That's their opinion but that ain't my point of view
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

I like a lady but I sure love a slut
The type that like to sit on my dick and let me screw up them guts
The chick that want it doggy style while puttin' on my nuts
And when you aim up her face, shorty, don't be tryin' to duck

True Aquarian, mean I'm freaky as to fuck
Eat that coochie for an hour, after you shower cock 'em up
From the power of the orgasm your legs are lockin' up
Caught a cramp in your thigh, can't even pull your stockings up

But your spike leather collar plus stilettos lookin' tough
Now you're passed out on your stomach, seems though you had enough
Like JLo in that movie where her husband beat her up
Puss appears to be pregnant, swole and wet up

Now you need to go and get up 'fore I set up some more setup
I done caught my second wind, let's begin, lift your head up
It's the battle of the sexes, we can do this shit 'til breakfast
I don't want no mo' babies but I can give you a baby necklace

Now ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

I'm used to women, think it's nasty
That's their opinion but that ain't my point of view
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

Bizz,"Another day, I cruise at the beach
Car sitting low, my homey's in the next seat
It's the Royal, rims clean with the top back
Rep for summer with the locs and the baseball hat
Down 805, cuties in the next lane
Trying to draw attention, their number and their name
We didn't get no play we got ignored
But there's too many cuties in the sea to fish for
I pulled up in the spot in the parking lot
Sipping on a 40 at the corner 'cause it gets hot
Cutties checking out the cars that we roll
Black candy with the rims with the booms and the gold
Here comes the pigs, turn it down they're getting nearer
Checking out the vatos with the dice in the mirror
But we ain't villains that be stepping out of line
We like going cruising with the cutties in the summertime

From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don't you know
We be rolling

From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don't you know
We be rolling

I said trucks rolling by with the boom-booms in em
I sling Sly shirts with the Levi denim
A late night tings in after day time
Vatos looking loco, hynas looking fine
The veterano's got the switches to the side
The truck's full of amps in the back of the g-ride
Everybody's styling, Profile's Low
I'm driving real slow, looks like a big car show
I peep the cutties with the light Brown complection
Gotta bust a you and go the opposite direction
Pina Coloda, room at the Ramada

Parties at the beach if it gets any hotter
Cholos in bandanas, nobody's down to bang
Let the rags hang, it's a Mexican thang
We ain't villains that be stepping out of line
We like going cruising with the cutties in the summertime

From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don't you know
We be rolling

From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don't you know
We be rolling

Cooling by the shore, hynas cooling in the sand
Lotion in their hand with a summertime tan

I said homies kicking back in the shade drinking brew
Have one or two, but they're down to drink a few
Too many drinks when the evening arrive
Pass the keys to the homey, it ain't safe to drink and drive

Four five burning, sea breeze blowing
Ladies dress sexy, body half showing
Trying to draw attention, Latino had I mentioned
Pack in the glove, don't forget about prevention
When we hit the motel it's almost 1 o'clock
Everything closed so we head to Heidi's Taco Shop
Cutties want to roll, the lab is where we sent em
Taking em to the room, we did the wild thing with em
But we ain't ones to wine and dine
I'd rather cruise at the beach with the cutties in the summertime
From the coast to the avenue

Yeah, this for all you non-believers, especially out in the see-O. Man, 
fuck y'all niggas. 
Yeah, I'm (tatted) so when I die, you can see what's deep in my eye

Look who got you, too, who shot you, who got you, pop you and stop you

Nigga, this Mo Thug and we can get fucked-up even if I'm under 
surveillance, I watch out, want to win, and fuck 'em up daily, 
throwin' up 7, what am I yellin'? Murderer. Nigga, once you come must 
be like crazy if you [Muthafucka, don't play me] play 
me. Nigga, not today. I see you but you can't see me. I know with all 
of government and, yes, this will get crazy and blow 
[bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb]. 
Maje$ty: 
Got your mind blown, vocal tones keep it sewn, blastin' out your 
steroes or your headphones. The roots exploited clones; 
therefore, it's my job to describe the loudness, the habitat of rap 
survival kit. Artistic skin abrasion, so when 'em fadin' my 
worldly reflections, it's magnified to new levels of elevation. 
Bizzy: 
Seven sign, seven, seven sign, seven, seventh sign seal. 
Yeah, now y'all know, yeah. 
Yeah, I'm (tatted) so when I die, you can see what's deep in my eye

Bizzy: 
The Rip here to run in the street, and flippin' on police, yeah they 
know me, I'm not lonely, only, show me when the smoke 
clears, and at least I had my homie and a nigga, K, homie. All 
bitches, look into it as you want the real killa? Well, pull out 
your pistol, bitch, and shoot it, shoot it. And you knew it, too, 
when, when you looked in my eyes, I'm ready to die. And I 
hope my mama really loves me, 'cause daddy's bye-bye. Inner pride with 
the Ripsta, let 'em hit ya with the scripture, picture 
me loc'd out and smoked out with a half of fifth of (?).

Three sixty-five out of all the round trees, they'll be Japanese, 
Maje$ty's corruptin' record companies. Nigga, jump for cheese, 
catch sub-zero freeze and crack once the atmosphere brings the 
temperature back, slacks only in dress pants, have you ever 
danced with the devil in pale moonlight? I have. Hollywood niggas make 
me laugh. Sell a dream to 'em. Cash, no royality, 
grab they royal keys and dash. My overhead projects how ends meet to 
foul or ejected, lyrics was selected beyond my 
control, last door on the totem pole, pockets swoll from tape residue, 
last interview and went in daytime, it's made a promise to 
let down smooth criminals gently and (?) grab your earlobe and 
billion, this is big business, buy tapes, don't lend, niggas (?) 
while I scrap change for phillies, why grill me? Got bigger balls to 
chase waterfalls with Chili, explore on four wheels or foot, I 
bring it to that ass over the hook so when you slip, gots it. I ride 
up on it. I had to maintain my mental frame, and now I'm 
Boneless, word sound 'til I'm foamin'. Cybergenics wanted my genes for 
clonin'. Disownin' heads like Romans fight rebel 
Trojans. More than civil suits make my longevity boost, articles and 
promotions make me more potent. Deadly to the mind, 
'causin' somethin' to be blind, redefine lines entertwined with all 
mankind. Would that rain outshine divine Maje$ty, shame, the 
boogie down Bronx is where the heart still remain. 
Bizzy: 
I'm a let a nigga know, you know what I'm sayin', just right off the 
bat. I gives a fuck about no nigga. Don't be no (corvie)-ass 
nigga. I'm tryin' to tell niggas that off the rip, off the rippa, 
baby. 
[I must be losin' my mind . . .] I must be. 
Where's the mob? Find your specialty, let's give this nigga a job. Is 
you ready for jail? Yes and no, but somebody's gonna try 
to rob. We can spar, but you gon' drop [drop], I'm a bomb, ready for 
war, will I p-pop pop, better look out for miles, been 
doomed since the womb. Will he put me in my tomb? I've been thuggin' 
so assume when I enter your room, boom. Stomped 
through Compton and cities y'all ain't never heard of, and listen, I 
bet there's thousand people screamin' out ""murder, murderin' 
ya."" Hypnotized, took off my shirt, I got a (?). I'm tatted so when I 
die you can see what's deep my eyes. Trues ride but trues 
die, my nigga, don't cry, I shedded my last tear when I found out love 
was a lie. So I try, but it ain't nothin' for my mental. So 
piss off my pencil, and I blast, dash in a rental. One nigga got (?) 
and off he in a trap with sawed-off they took a chance and 
lost, let's spray A-K and make gangsta gone, don't finish the wars

Trippin' on foster homes

Why can't my skeletons understand me
What if I said I was molested
Would you look at me peel,
But I keep on bailin
And I hope I don't go to hell, stressed I will
Can I sell my bio? I was born in Ohio
Already on trial
Cause Pops said I looked too light, but mom 's just white
But I still had your smile
And look at me now gotta be proud of myself
Ain't nobody else soundin' so worried about my health
And all the while takin' care of my kids

Callin' me worthless but I could purchase what they purchase
But I understand behind closed curtains you workin' on being a man

And hopefully repair me

Watch your sins
Then it's true you can be born again.

Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong

I keep getting closer, closer, closer to the other side
I think I'm running out of time, running out of time
Looking for a sign, looking for a sign
Can you tell me what's going on
Anything's that going on
Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on

Can you me where I'm going
Am I going down
What am I supposed to feel
Am I having doubts
Life is not always showing
Am I safe and sound
The truth and what is really real
See I'm living all alone
Playing solitaire 
But it's kinda hard
When all the cards ain't there
And I'm starting to dig
All the voices inside my head
Yeah

Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?

Looking for a sign, looking for a sign
Can you tell me what's going on
Anything's that going on
Can't seem to tell what's going on, going on, going on

Seems I am always thinking 
Of many things
Of how my life used to be
I'm doubting me
Before my world started sinking
I don't wanna drown
I used to feel so free
But now my back's against the wall
Can't see light at all
Every time I try and play pool
It takes my ball
And I don't care about nothing at all
Yeah

Doctor, doctor, what's going on?
Can you tell me what's going on?
Everything keeps going, going, going wrong

And I keep looking for a sign
I keep getting closer, closer, closer to the other side

So who want a bag who want a bag

So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope in a quarter o (want to get high get high)

Alright homies legalize reefer leaves and nines
Some of them say we evil a little sumthin sumthin for my people
And though I know that weed will even out your debt
Love everything green roll blunts from boxes of cigars said
Gonna get ya fucked up want to get ya fucked up
When you take one hit then I make you hush up nigga shut the fuck up
No stems no indo and chronic hydro and skunk and I can think of some more ohh
Yeah time to smoke said so I know high day come around on Friday
Toke the bowl breath deep boy yes then we pray
As the reefer help me see more everyday woulda me coulda me be Heaven sent
One hell of a superstar bowl every first Friday of the month
And your humbily invited were truly humbly united
Enemies and all of ya'll hate on when I get my fade on

On new year smokin the potent buddha (buddha)
There ain't nuthin like that buddha lovin bomb shit
Fat enough that it will make me move ya sooth ya

Better believe us even when we lonely weed won't leave us

Life ain't easy put it on eazy but we still breathin
Takin a hit of the reefer sendin me straight to heaven
Chokin with my breezy

And don't ya want to feel that feelin and don't you want to spend your scrilla
And givin the weed to the killas niggas forget why they killin (hell ya)

Thug that talkin till we love that love that that
Don't legalize 'cause they know we can
Gettin high just to get by
Through all the suicides and homicides
And genocides drivebys walkbys gonna multiply
And chalk lines in the towns in the h-double-o-d hood and it would rain
And it ain't all were it ain't all and it ain't all and it ain't all good
I started at eleven stealin weed from coppers
And even though you beat us I gotta thank you for the reefer
Neva mess with white girls but I roll those white boys
Niggas come out the pen and they roll some tight joints tight joints
My shit is swollen you shouldn't be rollin
Livin on green leaves that will make your heart bleed
Just go and let me split up the weed and be silent and sober
No jokin when the nieghbers door is open you want to come over
We smokin tokin and now we chokin tokin and then we chokin chokin chokin

Intro:
I don't think they ready for this one, Eric
Tell him 
(Shed your blood) *in background*
Cause Jesus was the light of my life
God saves
Cause Jesus shed his blood

Chorus:
Don't Jesus make you feel good (x3)

Through the stormy breeze
And my children play as the day goes
How I feel like
Through the stormy breeze
And my children play as the day goes
How I feel like goin' on...goin' on...I'm goin' on
Cause Jesus makes me feel good

Chorus (x2):
Don't Jesus make you feel good (x3)

Son make sure you always take care of family
And when I'm gone I'm free
But if you need me
Remember to close your eyes 
And look to the stars up in the sky son
That's where I'll be
Screamin' seven
Heaven's been waiting for me

Chorus:
Cause Jesus make you feel good (x3)
Don't Jesus make you feel good (x3)

I like to look out my bedroom window 
And watch all the children play play play
Just watch them play
But where will they go when the games are over
I hope they got a place to stay
Please do stay
Oh it's a sad situation
Though my heart just keeps on racin'
And one thing that I must know
Tell me

Chorus (x2):
Don't Jesus make you feel good (x3)

We are blessed in the spirit

Cause Jesus makes me feel real good good good",Jesus,2001

Money hungry strugglin while thuggin 
My baby momma complain I'm full wit pain 
Cigrettes tha tame enemies filled wit pain 
Itchy fingers while niggaz they snitched out 
And bitches inches from havin pussy poppers wit pistol switches 
Picture that 
I actually I'm happy daddy just don't understand
I'm back on tha block wit chucks and my man 
And store my sexuality when all tha chickens where virgins (now) 
Rebellin in excursions wonderin if it be burnin up suburbans 
And my community we watch fights and it really don't bother me 
Sadamized by poverty 
Cause nobody think bout our babies 
Cause nobody thinkin bout our babies

Yeaaaaa!!!!!!!! murdarah murdarah

Heavily in tha drug thing 
And if they can stop saddam from sellin missiles 
How we satuated wit pistols they illegalize 
And tax which changed and mark my words 
They doin tha same thing wit cocaine 
And herb how we everyday handle well
Jesus planted tha seeds and help ease lil boys and girls ease 
There minds and I ain't talkin bout smokin weed 
Tha word is all you need follow my lead 
I'm thorough I know wit different homies barrowed through different girls 
Have double barrow pro hammers 
And I sold crack to sherrell and blastin 
Got cleansed to save my selve and no turnin around cause tha ??????

You still my nigga, my nigga, my niggas
I met Screw in 9-4 at a Fat Pat show
Back when Club Unique, use to be stadium bowl
I walked up to his car with a cassette in my hand
Then I freestyled for him 'cause this could be my only chance
Me and my partner Jason, we started doing mix tapes
We both smiled cause we knew this could be our big break
Then Screw wrote his number down and said hit him next week
Get your list together, and pick all your beats
Well time went by and my best friend died
Rest in peace Jason dog I wish your ass was alive
A couple months later, my second cousin passed
So that made me sit down and realize what I had
I dropped ""Diamonds In Yo Face"" and ""Buy The Car, Buy The House""
And Screw saw me at a show and said boy you went off
Two hours later, I was making tapes at his house
And didn't nobody go to sleep until the mics went off

And even though you gone, your memory lives on
And on yeah, and even though you died
You still my nigga, my nigga, my nigga

I'm still on earth, and everything ter-rific
Pour me a spot, so we can reunite and kick it
People don't understand life, but one day you'll get it
But for now you better enjoy your one way ticket
And Screw, I want to thank you for the help you gave me
We had a relationship like Lil Wayne and Baby
The day you gave me the plack saying Screwed Up Click
The Freestyle King forever is Lit-tle Flip
You let me rip, the mic while you was scratching and mixing
I wasn't trying to run shit I just played my position
We stood in the kitchen smoking, laughing and sipping
Getting high, me and you eating a basket of chicken
Before we shot fool you said Flip come get a ass whipping
I ain't gone lie, Screw could shoot with one hand without missing
I'm on a mission, I'm trying to Screw up the world
Lil' Flip gone hold it down baby that's my word

And on yeah, and even though you died
You still my nigga, my nigga, my nigga

Now the last verse, I ain't even got to curse
I'm use to seeing your Impala not you riding in a hearse
You set a trend, that'll never be forgotten
Just imagine Batman if he didn't have Robin
But I learned a lot, and I'm glad I'm in a click
And please believe, I still drop underground hits
I got your name tatted on me with a crown on top
You probably DJ'ing up there for Biggie Smalls and Pac

Shit- heh, friends- heh
A friends come and go I done learned that shit
Either through death or money issues
Or you know what I mean just time and space
Family sometimes you the biggest enemies man
Heh shit

Those that love me if you leave me

I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I'm a go get strong, return a better man

You better believe it you see me
How we creeped up out of Cleveland get your money baby
If not I'm gonna break even I won't let you play me
Your game ain't even season
It's that thuggish ruggish Bone I hope you know
Little be	 the reason see you creepin baby
But what are you really seekin
Are you weak, don't believe in me, believe in Jesus
I'm a freak, but baby that's for life
And all the weak I'm goin deep, and I can roll deeper than you
Half breed rock the mics to survive
And I might not make it out alive I'm spittin to save my life
Tryin a make it right welcome to the world that we live
And all that I did was crawl up out the stuff for my kids
So rest in peace to Little Eazy
But your paper work was sleazy and the black widow was horny
Baby was gettin greedy my boys is 'posed to be watching my back
Load up the guns and let's attack
But ain't nobody tryin to feel me with stack

And this is the way we play spread your rumors
I just love it do it all day everyday
Ride to the rythme of the nickel put the pen in the pack now
And I know you fear me, I done been there
Done that, run that, fun that covered around
And let me kill 'em with the venom we killin 'em with the sound
Every city, every little bitty town
Everybody want to break me down
Nobody gonna take me down East 99 has been abandoned

I'm sick of the drama, sick of havin beef with my momma
And beef with my sisters my brother got murdered
Over marijuana bless the bewilders
Strugglin, hustlin all of my life, watching my back
They already tried to murder me twice
I smoke the herb that I like, I never done coke in my life
We buy but I lie if I did it I'd tell entertainment tonight
Ain't no slackin in my rack it ain't no shame in the game
It ain't no slippin and the pimpin ain't no crack on the brain
You gotta be jealous of me and my fellas
Ain't that what they tell us sell us anything
We helpless give me a little bit faq and help us
We strugglin, jugglin, thugglin, hustlin, thuggin up in the club
No one to talk to, you step on his shoes
You really fucked up, poppa you was a roller
But his pockets are all swollen, you met the dope man
And now we on the block ask who told 'em
Sell 'em  some soap man that's for all the times you played me
Old man this is your son with a blunt and a gun
Check out my slow jam

Sip that crown all day everyday
Hey, hey and then I'll be pay-e-yayd
Fresh out of them carcus mountains

You gotta love me cuase I'm ghetto fabulous
What do you think, half breed rock the mic
Seven don't rock no pig I'm giving the people what they like
I've heard of murder but I don't know nothing
Like 'ternal clink, sink
I ain't had a drink in four motherfuckin weeks
I'm gonna go split my dome, what do you think
You better believe it

I'm not afraid to die
And I'm not afraid to fight, and we can
Bang, bang all day (all day), all night (all night)

So we can bang, bang all day (all day)

Gotta a cop coppin a co-co
The block is hotter than lava

One of thee broke heart rapper
Your hatred is gasoline my words are vitamin mena
You need to shut your mouth and mind your manners
Gettin high since I was nine
Dead homies, I could still smell pine
And wether I twist my tongue or not
Little Bizzy still gonna shine
So re-lax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down to murderous music from me
Check out my new thang please
Don't let 'em rap they whack
Don't know how to move thangs, pack
Or playin in stadiums, third markets
I threw thangs back
And I'm the rebel that made it rappin 'bout crack
Read many books to elevate my levels
So the words would match I am the fresh batch
Bakery, seasons veteran kesh
Now let me ride, gotta thank God just for saving a wretch
So y'all come on

I'm not afraid to die
And I'm not afraid to fight, and we can
Bang, bang all day (all day), all night (all night)

Roll it down let 'em smell that sticky
This Bizzy the Kid let the prescense come
Graze your city I refuse to go back to funerals
Niggaz be dying to quickly
Cause the knuckle heads get buckled
I know they comin to get me in my life
Like I'm blackula only the lights been with me
Here we go into the king elected by the people
I gotta grip on things I'm watching evil
You know my steez plus believe that I'm gone with it
From dusk to dawn you could ask the matradi
Bizzy got that Filet Mignon
I don't need no empathy play the track
As I control the symphony
Gotta get my monopoly property of that nigga Bizzy
Thought he was hard and got his jaw brought
Bitch I can pass out, get up, start rappin and have it all locked

[paper crinkling] What is this?
This was written for you?
You want me to say this?
Yes, I want you to say this
Stay out of the wonderland baby

[Bizzy Bone]
Rebuke murder for me; lust, wrath and sloth
Greed, gluttony, envy and the pride of the thought
I'ma tell you smite that servant, kamikaze no curtains
Slice through the smoke of the mirrors, imperfect
Impervious to danger, fear God, the beginning of wisdom
Enter to the kingdom, would you listen?
I miss you most definitely, spit knowledge, smell my breath
Righteous watchin the way, memory step, whoa!
Pay attention to the street signs
I ain't leave yet; never will, love all
Heavenly Father in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ y'all
Stick with the fight y'all
Spiritual physical shit, c'mon fade that
Feel me though

[Chorus]
No they don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I fake y'all? Never break y'all
Misfit maneuverin, tryin to take y'all
Plead, excuse me?
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I break y'all?
How could I take y'all, misuse, fake y'all?
Split serious please, they don't even know me!
Flash in the flask
They don't even know me
It coulda been flash in the flask
They don't even know me young homie

[Bizzy Bone]
It coulda been the flash in the flask in the dash and the cash
And the mask of different madman, flip blast
In the glass of vision, precision to, get past on the map
Very bad vocal from every paragraph
Blast about bad ass, booty and task
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat, mash on wicked minded and smash
What's nasty? Who the fuck ya talkin ta?
Take off my shirt, quickly tell 'em harkin up
Save last days c'mon, show 'em what we workin with
We praise God, Jesus Christ, most certainly
Baby, baby, world so crazy
Kinda hazy on them sucka, very wary time when I say

[Chorus]
Man, they don't hear me though shake y'all, break y'all
How could I fake y'all, take y'all
Maneuver, try to take y'all
Man please! They don't know me!
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I fake y'all, break y'all, take y'all
Please! They don't know me!
... For the, rest of my life
They don't know me
For the rest of my life, my soul
They don't know me

[Bizzy Bone]
For the, rest of my life the soul and spirit are priceless
I'd rather be iceless than to get played twice
Give 'em tussin homeboys in red, throwin up thrices
Peek deep inside the 4-4, and you can see rice
Like it or not, find it or not, I'm feelin Tyson
Fuck that sick round, missionary shit now
Licensed to pulverize, premise is capital
And the capo go fast in the battle
As they rattle an awful judgment, who the fuck you judgin?
Little grudges is so sledged in the murder while we walk in the dirt
Tryin to cure my little spirit, turn me over my lil' soldier
And they lookin at me tryin to keep me hurt
Feelin the pain huh, gain huh, plain huh
Throw up the one, stay the same huh
Rain come harder, call us homies huh
Footprints, mop, dust, turn the pallet
Power come quick fast, watch yo' ass
Hand on the hourglass, power be the God
Guess that, press that, full court with a fine ass wall
The sin it be the biggest, let's get spiritual
We're off into the light, when it's our gaaaaame
We flip pages, how we rock the ages, the kid is so amazin
But they don't feel me though
They don't hear me though, shake y'all

[Chorus/Outro]
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I break y'all, take y'all, fake y'all
Maneuver man... I say they don't know me
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
Fake y'all, break y'all
How could I maneuver and then take y'all
They don't know me, they don't know me
They don't know me, they don't know me
Evidently they don't know me
How could I fake y'all, shake y'all, break y'all?
They don't know me... heheh

I love music (What kind of music?)

-Layzie Bone-Chorus-
We love the Reggae and Jazz, the Rock n Roll could be cool, Alternative too/ We love the Rhythm and Blues/ But I'm a Hip-Hop Baby, from the heart, I never flip flop baby

-Layzie Bone-
If it wasn't for my music, tell me where would I be? (Where would I be?)/ Prolly standin on the hot block, sellin crack rock, runnin them streets, runnin them streets/ I say ""My music is my best friend, my confidant""/ I love the way we live us one together we the perfect bond/ Me and my radio, doin 90 on the freeway, knowin the way to go/ And I like to feel the rhythm, the beat be bumpin, don't it? And I love to give it to y'all, because I know you want it/ And if you feel like I feel, you love the Rhythm and Blues, Reggae and Jazz the Rock n Roll could be cool/ But, I'ma Hip-Hop baby, this from the heart, I never flip-flop baby/ Give me a drank and a song and I be stress free kickin it, all night long

-Krayzie Bone-
It ain't nothin like Hip-Hop music/ Careful how you use it and please don't abuse it, when you do it/ Music can keep you party people dancin and put your mind in a trancin, keep ya happy, give it a chance come on/ Just flow with the music, get blowed off the music/ When I was 13, like Dr. King ya had dream' to be one of the greatest musicians alive/ To be remembered, when I die/ I love, I love, music...it's got me stayin alive/ And if you took my mic right now, one thing you'll never do is take my love away/ Cause I'm a Hip-Hop baby, from the heart I never flip-flop baby

-Chorus-
-Bizzy Bone-
Tossin and turnin, I'm burnin with different melodies, words my niggas tellin me sellin it to the world/ Been rappin, since the day I heard Rakim, and Dana Dane, Doug E Fresh, Slick Rick, always been a singer mayne/ Late night foster home, workin on perfection my selection of the songs that I heard was my direction/ It's when Tommie was my girlfriend, rolled or go back/ Said ""I'm the baddest mama jamma"", half white and black/ Have my babies: D'Jodecy, sick with Serena, little breed born Bryon, Miss Moe, and Shanika/ Little Trey-Trey, Destiny, and plus Aaliyah, and the newest one is Shelby/ I can't wait till I see em (Dada), they are the music in my physical form since they was born, I've been singin wit tears in my eyes as I perform, for the whole world/ Until I die like Confuscious, tell the world my name is Bryan, I'm in love with my music/ (Yea, uh) Cause I'm a Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop

-Layzie Bone-
Now everybody got that jam, that make ya get up, want to boogy to the beat now/ And if it wasn't for the drums and the strings and the lyrics that we sing what would life really mean now?/ Would it be just as fun? Would ya, kick it the same? Could ya, live without it? Could ya still maintain? My thang, is crank up the volume because it help me escape from my problems/ Till I solve em', and I'ma solve em'/ It's all music, Bone Thugs music

Brought up in the projects, now we ballin' skyscrapers

And I done seen about everything in the world but Jesus
I been to Armageddon, under war, one disciple
Tear it up and start it all over, let me rewrite the Bible
My shit's maniacal, drink Henny until I spit up bile
Livin' this crazy life, la vida loca
Baggin' that coca cola, poppin' that Motorola soldier
This shit is sizzlin', bullets are whistlin', bitch
I am the master of my destiny, never no De Milo
And no Jezebel, my sisters say don't let them broads stress me
I need the silence of the spirits, I am the lamb

Bizzy Bone,"Ain't she bueno, mi amore
I represent a, dios, the uno 

And I was told to write this
Miss you in the worst way, I can't fight this
Give me a stick or a candle so I can light this, c'mon
Baby I love you, and I was told to write this
Miss you in the worst way, I can't fight this, huh
Give me a stick or a candle so I can light this
Baby don't wanna hit it, is you chicken like Tyson?
Baby you hear me, for the moment while I'm walkin' in the Garden
Madison Square, New York, New York, whatever I beg your pardon
I been lookin' for you, not to be a stalker so I'm keepin' my distance
I'd rather sing to you and hope that you'll listen
I'm reminiscin' on the rib, how much did I give?
Keep that money honey, I can eat Ramen Noodles and live
What about the kid, ain't the children, better watch those numbers
I got on my silk clothes, I'm so prepared for the slumber

[Chorus]
We go all day, all day, all day
All night, all night all night
All day, all day, all day
All night, all day all day all day all day
All day all day all day all day

I hear you whiskin' me away, in a brand new ride
I don't have to worry 'bout the Caeser, and the money's inside
The father tellin' me to win, and I'm goin' for mine
You can reject me if you wanna, it's the sign of the times
I like the {?} after the rhyme, the beef prime
Baby I don't believe you but I'm feelin' you Bryon
It's all good, wanna cry, your presence steadily takin' me
In the same direction, of the Father who made me
It's gettin' crazy in the Garden of Eden without my lady
Baby, can't you see, that I'm yo' baby
Walkin' around and I'm thinkin' of you
And I feel like you cut my fuckin' head off, but I know it's not true
I see you throwin' up the one more and more and more and more than ever
Forever your love I spiritually kiss you I can remember
I see you throwin' up the one, more and more and more
Forever your love I spiritually kiss you I remember

[Chorus]

In another life, when you held me close
Said it'll be all right, and you love me so
Screamin' your name and I'm feelin' like you predicted it
But baby I didn't plan it but it happened little baby, didn't it?
You feelin' it the love of the Father, so subsidiary never
It's the love of the people that we cherish like September
I cherish your voice, your spirit and yo' life and your breath
I feel you righteous, I feel you righteous to death
So tell Alicia, love and respect, and of course, the kid in love
I got a question what they say I've been waitin', from up above
Tryin' harder everything, but you stay in my heart
I'm finna cry little baby don't even start
You better believe it, 'lieve it
All day, you better retrieve it, 'trieve it [echoes]

All day, all day, all day

Never a stranger to danger playa
They better remember that to the coldest winters pimp hand
Slippin' ain't never an option, I get the trippin'
Flip when they dip when they skippin'
They say to the other side, let it roll, let it go, let me ride
As we park on the other side, for the moment
And the Lord provides, so potent, heh
Like the omni-potent, I'm the greatest, youknowhatI'msayin?
Now we duckin' in sins, sinful livin', baby let that sinnin' begin
See ain't we dirty rags, and ain't we dirty bags
Pretty in the rugged rough, pretty enough to sip that Henn'
Drift back in, move back in, wit 'em again, sick enough
Can we bring it quick enough? Now tell me is that slick enough
Cause I know I wasn't good enough, and I know they sneakin' a peek
Don't let 'em drown me, oh dear Lord
I think they're drunkards and I'm a freak, stay close
Look at the cookie crook, but I love them all the same and yes I'm grateful
How could they be so fuckin' hateful? (hateful)

Motherfuckers ain't gon' get at me like that nigga [laughs]

And ready for warfare
They ain't ridden me of nothin but weapons of war playa
Pick up the double for reverends and devils
More weapons will give 'em the bite there
But the war yeah, he got us a sword right out of a drawer
Now give me a reason this isn't assault, my fault
Caught up in the crosshairs, here's more playa
They thought it was over and it was a wrap
I tap-dance, for the paper, escape in a world that they never did care playa
And when it was written, the devil didn't deliver it in your mail
And what do you know, it's just like livin in hideous times here
Addicted to kick it, compete with the price
Pour me some ice, yeah, now give me some liquor to get with the vibe
For quicker than fast to get with the mass
The underclass is what they call it
Call me a drunk or an alcoholic I'm ballin, motherfucker!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'ma-I'ma keep it thug 'til the day that I die
I'ma keep it thug 'til the day that I die
See ya - see ya boys hatin cause you see a nigga ballin
Sippin-sippin on the Hennessy until a nigga fallin

[Jim Jones]
Jones... now I'ma push it to the limit, I was dyin to be the boss
And we was up early cause grindin was a sport
Rewindin in my thoughts, late 90's it was cold
Lost a friend every month, couldn't survive another loss
My niggaz in the pen, until we meet again
Picture me in the Benz, blowin weed in the wind
I caught a few cases, and now the Coupe races
Right through the Westside, floor seat at the Lakers, the milli-makers
Uhh, and do you know what that money mean?
The wintertime turn to sunny scenes
50 thou' on my dungarees, I made it rain like it's thundering
But the money got me nervous
My niggaz pack guns cause I ain't tryin to get murdered
And the feds tryin to serve us
Cause we ballin, but I'ma thug 'til I die
Until I hug the sky - Jones!

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
As soon as we judge you give me the grudge you get it away from me
Always seem to be druggin the bud, they get with the scrubs
I'm sittin here waitin for somebody daily
Hopin for love cause shit it is hard enough, myself, get 'em away from me
Probably does continue to move it and groove it
And why you never get rid of me
Can never get rid of beef, nobody know me and nobody owe me, I get it myself
I'm earnin respect and wealth up under the belt, the baby can feel the welts
Been livin in poverty, livin and prosperous
Livin in the matrix, I'm gettin it how
Huh, I'm movin this shit, I stay on the edge and ready to smash
And we better then that, Lord I hope we kick it to get it together real fast
Together at last, under the bridge, you know what it is, move my ass
Drunk or an alcoholic I'm ballin, even if I'm crawlin
Quicker than fast, now get with the mass
The underclass is what they call it, motherfucker

Keepin me lonely, no woman to hold me
Where my lady? My lady ain't crazy, my love
My lady is all that I have
Want that below{?}, and what do ya know
This is the path, so narrow the arrow is pointed
At somethin and I just can't do me
It doesn't suit me, just boot me - I'll make it alone
I'll make it with Bone, I'm comin get home
Baby I don't accept clones
'Member the tone, the tone, the hollerin is dumb
Where is she from? She needs to be gone
My word is my bond, your word is your bond
Whatever whatever, bring David this song and I'm gone

What's she doin, my darling, let's get away fast
I give you no money, don't give me no ass
We upper-class players, riders forever
They never will get us so get us remember
Eleven times comin, she's stuntin, she frontin
When you ridin me then ride Ezra, it's nothin
I make him go fuck the flo', you know
Mi casa mi casa now watch, that hoe
Say boy, that ain't no money, this money is money
Johanna, you're so fuckin hungry, it's funny
Messin my body, my ink, back and tummy

Can't fuck with my book baby
I read the rook for you baby, ha ha ha

Tell them quit with that foolish, this schoolin is due
Don't mean to be rude, with no attitude
Just the gratitude, latitude, gradually after you
How could I ever be mad at you?
One in their face, with one in their place
What should I taste? Give me a woman, I'm straight

Blowin Cali to the haters, oh what a pity
When they hit a nigga, Twista rockin city after city
They gon' ask, ""Is he doin it with Bizzy?""
And you know why they done that (why?)
Because we two of the coldest motherfuckers
To spit these fast lyrics on one track
Buck 'em with a lyrical bullet in the body
Because I gotta get the fire know the shit don't stop
Pull up in a Lamborghini or the Ferrari
I know I gotta get the props, cause I gotta get the drop
Gotta get the dough and get the money money
I could really feel it when I hear they comin for me
Try to get it if you think you feelin kinda lucky
Twin glocks so you know you better bring a buddy
And I got the ammunition for anybody
That wanna go against the Midwest Militia
A whole clip at the competition for Bizzy
A whole clip at the competition for Twista
A whole clip at the world, because it's us against
And then this shit about to get ugly
For static, I'ma hit 'em with an automatic
Run and do murder after murder, but I'm a baller so I gotta get

And drinkin that Goosey, with 'em a brew

Thought that we beefin they try to divide the truth
Talk about who really started the style
How 'bout everyone livin in harmony, look at the army now
General 7, the belly is purest and we gonna get it at heaven
We dancin our way to the gates, if you comin with me we'll need every Muslim
We human, we're all in the brethren
Veteran deep in the city I pity the fool who jump out of this fake
What do I look like massagin the thought
When they come with the matrix and say that we 'fraid
We'll never break, 'member that conny and Twista
We're gonna go through the fire
Never expire, give it the way that they want it
They'll front on you if you tired (what about)
Money you tell me what's money to you, pay for the rappers and corporates
The office that burn wood, but the burn good and the brain wave
Puts the energy certainly, I don't have time for emergencies
Baby the word and we walk with the covenant
Party and poppin the melody baby, I know that the ladies be lovin it
Brush the dust, enemies way, get 'em a drink, we look too lovely
The spirit is present and never be hesitant
Twista and Bizzy, we gettin this money nucca

Then I'm out, just like the light when the powers gone
And there's another tombstone, the childs putin flowers on
Long live the dream, of making enough cream
Were I won't have to skeem, or roll aroud with the team
And niggas I can't trust, and I mite have to bust
Over something dumb, know where I'm coming from fuck the fuss
It's to much to bare, and everyday is getting worse
Got me plotin on my peeps, and how to get'em first
It's something to make a nigga strive, and {Stay alive}

Bizzy Montana,"Ich seh' durch deine Augen diesen Hass in dir,
Ich seh' wie gern du mich doch abservierst
Und du willst sehen wie ich mich krass blamier' 
Du würdest Lachen wenn jetzt Tränen runter kommen
Und bei schlechten dürft ich diesem Leben nicht entkommen
Und du würdest mich verkaufen
Bin Luft in deinen Augen 
Sag mir bitte wie oft musst ich schon dran glauben
Sag mir wie oft wurd' ich von dir jetzt schon ausgenutzt
Hab dir so oft verziehen trotzdem hast du drauf gespuckt
Du redest ziemlich gern und gern auch über mich
Und geht's mir gut seh' ich wie du meine Flügel brichst
Ich bin dir scheiß egal ich hab's kapiert OK
Du schleppst die Steine an und blockierst mir den Weg
Ja ich interessier' dich Null ich hab nur ärger man
Ich brauch einen echten Freund einen der mich stärkt verdammt
Zeit in diesem dunklen Loch die wirst du verbringen, 
Weil du mir im Leben nie was gutes wünscht

Und ich hoffe dir geht es gut,egal wo du gerad' auch bist
Den Frieden findest du bald,ich merke doch wie es dich fickt
Ich seh' doch wie du dich quälst,ich spüre doch diesen Schmerz
Man tuh' dir sowas nicht an,diese tränen bist du uns wert
Und ich hoffe dir geht es gut, egal wo du gerad' auch bist
Den Frieden findest du bald, ich merke doch wie es dich fickt
Ich seh' doch wie du dich quälst, ich spüre doch diesen Schmerz
Man tuh' dir sowas nicht an, diese tränen bist du uns wert

Ich weiß du siehst es gerne wenn ich am verzweifeln bin
Wenn alles was ich habe einfach geht und ich alleine bin
Auch wenn wir keine Feinde sind Freunde sind wir auch nichts mehr
Ich bin es Leid doch irgendwie gewohnt von dir enttäuscht zu werden
So viel Versprochen doch die Versprechen gebrochen
Unsere Freundschaft ist gebrochen mit den letzten Funken Hoffnung
Heute gehst du blind an mir vorbei ich weil du willst mich leiden sehen,
Weinen sehen,doch ich bleibe stehen und schreib mit meinen tränen
Du suchst nach gründen mich zu hassen ich gewöhnen mich dran
Es fühlt sich an als ob du nur allein mit blicken töten kannst
Und verdammt warum willst du sehen aufgebe,
Hinfalle,liegen bleibe und nie wieder aufstehe
Ich wollte dir nichts böses im Gegensatz zu dir
Mein Schädel platzt wegen dir ich hab es akzeptiert
Und auch wenn mich all der Hass und auch 
Die Wut zerreißt hoffe ich es geht dir gut dabei
         ​                                    ​                         
Und ich hoffe dir geht es gut egal,wo du gerad' auch bist 
Den Frieden findest du bald,ich merke doch wie es dich fickt
Ich seh' doch wie du dich quälst,ich spüre doch diesen Schmerz
Man tuh' dir so was nicht an,diese Tränen bist du uns wert
Und ich hoffe dir geht es gut,egal wo du gerad' auch bist
Den Frieden findest du bald,ich merke doch wie es dich fickt
Ich seh doch wie du dich quälst, ich spüre doch diesen Schmerz
Man tuh' dir sowas nicht an, diese tränen bist du uns wert

Du würdest gerne sehen das ich Fall
Mein Leben lässt dich kalt
Ja und trotzdem wünscht du mir Probleme an den Hals
Du willst sehen das ich zitter, zitter und verlier'
Keine träne sogar wenn ich hinter Gittern mal krepier'
Und diese Kälte werd' ich nie verstehen
Warum willst du mich nur auf der Erde liegen sehen?
Und du trittst mich mit Füßen dein Hass er zerbricht nicht
Ich hoffe es macht dich jetzt Glücklich!

Es macht mich verrückt
Ich weiß du willst jetzt sehen wie ich Untergehe
Und ich nehm' es einfach hin auch wenn ich nicht den Grund verstehe
Warum bist du Grundlos böse,hier liegen nur Scherben rum
Selbst wenn ich sterben würde kämst du nicht zu der Beerdigung
Warum willst du mir nur alles nehmen was mir Freude macht
Ich will es nicht verstehen das ich die Zeit mit dir vergeudet hab
Und heute sag ich hier und jetzt für mich ist es erledigt 
Und ich hoffe nur der Herr ist mit dir gnädig!

Und ich hoffe dir geht es gut,egal wo du gerad' auch bist 
Den Frieden findest du bald,ich merke doch wie es dich fickt
Ich seh' doch wie du dich quälst,ich spüre doch diesen Schmerz
Man tuh' dir sowas nicht an,diese tränen bist du uns wert!
Und ich hoffe dir geht es gut,egal wo du gerad' auch bist

Ich bin am brennen und ein Regen löscht kein'n Waldbrand
Alle sind gegangen, außer das Mädchen aus'm Balkan
Egal ich pack es an in Zeitlupe, langsam
Und klapp' nicht zusammen, wie ein Stadtstraßenfaltplan
Ich hab gemacht, bin nie gestorben beim Versuchen
War lange weg, doch hab noch in den Ohren, was sie rufen
Von Montag bis Sonntag durch Schnee ohne Kufen
La La la Lala
Stunde null, ich bin unterwegs, einwandfrei
Brauchte einen Moment für mich und deshalb hatte ich keine Zeit
Und was sie reden bleibt auf weiteres ne Kleinigkeit
Denn was ich schreibe beißt sich fest B-I-Z Iron Mic

Irgendwie ohne Flügel wieder da oben ich King, ich bin starklar

I wouldn't come back, I tell you no lie

Whenever I'm back, I'm bound to make a link
With the music that used to make me jam and jump

One nation under a groove, so my beat'll never stop

Called my nigga Kurupt, I knew it was boast
They hope a nigga in the music with this bomb
So I prepare load my arms
And wait, cause its the last time

Just to keep from breakin, goin broke
And if you read my diary it'd break your heart
Cause I been losin like a mutherfucka from the start
Excuse me--but that's the only way that I can express
My life feelin like a bunch of bullets racin through my chest
Time after time i felt the feelin that you feel when you lose
Sittin on my stoop cryin blues
Seekin refuge from these hard-time skits
Remembering days when I was literally penniless
And have to watch my people do it alone
I said it was the last time but this time I swear
I'll make it happen if I have to to lose all my hair 
For real

Chorus (x2)

[Steele]

Eyes watch as I make moves
Livin proof that the struggle still continues
Who's out to gain for fame?
Let him not remain vain
Time will tell who fell
And who maintained
Finding my purpose in this life
Cause I ain't sure that we all promised paradise
Precisely I'm just like the seed
Planted in the Earth to bring forth new breed
Shall I proceed to manifest destiny
Surely me and all of my be	 and see
Will find our time on the line of history
Faithfully as G-O-D watchin over we
Created we so I satnd in my God Body
Hardly moved by those crews that try to charge me falsely
It won't be the first time and it won't be the last time 
I'm sure

No more pain
Only good times after this

To be safe up here with you

So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
On their way down

I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
Imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks
When it lands

Will my eyes
Be closed or open?

Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nothing

But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies

I gotta see some loot so all my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'

You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealing

So frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact
With a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked
The switch hitting Queens, niggas liquid sword spitting
With raw poppy, and now your first love is krill
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whip cream before the water runs dry
Niggas flash-dancing yo I don't know why
You're sick of snitching, she got you cruising to the pokey
Like Smokey, the stress be trying to squeeze out a homey
While I be trying to get star status like Shinobi

Slamming against those rocks
When it lands

Be closed or open?

Loves the other

Domestically, I can obey
All of your rules
And still be, be

We wish you, shouldn't fight
Embrace, you tight, let's unite, tonight

I thrive best, hermit style
With a beard, and a pipe
And a parrot on each side
But now I can't do this without you

We wish you, shouldn't fight

And the Empire State

and what ails the state

Your grandson's hand
As he plays with your hair

I've seen the dark
I've seen the brightness in one little spark

And throw little things off
Like car-parts, bottles and cutlery

It's become a habit a way to start the day

Before you wake up
So I can feel happier

Before you wake up
So I can feel happier

I'm back at my cliff still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make on their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
Imagine what my body would sound like
Slammin' against those rocks
And when it lands will my eyes be closed or open?

Giving urban a farewell

I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs

And I don't want to find it again

And be held by ocean's paws

Wanderlust, peel off the layers
Until we get to the core

Did I imagine it would be like this
Was it something like this I wished for
Or will I want more

Lust for comfort
Suffocates the soul
Relentless restlessness
Liberates me (sets me free)

I feel at home

Whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace
Aboard my floating house

Wanderlust, peel off the layers
Until we get to the core

Did I imagine it would be like this
Was it something like this I wished for
Or will I want more

and enjoy every bit of you

Björk,"I once had no fears
None at all
And then when
I had some

To my surprise
I grew to like both
Scared or brave
Without them

The thrill of fear
Thought I'd never admit it
The thrill of fear
Now greatly enjoyed with courage

When I once was
Untouchable
Innocence roared
Still amazes

When I once was
Innocent
It's still here
But in different places

Neurosis
Only
Attaches
Itself to
Fertile
Ground
Where it can flourish

The thrill of fear
Thought I'd never admit it
The thrill of fear
Now greatly enjoyed with courage

When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes

Untouchable
Innocence
It's still here
But in different places

Fear is a powerful drug
Overcome it and
You think that you can do
Anything!

Should I
Save myself
For later
Or generously give?

Fear of
Losing
Energy
Is draining

It locks up your chest
Shuts down the heart
Miserly
And stingy
Let's open up, share!

Björk," get over the sorrow, girl
the world is always going to be made of this
you can trust in it
unless you breath in
bravely

I adore how you simply surrender to high
and your lungs
they're mourning
t-b style

all the stillborn love that could have happened
all the moments you should have embraced
all the moments you should have not locked up

understand
so clearly:

to shut yourself up
would be the hugest crime of them all
hugest crime of them all
you're just crying after all
to not want them humans around any more

get over that sorrow, girl
get over it",Pneumonia [DVD][*],2007
Björk," up-on-the-toe
there is a view
up-on-the-toe
and the spine
straight and erect
hungry and curious
up-on-the-toe
looking forward to

…the air is thinner here…

she came here to lose face
got down on her knees
the beast is back
on 4 legs
set her clock to the moon
raises her spine

vertebrae by vertebrae

up-on-the-toe
looking…

I have been filled with
steam for months, for years
same old cloud
claustrophobic in me

let it burst
like old train sounds
make them leave me, nature

vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae
by vertebrae

! my arms ooze out of my shoulders !
and the arms ooze out of my shoulders

I curl my tail
inwards, inwards
set my clock on the moon

vertebrae by vertebrae

please release
this pressure off me

please release
this pressure off me

please release
this pressure off me",Vertebrae by Vertebrae [DVD][*],2007
Björk," I am leaving this harbour
giving urban a farewell
its habitants seem too keen on God
I cannot stomach their rights and wrong

I have lost my origin
and I don't want to find it again
rather sailing into nature's laws
and be held by ocean's paws

wanderlust!
relentlessly craving wanderlust
peel off the layers
until you get to the core

did I imagine it would be like this
was it something like this I wished for
or will I want more?

lust for comfort
suffocates the soul
this relentless
restlessness
liberates me
sets me free

I feel at home whenever
the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace
aboard my floating house

wanderlust!
relentlessly craving wanderlust
peel off the layers
until you get to the core

did I imagine it would be like this
was it something like this I wished for
or will I want more?

wanderlust!
from island to island
wanderlust!
united in movement
wonderful!
I enjoy it with you

wanderlust!
wanderlust!
can you spot a pattern?

relentlessly restless
restless relentlessly
restless relentlessly

can you spot a pattern?",Wanderlust [DVD][*],2007
