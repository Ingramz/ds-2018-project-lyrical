Catch me at the shop, I will, be, there
And my prices stay low, I keep, it, there
And if you want it raw, I got, it, right, here
And if you want war, I am, your, nightmare
This is all I know, it's bang bang
I hustle and slang slang
My block, I hang hang
Who am I? Lil' Wayne, man
I represent CMB
My sell is ten a ki
I usually get in beef
Was taught that it's him or me
I pop head-bustas quick
I rock here for my brick

My shop here by the vic's
I always, thug in black
And always, bustin' gats

Listen, listen
I give it to 'em how they ask me
Raw and nasty
The AK, I pack it
Believe I'm 'bout that action
Slash a buster like a fraction
I'm on that yolla
Standin' on the corner with one sleeve over my shoulder
Ride on your block, I see a dozen of weak jerks
Now it's time for your momma ta order a dozen of t-shirts
For only half-a brick
I'll blast the fifth
And I ain't gon' stop shootin' 'til I jam tha clip
Yeah, I'm a small creeper, what
But it's about ta get ugly
Y'all better call people up
I'm about ta start shovin' my sawed-off between your guts
Wayne 'bout ta ball people up
Y'all better duck
When it get real, they hide from me
But, all them busters 'bout ta get killed, I'm tired of it

Take a few blunts to tha dome
And, show up alone
Just me and my, flame-torch

Walked with my head down like a stranger, and banged ya
Burnin' off that Hennesy
Some of y'all be feminine
Bounce in with a twitch
Leave 'em crawlin' out a ditch
God damn, son of a shh! Don't speak

You think this shit happened for me over tha night
This is my life
Everybody know I be on tha flight
To get it right, and keep it right, and stay strong
Nigga thought it wouldn't happen to 'em, but all of 'em dead wrong
Singin' tha same song, sayin', ""Juvie ain't shit!""
With a project nigga out here tellin' people he rich.""
When tha truth is:  they wishin' they was in my shoes
I pay dues, with them pistols I made moves
And I'm seein' all these pussy-ass niggas tryin' ta be hard
Why ya fuckin' with mines?  I ain't fuckin' with y'all
Tha people runnin' your organization workin' for me, uh-huh
You didn't know that, now you call for tha plea
Boy, think of all tha places you could possibly be
Then, (?) these bullets (?) is comin' for me
With my T-shirt and Rees on
'cause only God knows what these niggas be's on

Hit a block and ya ride with me (huh?)
Cut 'em all, but not your boy, he just had a baby daughter (so?)
Then, Cita, he never walk again (so?)
Don't play with them shots again (oh)
I make them niggas bleed like that time of tha month
See, I told 'em, ""Nobody move; nobody head bust.""

Niggas respect me 'cause they know my nuts be hangin'and swingin' (Hangin')
If my toes get stepped on, I'm click-clackin' and bangin' (Bangin')
I've been out here since I was, like, ten years old
Caught my first gun charge in nineteen-nine-four
Scuffed my knees up a lot, he pulled me out that

Fresh laid tha track down, I picked tha pad up for a minute
Put tha gat down

You need a nigga that stay sharp, always got money
Pockets stay full of them big-face hundreds
A nigga with tattoos all over his arm
A nigga with a gold grill, diamonds in his charm
A nigga that'll tell your girl, ""Fuck that nigga!""
Your givin' me tha pussy, you don't love that nigga
You need a nigga that'll put you in your place
Put that dick on ya at anytime of tha day
A nigga that'll give ya a lil' somethin' if it's right
A nigga that you may not see for three or four nights
A nigga standin' tall like tha Statue of Liberty
A nigga on fire like a match and a cigarette
A nigga that'll take care of his kids if it's his
A nigga that's a handsome lil' son of a bitch
A nigga like.. me.. never get tired

[Juvenile]
Some old ghetto-face, blue-hair, funny-ass lookin' bitch
Was tryin' ta holla at a nigga... talkin' some bullshit
I told her, ""If ya fuck everybody it's all gravy.""
She didn't say nothin', she stood there lookin' at me crazy
Then she got mad, and called me bitches and motherfuckers
I waited 'til I got by the door, reached back and stuck her
She did what any bitch woulda did, and got the law for me
Talkin' 'bout gonna press charges and get her pa for me
I told him, ""When I get outta jail, I'ma beat ya awfully
and open up fire at your pa to back him up off of me.""
All she wanted to do was scream out ""Juvie""
While I hit her from tha back and smack her on tha booty
Bite tha titties, get tha head, break tha bed
Pull off tha rubber and bust a nut on her leg
Some of these hoes be tellin' me,"" I'm just an admirer.""
I don't want to fuck ya; shit, I got that fire

(Chorus [Juvenile])
Shit, I got that fire

Tell her Tiger Woods... but I won't

What
This.. this here's real, nigga
It's real, nigga
Too real
Pay attention even though I'm young, nigga
Look, look
This one here's on tha up, dog
For all my people with bad luck, dog
Strugglin', tryin' ta make a buck, dog
For all tha peeps who ain't with us, dog
For all my niggas in Angola, stay tough, dog
See, this from shorty on tha real
I'm tired of seein' my niggas gettin' killed
They hustlin' for a mil, nigga, hustle for your bills
If ya think ya need help, holla at me, wodie, I'm trill
If I got it ta spend, then I got it ta kill
But listen, man.. I know ya see tha ice glistenin', man
I know it make you want to go get it bad
But ya gotta think 'fore ya move, partna
'Cause it'll make your ship sink and you will lose, partna
I know you hate ta take it from a young nigga like me
But I betcha can't name one nigga like me
That's why I'm tryin' ta preach, my nigga
And teach, my nigga
If ya don't work ya don't eat, my nigga

(Chorus 2x [Juvenile])
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it

[Juvenile]
Look at ya, you're fuckin' up and I can tell it too
What is ya smokin'? Everything a nigga sellin' you?!
I know you could do better than that, and deserve more
Ya use to be tight with your game back in '84
All tha hoes use ta jock ya
Niggas use ta knock ya
Stay a big shot, motherfucker couldn't stop ya
Then ya went ta runnin' 'round tha project with them junkies
Holes in your shoes, and your body all funky
Lips all ashy, eyes popped out
Spendin' your children check, takin' food out they mouth
And you get mad with me 'cause I don't want to give you ten
I don't support your habit, nigga, y'all grown men
I got kids ta feed, I got bills ta pay
I got people comin' askin' for shit everyday
I can't please everybody, but I love my folks
If I give ya everything, baby, I'ma be broke

(Chorus 2x)

[Turk]
Look... look.. look
Where I stay, times is hard for a lot of my peeps
Some of my rounds doin' bad.. can't even much eat
Everytime I pass through, beggin' me for a dollar
Thinkin' I owe them somethin', don't even want to holla
Nigga who use ta be ballin' ain't ballin' no mo'
I can see they life fadin' away slowly for sure
Niggas who I come up with get me full of that dope
Use ta care about theyself, ain't care no mo'
Niggas want me ta help 'em.. ain't helpin' theyself
You must be out your mind if you ain't helpin' yourself
Ain't no love loss... I just gotta stay my distance
Gotta keep my mind straight.. before I come up missin'
Gotta do my rap thing, and make my paper, mister
Ain't gon' let nobody stop me from gettin' my six figures
Gettin' my shine on, bling-blingin' everyday
If you're not for tha right, stay tha fuck out my way, nigga

(Chorus 2x)

[B.G.]
Everytime I hit tha block, it look like it get worse
Make me wonder if V.L. and Magnolia got a curse
My niggas still my niggas... got love for 'em all
I hate to see that market ride they back and make 'em fall
Somebody tell me, if I didn't have change and I was broke
Would I get tha same attention when I'm in tha next four-door
No, I don't think so, I'll be a equal nigga
On the set, smokin' jo's, beggin' people for scrilla
On the reala... if I could do it, then you could
Lay your hustle down and make your way out the hood
Ain't nobody gon' give no hand-outs, I swear
Ain't nobody gon' pay tha bills in your house, I swear
They don't care, ya gotta stand on your own, my nigga
You ain't no child, look in tha mirror, you're grown, my nigga
Do yourself a favor: leave tha heroin alone, my nigga
And get your hustle on, nigga, get it on, my nigga

(Chorus 4x)

[Juvenile talking]
Man, you could be out here tryin' ta do somethin', man
I mean everytime we come through, man, I do somethin' for my people, man
I give tha little kids a dollar or so, ya know what I'm sayin'
I try ta do things for tha football team
Try ta take care of my people
Try ta show them how ta help theyself

Juvenile,"I put my trust in myself and my 9 first
Y'all niggaz second, third, and fourth because I'm first

My old lady ain't gon' be sendin' me no mail no mo'
While I be askin' my lawyers, ""When they gon' let me go?""
He be tellin' me, ""Just be cool until you go to court""
Get out, back to the bricks, it's the same old shit
Niggaz got 2.50 a piece goin' half on a nick
Back and forth to keys, but the Lil Weezy handle purchase
Popeye's for the ballers, the ghetto eatin' Church's
Shop always open 'cause nobody never closes
Some of 'em like that needle, some play with they noses
I ain't nothin' like a candle light dinner, wine and roses

I gotta do somethin', look

Come upon a superfire lick and get my ass home
Ain't thinkin' about jumpin' out Lex's and Benzes
With the TV's, and the CD's, and 20 inch 'renzes
Look here, my situation ain't the best in the world
I'm a snake like the rest of you niggaz, full of that Guerl
Wodie, c'mon and get your skull cracked, tryin' to erase me

Muthafuckaz try to stay  peep me at my residence 
Chargin' me for homicide  they say it was negligent 
Fuck it  I'ma accept my lick when it come to me 
Now let me see how many of these bitches gon' run for me 
Shit, my breath funky with a migraine headache 
Big pissed off cause I know I made a mistake 
But that's what I get fuckin' with pussy ass niggaz 
And 2 dollar hoes that'll trade you for cash figures 
They did that. but I got a way to get 'em back 
Not with the police though Juve ain't no rat 
Nigga tell me shit I done fallen for the end 
And you woulda had that dick look when you'd caught that 10 

Chorus: Juvenile (2x) 
You gon' take 'em (Five) 
Are you gon' take that shit to trial 
And gon' deny it 
Violate probation when you just got caught, with that ride 
That alibi ain't gon' work 
Ain't it some hotter niggaz from out that 3 be doin' that dirt 

Juvenile: 
All the money in the world can't even move you 
Your lawyers tryin' to fuck you, the judge tryin' to do you 
The district attourney don't give a fuck about y'all 
Cause he gotta run run for office again in the fall 
So everything he cross examine he tryin' to fuck over 
Brothers on his shoulder, tryin' to read his quota 
You wastin' ya time boy when you wastin' they time 
Cause they'll start off with a nickel and try and give you a dime 
You think I'm lyin', go ask my cousin KC 
You think I'm lyin', go ask my cousin Ducky 
Both of my niggaz just cam home from doin' a bit 
Both of my niggaz know what encarceration is 
Lil Daddy, you fightin' a war you can't win

So accept ya lick, you got caught with more than a brick

You be up in penitentiary and don't know what happened 
Law, you're tellin' me you're wanted for murder and kidknappin' 
Short on they information so they lyin' and scrappin' 
You don't want to be in jail that ain't you're place 
When your child graduate you gon' look her in the face 
Tell her lil wodie out there hustlin' somewhere across the nation 
All in the projects, take that probation 
Believe it or not, you be up in the cell block 
Far away from home where you can't eeven sell rocks 
Bitches ain't on your side like up in the bricks 
Cause once you up in the jailhouse they searchin' for that dick 
Sco' no, cho' no, I'm single 
My man up in jail, I can still mingle 
I'm my own woman, fuck who, what, or when 
My man can't whip me, cause he doin' ten

I'ma stay thuggin, how I came is how I leave
When I say somethin, best believe that's how it be
Motherfuckers, too - yeah I said it, nigga, I mean it
Bitch was dressed in gangsta and switch, wodie, I seen it
One of these Juvie-fuckin' hoes gon' get you caught up
Me, I wear ReeBoks and Girbauds, and play it smarter
If them boys in tha ben, they go bluckahda on tha block
I'ma be gettin' somewhere, your ass gonna get shot
You paid 1500... I paid 5999
Got diamonds and Rolexes that shine at tha same time
I ain't scared... but I ain't dumb, and I ain't stupid
I know how ta survive in tha project and how ta do shit
If I hit a hustle I ain't tellin' tha biz
'Cause tha witness will tell them people who tha murderer is
Your main man'll put four or five to your wig
Take tha Coke can and throw you off the side of the bridge
Gotta be able to think, gotta know when to move out
Gotta read through the lines, gotta know what these hoes 'bout
Gotta separate your business from your family and friends
Gotta bust a nigga head if he plottin to do you in
I done did dirt, so I know what's tha consequences
Let my shit burst, tryin' ta knock out a nigga denchures
Always keep cool to see through these fools
Cause we do the shit that people see on the news
So, follow me now into a world of stress
Where wodie tryin' ta get it all 'cause he don't settle for less
Ain't satisfied 'til all of his beef is put to rest
Slangin' that iron... with a soldier rag on his neck
And credit for they people in case they want to connect
He ain't hidin'.. he still ridin'.. in the 'jects
He gotta be willin' to play tha game 'til his death
Nigga bangin'.. hit you in your brain, now who next
I be cool at all times and acknowledge.. when I'm wrong
Shit I went through when tha Feds got my game real small
I'm not tha smartest motherfucker walkin
But I can tell a fake motherfucker when he talkin
My daddy always told me, ""Boy, don't be a follower
You got a lot of pride, but some you need to swallow up
You keep that attitude, you won't see tomorrow, bruh""
I soak it up, and got better as a hustler

[Lil' Turk]
I'm a head buster, a straight up Nolia nigga

Fuck up, I show ya, nigga, that I don't play
Keep a K for protection
With fifty... never run without my weapon
I stand out here, tie ducked with bandanas
I show no fear, what'chu 'bout we can handle
I'm real as they came, a untamed guerrilla
'Bout bustin' your brains, whoever be wit'cha
I have no pics, I split your shit
Whoever you with, I'ma split they shit
Ya steal or get stole, wet or get wet
Bust or get bust on, move a chest or lose a chest
Try not to miss when you cock back and shoot
You shoot and miss, then it's all on you
Ain't no game, it's real dog, live or ya die
Real in tha field, dog, ya live or ya die
Even though I'm a lil' bitty nigga
Look, I got big nuts and they hang low, nigga
I ain't scared ta bust
Want beef, let me know.. and look, we can tear this bitch up
You or me.. me or you.. gon' bite tha dust
Wuz up, nigga
Wuz up, nigga
You afraid, go ta church, I ain't scared at all
Lose your head, fuck with Turk, 'cause I'm knockin' it off
I'ma keep my hands clean, ride for some change
Niggas gon' ride for me, niggas that's untamed
Niggas who bang that heroin, or snort that cocaine
Niggas out that project don't mind sprayin' thangs

Flippin' chickens, and movin' out quick
Hard-hustlin' 'cause we love slingin' this white s***
S.S., Monte Carlo's, hard-tops - we love that s***
'Bout two-hundred thugs with this clique
We multiply everyday for the bulls***
For the hood s***
Burned down buildings ain't no good, slick
N****s pullin' auctions on they own cars to get money quick
Then we dippin' and dabbin'
Goin' back to the labbin'
Lil' n****s payin' me for cookin' they slabbin'
Cook a brick and make it out a brick-and-halfin'
Chargin' them young g's ten G's for cookin' they slabs
Say, lil' wodie, I gots to have it

On the streets it ain't sweet
They be
It's not a game, homeboy - this ain't the NFL
Him just from rippin' with the mid-deck twelve
Hit the block in twin-SL's, and spit at gals
You get that, pal?
Once it's war, n****, skip town
'Cause if I don't do it, be swimmin' with fish, clown
Now, crack a whole chick down, sell it in quarters
If the drama happen to hit town, I'm 'nappin' your daughter
If the broad try to flip out, I'm cuttin' her water
If your boys try to help out, I'm killin' they fathers
When and wherever
What and however - you bring it good
I'll have your mom singin' ""Hmmm hmm hmmm""
Cause nowadays lot of n****s got coward ways
So I ride with K's to knock off the side of heads
But I'm tryin' to stay man, I'm tryin' to stay focused
What I'm tryin' to say we gon' bust it wide open!

How the f*** you gonna help me when I don't care?
N****s see me front it all - they just look and stare
And talk about how it should be and how it could be
Bentley in my basement - ain't nobody understood me
Take care of your people like you take care of your kids
'Cause money ain't s*** when you don't know how to live
And n****s gon' pretend to be your friend when they ain't
You expect 'em to be there until the end, but they can't
Now, how many of you can say you're a real n****?
Play the Prowler, but scared to go in the field with ya
You gon' know your n**** - he gon' be there, still with ya
Whether if it's talkin' or slingin' the steal with ya
Don't answer nobody questions
Gotta turn to the Lord with a confession

It's a fresh package I got - why not move it
Keepin' it in the house 'll have the Feds locked to it

We want the whole cake, n**** - we don't want no crums
Stupid s*** - we avoid it
Dope - we exploit it
Had our s*** tight b****es done destroyed it
Now n****s gettin' out lookin' for employers
Made a deal with the D.A. and the lawyer
Swearin' he would never tell - put it on his daughter
Sayin' he was outta town - n**** crossed the border
Should've bust his head, but I don't need the heat
I'll send another n**** out to handle beef for me
It's a test 'cause I've been given him a ki a week
Let me see what they gon' do up on the streets for me
And if he hand me his business, I'ma make sure he's straight

Started out with a seven-gram quarter, flipped to half-a-ounce
Tryin' to keep clothes on my daughter and food in her mouth
It don't stop from sun-up to sun-down - I'm on the grind
In two weeks I was workin' a 16-25
Tryin' to get it - only thing in my vision is ballin'
Jumpin' out a 500-S cla** on brodders
So you only had a nickel like me hustlin' hard
'Fore I knew I was workin' four ounces and two quarters
Not a taker I'm scarred from
Swore he was gon' front just bringin' his s***
Now I got a quarter ki - broke it down to six and two quarters
It's cooked already - I got these n****s runnin' like water
Slowly, I'm comin' up - scorin' a ounce since fronted nine
Had this n**** - only said what they workin', the block is mine
Got hustlin' skills in my blood - come from my pa
That's how I know the game 'cause at a young age I was taught

Because this the first time you ever heard some shit like this nigga
I'm tellin you this shit so off the fucking hook bro
Ya'll man look, check this shit out

Mystikal and Juvenile nigga
Say juvey they don't believe you did the beat bro
What you mean nigga, fuckin' right I did this beat
I tried to tell them niggaz bro

I come with my own look, my own sound, my own style
Who the fuck you think drawed this crowd
It's the ripper, the clean up hitter
You bitter intimidating young long dick nigga
Now suck it, now suck it, while you around here playa hating
Your woman around here screaming fuck me, fuck me
Tell me something, don't I put down on my albums
Motherfucka nobody ever told you I was hard as a NFL helmet

I write 'em, land 'em, plant 'em, bam nigga can't stand 'em
On top, on sight, heads up, bust 'em at random
I got the vest out, put the braids back, put on the bandana
Signed a brand new contract, shot the video in Atlanta
Don't pull me, can't hold me the beat don't move me
You know smokin', drinkin' whenever I kick it with Juvey
Back on my own, back on my zone, feelin' better, lookin' better
Bout to go get it and bring it back home

A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home

You better cancel that shit, about you run this here
I ain't seen you on the charts what you done this year
Y'all thought ""Project English"" was the last of this shit
When I was really only given y'all half of this shit
Fuckin' right I made the beat and I wrote this rap
But a niggaz in the ghetto want to post the crack
Got two niggaz posted watching a bus with macks
Just waiting on the police and niggaz to jack

To people across the nation, thanks for being patient
Ya'll been itching for some G-shit huh, I know you waiting
When you cop the CD, get some herb and ride
Turn the bitch up real loud so you can feel my vibe
I got a long way to go, I'm just gettin' started
I'm 26 years old and I'm still retarded
I ain't talking about handicapped, I'm talking about the way
I talk and express my rap, you feelin' that

A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score

Anytime you say my name make sure it's some good shit
Look I'm not your eldest rapper, I stay on some hood shit
Am I hatin' on cash money, now stop playin'
I respect it how it came, now I got game
I'm all about U.T.P. family and kids
And takin' care of business it the way that we live
I don't need a record deal just give me my props
How many muthafuckas you know keepin' it hot

Believe it or not, keepin' my spot locked
I got more season than the seafood out the gumbo pot
Now run your mouth and lose your slot
I make 'em feed for me like junk is fever one more rock
Ain't this some shit I'm famous and rich
I got bitches I ain't even fucked claiming my dick
If that's how it is, I guess we gone see
Is this all about that big truck and U.T.P

A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
'Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home

There she go there she go with them g's and strings

Crashin' up in ya joint and knockin' the lights out
Feelin' lovely, trust me, I'm drug free
Only chewed on bringing out the thug in me
'cause you sittin' on my nerves, when we've already heard
That garbage, played-out crap you call rap
Some chicks say they love that, well I'm above that
Calling me a ? ? ? it's two, double O two
And my crew roll thick like BIG
Act up, and be puttin' that ass to sleep
You got nothing for me, been there, smelt the dope and

Watch it change 'cause, nah nigga, we ain't in the same gang
We walk different and we talk a different slang
You a sidekick, and I'm a four point six range
You a one roof flat, I'm fifty acres of land
In Jamaica with your man laid up, gettin' a tan
Thought you knew, I'm overdue
And you're overrated so cats are over you
I inspired you, come on now, no way
? that rumour, the consumer won't believe it anyway
Never play with the messenger, Head on Joan of Arc
When I'm coming through these parts like just cut the dark
I'm a trendsetter, go getter, bringer back
'cause I'm fed up, ready to get a set up
Oh you scurred, vision blurred
'cause I serve these words
And pitch them bitches with a curse

Niggas in the hood call me Lyte
But brothers call me Lana Moorer the high scorer
Play fool if you want to, we closin' after quarter
I started it and I shut the shit down
Sit down, don't nobody move, I'm making haters quit now
Been a long time coming but I'm running with the torch
Race, got a lot a rats but I can't be caught, or bought
'cause I won't sell out, that's why me and the big dogs, we fell out
Not with a major, but I'm still major league
Crash ya dome with this ? then watch your nose bleed
You want it, you can get it anytime
'cause I got many lines for niggas of any kind, you know me

Hand chose bithces a la mode, gettin' sold
Plus a load of killer, as Chronic gettin' blowed

Keep it froze, tucked up in a Tupperware bowl
Stick of gold, somethin' from the school of the old
Forever flows, I take it down as deep as it can go
Burn rolls, braids tight, blazed afros

I guess the same shit went on in the eighties they still crazy
I'm with it too kind of sneaky know how to get at you
Not trying to have momma crying and miserable
I already know what guns can do
I done seen some of the worst niggas get blown in two
Come on

[Chorus 2x Juvenile and Skip]
Ay yo we down south posted and we counting our figures (Skip says: Ha)

Long as I don't bring no diseases or no ho's back home

Let me roam, you don't even much need that phone
I'ma take care of my shit, baby, ,just leave that alone

'Cept them three twenty's that Slim had, Slim!
See I'm cut broke, in a skit mask

Well, then lose the number, do me a favor

You still want to ex me or try to disrespect me
Now them ho's in your ear, got you trippin' wanna test me
Look, meet me on Freret Street, right where my set be
Go home, pack all your shit and drop off them Vette keys

I'm not asthmatic I'm healthy and I could fuck
That teenage pussy I don't want so zip it up
And no satchatories having in here so catch a cut
Ohh how I love it when half your ass show
And you catch the side view it look like two elbows
And my dick stuck to my leg like velcro
Stop blocking and let them females go

It look like you got a loaf of bread in your pocket
Should have followed you first ma and snatch you first
But when I'm drinking everyboady look like they got worth
I don't need to tell a woman what I'm worth
She gonna show me some affection when I raise my shirt
I ain't never bought a woman where I do my dirt
To a nice confined spot where I can lift that skirt
Hopefully she illegal with the head and all
Probably heard of my background and said I'm a dog
But I ain't about me baby it's about y'all
My fantasy is knocking four of y'all off

We be popping exctasy looking for woman to hug

So don't be telling me nothing about no babies
You trying to give me a charge you must be crazy

I don't know why you making people think I got you swell
You better quit it before one of my bitches pop you hoe
I know your baby daddy he ain't got no flow
You may be into playing games but its gone stop here though
You want more than a fuck, you just trying to tie a nigga up
Like my last bitch, I blew a lot of money on her
I met her, fast pace, lil mama hard for me to slow down
Why the sad face after the results come around?
You want a nigga to play daddy? Should have asked me
I would have gladly told you that I have me
When you met me you told me you wanted a gangsta to hit
Without the wisdom of knowing I'm off the chain with this shit
Now your feelings done got involved and you ain't glad with a fuck
And you wonder why all the players keep on passing you up
Look Juve ain't going through that old Billie Jean shit
I ain't gone let you put your babies on me I mean this

You got a fat ass, your chest right, and you dress right

But I'm in the playoffs, you be scheming all day, hoe take a day off
Find another target this one you need to stay off
Your looking for a reputation ? I'ma give ya one
Don't be trying to give me a charge ? nothing a nigga done
As far as I'm concerned that baby can be for anyone
Not til you entered the party there wasn't any fun
It's not me it's the attention I draw
To make these bitches fill out paper work and lie to the law
It's obvious she want to ride in the driver's seat of my car
Taking the lotteries to get some properties from a star
Look Juve ain't going for that old Billie Jean shit
I ain't gone late you put your babies on me I mean this

They be like look at his lips, look at her eyes and her ears
Mama said ""If I don't approve it, the baby not his""
She said she not gone keep all that (?) with kids
Keep playing mama said she saw 380 ya did
I saw the grin on your face the moment I saw you in court
Wish I would have saw your face when the test was exposed
This ain't your first time you done did before
Your not even gonna have a vagina no more
You're making accusations you ain't sure bout
You had a chance to be a queen but still you chose to whore out
Don't even speak you ain't no friend cause you an enemy now
Niggaz knowing you ain't the hoe you pretend to me now
You done caught a maybe-baby, move you're whoring and drama
You needs to try to focus on your daughter lil mama
Look cause Juve ain't going for that old Billie Jean shit
I ain't gone let you put your babies on me I mean this

and I heard my name was poppin up in some shit too

couldn't tell me shit when I was hungry and thirs-ty

I guess it's punishment to who and never was worthy

And advise for that viewer discretion
On a scale to 1 to 10 I get 11

When you seek you find, since I left you
Can't seem to get you off of my mind
I paid the cost, now it appears I've lost the melody
Got monumental makin' up to do with you, baby

Made some mistakes, caused some heartbreak
You must be fed up, I didn't mean it
When I was screamin', that I'd had enough
An' all the time that's passed from then to now
I can't get it right, baby girl, I need to see you tonight

'Cause I miss you, want you, need you back in my life
Got to get back to them days, when you were mine
I'll do whatever I gotta do, to make you see
I can't live without you, girl, come back to me
Come back to me

Told you so many lies, just to feed my selfishness and greed
Through all the fanfare what was out there, wasn't what I need
Found an old photograph brought back all the memories
Wasted so much time without you, my baby

I beep you, try to reach you, head over to your place
I get over, someone else's Rover is parked up in my space
What have I done, I might have lost the one, I might be too late
Every time I get the machine, I say, I say

I miss you, want you, need you back in my life
Got to get back to them days, when you were mine
I'll do whatever I gotta do, to make you see
I can't live without you girl, come back to me

Oh, I know there's still a place for me in your heart
And oh, every moment I spend without you, girl, is tearing me apart
I know that this ain't the way that it was meant to be
Baby, please forgive me, girl, come on back

Or at least where it was they notice the tire tracks now they flat
So I learned to be polite move over please

And my past ain't got nothing to do with me hitting that ass
Ma I'm tweaking, I'm from a different world
Where you don't tie a woman down if she want to look around go head and get it girl

A gangsta so I'm raw with it I know what I'm doing
Thats why she pop up at my residence trying to see what I'm doing

'cause you cold with that shit that you do...ya mood shocked me
Unlike these other hoes in ya crew you don't jock me
I'd like to get ya phone number just to see what you about
Call you for breakfast to get you out
And see if you just some eyes without a face
Let me see ya crib - take me to ya place
I wanna show you that it's mo'to me then fuckin on my mind
'cause in yo mind I bet you fuckin all the time
Come to find you only out tryin to go to school
And tryna go to school and pay bills is hard to do
I see you fool so go on and do ya thing
But when you tired of showin ya titties give me a ring
I like a woman gettin hers cause that's better
Then her tryna come up off mine I can't let her

Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

Give me some assistance as I manuver my long stroke
I hope you don't think I'm payin'for it that's the wrong hope

And to get ran through until you get carpet burns off the rug
And to get nutted on by nine niggaz with diamond grills and guns
And how you got on my microphone and sung a sixteen
Ya performance deserves a grammy check out my big screen
Most bitches don't know but you know what suckin a dick mean
Yeah the head was fed but what up with that in them jeans
I can see the pussy (?)lookin like a big bee
Make ya cycle start early my shovel be diggin deep
I don't wanna relationship, I just want me some relations
Go on and let a nigga poke hoe, and stop shuckin with my patience

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 3 - Pimp C]
Bitch get down on me at the drop of a dime
Fuck all that are & be singin shit I ain't got the time
I'd rather bust yo'ass up with some screwed and chopped
Let me test ya jaws and let me stretch out ya cotton
I'm still Pimp see bitch, the name ain't changed
Puttin stick up in these hoes don't remember they name
'cause we tired of playin games with them booty lickers
'cause we jumped up in ya life, cause I'm a true dirt digger
So go on hit the streets, break them lame tricks
Then bring it back to daddy that's how you can get this dick
I need the cash first - and the ass last
And we can blow dro in the Benz while I smash on the gas
So let a nigga pimp, and let a nigga mack
And later on tonight you can get hit up in ya back...and get ya money back
But when I make ya pussy skeet bitch you gon'buy me a 'Lac

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 4 - Juvenile]
I ain't tryna talk a hole in yo head
But I can tell you didn't excel what them hoes done said
Starrin at my neck and my wrist 'cause my shit is frozen red
And I look like a easy hustler so go ahead
Ya leavin the same way ya met me
You gon'be grievin if you sex me, while I'm schemin on the next piece
I'll poke ya cookie I don't give a fuck who know this
Who up in the area that aknowledge what a hoe is
All my warriors is lovin my rep
How I took it to the world from the project steps
Playin touch with my broad like my children
And it ain't like back in the days when we ducked behind buildings
I be a threat to tell a broad what I'm feeling
Especially if she poor and she need to be gettin no bullshittin
She ever fix her mouth for some money it's good with me
I ain't the one what you need is a stool pigeon

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 5 - Petey Pablo]
If you think I'm a treat a bitch with high price drawls
Any differance then the way I treat the grandma's on
How many ways is there to say that you terribly wrong
Would you understand me better if I just said ""naw""
Fuck what another motherfucker told y'all
That's tipical talk when they dick hard
They just wanna little pussy mama that's all
It's like fourth down, two yards fuck it they goin for it
How am I payin'for it?, and how much you charge for it?
It ain't about being a whore that's what it's made for
Get ya paper baby fuck what the world say
Get ya bills paid....okay!

[Chorus - Bun be Sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke

Could get one of these hoes that's gotta stand, by the right bar
Get the wife and she could [Incomprehensible] light stars

She ain't stupid, she recognize who it is
Enjoy the lyrics on the records, play the songs for the kids
For instance, I can come through bouncin' in this bitch like what
And she's figured this shit, she ready to give that life up

Wonderin' how do it feel to be with G's like us

They're not about the camouflage, the homies that I ride with
I keeps it ghetto for my street people and convicts
I don't vouch for nobody, I just make sure I pay homage

Hey shorty, this nigga here's a vet like Shaq
I don't have to control the ball but I control that rap
If I smack you on your ass you gonna throw that back
They like it when a gangster take control like that

Tell us who they really is and give y'all different names

Claimin', she ain't nuttin' like them boys be sayin'

I had a little drama, I was bout that there
That's how a nigga kept his name in the wind (""Do it!"")
I'm from the projects, as in the 3rd Ward

I ain't even gotta tell 'em nothin' to give 'em the word
Put bosses on injured reserve, fuck losses
Put your sister brother mammy and your pa on the curb
I can make an ounce out of a quarter of a bird
Introduce you to the killers, all my dogs in the 3rd
Know that, this ain't the spot to sco' at
Cause you don't know if nigga really got a package or he's scopin' to jack
If they get'cha won't nobody rat
These families been here for years with kids and they not about to demolish that
We got ? and a lot of crack

'Fore I ignore it, my name be in all type of shit
Trippin' over my car, and I don't even like the bitch

If you dyke, bring your crew if you like
If any, um, booty is like, your booty is like
Call your whole crew booty delight, we make it 'Nolia Clap'

Don't hold it back, touch the flo' with that
I got a heart attack, your booty causin' cataract
I can't even stay on it, look I keep on fallin' back
My momma always told me Skip don't ever fall for that

She got a loose booty, she got a loose booty
Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty

Whole hood payin' attention to me showin'

I sold my whole thang 'cause my dude and them pulled up

They talkin' about a nigga like a hurricane forecast
Boy kinda ignorant but he could move the fast
To hell with the talkin', we could go do it
The package right here, let's roll through it

I'm down South bred, that's what my mamma and my daddy say
Acts like New York and smoke the Cali way
Gutter, I hustled the corner, cuts and alleyways
Word mean nothin' to me, I'm goin' that-a-way

I got a dynasty and I ain't throwin' that away
I've been investin' my rhyme up on my strategy
And I don't feel that it's time to put the strap away
It's either that or just I'm full of that Alizae

These you, T, P, we rock like that
We rock like that 'cause we rock like that
These Magnolia, we rock like that

You can get it quick to your head, homeboy

You can get it quick to your head, lil' mama
I don't think you wanna fuck with me

I don't cut no corners to jip for no figures
I ain't kissin' no ass to live with no nigga
I don't need this rap, bitch I'm in these streets
When Cash Money didn't pay me, I still got sleep

Get capped, you're on the phone, tell her I need the teeth
To set the nigga up to get his Jesus piece
She used to run it with Nate Dean, now she's a beast
Got her daughter sellin' for a 'G' at least

I move a lil' work, ain't nothin' to brag on
Somethin' to keep me nice and my homie to tag on
Twenty-four inch shoes on the rag on
I got poppin' in my hood and I'm that strong

Fiends keep smokin', please don't quit
You want another ?, Fiend on this
But watch it, the gun is under the shirt now
Me lead love and me will keep sendin' the work down

You can get it quick to your head, lil' mama

Keep it trill, keep it gangsta, pimpin' keep it hundred
Before a nigga be done got killed
And I'm the one who done it
I'm in H-Town baby, the home of the hoe sale
Where niggaz don't just give you a brick
They give you the whole deal

Drug deals goin' down at ten dollar motels
Keep it on the down-low
'Cause somebody might go tell
Like it, get you what you need, just have yo' mail
And send your people 'round here
So I can get some more sale

Know that I got more yayo that most niggaz goin'
I'm gettin' it from the same bringin' all the in
I'm 'bout to get it dropped off, I'ma let you know when
(Shit, I'm tryin' to spend like fifty wit ya, dog)
Shit, fo' sho' then

Bring your money with you, counted and wrapped up
And move like you 'sposed to be movin' because we strapped up
Don't get yourself clapped up for no reason
'Cause we won't hesitate
When it come down to the squeezin'

But then you woke up and realized he was takin' your shine
And you're mad at the whole world and they don't owe you a dime
Some of these niggaz don't be gangstas when they 'sposed to be gangstas
You know he owe you money and you're scared of him, ain't ya?

I couldn't call you when my bills wasn't paid

And also, he only rides in the year that he's in

You can catch me in that dro, boy that money green thang
Get a fish and shrimp po', boy, and go sit on St. James

Too Hood 2 Be Hollywood (Bust something, shoot something)
One of the realest niggas that ever done it, right chyea, live and in living color
(get em)

[Verse 1: B.G.]
It's like B. Gizzle, the world wide ghetto pass
I'm reppin nigga, take a flight to the motherland
I fear God only, never fear another man
It's never one hustle, I always got a backup plan
It ain't no secret I can tell ya bout the gutta man
I'm a write a book on how to come out the struggle man
Now come through, you know what's in them dufflebags
A lot of gats, a lot of cash, and some ski masks
You know my street pass, it been certified
Stop lying I'm a g you been heard about
Stop repping, you a pussy I been heard of you
You playin with a gangsta homie the nerve of you
Oh you lookin for me, but the homie lookin for you
Have yo people wearing a rest in peace shirt of you
My reputation on the block been A-1
I'm the same N.O. nigga I been since day

[Chorus: Lil Wayne (Trey Songz)]
I said bust somethin, shoot somethin
You just talking I know you ain't gon do nothin
Pussy nigga (ya heard me?)
If you got something to lose, you gon lose something unless you do something
So (ya heard me?)
Gotta use what you've learned, in order to receive what you've earned
Make sure (ya heard me)
Real niggas do real things so recognize real niggas in the game
I know you heard me
You say (ya heard me), I say (ya heard me), He say (ya heard me),
I know you heard me, she say (ya heard me), everybody like it when I say (ya heard me)

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
You got a lot of nerve
They talkin alot. I heard
Only round yo homies, when I'm round you know, not a word
I'm a heathen who fight for what he believes in, and I don't have no plans on leaving till I get even
Salt and pepper, nigga I'm seasoned for any reason
The day you want something with Juve, come on and see him
My G ain't gon allow me to lose, I'm busting shots as soon as you make a move
Oooh, I'm not a fan of fools that's why I got attitude
Runnin your mouth to me, I'm a try to get at a dude
Don't even have a tool, what is you tryna prove
Gon head and choose ya [? ], cause I'm a shoot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
N.O. on my fitted, I'm committed to my city
Anything I will commit it just to show that I'm committed
Commit it then get acquitted
Aye Gizzle let me get em, Gizzle let me get em
Eat em up and shit em (ha)
And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed... achoo
I came to get me and I got you
And I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married you could'nt do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble...

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And pouring gas too, if there evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'm a get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it

Got so many, all my real niggaz under the gutter

I tend to brush my teeth with Windex, just so the glass house mouth shine clear
I got mo' karats invested with soup, I'm a Texas icon a People's Champ
Put on your shades when I commits to approach, my mouth is eliminating like a lamp

My gear clean, from my ear rings to my pinky ring
If you ain't spend thirty, tuck in your piece and chain (Southside)

I got the diamonds in my mouth

Blucka-blucka-blucka, that's how my gun go
If I'm looking agitated, bitch you better run hoe
I use to do the baguettes, but now I'm VS-1's though
Princess cuts straight up and down, Johnny done those
I got loud ice, just like Paul Wall
Shining down South, brighter than all y'all
When it's time to get your jewelry done who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out
On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp
Even with a suspended license, still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get
Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip
Ride with a Revolve', I don't fuck with clips
These roach ass niggaz, trying to make me bust my chips
But I'm not a bank, I don't even trust my bitch
I'm from the South, and I got diamonds in my mouth

From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Juvenile Committee,"Here's the situation for brothers in the ghetto
Livin' in the projects it's hard to get ahead, so
What you gotta do is be down with each other
Other fools tryin' to trip, can't trip on each other
Like a lobster in his bucket, you try to escape
You steal, you kill, you rob, you take
Clownin' on your brothers' back, one thing is a fact
They're gonna be sure to push ya back in the pack
You want to do a lick cause you short, you float
If you had to blast will you pop or will you tote?
187 on the head, you killed a man
You're all fired up, so you feel you in command
Try to be the baddest in the crew
Why trip on a brother that's down with you?
And now I understand why you could do so
'Cause you probably wasn't down from the get-go

Some people they got homeboys like I do
Like Stevie, Jay, Rock and the rest of the crew
Yo, we chill with each other and we kill with another
And we never ever keep anything undercover
'Cause if we do, we have to keep it in a circle
You're soft as a nerd, so don't be trippin' on the turf, yo
This is what they say: Cause he was with us on that day
First he was chillin' with his nine and A.K.
The cold thing about it, we didn't see it comin'
It's cold stunnin'
First we were hangin', now it's cold gunnin'
What happened to the do-or-die situation
Was it a complication or the conversation?
In the midst with a mixed personality
Po-po brutality, flipside mentality
To make you the weak link in your crew
You're trippin' off yourself, you wanted all the juice

You can't faze me, cause I live my lifestyle crazy
Boys in the hood wonder why I got lazy
'Cause no respect and no money don't mix
I like havin' kicks, so I hustle on the rich
I bought a gat from a neighborhood street thug
A .44 mag full of .44 slugs
Now it's time for robbin' niggas' hoes
Kickin' in do's, and leavin' prints on .44s
Confused is the way I live
It's my prerogative, cause I don't want to give
To the people, cause I was treated like a sequel
Never treated equal, now I live illegal
Doin' the things that you shouldn't do
But you didn't know what I had to go through
Like trippin' on the homeboys in my crew
I wanted all the juice

Brothers in this world it's so hard to be good
To live life like it's legal and work like you should
First it seem right, until one night
It don't seem right, you don't see the light
Start feelin' like the whole world dissed you
Pop a big gun, and doin' self-defense too
See, that's the prob', you learn how to rob
Take it back to back, as if it was a job
Teach your boys the game, the game is what it's like
But that'll move the crew, and somethin' ain't right
Your boys ain't with you, your boys want to fight
Bustin' all the bones, you try to get a stripe
Front on everybody cause you're headstrong
What you're doin' ain't right, it's dead wrong
Flip-flip-flip it on the flipside
You done flipped up, committed suicide

Juice is a five-letter word of corruption
From town to town it can start an explosion
So what we gotta do is play like a lemon
Squeeze out the juice and peace among men and women
'Cause envy and jealous' can ruin the land
But brothers tryin' to play God, and they job 
Is keepin' the world in their hands
But that's a mission that's impossible
It'll only end up being a lotta people in the hospital
Brothers killin' and killin'
Hurtin' feelings, that's illin'
To be on top they was willin'
But they ain't nothin' but illin'
Attitude that's rude, be cool instead
Because the black guys are in jail, or either they're dead
Your grave site is waitin' for you
Because you don't think about the things that you do
All the screws in your head must be loose
Because you did ill to kill
You wanted all the juice",Flipside,1991

Dealer got the coke for all the snorters and the shooters
If I say they online, I ain't talkin' 'bout computers
D.E.C. Eastside hoe we back on the grind
If I'm in the trap I like to pack a mack or a 9
In '94 I'm sellin' bass, in a place called spanish trace
In a second you can vanish, dead and gon' without a trace
I caught my first case, for boomin' out the back of south deca'
Man I wouldn't be caught there without a Z atleast a half
Shit I had to be fresh, they had the T's on friday night's
And if the car ain't got no shoes, I can't say I'm ridin' right
I had this trick, out in Eastwick, who turn tricks and suck dick
And when I went to see her, I would always have a full clip
Scottdale bitch, one been through some rappin' lands
Mr. Coug' a damn shame, call the twins from jagged edge
And I will rep the D.E.C., til' it ain't no breath in me
Whether Glenwood, Rainbow, Flexo's or Macavee see...

Yeah, I talk that dope slang folk, rock and dust
Treat my hoes like my pistols, cock and bust
You better study hip-hop, if you think someone else
Could spit the game so trill and get they shit off the shelf
Niggaz think they so fire, well I'ma full alarm blaze
Set ya braids on fire, til' they burn to a fade
This that eastside shit dog, let it be known
And our hands in all the car folk, nothin' but chrome
It's all stuntin' in the Dec. dog that's rule number one
Ya see more niggaz touchin' rims then a game of 21
And I'm so slum with it, my roots are do' deep
I'm so street if I get shot I'd probably bleed concrete
Take a second, swallow what you heard
Try to understand while they follow every word
While they put me on a pedastile and worship what I say
I-Dub out that eastside and this is how we pray, say ugnhh!

[Chorus]
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur
I'm so Decatur

I-Double, I'm straight out the Dec., no one is better
Niggaz claim I changed my style, but I only changed the letters
From BMX to BMW, AK's to MP's
.OZ's to ASCAP, the BUS to SUV's
Bitch please, I'm from Atlanta where we brawl and we fight
When you ever heard me rhyme and it was only aiight
I ain't shit, but I'am the shit, you do the math
This ain't a clip, it's a full clip, move or get blast
The only one that could be king, cause I do it for real
Don't believe me we can hit the deck and do it for real
Pretty thugstyle, got these bitches kissin' us off
Fake rappers sound like bad blaoww's, pissin' me off
Infamous, I'ma icon, ain't no endin' me
Call Chaka all you want, and you still won't be D.T.P.

A thousand voices call her name
She turns the lights on
To blind the pain

She runs out the door calling
She leaves the TV on

She lights a candle
Shadows dancing on the wall
Will there be moonlight
When darkness falls

Beautiful lies, Beautiful lies
Will she survive
As angels cry, As angels cry
Are you there, Are you there
She's all alone
Without a prayer, Without a prayer

She runs out the door calling
She leaves the TV on

Fading into pale
Listening as twilight
Turns to day

Why do her memories last a moment (and then they're gone)
She writes an ending but it's all wrong
Why does her heart feel so alone
Why does her song seem so hollow

A veces no te encuentro y me desespero 
Por que siento que si no estas a mi 
Lado me muero 

Ya no llores mas 
Por un amor que mal 
Te dejo llorando y sufriendo 
El amor se va otro llegara 
Gota que baja va subiendo 
Y no pasaras mas la vida 
Solita sola llorando 
Yo te hare feliz 
Quedate a mi lado 

Te regalo amores 
Dentro de tu vientre 
Pinta'o de colores 
Dame lo que sientes 
Pa' que no llores 
Tengo amor sincero 
Amor del bueno 
Para llevarte lejos de los dolores 
Pintar en tu vientre 
Un rio de amores 
Dame lo que sientes 
Pa' que no llores 
Tengo amor sincero 
Amor del bueno
Solo para ti

Tonight is where it will be,
In this desolate place, we all stand and wait,

JX,"I've been thinking in between breaks from drinking
About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

CHORUS

We could fake the world out (x3)

Rubbing up all over mine. 
That is when I know 
I got a tendoreli 
More then a homie 
When the lights go down 
You are all up on me damn,
Now I gotta show you mamma 
Toching places you wanna 
So hot like Arizona 
In wada California 
Cause you are ma tendoreni 
That I been tryin'to find 
Tell me your fantasies 
And all your secrets on you're mind 
Lets roll on a hotel suit 
Laundry and your pretty feet 
Look so good that I wanna eat 
I think you're twisting me 
And I know you love this place 
So goo like birthday cake 
Lets put it down like Bobby Brown 
And ma man Baby Face

Use to a time 
When I skipped the game 
Always got a girl fora different date 
Its funny how life takes a sudden change 
Cause then I all pimp up on ma brain 
Got one girl that makes me hold all of the other girls are at the front door 
Was one to be grown 
But I will sit back and drop slow 
Got a lot of money you know that 
So let me keep you like a polar cat 
Get a Gucci bag to match 
And then get the shows to go with that 
I love it when you walk down representing

Jyongri,"扉はいくつもある
このまま閉じ込められてるだけじゃなく動き出そう

見慣れた自分がいる
同じ歌を繰り返すだけの日々をここで忘れてみたい
 
でも急に立ち上がれる程の力も自信もないだろう
Just not alone一人じゃ出来ない事もあるから
私もまだ その一歩が 踏み出せなくて…

We'll start today so no one can beat us
どこまでも キミが思うほうへ
Don't know where we'll stop
目の前の試練を越えると 未来が私達を待ってるはず

キミの物語を 世界中に伝えていくためにも
一緒に続きを刻もう
 
今までの数々の道のりは
何にもつながっていなくても
これからは同じ日々の中で探そう
お互いが 更に輝く ためのヒントを

I'll go your way cause you are the answer
今すべてが 見えてくる予感
I know where to start
そばにいてくれる一人を 喜ばせる事から始めたい

Is I can't make it on my own
I will never last that long
I need a place to hide
Need a place to hide

Every ounce of hope is gone

Jøe,"When you get caught in the rain with no where to run
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes and you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, what you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And if you keep falling down don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
What you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And when the rain blows, as shadows grow close don't be afraid
There's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you you'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And stand up once again
And I live one more day

Jørgen Ingmann,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain

Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand

 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

And you are entitled to know
You have brought nothing else but bliss, a great deal of frustration, a voluntary occupation
Driving me insane and off the wall 
And we were free to choose each other
But now it seems like something other
So have you placed me where I stand?
We turned caring like a mother, afraid to lose each other
It got us this far
Now problems are:
I have no bags to pack, no suitcase waiting in the hall
You have no make-up, no stockings in my drawer
Oh, how did we forget? How could we forget?
It's easy to learn if you never regret
When you live in paranoia and you know she's got you, oh yeah
You can't leave until you know the truth
So for months you're going nowhere 
Until you seize the day and place yourself behind the steering wheel 
Or you could end like you don't want to, the opposite of what you planned to:
You can watch the ships when they're abroad
Become a joke when people see you, cause it's enough to please you
You got this far, step put of the car 
I have no bags to pack, no suitcase waiting in the hall
You have no make-up, no stockings in my drawer
Oh, how did we forget? How could we forget?
It's easy to learn if you never regret
We'll never learn in the future, this is it, seemingly I am sure
I know we haven't been together now
It wasn't meant to be this way so we'll give it days and days and we'll try to make it easy now

K Koke,"I’ve been living this daily
With no peace
No day dreams to save me
Get high cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time

I’ve been living this daily
With no peace
No day dreams to save me
Get high cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time

Born May, 1985
Ten months later my little bro arrived
Raised in a place where is due to survive
My Mummy shot food to put honey in our hive
I could see the hunger in her eyes
I could see that sut'n wasn’t right
She taught me how to wrap and shot my first ticket
She told me watch my back and be smart with it
And I wish that I could take you there
To a place that my brain takes me every day
I could smile but it still won’t take the pain away
I could try
But remain in this lonely place
From a child I been raised in this soldier way
Mummy didn’t ramp she called us the Kray’s
No joke she showed us the ways

I’ve been living this daily
With no peace
No day dreams to save me
Get high cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time

I’ve been living this daily
With no peace
No day dreams to save me
Get high cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time

Mummy couldn’t cope so she turned to drugs
My auntie Tina gave us hope
She was there for us
I was raised on the roads where its rare to trust
And my hearts been broke now I’m scared to love
And I might seem closed till I open up
Feel the weight of the struggle I been holding up
Been betrayed by a cuddle and a heartless hug
I drink pain from a bottle till my heart feels numb
Cause I came from the bottom of this bottle of rum
Ain’t changed from a young'n
I been stuck in the slums
Grey days up in London
Ain’t no summer for us
They tryin' to take A
They want my brother in cuffs
And I just came home
This ain’t nothing to us
Like the court don’t know how our sufferer does
This poor home grown
But mums love was enough
So I want to give her more then she has given to us

I’ve been living this daily
With no peace
No day dreams to save me
Get high cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time

I’ve been living this daily
With no peace
No day dreams to save me
Get high cause I want to survive
Wish I could turn back the hands of time

I don’t want to feel this
I don’t want to see this
I don’t want to hurt no more
I don’t want to be this
I don’t want to feel this
I don’t want to see this
Be somebody
Need to get on up, need to get on up now

I’ve been living this daily
With no peace
No day dreams to save me
Get high cause I want to survive

You do whatever please me, runnin' burs while I take it easy
Will as you do whatever, live your life just to please me
These buster-ass niggas make the shit so easy

If I was fucking you, I'd let the homies fuck too
Run up in the guts bust nuts and we're through

Everything is broken.

It's like a dream I can't wake up from
I keep on running, and wait 'till the morning comes!
Maybe tomorrow is different 
Maybe when I wake up and I see you
It will make a difference!
Maybe you'll save me from drowning, 
but you can't see the tears from all the rain.

Been dealing with some changes
But girl I got one question, will you be there?
When a man is sick and tired 
And this world is set on fire
After all that's said and done
Will you be there?
Will you be there?

Used to think that drinking was the answer to me
Sinking in my sorrows, an if its a tomorrow will i be around
Or consume this swallowed maybe i go back to the bottom

If we're down for one another

Stumbling to the car but they keep asking for autographs

Tell me is it the fame or the money
Either way this people all think there must be something about me - stunning
Ah, everythang (I’m juiced up, I know the truth stuff)
'Cause everything I do is just actually too much
For y’all niggas
Oh yeah and I’m awesome over all niggas
Motherfucking dimes, I can’t even see you small niggas
So pardon me (please)
I don’t mean to brag
But I just spent 40,000 yen on these jeans I have

Oh yeah money long baby

I mean oh you can be the inspiration for my next song
Just motherfucking do with me and bust jimmy johns

It's Been a long time coming and we still going strong
We win it, can’t let up
'Cause once these clowns forget us
It's gonna take a lifetime trying to make them unforget us
So I’m gonna represent us
From start and to the finish

You used to ball too, until you got laid out
Back in 95s damn I bet that's chaos
Life’s about lessons, sit back and watch me teach
Like a game of badminton, I’m so out of reach
I’m at the finish line, give my winning speech
It goes ""ahem , um""
But all y’all said I couldn’t do it
I hope every time you grab a … you forced to hear my music

You don’t, talk about it
You just, laugh a lot
And you just, walk it out, pop it out and stock it out, 
But ya'll bitter bitch ass haters don’t know what I’m talking bout
Do you? Cause I do
The best I can me and my crew - the best of friends
And the niggas that ride for me will put to sleep the best of me

But I failed to mention that , um , I do this shit
While you other candy-coaters on that other .. box of goober shit
I rap  sing and do it on another box of .. shit
And if you ask my haters probably tell you I’m a super bitch

There's no glory and the worry takes a toll on

There's two dead with a legal gun to his head

In the beginning
There was a hum
From a poet whose pulse fell
Drum drum drum!

He would perform prayers and all
Till one day he heard a voice call
Come come come!

Suspicious he moved
With vicious caution
Dismisses,
He thinks is a little often
People get held back
By the void inside 'em.

Yo!

The void said,
I'm poised to speak inside you
""Rejoice then please let me invite you
To evil, greed and lies too.""

Yeah!

Confused and dazed
He moved in ways
He soon became ""Hakuna""

A knock on his door, his heart is no more
A knock on his door, his soul is no more

Yeah
That was in the beginning
As the story goes on

So

The poets got a proposal
He would always hope but never know
What it feels
To be free.
He would be the frozen
Imposed as the chosen,
All laws oppose him
But it would be greed.

That's got him there
He's power-hungry,
And proud too.

People don't care, people just care
Evil don't care, evil just care

Yeah!

There was a hum.
Then things changed.

We don't see them.
See them for their worth at all,
That's why we lead'em
Lead'em to these wars
And what is it we feed 'em.
Feed em our impurities
And who it is we treat 'em
Treat em like the enemy
Humanity will need'em.
Need 'em like the blood we spill
And we're freedom
Freedom for the hearts we fill
We mislead 'em.
They hunger for the love we give
But we cheat 'em.

Is his freedom,
So they defeat him,
Whatever spirit hes got.
Beat him!
And they teach him
The rest of the world don't need him

K'NAAN,"So yeah, basically
A lot of people ask me how life was then
So here it is

My old home smelled of good birth
Boiled red beans, kernel oil and hand me down poetry
It's brick white-washed walls widowed by first paint
The tin roof top humming songs of promise while time is
Locked into demonic rhythm with the leaves
The trees had to win
Hugging them, loving them a torturous love
Buggin' when
It was over and done
The round cemented pot kept the rain drops cool
Neighbors and dwellers spatter in the pool
Kids playing football with his hand and sock
We had what we got, and it wasn't a lot
No one knew they were poor
We were all innocent to greeze judgment
The country was combusting with life like a long hibernating volcano
With a long tale of success like J-Lo
Farmers, fishers, fighters, even fools had a place in production
The coastal line was the place of seduction
The coral reef make you daze in reflection
The women walked with grace and perfection
And we just knew we were warriors too
Nothing morbid, its true
We were glorious
Boom!

Then one day it came
Spoiled up a ray like rain
Like oil in a flame, it pained
The heart attack sudden
Odder than eleven
Harder than a punch in the womb
Harder than the lunch you consume
For us, it had a cancerous fume, more lust
Men who made killing hoggies,
Selling prout fully like healthy livestock
It made tides rock with a diligent mock
Confused are the people, infused in the evil
Professed to eject like Jews in the sequel, to win
It came in the morning, with a warning and without
The hurting was a burden, only certain was doubt
A mythical tale, no soul knows well
Liberty went to hell, freedom called for shells
Fierce was the blow, keep your ears to the show
It appears Orwell was right in '84
Had big brother kill Mother in her store
With all of us watching, we didn't lover her anymore
Peep my poem, Mother was my old home
Good winners looted, in my old home
Religion is burned down, in my old home
Kindness is shackled, in my old home
Justice has been raped, in my old home
Murderers hold post, in my old home
The land, bombers, ghosts, in my old home
We got pistols with eyes, corruption and lies
Trusting snakes, and death without breaks
Suspicious new borns live in our horn
Used to the pain, rack bodies not grain
Chopped limbs not trees
Spend lives not wealth
Seek vengeance not truth, the craziest youth
Hoist pain not plans, nigga' fuck your parents

Bandits will beat us down, in my old home
Rumors are law now, in my old home
Sedatives of faith, in my old home
Rapists are praised, in my old home
Demonds dressed well, in my old home
Infants are nailed, in my old home
Spirits are jailed, in my old home
Grudges grow tails, in my old home

High roads of sea in electric Hayden
Outward labor beneath stubborn faith
Our farms produce guilty grub and
Our kids depend on shifty luck, see
Our muse is life for death is old, so
Don't blame me for truth I told, say
Good winners looted, in my old home
Religion is burned down, in my old home
Kindness is shackled, in my old home
Justice has been raped, in my old home
Murderers hold post, in my old home

When we was younger
Her I was scarred yo
Bullets I survived though
Death it's came easy
Truth the games needs me
Never let them see me down, smile while I'm bleeding

Smile when your in jail
Smile when your dead broke
Smile and the rents due
Smile you ain't got friends now

I can't speak your name
It hurt me that you never listened

Had me deep in pain

I can't do it
I can't see it, look
Dammit, I can't blow it
I got a judge telling me my life's key
They will throw it

I'm resurrected

My mom plays trix and I beat on the floor like bush wick
My fists bloody and blistered
A pair like I'm ballistic
I just stare at the red and smile while I'm bleeding

[Chorus]

There are a few things you gotta take into account
I'm not an entertainer I've never been a clown
I was born where the mothers give birth while they frown
I would walk with the kids that would bra sound ah
Never really thought I'd make it to fourteen
And anybody wanted to fight I was most keen
Plus I had a little temper it was often foreseen
Yo say something bout my momma id shoot ya dead out clean
But ya gotta keep in mind that I grew up Mogadishu (tell em)
The only law was gun law
And we don't walk with a pistol
You get laughed at for being so insensitive to the environment
Cause how will you be heard when those big boys are firin'
War is no place for a child
Especially if hes rollin' with an ak and a smile
He had witnesses on mother bloody in a towel

My season will come it has to, honestly I feel like I'm 10 months pregnant, I'm past due. Sincerely, un-touchy these days I can't take nothin'. 
I'm trying to treat my record like the Lord shit I'm trying to brake somethin'. 
N mostly I'm up and stressing when other folks sleep  
And believe I know struggle and struggle knows me. 
My life owes me like an oven dose 
I'm slowly drifting to the arms of trouble and trouble holds me 
And nothing else is close to me more than pain unfortunately,
Like a self-fulfilling prophecy I'm supposed to be

I'm dwelling in to find myself in the corner huddling 
With some angry men and I gotta settle shit again before they gotta kill again

I should be chilling on beaches instead my bone freezes ducking glocks 
And I was and 12s like Jesus the realest thing to me is since I was a fetus 
The only break I ever got was at recess so legitimately 
I remain very little relieved and that thug rappas 
I remain very little entriged and can you blame me with how we lived in the late 80's 
Throwing rocks at the crazy ladies 
And when we played these crazy games the whole crew had crazy names 
We even had a crypper we called him lazy legs 
But my faith remains untouched and unchanged 
Still in my block you hear more shots then a gun range

More to the truth no writing just me recording in the booth 
Forced by the loop and the guitar but I'm the boss of the group 
I speak truth deep roots remain equal danger 
The pain in my song is crazy but the sequel is stranger
Hey man I'm from the oddest hardest progress then departed 
I'm now known as a recording artist spitting what little remains of your memories 
In your process bigger or little making your name into a colossus 
Believe me I'm thankful my brothers still with me 
And ain't much changed Bobby's still troubling with me 
I'm still mom and pory but we always dently I got a little recording gig but evidently

Poison in my veins, inside I'm torturing my brains,

Voices in my head, am I alive or am I dead,

I'm still awake,a nd its quarter to six, I'm trying to write and I ain't thought of no,
I live with guilt like I slaughtered the sick, I live with shame, like my daughter a bitch,
I don't make living but I still persist, I could sell out but I still resist, 
So don't tell me about no pain and shit,
I was born and raised in poverty bitch, And I smile all the while and don't complain, 
I'm something like Gail Scott heroine, do you know what it feels like to lose a friend, 
Again and again and again, again
The bitterness in the killer the poet, the river of blood within the mess flowing, 
I'm the bitterness in the killer the poet, the river, the blood will keep on flowing,

Cause I'm only twenty something years old working for a crumb or some bread or nothing

Come out of the bubble, ill teach you to cuddle,

And eating and keeping it even, and even my reason for breathing this season,
? in a danger, my nose when I'm reading, its bleeding on paper, its bleeding on paper,
And I'm tired of this violence, so tortured inside, ? open inside, have I already died,
Has mom already cried? And why do I feel like I'm over this life, I'm not hateful, I'm grateful, 
My girlfriend is tasteful, living it up, I might even blow, like a leak in a truck, 
Wit a torch and a clutch, and explosion that leaves the hole ? the dust, and the people,

Driving with negligence, too many beverages,

Kids trust no one cause fire burnt them,
Refugees die in boats, headed for peace,
Is anyone scared of death here' Not in the least,

You can't go half a block with a road block,
You don't pay at the road block you get your throat shot,
And each road block is set up by these gangsters,
And different gangsters go by different standards,
For example, the evening is a no go,
Unless you wanna wear a bullet like a logo,
In the day you should never take the alleyway,

Get ready, he got a good grip on the machete,
Make rappers say they do it for love like R-Kelly,

Harder than harboring Bin Laden and rewind,

I got my heart, I ain't afraid of the fall
I got my duffel bag that daddy packed for me
I got my ear so I hear when you call
I don’t need eyes just to see you look good
You always did, but they misunderstood

I’m goin’ up and down
And baby round and round
I wanna touch you down the river below
And then I’ll kiss you from your head to your toe
You take me so high up, and then you let me down

K'NAAN,"Wale, I kick it, I kick it like Olindo 
I wear my Nike boots in Gucci 
I don't wear no Timbo 
I kick it any tempo 
I'm lifted off the indo 
I'm poppin' champagne, drinkin' till I'm jumpin' out the window,
Ha ha If the autotune's gone bet they'll all tune in 
So I'mma do it bigger than an Audemar wrist watch 
Hip-Hop slackin', 
Why they gettin' Grammies when these niggas is actin? 
They phony, should get Tonies 
For the thing that they be yappin' 
It's utterly bologna so I'm Muslim to these rappers 
Fuck yappin' they lucky we don't clap em 
And have them people leakin' like they're CD isn't mastered 
CD is in plastic, these niggas is has-beens 
We ain't makin friends while these niggas is Anistons 
Dig, these niggas is fake Joe 
Hip-Hop need to wake up, we the fuckin' clock radios 

[Chorus]
We original officially the most original 
If we wasn't so original then we'd be criminal 
Wale and K'naan they don't know is they're radio 
How the hell did they fit the TV in the radio

They told me go in, no problem I'mma go in 
And shy away from drama, I ain't run away from no man 
And there ain't been no buster prepared for you suckas 
Then they'll play with Mario Brothers when it was duck hunt 
That's words to my mama, since I was in a starter 
A nigga been a star before I forfeited my scholar 
Shit didn't finish college, shit wasn't a problem 
Shit my homecoming is here I'm who they call up 
So I still be on that yard with a feely of that Marley 
From the city the Philly women willing to menage 
Though I put em on pause since Manilli been involved 
Though everybody's on me like the Milli V part 
Now I'm from the D Dot where we not no beat boxers 
We talkin' B blockers keep us with deep pockets 
See not no fad or no internet phenom 
But he be's on that web like he be's with Pete Parker 
Me I'm not shy and my partner's Somalian 
K'naan and my buzz is too big like Comala 
Ballin', Folarin so goddamn hard 
Fat rhymes every time bitch Roseanne bars, Wale 

[Chorus]

I don't know why the industry wanna keep me a secret 
And Wale been tellin' other rappers take a deep breath 
And don't perform after him or you might regret 
I guess they didn't get the memo or the leaflet 
You know if you was harder than me then you'd be led 
And if you had more street cred then you'd be dead 
And I'm Somali so I guess I'm just trynna eat bread 
Fuckin' with my people well that's called the Heath Ledge 
Needless to say I turn rap beef to piglets 
Make you speechless, make you bloody, make you teethless 
Then the blood drip on the floor poison pieces 
I been on more red carpets than Ryan Seacrest 
Don't cross me cause my friend I'm no Jesus 
I don't turn cheecks or draw blood like leeches 
And my friend's a nut me spark in heaters 
Get your ass privileges with parking meters 
Do I condone it or is this some kinda small talk? 
Course not, I'm big like horse nut 
Under pressure I don't sweat like my pores shut 
I'm from the ten shacks where mishaps 
Get fix fast by klick klacks and big bwaps 
And inside they think rap soft 
My pen sparks the benchmark I fench off tar 
No sixteen, no vaccine, I'm so sick my ten bars cough 
Now I'm off

K'NAAN,"Ce qui m'a sauvé c'est que je ne voulais pas faire de peine à mon père,
Qu'il dise ce gosse? non, je ne l'ai pas fait
J’ai trouvé ma voix le jour où j'ai pensé à tuer un homme
Donc j'suis bien placé pour parler de paix. J’évite de me répéter,
Alors je me tais lorsqu'il est trop tard pour bien faire
Comment apprécier la paix sans la guerre
Comme la fin et le début les deux font la paire
Je viens déclarer la paix, sans heurts
Quelques cartouches d'encre dans le chargeur.
C’est l’arme de paix

I guess I'm in the race
I'm tryin to win the chase
I'm trying to find my place 
And make it through the days
I'm in my corner store

Cette audace de parler de paix, pendant la fin des temps
Chanter contre ce futur sans précédent
Il le faut ce monde c'est le nôtre
Je pense qu'on tire bénéf du bien de l'autre inquiet car, au fond, je sais
Le malheur de l'un ne fait le bonheur de personne comprenez guérir est la seule porte
On ne peut que périr sous la loi du plus fort
La patience est plus efficace que la force 
Raison pour laquelle je ne milite pas
Qui insulte la paix ne la mérite pas
Chacun touchera sa part de l'héritage

I guess I'm in the race
I'm tryin to win the chase
I'm trying to find my place 
And make it through the days
I'm in my corner store

Je cherche l'impossible équilibre 
Sans en tuer dix pour que mille vivent
La paix à tout prix n'est plus la paix,
Je prends la peine d'un dernier appel
Les chanteurs de vérité sont des cracheurs de flammes
Sous feux des tirs d'armistice,
Je deviens un passeur de calme.
Un jour, l'injustice en personne
Fera tomber une larme

I'm tryin to win the chase
I'm trying to find my place 
and make it through the days
I'm in my corner store",L' Arme de Paix,2009

Still I just can't hold it one more day
So I think I let it out

You're on my mind more than I may sure
You're in my heart more than you may know
And the last thing that I want
Is for you to fall apart
The future will be clearer
I want you to remember

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Make you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
In each tear (each tear)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

We can't change the things,
That we done that's in the past
But fighting won't get us anyway
So if you want, here's my hand
Every night there is one thing I do
I bow my head and I pray for you (pray for you)
And the last thing that I want
Is for you to fall apart

You're not defined by your pain, so let it go
You're not a victim, your more like a winner
And you're not in defeat, you're more like a queen

K'NAAN,"Yea, uh
Its K'naan
Yea, uh. 
About to take over with this, 
here we go I check it

They don't expect me on this beat, the thunder on the street
But I never turn the cheek, surrender or retreat
You can bet that I am strong, trying to right what is wrong
They say it won't be long, keep on singing your song
But ayo you need a single, single to make a mingle
Something that's kinda simple, I'd hate to call it jingle
A single is a missile, takes you right to the middle of 106 and park 
And maybe Jimmy Kimmel
You'll need somebody famous co-signing for your anus
Who you got on the album I don't see where the name is
But I do it my own way I do it my own way I do, 
if you do what you do your own way you could be famous too.

If the beat is hot does it matter where or who its from?
If the flow is hot does it really matter where I'm from?
If the song is hot does it matter 'cause the DJ dumb?
If the girl is hot does it really matter where she's from?
If the beat is hot does it matter where or who its from?
If the flow is hot does it really matter where I'm from?
If the club is hot does it really matter how we bump?
If the girl is hot does it really matter where she's
From?

I coulda been from the west side or the Chi-Town like twista
With a flow so sick it blow you to bits it will show you the glits 
And gold in the wrist and the boat in the fish and I blow them a kiss, 
lets blow give them em a sweet talking in a piss while taking a piss?
are you talking to the fish or the girls in the boat exposing their tits

I coulda been from NY like Rock 'em with the my pen
I can get paid in full with praise and tools erased 
And rules my case of jewels I'm cold like a glacial cool 
With blades and fools I'm raging bulls

I coulda been from L.A like Dre and Snoop
Rolling in my six-four with fresh case jewels
And I'm riding on 'em niggas unless they cool
And I got border troubles like 'em essays fool

I coulda been- I coulda been from the dirty like A town or M.I.A
I could ride an invisible motor cycle and go HEY (echo hey hey)
Storm like the hurricane and I don't mean ay-bay-bay
I'm from Africa where they say K'naan- boom-aye-ay

If you wanna make it hot then you better do a drop 
(drop drop drop drop drop drop)
If you wanna get a hit you better auto-tune this shit (shit, ooh yea)
And he is tougher than you suckers none of you could ever bark at him
Look at him make you tough guys look like you are from suckatem

I'm sending this one out to anyone who's had to wait on a money transfer, 
Yea its kinda whack when they charge you like 10 percent on the dollar 
But you know how good it feels when they say

You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away.
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away.
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away.
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away.

The worst thing is the waiting man,
Its spiritually draining,
I guess I could repaint it, but don't think I'm complaining,
I'm in my small apartment,
This month has been the hardest
I couldn't afford some omelets,
I'm broke like an empty promise
Sometimes when im in a meeting, and everyone else is eating,
I feel so awkward asking, so I pretend like I am fasting,
My girl had paid my payments,
She wants to save my anus,
She says my loves contagious but my pride is so outrageous
She sent me Western Union, so I can make it doin'
It felt so good when she said write down this eleven digits
I go out to receive it, I'm desperate and I need it,
Feels like an angel's speaking, I can hardly believe it

[Chorus]

You finally got a cola, you met him in sarpola
A tourist with a dollar, he's some kind of a baller
Two babies in a stroller, and still he wants to hollar
He likes your Pepsi-Cola, but you ain't runnin' Lola
Brazil ain't nothin' easy, for Velez or fa sheezy
The sun would make you dizzy,
Workin' for something measly
These girls would make you trust em,
And sweetness is the custom,
But everyday they hustlin', everyday they hustlin',
John calls her with the number,
Home with her local lover,
Who was it that picked up the phone,
Oh that was just my brother
She goes out to receive it she's desperate and she needs it
Its like an angel speaking, she can barely believe it

[Chorus]

I got my confirmation,
The western union agent,
Said grandmas destination,
Had violent inclination
But now I'm proud and pacing,
And walking to the station,
Heavy precipitation,
But you cant me anything,
I got my bills in order,
I made it cross the border,
Such dazzles such a horror,
His life was like an Oprah,
Grandma I never forget you,
Worry I never let you,
Soon as I leave the venue,
This money I will send you,
I still haven't gone astray,
Don't drink or smoke and sway,
Though sometimes I don't pray,
It feels so good to say,
Go out and receive it,
Cause I just know you need it,
Your boy has grown up decent,
Grandma can you believe it?

[Chorus]

Yo let the beat ride out for a minute ima say somethin right quick to people. 
I dont really do shout outs 
But I'm gonna do a quick shout out to the people that helped me 
When I was in need you know what I'm sayin', 
The people who sent me things on Western Union what have you. 
You know Mahama Yuisef takin care of us numerous times 
When me and rezac stuck on the road somewhere. 
Mr Jarvis Church who didnt even know about Western Union til he met me. 
My wife Dedna helpin' out when we needed her, thank you baby. 
Mr. solgai helpin out with my brothers bail money 
Even before we been working together, 
Thank you very much, orregato I appreciate it, 
And now I'm sending money to people.

Thank you very much, it's K'Naan",15 Minutes Away,2009
K'NAAN,"Bundle up my whole style is so cold
I glow like old guys who go bald
My flow got no front in the vocal
Your flow got no button its so old

I don't mean to sound like a showboat
But it's true my persona's no joke
I stepped into some kinda portal
I'm legend and sometimes I'm noble

I'm from the most risky zone, oh
No place is more shifty global
More pistols, Russian revolvers
We shootin' all that is normal

But it ain't just because we want to
We ain't got nowhere we can run to
Somebody please press the undo
They only teach us the things that guns do

They don't teach us the ABCs
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

They don't teach us the ABCs
We play on the hard concrete

All we got is life on the streets

Rock, you know my era
B-boy seasoning, salt -n- pepa
Grown and sexy, come with the extra
Crushed up linen, fly like sess-a
This type brew I gave it birth
Now it's time again to give it a verse
Jamaican born, not a fan of the ganja
? Brooklyn to Somalia
And it goes in the background
Playa, that is my sound
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
Pioneer legend, and they call me Mr. Rock
No B word or N word, I don't need those words (no)
Respect for hers
The game dried up, so we come with the grease
Leadin' ya right and treatin' ya right, so peace

They don't teach us the ABCs
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

Superman is known by the locals
As this dude who's so fly it's global
Attitude that came outta struggle
Destitute but I make it hopeful

You real, but my real is tenfold
My real'll make yours a rental
Gangsta if at ease, essential
Fight with guns or utensils

So bold nothin's confidential
Breakfast was not continental
And lunch could not compliment all
We still become competent souls

These streets ain't paved with no gold
Matter fact someone stole the light bulb
Nobody fat enough for lypo
They don't teach us to read and write, so

They don't teach us the ABCs
We play on the hard concrete

We have to be in search of something equal to the cure
Straight out the door, I come to give you more
Lay the law keep it raw, when I speak it from the core
Get underneath your skin like especially with the claw
Conflicted with the rich 'cause I kick it with the poor
I laugh in the face of adversity
Sound clashed with the bass 'cause it's natural to me
But if you pay attention to the past you will see
Not long ago you black they'd hang your ass from a tree
Certain things things change, while some stay the same
Some are recluse others are lovers of the game

K'NAAN,"She shot me, she shot me,
Bang, bang, she shot me. [Repeat: x3]
She shot me, she shot me,
Bang, bang. (Get out the way, yo)

There she goes again,
The girl is Ethiopian.
In other words, she came through explodin'
In the podium, dynamite
Napoleon like sodium mixed with petroleum,
Slowly but surely, she was walking toward me
Cut the convo short 'cause she had to wake up early,
But continuing the story,
Don't worry she gave me digits for her Blackberry
""You're very handsome"" is what she said.
And the way she looked in my eyes said ""Put me to bed.""

Oh my, oh my, I should have known when she said to me on the phone:
""You do not know me very well, but I would never hurt a fly.""
Then she aimed at my chest with love in her eye.
I said she aimed at my chest with love in her eye.

She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one.
It went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away,
I stood my ground and let her spray.
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang she shot me [Repeat:x3]
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang.

Scorpion,
She's so hot she's a scorch-ian,
Killing me softly,
Lauryn or Kevorkian,
Couldn't tell if she's coo-coo or corky, when
I asked her her name she said ""Call me Ten.""
Testing, testing
Things just got more interesting
She's dressed in a vest pin, double-breasted holster,
A very Western toaster,
She ain't nothing Kosher.
Ah, she lets me closer.
Hotter than a pepper-crusted Samosa
While I try to keep my composure.

She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one.
It went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away,
I stood my ground and let her spray.
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang she shot me [Repeat:x3]
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang.

Am I wrong?
But what is love without the pain to go along?
And what is pain if not the reason for me to sing this song?
And this song is for the weak and for the strong.
Cause I was strong and still,
She got me, she got me,
Bang, bang, she got me.
She got me, she got me,
Bang, bang.

She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one.
It went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away,

K'NAAN,"Yeah
Believe it or not
What kept me alive
Is my dreams

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
I'm a dreamer
But I ain't the only one got problems
But we love to have fun
This is our world
From here to your hood
We alive man
It's OK to feel good

I got a friend named Flow,
Who got a friend named blow
With a finger named clap
That'll leave you on the side like a Kangol hat.
He ain't have no choice he was born this way
These streets will pull your number like a phone display
You gotta be defensive with your life
You gotta be like Bush and take Pre-emptive strikes
And the boys from the hood are always hard
Let alone in Mogadishu it's a mastered art
If you bring the words hood to a seminar
We from the only place worse then Kandahar,
Now that's kinda hard
But we still like to party and hardy har
Something good happens we say Mashalla
Something bad happens Kay Sara Sara.
I close my eyes and all I can see is you dancing with me

[Chorus]

It's ok to feel good, it's the truth
Yo check it out

What would it take for a boy about my age to hear cheers in his head upon that stage
And the cheers that would drowned out the tears from my brown eyes
Come on back stage you see the screams ain't the screams from gun shot streams
In my dreams these screams are from hot teens
And I'm barely thirteen but I pack dirty, a Russian fire arm that shoots thirty
Just then I hear the bus engine I'm transcending I'm crowd surfing I can't see the time burning I'm not hurting with my mahogany pen.
I'm on a world tour with Mohammad and them.
And we be over sees and not in these trees where my peeps stay alive like the Bee gees
And the likes of JZ would save my steeze and singing handily brought Hip-Hop peace

[Chorus]

Sometimes we just like to have fun,
Man we like to forget all the fighting
All the guns and the tires burning,

Back on the verse
Imagine crack was in birth
Imagine the earth wasn't hurt
Imagine no homeland alerts
Imagine no record locater so I wouldn't have to get a criminal waiver
Imagine if peace wasn't in my briefs
Instead peace could stretch across the sees
So finally we could just rest and in easy no refugees
And you, well you could dress in a book
And I can read your body in less then a look
I got a dream girl in my mind and that the hook,
An intellectually, sexual and still can cook

Yeah, and I feel good right now
I feel good right here
You feel good?

[Chorus]

We not down and out, just cause times are hard
Yeah shout out to the struggeler's,
In my country, hardest place on earth
But still
I still know how to get down,
I still know how to vibe out,
I still know how to talk to a pretty girl.
Take it easy now.",Dreamer,2009

We rise early pace up the hour
Streets is bustling hustling their heart out
You can't have the sweet with no sour

Spices herbs the sweet scent of flower
We came out precisely the hour
Clouds disappear the sun shows the power
No chance of a probable shower

I fell in love with my neighbors daughter
I wanted to protect and support her
Never mind I'm just 12 and a quarter
I had dreams beyond our border.

Is it true when they say all you need is just love,
Is it true

Whose memory still lives inside of me.

What did the Young Man say
Before he stole you away
On that fateful day Fatima
Fatima,
Did he know your name

To go to New York City, Fatima

I ask God to slow down the seconds
He does the opposite that's what I'm guessing
I better chill and count my own blessings

How come you ain't come up the ladder
So we can be like there's no tomorrow
Damn you gonna make me wait until tomorrow

If beauty was in the eyes of beholder
How come everyone hushed when she walked by
How come girls would look just to scold her
How come the angel wanted to hold her?

Fatima, Fatima I'm in America
I make rhymes and I make them delicate
You would have liked the parks in Connecticut
You would have said I'm working too hard again.

Damn you shooter, Damn you the building
Whose walls hid the blood she was spilling
Damn you Country so good at killing
Damn you feeling, for persevering

Is it true when they say all you need is just love,

Let my star venture out, I got war in me, so let me vent it out

Ill admit it I could spit it like a fitted knitted cap
That means tight and won't stop like a city cab
That means I'm not white
But I figured do it big because the slum needs me
So instead of getting a beat from Kanyeezy
Who would probably take half my budget
I could save the back end and send it back to Mogadishu
Where my family and friends getting patched up again you can ask hova

And open doors to hurting people like me
People like me

Is it fair to say that I am stressing out
I'm stationed in Iraq and they won't let me out
My homeys said I was stupid for even joining
My counselor said that my decision was disappointing
How she had good for good state colleges
And with my good grades it wouldn't have been a problem
But they don't understand the power of significance
More than brilliance and certainly more than difference
And if you ask me now would I repeat it
Would I fight in a war I don't believe in
Well the answer is if not me where the cancer is
They been doing this before Jesus of Nazareth
And after all this time it is still deadly hazardous
And bush isn't really being all that inaccurate
When he says we're winning the war cos its staggering
But that's cause we're killing everybody that we see
And most of us soldiers we can barely fall asleep
And time and time again I'm feeling incompetent
Cos my women back home, we're constantly arguing
And I must be crazy cos all I'm obsessing with is
Her Myspace and Facebook and who's commenting
I swear to god if she's cheatin' I'm doing her ass in
I can tell with one look and it came to me
Sounding like something from a song hook

Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me

Meet Sarah, the proud mother of young Sebastian
Suburban professional went to college in shton
In self pity she suddenly cried
Would my life be important if I suddenly died?
Neighbors saying what a nice women she was
Keeping mostly to herself ever since the divorce
And with the company downsizing and the fall and all
She really shouldn't take it that personal at all
It wasn't her boss who had his eyes on her thighs
And got a rise from her rising off the desk though
And despite remembering saying no plenty of times
It was still a damn surprise being let go
And now stuck with a mortgage she cant afford
And too educated to blame the corporate world
She got on welfare and hated it case work a power tripping
And generally being degraded if
Nothing else she was treated sick
And ineffective which is the worst thing
That she'd been left with
Damn, no magic from David Blane
No painter to pain this pain
No Morgan Freeman to narrate the shame
So she took refuge and prayer
Kinda like finding god in the phone book
And it came to her sounding something like a song hook

Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me
People like me

I guess I told you about myself to a degree
Just by telling you about people like me
But people like me they speak politely
They don't start no beef or peace
Everybody gotta eat but everybody doesn't
Which is why I want to tell you about my favorite cousin
He and I grew up where the sun shines
And we both partook with the gun crimes
And we both liked American rap rhymes
Even though we didn't understand one line
If you remember my line of notes in my last album
I talked about a close call with a grenade
I think we both must have been about 7th grade
But don't panic we both survived without damage
But we developed a bond like we survived the titanic
But when the country became frantic
My mother tried to get us out, planned it
To the last detail except the plan got derailed
Cos there wasn't enough money for the plain tickets
How bitter when my mother had to chose who to take with her
So my cousin got left in the war and that's just hard to recall
But now I take refuge and prayer
Kinda like finding god in the phone book
It came to me sounding kinda like something from a song hook

And open doors to hurting people like me

It's just the wrong dance
That'll leave you not breathin'.
I'm not particularly proud
Of this predicament but,
I'm born and bred
In this tenement, I'm sentimental, What?!
Plus it's only right to represent my hood
And what not.
So I'm about to do it in the music, in the movies.
Cut to the chase pan across to the face
I'm right there.

And the drain of sewage.

Mold them around discarded bike tires.
Roll em down the hill in foot blazin'.
Now that was our version of mountain bike racing

When someone comes out of such a dire situation
And learns the English language,
Just to share his observation!
Probably get a Grammy without a grammar education.
So fuck you school and fuck you immigration!
And all of you who thought I wouldn't amount to constipation.
And now I'm here without the slightest fear and preservation,
They love me in the slums and in the native reservations.
The world is a ghetto with ministerin' deprivation.
My mommy didn't raise no fool did she hooyo?
I promise I would get it and remain strictly loyal.
Cause when they get it then they let it all switch and spoil.
But I just illuminated it like kitchen foil.
A lot of main stream niggas is yappin' about yappin'
A lot of underground niggas is rappin' about rappin'.

I glow like old guys who go bald
My flow got no front in the vocal
Your flow got no button it's so old

I don't mean to sound like a showboat
But it's true my persona's no joke
I stepped into some kinda portal
I'm legend and sometimes I'm noble

I'm from the most risky zone, oh
No place is more shifty global
More pistols, Russian revolvers
We shootin' all that is normal

But it ain't just because we want to
We ain't got nowhere we can run to
Somebody please press the undo
They only teach us the things that guns do

They don't teach us the ABC's

Rock, you know my era
Be-boy seasoning, salt-n-pepa
Grown and sexy, come with the extra
Crushed up linen, fly like Cessna

This type brew, I gave it birth
Now it's time again to give it a verse
Jamaican born, not a fan of the ganja
Boulevard, Brooklyn to Somalia

And it goes in the background
Playa, that is my sound
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
Pioneer legend and they call me Mr. Rock

No be word or N word, I don't need those words
Respect for hers
The game dried up, so we come with the grease
Leadin' ya right and treatin' ya right, so peace

Superman is known by the locals
As this dude who's so fly it's global
Attitude that came outta struggle
Destitute but I make it hopeful

You real but my real is tenfold
My real will make yours a rental
Gangsta if at ease, essential
Fight with guns or utensils

So bold, nothing's confidential
Breakfast was not continental
And lunch could not compliment all
We still become competent souls

Awaken the sleeping giant

I dreamt that we could visit Old Kemet
Your history is too complex and rigid
For some western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions
We praised bridges that carried us over
The battle front of Sudanic soldiers
The task put before us
Ya hear me out

Who are we today?
The slums, diseases, AIDS
We need all that to fade
We cannot be afraid
So who are we today?
We are the morning after
The make shift youth
The slave ship captured
Our diaspora, is the final chapter
The ancestral lineage built pyramids
Americas first immigrant
The Kings sons and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect, the first philosophers, astronomers
The first prophets and doctors was us

Now can we all pray
Each in his own way
Teaching and learning
And we can work it out
We'll have a warm bed
We'll have some warm bread
And shelter from the storm dread
And we can work it out
Mother Nature feeds all
In famine and drought
Tell those selfish in ways
Not to share us out
What's a tree without root
Lion without tooth
A lie without truth
You hear me out

Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Ye lord
Well Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May some more love come
Yesterday we were Kings
I'll tell you young blood
This world is yours today

From Africa--we was once happiness pursuers 
Now we back stabbing, combative, and abusive 
The African and Arab go at it--they most Muslim 
We should be moving in unison; disputes should end 
Bounty hunters in Grape Street get cool again 
Substandard housing got the young running rampant 
Wilding for a phantom he can style in 
Mask on his face, grabbing his Ruger

Catch twenty-five and he doesn't like the man inside
With black, white pride, and Mexican, survive the best he can 
Strap a shank to his thigh 
Why do we all collide? Why do the young die?

Timeless in case we ain't never been acquainted 
Flyness--we made it; it gets duplicated 
Mindless violence--well, let me try to paint it 
Here's the five steps in hopes to explain it 
One: it's me and my nation against the world 
Two: and me and my clan against the nation 
Three: and me and my fam' against the clan 
Four: then me and my brother with no hesitation 
Go against the fam' until they cave in 
Five: now who's left in this deadly equation?

Over Brooklyn, over Queens, and over Rutgers 
Over red and over blue and over chuckers 
Over red and over blue and undercovers

Hard to separate my past from my rhyme
Cause how could you separate milk from lime

I feel cocky, running up the steps like Rocky
Until the past comes flashing like paparazzi
Nothing's new so why open my folder

Everything backwards, is my plight
Its landing first when in my flight
Even my tears run up my cheeks
Back in my eye
Link I die

Feel I'm floating high above me
Like I'm looking down upon me

Never stop to let the truth in

Sometimes I feel like it's all been done
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one
Sometimes I wanna change everything I've ever done
I'm too tired to fight and yet too scared to run

And if I stop for a minute
I think about things I really don't wanna know
And I'm the first to admit it
Without you I'm a liner stranded in an ice floe

I feel like a thief who has no faith
Maybe more than by the grade
Of the drugs he took that day

Sinking, in the pain he's been inflicting
Yet he's feeling like the victim
Just a horoscope's to blame

Sometimes I feel like a little lost child
Sometimes I feel like the chosen one
Sometimes I wanna shout out 'til everything goes quiet
Sometimes I wonder why I was ever born

And if I stop for a minute
I think about things I really don't wanna know
And I'm the first to admit it
Without you I'm child
And so wherever you go, I will follow

Ugh, yeah
And baby you are just beautiful
From crown to your cuticles
You held down with two sons
You never frown when duty calls
You know me, I gave you more than you can handle
But you still keep a handle on it
Even when I take something beautiful and vandal on it
No more females
Well how come my emails got notes on a scandal
It's like Eve with the apple
A priest in a chapel
Overcome by the devil's tackle
I'm still shackled in the battle
I know, I'm such a hassle
Every time I let me thoughts go
I get baffled
So I hardly pause
I just crossed z's with these gnarly broads
Cause it hurts me just to see what I finally lost
So I guess I'm just a fiend

The stage and the screen where it's just me and Keane

Young like him, 
Had a mouth on me a tongue like him
But now I'm feeling much weaker
Closest thing to my heart is a mandatory gripper
And my eyes ain't what they used to be either
But here's me singing promise from la Vita

When I am old and lonely
Would you still be there for me
'Cause now I have all of my strength
And you have all your beauty

When you're gold in Timbuktu 
Will I still come look for you
Let's swim in the deep end
Make it warm that we can

For you, for me
Buried in the deep end
Life is one big weekend

Push!
One day you comin' and then
Whoosh!
You'd be surprised how easy is 
To be enticed and feasting life
Without the least of dreams suffice
So watch it fly fear to flight
So I'm busy chasing a decent size
Tush! and I ain't never been a wuss
Have more arms than an octopus
Those days I never thought of old age
I never thought I'd see the hair in my nose gray
But life goes on how ironic
If I could do it over I'd probably smoke chronic
But still follow the footsteps of prophet Mohammed
I probably turn every lie that I told honest
I be an equal terrorist I give the middle finger to my therapist
And flush my sedatest 
I'll have a baby with a feminist and name him sexist
Life's a contradiction on my check list

When I am old and lonely
Would you still be there for me
'Cause now I have all of my strength
And you have all your beauty

When you're gold in Timbuktu 
Will I still come look for you
Let's swim in the deep end
Make it warm that we can

Buried in the deep end

Say you'll run to my side

Something 'bout Mary
Never won a pageant
Never felt pretty
Never looked like Cameron
Diaz was her last name
Always been abandoned
Keep your head up

Baby girl this is your anthem
There goes Hannah
Showin' off her banner
Rocking that crown
Make them boys go bananas
When you're insecure about yourself
It's a fact
You can point a finger
But there's three pointing bac
I can see her crying out, yeah
Is there anybody out there?

She's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now she could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
She's crying for your love tonight
Loneliest heart to survive, she said

I don't wanna be left
In this war tonight
Am I alone in this fight?
Is anybody out there?

Don't wanna be left left in this world behind
Say you'll run to my side
Is anybody out there? yeah, yeah, yeah

Is anybody out there?
(Somebody, anybody)

His name was Adam
When his mom had him
Dad was a phantom never took a look at him
Grew up mad and antisocial

Hated outdoors, always in playing madden
Adam was lonely
Drugs were the only
Way out of his own life
Now he's slowly losing his fire
Close to retire
With one last hope he puts his arms up higher
I can see him crying out, yeah
Is anybody out there?

He's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now he could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
He's crying for your love tonight

I don't wanna be left
In this war tonight
Am I alone in this fight?
Is anybody out there?

Don't wanna be left left in this world behind
Say you'll run to my side
Is anybody out there?

If you feel the way I feel
Like you've been talking to yourself
Well this one's for everyone who's felt invisible
Lonely in a crowded room
Searching for someone like you
Can't do it all alone (no one can baby)
Can't do it all alone (no one should baby)
Is anybody out there?
(Somebody, anybody)
Is anybody out there?
I'm right here for your
Is anybody out there?

K'NAAN,"[Chorus]
Turn the light off
There's a light on in your heart
So let it be your guidance, guidance
Open your mouth if what you'd say
Could be more beautiful than silence, silence

OK, ain't it funny how the talkers always talking?
Never firing, but always say they cocking
And they're cocky until they in the parking lots
Suddenly they got Parkinson, they can hardly talk.
No karate buddy, no Pilates buddy
It's a new game, no Atari buddy!
Body chalk, well I'm used to bodies chopped
I've seen shit to give new meaning to the body shop
Look, I know you think I'm so righteous,
But mother fucker, I'm also into rifles
They try to tell these niggas I'm a baby in these diapers
I'm on my own shit, like this
I don't disseminate, I got my name in services
I don't discriminate, I got friends who are snipers
But some of them ended up being lifeless
Cause they kept silent, survivors.

[Chorus]

I'm the quiet type, breathe and steady
Never small talk speak when necessary
In the streets, I see niggas chopped with machetes
My Jamaican girl say ""talk to me baby!""
What's on your mind? can't say cemetery
Death do us part, memories, I marry
Got a library with no lies buried
And all the books look like they're made of strawberries.
It ain't easy being me
Cause my own fans can't relate to my streets
And my streets can't relate to dough in the yeast
But I'm beast, so I make bread on release.
I'm releasing my demons
Give the beat it's life like I gave a fetus semen
Feel the kick in your belly, that's freedom breathing
And don't say nothing, cause now we're dreaming!

The knock off Filas, with the pumps and cheap cardigans

But this corny kid, quick to send you to the coroners
Y’all know my war story, I won’t repeat it
It’s just injury, my victory’s undefeated
Thought you knew me well, go back and delete it
I’m in every joint this year, Orthopedic
And yes the AK’s are instruments we do drum ‘em
I’m somewhere between killa and king Solomon
And the shades take half the face we over stun ‘em
And treat obstacles like ass we overcome ‘em
Man, they really made me do this

Now I’m suited up with Lugers
Rugers suddenly intruders
Turn around like hoola hoopers

K'NAAN,"You know, and it gets into this whole issue of border security
You know, who's gonna say that the borders are secure? 
We've got the House and the Senate debating this issue
And it's, it's really astonishing that in a country founded by immigrants
""Immigrant"" has somehow become a bad word 
So the debate rages on and we continue

And just like that it's over, we tend to our wounded, we count our dead
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom
Not yet

I got one job, two job, three when I need them
I got five roommates in this one studio, but I never really see them
And we all came America trying to get a lap dance from Lady Freedom
But now Lady Liberty is acting like Hilary Banks with a pre-nup
Man, I was brave, sailing on graves
Don't think I didn't notice those tombstones disguised as waves
I'm no dummy, here is something funny, you can be an immigrant without risking your lives
Or crossing these borders with thrifty supplies
All you got to do is see the world with new eyes

Baby boy, it's hard times
When you ain't sent for

With they pitchforks, rich chores
Done by the people that get ignored

Ya se armó
Ya se despertaron
It's a whole awakening
La alarma ya sonó hace rato
Los que quieren buscan
Pero nos apodan como vagos
We are the same ones
Hustling on every level
Ten los datos
Walk a mile in our shoes
Abróchense los zapatos

I been scoping ya dudes, ya'll ain't been working like I do
I'll outwork you, it hurts you
You claim I'm stealing jobs though
Peter Piper claimed he picked them, he just underpaid Pablo
But there ain't a paper trail when you living in the shadows
We're America's ghost writers, the credit's only borrowed
It's a matter of time before the checks all come

Ay yo aye, immigrants we don't like that
Na they don't play British empire strikes back
They beating us like 808's and high hats
At our own game of invasion, but this ain't Iraq
Who these fugees what did they do for me
But contribute new dreams
Taxes and tools, swagger and food to eat
Cool, they flee war zones, but the problem ain't ours
Even if our bombs landed on them like the Mayflower
Buckingham Palace or Capitol Hill
Blood of my ancestors had that all built
It's the ink you print on your dollar bill, oil you spill
Thin red lines on the flag you hoist when you kill
But still we just say ""look how far I come""
Hindustan, Pakistan, to London
To a galaxy far from their ignorance
'Cause

Immigrants, we get the job done

Por tierra o por agua
Identidad falsa
Brincamos muros o flotamos en balsas
La peleamos como Sandino en Nicaragua
Somos como las plantas que crecen sin agua
Sin pasaporte americano
Porque la mitad de gringolandia es terreno mexicano
Hay que ser bien hijo de puta
Nosotros les sembramos el árbol y ellos se comen la frutas
Somos los que cruzaron
Aquí vinimos a buscar el oro que nos robaron
Tenemos mas trucos que la policía secreta
Metimos la casa completa en una maleta
Con un pico, una pala
Y un rastrillo
Te construimos un castillo
Como es que dice el coro cabrón?

So she shoved him off that pole
And told me something I should know
The music loud she was talkin' low I couldn't understand this ho
So I told shawty go change clothes and meet me back right here
Don't say a word just grab ya bag so we can disappear
She said bet and I said cool
Later on we was at the twelve
She don't drink lean but she smoke loud
So we burned down the whole hell
See you the type I might take home and let you spend the night
But I don't know yet
It's our first date
Let me think about it a'ight!
So we in the whip on 75 trynna figure out the move
She said aye and I said what
She gone ask me what we gone do
Come lay ya head on my lap and do somethin' you barely don't do
She said bet then she got loose and blew the top off of that coochie

See me, I'm a trill nigga through and through
And I'm out here looking for the chewing to
That's word to skinny pimp
Just a gangster walking with a limp
And you know I got no love for a simp
Posted up, nigga, eating steak and shrimp
Lil bitch got my knife and I got my fork
Benz outside and it's valet parked
Blunt rolled up and I'm 'bout to spark
In the city lights, I smash out in the dark
Can't be but who I am
Got to represent for my fam
Cadillac doors still getting slammed
Don't like it, sorry don't give a damn
Still down, still trill

Riding shotgun in a old school with my dad
Memories that I hold on to
'Cause really those the only ones that I had
They used to call me Lil' Rock
Skinny big head nigga with a rock
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hard
Even though my fam used to keep the grams in the socks, damn
It was me, lil Brandon and Nene
Outside running wild, fuck TV
On 13th all the way the 49th and Chambers
Shout out to my lil cuz Veve
And my uncle Jerome
One time for my uncle Jerome
In the basement smoking cigarettes with Tyrique
I think we did that when unc wasn't home
47th and Lloyd, first time I got jumped on the porch
Hit the oldest one with the one two, bink bink
Other one ran up, left his ass right there on the porch
Hell is you saying? Lil Jeff turned me into a man
That was big bro, that was big cuz
Everything to a nigga now he gone
Guess God had a plan, I don't understand
Lord why you do me this way? You live and you learn
Them tables will turn, them bridges will burn
But through it all, just make a way
I'm here to stay and I'ma do it for my city like the mayor
Real north-side nigga living life like my grandaddy Charles
He the reason why a nigga a player

Let me talk to 'em
Plenty nights when I felt all alone, nobody to lean on
Listen up, let me tell you how it feel
Look, I just tell it how it is, everybody claim they real
On the real these niggas ain't ever been real
I'm just living my life, I'm just doing my thang

Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be shit, is the shit,
Who knew?
Still ridin' 'round with my day one niggas
We don't need new niggas in the crew
One time for my nigga Dan
That was my first friend second grade, Mrs. Blue
I don't do too much, nigga just say what's up, man salute when you see me
These niggas upset 'cause they heard I got next
I keep cheese like Fellini's
Back in the day I used to be a hot head
Like I'm walkin' 'round with a beanie
In the middle of the summer
I'm just tryna score, nigga, no time to fumble
It's game time, everybody on ten
We just tryna get this money at the same time
I ain't claimin' what ain't mine
Got your girl on the edge like the state line
Ain't no mo play time
We just tryna get it off the muscle
Fighting for the money, how much hustle
I'ma get my bitch to respect my hustle forreal
Man fuck everybody do you
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit
Is the shit, who knew
Look, I'm just livin' my life, I'm just doin' my thang
Same nigga from the jump

What's the point of getting that money?
Money ain't money, if your life don't change
What's the point of pushing that whip
If you ain't changing lanes?
What's the point of having any girl
If your bitch don't change?
What's the point of staying the same

Sonnin' these niggas like an episode of Maury
If you running for the money, motherfuckers better hurry
Shout out Diego, stacking like Legos

She keep calling for seconds, between her legs is a blessing
Might just fly out to Texas and stack it up just like Tetris
Spare my heart in these sessions, I let it go learn my lesson

And know we all 'bout the bankroll
But got a cuff for every color of the rainbow
Fuck all that going back and forth with a dirty bitch
I shoot that hoe with the .44 I’m riding dirty with
Counting money blowing weed in the back, in the back
Hundred K, two or three in the sack
And all we know is double up and stay fly
And run that check up, be a hustler 'til I die, 'til I die, 'til I die

Okay now bang, bang, only thing a young nigga stack
Niggas ain’t tryna get racks, they rather sit on they ass
Nigga what the fuck is that
Nigga that’s some car cold that's on the hill
Side not I want a mill
Pea coat dressed to kill, introduce you to the real
Remember them nights I was dead ass broke, while I still had a milly on my mind
Still had dreams I would get it, still had dreams I would win ain’t never waste no time
This that trap music, urban legend
Bitch I’m a urban legend, carry ’round a Smith N Wesson
Case a nigga wanna test it
Fuck you mean, fuck you mean, motivate all my niggas,
I’mma stack this shit up with my team
Went from rag to riches now I keep them bankrolls in my jeans
Drag racing on some peace treaties, that’s some shit you’d never see
Now I’m here with the king

And know we all 'bout the bankroll
But got a cuff for every color of the rainbow
Fuck all that going back and forth with a dirty bitch
I shoot that hoe with the .44 I’m riding dirty with
Counting money blowing weed in the back, in the back
Hundred K, two or three in the sack
And all we know is double up and stay fly
And run that check up, be a hustler 'til I die, 'til I die, 'til I die

Hold up, it what it look like
I got your girl with a girl like a bull dyke
Going, hard, on a all nighter
And then I give her back to you nigga I don't like her
Dis shit easy or 1-2-3, 911 in emergency
If I swerve that Lac, and spill this Yac
Keep my lane young bitch, the car 'bout that, ho check it
Looking for some trouble well your ass gonna get it
Never hesitate and share a time my peasant
Pussy nigga ever did respect my presence
Fully automatic let you hear these pellets
Pellet, pellet, pellet, pellet pew nigga you betta' gone nigga
We're puttin' on nigga, got long scrilla
Got a bad bitch with no thong with her
And she walkin' out like King Kong hit her
So good made her running back
She said she gave it all to the wrong nigga, he made a mill, I made double that
The nigga had her eating double stacks
I fill her pocket up with whatever stack
She do it right, get another rack
Crib with a heli pad, full of fine bitches hella bad
Run out of cash, nigga never that

And know we all 'bout the bankroll
But got a cuff for every color of the rainbow
Fuck all that going back and forth with a dirty bitch
I shoot that hoe with the .44 I’m riding dirty with
Counting money blowing weed in the back, in the back
Hundred K, two or three in the sack
And all we know is double up and stay fly
And run that check up, be a hustler 'til I die, 'til I die, 'til I die",Till I Die,2015

Just all for one deal
Deal

One done, made a quick five-hundred
White ghost right behind me like, I'm haunted
Never drop the bag off and heard, I don't want it
See the Benz and the six crib bedroom, I bought it
It's good, come to Cali, get a sweet price
Put her on a cheap flight
Hit me when she lands, I'mma wrap it up three times
Tripple seal, each one

Trap talk, dig holes in the winter time
Out door got me rich, yeah, I'm finna shine
Bitches talkin' crazy, but they give me mine
I got a twenty-pack knock on my other line
Two girls, both drunk and they hella fine
Fresh picked, new smell, you can tell it's mine
Send another box out, I hope it touch down
I don't need another lost now

Dasani bottle full of Hennessy
Takin' shots, making gwop off my enemies
Fuck nigga, you is not who you pretend to be
Face some blunts to the head for the memories
Smokin' that Cali got me on the way
Where is them hoes, I ain't fucked em' for days
I got more problems and money to make
You gotta wait while I make some shade
I cannot touch unless it came with the seal
They fuck with me from the jump, I been real
I drive that shit with the horse on the wheel
And that was before the deal

Someday they all got some steal in the field

Why motherfuckers can't be broke sometimes? 
Sometimes it's cool to floss 
But don't buy an eighty-five thousand dollar car 
Before you buy a house 

They always said I couldn't rap, I just say bitch 
I guess the bitch, made me rich 
And now you wanna call me hardcore 
While I be steppin out the shower on a marble floor

Long expensive fuh-flights, up dere in the heavens

Smokin blunts and drinkin brew on the blacony, barbecuin ribs 
The more scrilla, the merrier

Got a paper bag full of that, can't you tell 
It's funky, everybody nod they head like this 
I said bitch, and everybody read my lips 
I got rich, suckin up the game from the O 
And even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow 
I survived 'cause I got mo', game than them 
It came straight from the prostitutes, players, and pimps 
It was my destiny, I came the same every time 
So don't question me, I transfer the game in the rhymes 

I'm not a freestyler, don't rap for free main 
It's Paystyle on mine, 'cause I love money main

People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce

Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's

I had to get P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court

With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon' to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin' black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three

I feast each day (each day)
Without a smile
And life seems so unfair
I feel like I wanna (like I wanna) die
You didn't even give me a last
You didn't give me a last goodbye baby

[Chorus]
I've waited weeks for your call
I've waited here by the phone
Broken the silence too long (it broke to long)
I knew that something was wrong (oh)
Right then I knew it babe
How could you do it babe (how could you do it)

How could you tear my poor heat in two (why did you have to do it oh)
How could you do it babe
How could you do (how could you do) it to me (to me)
Do it do it how could you do it baby
And tear my poor heart in two

Ain't no more blue up in my sky
Only cloudy moments ha
And this is like rain you left behind
All of those memories in the corner of my mind
I started looking at a picture in a frame
As I start to cry 'cause I can't picture us apart
Oh my God can you help me
Can you help me with this pain
With this pain I've buried deep down inside.

[Chorus]

How could you tear my poor heart in two
(How could you do it how could you do it to me baby)
Girl tell me it's not true (all my life)
Do I have to spend the rest of my life without you baby
How can I get through
How can I get through this pain this pain no deal baby

[Chorus]

How could you do it babe (why you do this why you went away)
How could you tear my poor heart in two (yeah yeah)
Yeah baby oh
I've waited weeks for your call
I've waited here by the phone
Break it down, break it down (broken the silence too long)
Break it down, break it down (I knew that something was wrong)
Break it down",How Could You [Master Mix],1996

I'm Too $hort baby been down since the eighties
For the last eight years rode around in a Mercedes
Lexus, trucks, drop-Vette, Caddy
Bitches don't call me by my name they call me daddy

K-Ci $hort E-40 Fonzarelli
I'll probably never have long money like Ross Perilli
But shit we just want a hip
Don't want the whole plate
Don't put the two on the ten, don't ever perpetrate
Like a lot of these fools I see on TV
With the Armani Chanel Versus Versacci
Why motherfuckers can't be broke sometimes?
Sometimes it's cool to floss
But don't buy an eighty-five thousand dollar car
Before you buy a house

They always said I couldn't rap, I just say bitch
I guess the bitch, made me rich
And now you wanna call me hardcore
While I be steppin out the shower on a marble floor
I paid the IRS taxes send FedEx and faxes
This industry'll is like fuckin, fat bitches
All work and no play, I do it everyday
anyway cuz I gotta stay paid 40

Say that you got it all
Love the way you players ball
Everyday you're at the mall

We throw parties on big-ass boats, niggaz wrap they paper
Ultrafied all-inclusive trips, Montego Jamaica
Front row seats at the Ultimate Fights, shamrock and severin
Long expensive fuh-flights, up dere in the heavens
Fat ass royalty checks, fat ass cribs
Smokin blunts and drinkin brew on the blacony, barbecuin ribs
The more scrilla, the merrier
I represent the Ya area

I walk from Foothill and Paperscourt to Sixty-Seven MacArthur
To Freddie B house to make tapes with my potnah
Hit Arroyo Park, we had tapes for sale
Got a paper bag full of that, can't you tell
it's funky, everybody nod they head like this
I said bitch, and everybody read my lips
I got rich, suckin up the game from the O
and even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow
I survived cuz I got mo', game than them
It came straight from the prostitutes, players, and pimps
It was my destiny, I came the same every time
So don't question me, I transfer the game in the rhymes

I'm not a freestyler, don't rap for free main
It's Paystyle on mine, cuz I love money main
Landrovers and Toyota, Lexuses
Six-hundred feet twelve with them big ass motor Mercedeses
We don't be savin hoes, bitches be savin us
Bitch disrespect me in my car, bitch best to catch the bus
I keep a briefcase full of game, while y'all be ear-hustlin
Ain't no paperback pimpin nigga, we ain't strugglin

Say that you got it all

I'm Shorty the Pimp, I come funky
Again and again, they say when will it end?
Maybe never, cause I can still spit it
But I ain't rappin for cheese, I want meal tickets
Gotta start somewhere, and I'm past that
For the right scratch, I be the last mack
So stick yaself Pretty Tony
You tryin ta make a hit, but your shit sounds phony
Not like AT&T but like ET
You can't be me, so would you please see
If you can keep my name out your mouth
Cause you don't really know what the game's all about
It's bout feedin the family, not freakin in the Benz
Instead of rentin, pay for that roof on your head
And stop pimpin in your mind knowin you a trick
Put your hustle down playa go an hit you a lick

Ever since I was a baby boy 
I played with ladies like my toys 
Always said I'd never fall in love

Been doin this for eons, peons best to catch this
vision of excellence, precise rappin ability
Bout to make some dead presidents, macking a million G
The money though, it's got people actin funny yo
As soon as some niggaz get some light, they be like dummies yo
Products and puppets and pawns, gettin played out
When authentic niggaz step up, respect be layed out 
Major effect to your sector, I'm the corrector
Live and direct, waving my mic like a sceptor
Supreme exalted, universal leader
Descendent of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, creme de la creme
Spent years buildin with cats in the streets, so they my men
Again, GangStarr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days?  You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listening to beats to keep the cypher complete
Wether you kids be holdin, on the block all day
Or you be puffing lye, out in the back hallway
Or whether you being schooled, or in the library
Wherever you are Baby Pah, realize that your essence
is divine son, and let it shine son
As we refine son, aiyyo, this shit'll blow your mind son

I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

And all the girls they want to spoil me
My honey annoits me with oils G
After work she greets me, and treats me like royalty
Works with me, giving herself, by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame, or my ride
A lot of ladies out there, be lookin lovely
But they don't got no control of the their life, inside they're ugly
Word to Bugsy, and to Red Alert
Sway and Tech, and Funkmaster Flex to make your head jerk
Chicks go beserk when they see us in the spot
K-Ci, JoJo and Primo, creepin to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breaking hearts
While we're takin part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me
Baby Doll, because you're royalty
   
Whatever I do, Wherever I go
I want to take nothin less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do

Would mean, so much
What a difference and we walk hand in hand
I feel so real

Barney Rubble, gettin in trouble and fuckin up

Tell your baby to get your baby daddy to buy you a nail shop
or a beauty saloon, since he come to be the biggest tycoon
with methamphetamine laughs and heroin balloons

Six po-lice pulled me over laid a nigga on the ground
Searched my car real good I know you know what they found
I had the trunk, full of that junk
X-Rated lyrics, laced with the funk
No doubt, I was just about to flood the streets
Big boxes full of tapes with them dopefiend beats

Used my niggaz gold ropes and his Cadillac

A single thread in a tapestry

though its color brightly shines

can never see its purpose

in the pattern of the grand design

and the stone that sits up on the very top

of the mountain's mighty face

does it think that it's more important

than the stones that forms the base

So how can you see what your life is worth

or where your value lies

ohhhh, you can never see through the eyes of man

you must look at your life

look at your life through heaven's eyes

lai-la-lai...through heaven's eyes(2X)

A lake of gold in the desert sand

is less than a cool fresh spring

and to one lost sheep, a shepard boy

is greater than the richest king

should a man lose everything he owns

has he truly lost his worth

or is it the beginning

of a new and brighter birth

So how do you measure the worth of a man

in wealth or strength or size

in how much he gained or how much he gave

the answer will come to ya

to look at his life through heaven's eyes

lai-la-lai...through heaven's eyes(2X)

and that's why we share all we have with you

though there's little to be found

when all you've got is nothing

there's lots to go around

No life can escape being blown about

by the winds of change and chance

and though you never know all the steps

you must learn to join the dance

you must learn to join the dance

lai-la-lai...through heaven's eyes(repeat until fade)

K-Ci & JoJo,"Wooo! There's gonna be a lot of punchin' in this motherfucker
Y'all better be swift with that punch button Jack
Biggie, Biggie

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
'Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man

Come and roll with me, I really wanna show you
How I run the streets, I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's, I really wanna show you
Come and roll with me, I really wanna show you

I had the master plan
I'm in the Caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon' to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin' black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

Come and roll with me, I really wanna show you
How I run the streets, I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's, I really wanna show you
Come and roll with me, I really wanna show you

I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
Guns and diamonds
Bitches put they tongues where the sun ain't shinin'
Take ki's 'til they spot us, snakes flee with consignment
This kid he got his crib rated, police found grams
They locked up, his whole fam, moms, sister, his old man
Nigga bailed his moms out, then he told on his man
Now they home, actin' like nuttin' wrong, hustlin' again
He tried to be the next Frank White, and Escobar
Pickin' up coke, a fiend holds it in a separate car
Cooks it up 'til it's bright white, cut it tight right
Then he slings it to the fiends, lookin' like Fright Night
Coppin' the motorbikes, the scooters, countin' dough on computers
High technology dealers, to the users and losers
Half-leg DiDi, try to swap drug for TV's
Stores run out of baking soda from BK to QB
My niggaz die for the cause, .45 on the drawer
City laws made by Big, Nas and Biggie Smalls
Bitches, holdin' my weight in they titties and bras
My bitches out of state get busy while they pushin' my cars
Callin' me up, callin' me baller, call for they cut
Pretty hoes bring me my cash, swallow all of this nut
Seats on the Bent' say 'Nasty'
Push the dash for the stash box is where the cash be, watchin' for task force
'Cause I know they comin' but I'm reachin' my goal
Fuck bummin', I'm makin' sure I leave this whole game wit somethin'
Crib in West Palms for my dime, crib for my moms
Ridiculous, you lookin' at the next Nicholas Barnes, baby

Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing
That twelve o'clock the roof will be blowing
Drinks on me, up the cups, and
Midnight coming full thrust, and
Dick Clark holding it down, and
The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess
Same resolution, get the money
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne
Cause a person that know the words is hard to find
First soul train line of the year
Four, three, two, one

Its here and I like it
(Whoo! K-Ci y'all, K-Ci y'all)
Gonna pack the dance floor
(And do what with it?)
Rock the dance floor

I remember trying to count how old I'd be
When the clock struck twelve in the year two g
Medianoche finally near
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers
Just the man to usher it in
Big Will bringing the heat
K-Ci bringing the plan
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart
May the future hold more joy then pain
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain

Its here and I like it
Gonna pack the dance floor
Rock the dance floor

Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year

At 12 o'clock
Say what? Say what? Say what? What?

Made it through a tough childhood never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools

That's 'til I put my eyes on you
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on

Tell me lady how you like me
And if you want it harder baby, come and bite me
But do it lightly; cause that excites me to let it pop
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night

Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin me
I'm goin deep, it's the thug in me; so whatchu sayin girl?

A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
Got a lot of thug in me, that I want to put in you

How can I go on?

How can I ever get to feel again?
How can I ever get to trust you again?

Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?

I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot

Brothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the burbs!

I'll probably never have long money like Ross Perilli 
But shit we just want a hip 
Don't want the whole plate 
Don't put the two on the ten, don't ever perpetrate 
Like a lot of these fools I see on TV 
With the Armani Chanel Versus Versacci 
Why motherfuckers can't be broke sometimes? 
Sometimes it's cool to floss 
But don't buy an eighty-five thousand dollar car 
Before you buy a house 

They always said I couldn't rap, I just say bitch 
I guess the bitch, made me rich 
And now you wanna call me hardcore 
While I be steppin out the shower on a marble floor 
I paid the IRS taxes send FedEx and faxes 
This industry'll is like fuckin, fat bitches 
All work and no play, I do it everyday 
Anyway 'cause I gotta stay paid 40

Verse Three: E-40, Too $hort 

We throw parties on big-ass boats, niggaz wrap they paper 
Ultrafied all-inclusive trips, Montego Jamaica 
Front row seats at the Ultimate Fights, shamrock and severin 
Long expensive fuh-flights, up dere in the heavens 
Fat ass royalty checks, fat ass cribs 
Smokin blunts and drinkin brew on the blacony, barbecuin ribs 
The more scrilla, the merrier 
I represent the Ya area 

I walk from Foothill and Paperscourt to Sixty-Seven MacArthur 
To Freddie be	 house to make tapes with my potnah 
Hit Arroyo Park, we had tapes for sale 
Got a paper bag full of that, can't you tell 
It's funky, everybody nod they head like this 
I said bitch, and everybody read my lips 
I got rich, suckin up the game from the O 
And even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow 
I survived 'cause I got mo', game than them 
It came straight from the prostitutes, players, and pimps 
It was my destiny, I came the same every time 
So don't question me, I transfer the game in the rhymes 

I'm not a freestyler, don't rap for free main 
It's Paystyle on mine, 'cause I love money main 
Landrovers and Toyota, Lexuses 
Six-hundred feet twelve with them big ass motor Mercedeses 
We don't be savin hoes, bitches be savin us

Verse Four: Too $hort 

I'm Shorty the Pimp, I come funky 
Again and again, they say when will it end? 
Maybe never, cause I can still spit it 
But I ain't rappin for cheese, I want meal tickets 
Gotta start somewhere, and I'm past that

Not like AT&T but like ET 
You can't be me, so would you please see 
If you can keep my name out your mouth 
Cause you don't really know what the game's all about 
It's bout feedin the family, not freakin in the Benz

You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time (ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Y'all niggas about to feel this
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms (ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Have one on us aight (ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin' homie
You'se a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sho' 'nuff
I keep my hand on my gun, cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin' on the outcome
Free 2Pac is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time it seems, they tryin' to take mine
So I'mma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion
I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missing
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas living lavish

I've got a pit named P, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And, I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream's to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal, uh
It feels good to you baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me,
I bust and flee
""These niggas must be crazy, what?""
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like cough blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you about life and about the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floating in the black Benz, trying to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm trying to get up on it

Clutch vacant laughter
In silence and sweet, sweet pain
Without demand
But with a longing
For what will never come again
I smell your perfume
On the sheets in the morning
It linger like the patterns
On the window after rain
A past that lives
If only for the present...
Which is gone and will never come again
To your sad eyes
Turned away, mine say
'Do you? Did you? How?'
As the darkness
Slides away the day
Shows what was
And makes what is now
I see your picture
As though it were a mirror
But there's no part of you
Outside the frame
Except the change that you game to me:
This will never come again
I am me
I was so before you
But afterwards I am not the same
You are gone
And I am with you:
This will never come again",Again,1985

Can't stop the therefore because

That you wouldn't know was fake

Well, I know that it's on your mind to go for good
Well, I know that all this time I have kept you guessing
Oh, but I'd tell you if I could

If I now said that I loved you
How would that seem in your eyes?

If my words, if my words turn out to be lies

Even though you might not believe this

That you wouldn't know was fake

Well, I know this silence just won't do me any good

Tu donnes un son à ma vie
Et puis j' sais pas qu'est-ce qui s' passe,
T'as ce regard dans la face
Qui me ramène à la case départ, là où j' suis parti,
Nous ramène à la soirée do bar quand on est sortis
Et c'est cette même complicité qui s'installe,
Ou quand on est sur la scène
Et qu'on brille sous la même étoile
Quand ta voix croise la mienne, que j'ai ta soul dans mes veines
Comme on va être cool dans les tiennes
Femme t'es belle mais quand tu chantes t'es sexy,
Flash sur elle, rock, soul baby

Un délice pour un macadam
Hm baby baby, si tu savais comme j'te hm baby baby
Crois-moi que l'atmosphère est parfaite,
Et plus tu chantes, plus je j' glisse sur la pente et j'perds la tête
Deux vies, deux voix qui s' rencontrent
Deux histoires qui se racontent
Une chanson pour le dire,
Y'a les mots, les images pour le décrire
Une belle rencontre à l'ancienne,
Prends un flash, y'a d' la magie sur scène,
Le rideau tombe et c'est terminé
Une belle collabo, des mots sur une feuille, pour se rappeler

Donne-moi ton corps,
Donne-moi ta soul,
Ton rock'n'roll

Va cours rattrape ta chance
Vis ton rêve la vie te sourit
En une seconde, un oui, un non

Tu passes à côté
Ne pense pas dans le vent du courage
Vas-y élance-toi
Tu seras reçu par ceux qui t'aiment

Ceux qui dans le fond d'un regard
En silence te comprennent
Et ils partageront les mêmes peines, les tiennes
Ces centains de haine, les fois où tu parles trop

Les fois où tu dis rien tu fais rien
Quand tu as l'impression de vivre
Toujours le même quotidien
Ne baisse pas les bras, ne lâche pas

Prends le temps de te dire
Qu'il why a un ange derrière toi
Relève toi, et va trouver le plus fort en toi au fond de toi
Le bonheur est au bout des doigts ne l'oublie pas

Sous l'œil de l'ange
Je suis venu te dire que j'ai su rester fort
Sous l'œil de l'ange
Je suis venu te dire qu'ils n'ont rien vu encore

Sous l'œil de l'ange
Je suis venu te dire que j'ai trouver la paix
Sous l'œil de l'ange
J'ai su pardonner et j'ai su le chanter

Il va falloir que tu saches
Ce qui se cache dans une défaite et
Trouver la porte dans le noir qui t'en sortirai
Et recommencer à rêver

see'est dans les rêves que se cache
La porte de l'éternel conte de fée
Ta vie tu la bâtiras de tes mains
La sueur de ton front

Sera le pain pour ton lendemain
Va, et sois le meilleur dans ce que tu feras
Ne baisse pas les bras et Dieu te gardera
Il te parlera de ça de tout et de rien

Il a les mélodies, les clefs do mal et do bien
Il fera ton histoire, il écrira demain
Il aura tes mémoires dans le creux de sa main
Va et sache que tu as tout ce qu'il faut
Et bien plus qu'il n'en faut
Mais donne-toi le temps qu'il faut, regarde en haut

Et garder la tête froide, se regarder dans le miroir 
En étant fier du reflet qu’il donne à ce stade,

Ne voir que l’essentiel, regarder la vie sous sa façade la plus belle

See'est KPONE Inc qui paye, elles le savent elles donnent un bon show
Elles dansent pour nous mais elles dansent pour elles aussi
Si on why prend do plaisir crois moi qu'entre elles en prennent aussi
Hot sexy naughty, dirty dirty baby,
Le corp de deux femmes ensemble putain que see'est sexy
Hot little lady, nasty nasty easy,
Danse pour moi, la nuit est jeune elle commence ici.

Si tu nous voit dans un strip club posé tranquille,
Que le Don Pérignon coule girl you can holla at me,
Nobody can do it like we do it et tu le sais girl
So shorty get down with me,
Now what you wanna do girl
Si ça part sur un délire tu sais ce que ça voudra dire baby,
Let me show you how to do girl
On fait ce qu'on a à faire bitch pimpin'ain't easy

Il va why avoir do sport, do cardio dans les cabines
J'ai l'impression que les filles en privée d'un coup deviennent coquines
Watch out, things may just get nasty,
J'ai perdu le contrôle de mes home-boy the shit is nasty
Des corps à corps endiablés, des danses spéciales en privé
Des strings léopard qui volent au dessus des rideaux fermés
Les esprits se réchauffent, la soirée s'enlamme
J'aurais trés bien vu Cauet ici tomber pour Clara Morgane
Et de l'autre côté do bar, mes homies jouent au poker
Et là encore autour d'eux des femmes déguisées en joker
Qui strippent ardement, à chaque coup de brelan
Et si le flush tombe, la danse est faite spécialement
KPONE Inc bon payeur, K-MARO bon joueur,
Et comme les deux ne font qu'un,
Tu as un strip club à son meilleur
Dirty dirty baby, you sexy lady,
Rapelle toi qu'after the party it's the after party

Si tu nous voit dans un strip club posé tranquille,
Que le Don Pérignon coule girl you can holla at me,
Nobody can do it like we do it et tu le sais girl
So shorty get down with me,
Now what you wanna do girl
Si ça part sur un délire tu sais ce que ça voudra dire baby,
Let me show you how to do girl
On fait ce qu'on a à faire bitch pimpin'ain't easy

My baby baby grind with me,
I like the way you put it on me (bis)

K-Maro,"On parle de frère, on parle de sang, on parle de respect
On parle de ceux qui ne sont jamais partis, ceux qui sont restés
Malgré les coups et les colères, malgré les claques et les galères
Ceux qui se rappèleront toujours du mot ""amitié""
Ceux qui te parlent et que leur regard est sincère
Ceux qui te prennent sur leur dos pour sauter une barrière
Ceux qui ne connaissent pas la peur quand on marche ensemble
Ceux qui on le même cri la même foi même quand le cœur tremble
Mais ce monde a perdu tous sens d'unité
Tout sens d'humilité, le bon sens c'est arrêté
Les soldats tombent la trahison en bouche
Mort de regret, et le soleil se couche
Sur la nuit de ceux qui avaient leur noms gravés dans leur prières
Qui aurait pu dire aujourd'hui qu'ils ont pavé leur vie d'hier?
C'est pour ça que j'en ait fait mon combat
Et je vais gardé les miens aussi longtemps que mon cœur tiendra

The sun don't shine forever
Faut qu'on se lève, faut qu'on se bouge
Faut qu'on se parle et faut qu'on se batte together
Autour de nous il y a trop de gens qui perdent le nord
Il faut qu'on reste fort et qu'on y croit encore
The sun don't shine forever
Faut qu'on se lève, faut qu'on se bouge
Faut qu'on se parle et faut qu'on se batte together
Autour de nous il y a trop de gens qui perdent le nord
Il faut qu'on reste fort, les frères existent encore

S'il fallait qu'un jour ce monde soit plus fort que moi
Et qu'il m'enlève tous les miens tout autour de moi
Ce sera the perfect time to say goodbye
Je partirais le cœur fier with a tear in my eye
Alors on s'attache et on lâche pas
On a un code d'honneur sur un frère, on crache pas
Les mots, on les mâches pas, les promesses, on les casses pas
Si y en a un de nous qui reste, on reste tous et on passe pas
On sait ce qui nous unis, on sait ce qui nous détruit
On sait que trop donner, peut nous revenir en mépris
On sait que tout ce qui monte redescend
Alors on ne prends rien pour acquis et on avance à pas prudents
Dans les hauts, dans les bas, faut rester entier
S'il y a des vents qui soufflent, frère, faut rester ancré
C'est pour ça que j'en n'ai fait mon combat
Et je vais garder les miens aussi longtemps que mon cœur tiendra

The sun don't shine forever
Faut qu'on se lève, faut qu'on se bouge
Faut qu'on se parle et faut qu'on se batte together

J'ai plus le moindre soucis
J'ai le mal qui fuit
Tu donnes un son à ma vie
Et puis j'sais pas qu'est-ce qui s'passe
T'as ce regard dans la face
Qui me ramène à la case départ, là où j'suis parti
Nous ramène à la soirée du bar quand on est sortis
Et c'est cette même complicité qui s'installe
Ou quand on est sur la scène
Et qu'on brille sous la même étoile
Quand ta voix croise la mienne, que j'ai ta soul dans mes veines
Comme on va être cool dans les tiennes
Femme, t'es belle, mais quand tu chantes, t'es sexy
Flash sur elle, rock, soul, baby

Complice on leur donne un bon son, like
À la T.V., Mary J. Blige glamourous, ton style et ton charme t'es fabulous
Un délice pour un macadam
Mhhm baby baby, si tu savais comme j'te mhhm baby baby
Crois-moi que l'atmosphère est parfaite
Et plus tu chantes, plus je j'glisse sur la pente et j'perds la tête
Deux vies, deux voix qui s'rencontrent
Deux histoires qui se racontent
Une chanson pour le dire
Y'a les mots, les images pour le décrire
Une belle rencontre à l'ancienne
Prends un flash! Y'a d'la magie sur scène
Le rideau tombe et c'est terminé
Une belle collabo, des mots sur une feuille, pour se rappeler

K-Maro,"J'ai vu des choses mon vieux, des choses qui font mal
J'ai vu des larmes qui coulent, des enfants qui ont mal
On n'a le droit de s'en foutre, c'est rien de banal
Le temps qui passe pour nous, pour eux est fatal

Mais, on n'est pas la pour la pitié
On n'est pas la pour pleurer leur sort
Je voulais que cette chanson leur soit dédiée
Que tous ensemble, pour eux, on y croit encore

Aucune raison n'est bonne pour un enfant de souffrir
Il n'y a pas de raison pour une âme de ne pas sourire
Mais la vie a fait que pour certains ce n'est pas pareil
Il y en a qui viennent au monde déjà prêts pour

Un long sommeil
C'est triste, et il faut faire quelque chose
Il faut qu'on s'implique dans de petites et simples choses
Qui pour eux font la difference
Un sourire aux lèvres, un message de l'espérance

Lève ta main pour ces princes des ghettos
Qui ne voient que l'ampleur de l'étau
Qui tous les jours se battent pour survivre
En espérant un jour ne plus soufrir

Lève ta main pour ces petits princes de la rue
Qui ne voient que leur destin perdu
Et simplement que l'on se souvienne
Que pour tout le monde la vie n'est pas la même

La cicatrice reste, quand marquée sur un enfant
Mais leur visage s'illumine, à chaque main qu'on leur tend
Tu sais pour eux le bonheur ne tient à rien
Si je pouvais en faire sourire rien qu'un

Je me sentirais déjà bien
Ces enfants de la famine
Ces enfants des terres hostiles
Ces gosses qui ne l'ont pas choisi

Mais qui en portent des traces indélébiles
Parle pour eux mon gars, prie pour eux mon gars
Plus tu ne manques de rien et plus il
Y en a pour qui ça s'arrête là

C'est la vie qui l'a choisi ainsi
Sans trop savoir qui en paierait le prix
Et coulent des larmes sous un ciel gris
Malheureusement ce sont eux qu'on oublie

En espérant qu'un jour les choses changent
C'est déjà bien qu'ensemble on y pense
Surtout que je sais qu'il aurait pu être le mien
Ce petit prince triste qui me tend la main

Lève ta main pour ces petits princes de la rue
Qui ne voient que leur destin perdu
Et simplement que l'on se souvienne
Que pour tout le monde la vie n'est pas la même

La cicatrice reste, quand marquée sur un enfant
Mais leur visage s'illumine, a chaque main qu'on leur tend
Tu sais pour eux le bohneur ne tient à rien
Si je pouvais en faire sourire rien qu'un

10 ans d'ma vie sans parler même

Ça m'fous la rage, et ça m'donne l'envie d'réussir

Rien pouvait me détruire

De pas donner assez de temps à ceux qu'j'aime
De pas leur dire assez souvent que j'les aiment
De n'avoir la tête que dans mes affaires
D'essayer toujours de valoir plus cher

C'est la vie qu'j'a choisi, y a des hauts, y a des bas
C'est l'chemin que j'ai pris why a des riques a chaque pas
Je le vis tout les jours et j'suis fier d'être comme là

Tout le monde repars avec des souvenirs
Tout le monde a hate déjà de revenir
Pour ma part c'était parfait
du beau monde, du bon son so let's get dirty
Pop le champagne tout le monde est servi
Il faut que ça lève à ma mamière c'est party
Il faut que mes people dance et dance, dance
Ce soir je vous rends dingue, on bounce, on bounce, come on

Crazy, I think the boy is crazy
He got me freakin' baby
He got me losin' my mind
He got me losin' my mind
Crazy, I think the boy is crazy
But I just can't get enough

Ce qu'on va faire live ici

On change l'atmosphère

Come on girl

Crazy, I think the boy is crazy

K-Maro,"Yes!

What goes around, comes around.
What can make you, can break you.
What can make you, can break you.

Yeah! Aha-a-Aha-a
Yeah!

If there's no history, there's no fuel for the victory
A wise man told me, ""Don't be a witness of your misery.
Call the shots for yourself. 
Make some moves for yourself
Don't try to be too cool, make some rules for yourself.
Play the game the way it's played but
Make sure you are in the right time at the right spot
Flip your money over like a gangster would do
But keep it strict legit. 
It's like a weapon to you.
Keep your head down grounded, look out for your people.
You don't want to walk alone but make sure you they walk legal.
Stay out of trouble, you'll be rich like hell
Every wealth has to double, don't start with them grails
You're a man know! No longer a kid walkin' on the ground
If you wanna be like Trumph, you're gonna start right now!""
That's exactly what he told me. 
On November, 17th 1996 was the beginning of my dream. 

Hey!

[Chorus: x2]
That's my way of showing love to the game
It's about who I am, it's not all about the fame.
Hey!
That's my way of showing love to the game
Stand up! 
That's my kid. 
Love it or leave it, 
Love it or leave it.

When's the last time you ever see a dude like this
I moved my shit, get back to the crew I did. 
Make stacks of a few ideas, that's who I is.
They can't do what I did, get-in.
So now I'm a post, so they won't do what'ey did
You're gonna fail, don't do that kid!
Run from niggas that shoot between your eye-lids.
You see it in the news, but that's what I lis' (listen)

How dare you criticize when I pour my soul
How dare you criticize when I pour my pain
How dare you criticize when I pour champaigne
Cause even there, I'm gonna see what pork and pain
It's my game! Fuck out of here, baby, it's my house!
You wan't me out. Smokin' some like Amy Whinehouse.
I'm like No-no.. No,I ain't goin' no-where!
You can't walk with me for sure, I'll put you on.

Hey!

[Chorus: x2]

""Life will eat you, life will beat you,
Life will treat you like shit, put the heat on you
Your best bet when the time is hard, is take you one shot.
Stand straight flip it back on the bar.
And let them think you're weak now. It's all good!
They never cared about the weak, just starvin' in the hood
And let them think on whatever they wanna think
Blink on whatever they wanna blink
But don't you lose your focus, 
You're 'bout to win your strongest blink

For every loss, remember, there's a victory 
And every victory is a part of your dynasty 
Loyalty to the game will serve you
Respect the one above you
But only show love to the ones who love you
That's the game
Love it or leave it.
A whole bunch of players, only a few can beat 'em""

Es que de este amor ya no queda nada
Ahora tu vas a ver lo que se siente
Amar a alguien que no te ama
Temo ya que te arrepientes 

-Ya no hay nada que decir admitelo

Yo no me voy a morir tengo que seguir

What a wonderful world, world, world, world

Is this really a wonderful world, world, world?

[Chorus]
Out in the streets, streets
When the thugs play out in the streets, street
We blast that pistol
You's a damn fool if you don't duck, duck, duck
We do what we gotta do to survive, gotta stay alive
Even if the nine millimeter has to whistle
We can whistle while we work

Now I remember mama told me not to be up on the block trying to push rocks
She said, 'Cause that's the reason that your brother right nowin trouble with the cops'
I said, 'No way not me, ma'
But when she turned her back I stuffed the llello in my sock
Hopped on my BMX, and I'm out
Yeah, I got what the fiends need
If you need some weed, I got it
Got the powder and can rock it for ya (rock it for ya)
My first employer was my bigger brother
Til his ass got knocked and locked the fuck up
Stuck up in that system and I miss him
But can't stop eating meals 'cause he in there
And he should be happy I'm out so I can send him commissary
As I reach my territory, I jump off my lowrider
Yeah, that's my bike but you don't tell nobody
Soon as I hit the corner the fiends was on a nigga
Had to them bustas quit hatin' just 'cause my boulder's bigger
First I bust a ten, then I bust a twenty sale
Another fifty sale, shit today the fiends are spending well
Couple hours past and I got two rocks left
And I need to get these off
Walk up a few blocks where
Them niggas think they ballin', but they smokin' man
I tell 'em, I got them double up's
And sell my dope to them
If you don't tell nobody, I won't tell nobody
Paid them niggas two for twenty
I went home and I got pissy (pissy)
Drunk as a skunk, roll me a blunt
This is shit we do everyday
We can't front, can't front

[Chorus]

Well, well, well

It was just, one of them days on the ave of Lincoln
I'm just sittin' on the mail box watchin' and thinkin'
I just bought all my rocks and the fiends is rushin'
A little boy ran in the streets and his moms is fussin'
The neighborhood watch, they called the police twice
 
And my niggas always fight over a game of dice
Everyday it's like a story, it's so much drama
My girl just found out that I'm hittin' her mama
And my niggas who went to college, they never keep in touch
And my next door neighbor, he just stole the bread truck
He also stole a taxi, would brag and wouldn't care
He started pickin' up niggaz and started chargin' 'em fare

I guess the year was about 1981
I'd say I was about eight
Standing on the corner, bullets rang out
A little hoodster exposing too much
Niggas on my block play real robbers and cops
Big sis shootin' at niggas through the mail box
'Cause motherf**kers knew it wasn't no males in the house
Momma's at work, daddy who knows?
I got tired of wearing my sister's clothes
Young and shit, already on a role
Playin' look-out for the corner dope house
Start earnin' some clout
Got bigger, developed a figure
Got me a nigga, and then my thang start learnin' the game
Separating the real niggas from the lames
The street light's 'bout to come on
I gotta go home, ain't shit changed

[Chorus]

Well, well, well, well

Yo, I got needs and stuff, I had to be poppin' marry
I hit her with the 'Is you is, or is you ain't my baby?'
I know a Tom, know a Jerry, call 'em 'Su and Eve
I be goin' down in history, not a cliff, like Heath
Where beef comes from size, and give me 'em all baby
And what, what, no motherfuckin' gravy? (no gravy?)
Y'all have made me, Taz-mania mad
An I heard Damizza got him a little Arabian lad named Hodgi
Doin' his thing like Sagi
I'm tired of seein niggas do it
Time to watch me
Y'all remember the channel, the time and place
Just get on the couch, a floor, and find a space
Moms and pops worked all week to get the phatter place

So your little ass had a TV on Saturday
I know I took ya back, you ain't gotta thank 'Su
Just remember, you rascals is little and I will spank you

But I never cry, I just took a step

And to the one that fit, is for the street
And contents of the Pressure

You make me feel, but my man John Salle'
We keep it down, Figure Four kinda love

I pull out the mic, and shock MC's for spite
Whatever I write, magnifies heavenly sight
You said you shinin', but that really means you reflect
I absorb light within my pores and then connect
With the righteous one, he told me son, ""Forget it
Live your life for the truth don't anyone ever let it.""
Shed often, trapped on the Earth light walkin'
I meditate day to day so I can stay on the right path
How many know just what I'm feelin'?
The Eart keep revealin' songs you can't sing
To the non-believers, deceivers that can't see this
They blind to the fact but I can't relax
I keep runnin' see the light towards the sun and
They keep shunnin', but I bow my head to The One and
I can't lie, so you for it, I want to fly
Up to the heavenly hills where love chills

On these whack rappers, cause they never knew the time
Easy to find, out the way things are
But how it's supposed to be is to far
For your mind to grasp so you follow the ma**
Playin' the role of a mack, but deep inside the mack knows
The spirit is under attack, and I lead the war
With my battalion, lyrical stallion, riding
Dividing the sheep from the golden lyrical quote
If not you could get smoked, by the mind is sore genius
I mean this I guarantee you never seen this before

My rapid raps, open a whole fire bun

Yo, my war's against the foundation
Of a global united nation
When humans rule the world
By the codes of free mason
Hallucinated, by the quest for domination
An equation, which equals the battle station
Ready to bust, capture and crush
Move a nine of us, stealth style rebellious
Prefer profile, cause the beast is hideous
So move agile, seek the facts and compile
More wisdom, smokin' isms
That your knowledge and your children
Give thanks and it has nothin' to do
With the f***in' Pilgrims
Startin' the curriculum, the Devil wants to be Ichiban
Interception is how this is done
But by the locks of the dreaded don aka Red 1
We'll emerge the champion cause the war is on
So grab your Teflon, your muskets and your swords
And peace love and unity will be your reward

A new sun, a new earth has begun
Metabolical rates are changing, rearranging
This rhyme is entertaining and visually stimulating like an impressionist painting
Oooh, yo come follow me, what's the definition of a real MC?
Is it looking hard on mtv?
Or freestyling in a back street all-ey?
Muhammad, it's the return of the common

From King Street to Eglington, we don't run

I find this, very stimulating to the mind
But drives me crazy at the same time
Am I this or that? human or black?
Extra terrestrial or right side of the tracks?
In fact, the shoes itself could be confusive
Here's a little story from the time that's illusive
I knew a girl by the name of Roxanne, met her in eighty-six
At the local band stand
New tracks, suit, fat laces white sneakers
Moving to the sound coming out of the speaker
Last week around Queen and John, I saw her at the corner with a business suit on
I said ""what's up girl? you still check the vibe?
Remember De La Soul? Diamond D? And the Tribe?""
She said ""no, no, I just don't listen
That stuff on the radio is not to transmission
Same beat, same lyrics, same song
I listen to my old school tapes to get it on""
I said ""word up girl? I know what you mean
It seems we're all trapped in the glitz and the gleam
The truth's just hidden for now, so don't sweat it
So here's a cassette"" and then I jetted!

Come inside, the sun is high

Escape to, the outside

Told myself to forget it, ignore it, leave it
But just when things started goin' great
It rang again, I said hold up, wait

He said, ""What? Aiyyo, you disrespectin' me?

You commit, when you sit in the past Don't you know?
You construct a future based on everything that you know
But to get to the unknown, we surely must erase
All the preconceived notions they keep throwin' up in our face

And break every record, in less than ten seconds""

I can also be your style, because I analyzed it
You used to rock, but now you paralyzed it
Doesn't really matter like platinum blondes
Think what is an MC if he can't drop bombs
Don't really matter if it's over your head

Inside the hate of a present day
Got stepped after, being genuine we're swept away
Before the importance of diamonds, bells
And a platinum place, fallen from grace
Not my campus with another trace
Of the same thing I came in, this thing is worth saving
Standing in the pockets holding tongues of what I'm saying
Blaming myself only for supporting what they're playing
I may peek through the storm, but now it's raining
Unchanging of late, it's hard to be creative
Although creating is native to me, I tried to be
Even patience couldn't save it, from the days of pages
They couldn't believe I would say this
No longer without wings, Kamau is what my name is
Too many undermine, what I underline
Placing my poetry underneath their making of rhymes
It was a creation of frustration
Brown bricks or blank slates
Subway trains and cardboard bound with masking tape
It was the sound of the evening, the way the day grew late
Words tumble from lungs over my tongue
And gave a new taste to my fate
It doesn't even matter how the chatter would paint us
With love on our side they could barely stand against us
Um, what up? Uh Kheaven, what's goin' down?
Um I got your message, and uh yeah, basically call me back
Basically call me back and tell me
Sorry about the length of the message, but you know
You feelin' it? Aight man peace

But you're everything I saw, again
And hoping to pretend
I was knocking on heavens door my friends

Of the light anymore

Contrary to popular belief
You know what, yo

This is not a love song, it's a sonnet
Damn it feels good to have people up on it but
I'm just a fool playing with the master's tools
Learning how to break the rules of this record company pool
Hallucination, I see with my eyes
But my heart's telling me lies, why do I fantasize
Why am I telling lies to the people from the stage
Pretending it's all good when inside it's fire and rage
Cause I can't understand
How a man lives off the life of another man
Trying to pimp the universe, that's a joke
I stay rocking the boat down to my last note
It's murder she wrote, assassination vocabulary
I see your termination is heavily necessary
I should'a known, they do it for Forbes alone
I do it to break the walls if I fell off then let me know people

But alas, pop, pop, never thought to keep me in style
That's why I'm schizophrenic now so
God bless the child that has his own
The harvest we reap is what we sown
Chrome microphone, shoot it, towards the dome
Of computer digital clones, that mimic philosopher stones
Saying the style's their own, when they bite like mike from Brownsville
That sounds ill, relationship is a mirror
But ch'ya see yourself within, and the picture is clearer
That's why I'm on the scene wit a mic, like Ernesto Guevara

They stand around and keep talking
They tried to clip my wings

Just takin' sips but I don't skip
Just makin' trips so I don't tip
These papercutz just ain't enough
They makin' hits, and I can't touch
Just look at Hammer now
My grammar is tighter, provider
In light of freedom fighter, rhythm writer and rappin'
And yet you don't try it
Because you can't buy it
I saw you grippin' and slippin'
And fool, I'm so tired
Of fake emcees and you best believe
Got tricks than trade up my sleeve
And I pray to God when I'm on my knees
That I can break it, cut this paper, paper

For the answers to impossible questions that ain't true

Makes me human, that why I humanize 
I came to make it break and make it equalize

There's one place left to go and everybody knows 
Things are going to change. There's only better days coming.

I'm back from sabbatical, this mathematical magical stealth with the microphone 
Seeing knowledge as self 
Itâ??s here to elevate, regulate, or discombobulate 
The weight of illegitimate fate now.

It's probably my last time but maybe not 'cause I've 
Got a new style, it's what's up 
Pain of the people means pop don't stop

Ripping apart, its stereotypical art 
Holding me back 'cause rap's not afraid of the dark

I hope some way our hearts can change the weather

And I write these lyrics you can feel like braille

Haunted on each coast

I often see me floatin', but my shadow it weighs a ton
Call it baggage, I use it all to advantage

With glowing skeleton bones

Carry my penis, I'm like the man in the moon

Se quitó el sombrero muy lentamente
Bajó de su caballo con voz profunda
Le dijo a su lacayo

Fanfarrones que llegan inventando la guerra
Ilusos que resisten bajo el, ""No pasarán""
El sueño eterno como viene se va

Ahí está

Exhibiendo a las gentes sus calvas indecentes
Manadas de mangantes, doscientos estudiantes
Inician la revuelta son los años sesenta

Ahí está

Y ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo
La Puerta de Alcalá

Un travestí perdido, un guardia pendenciero
Pelos colorados, chinchetas en los cueros
Rockeros insurgentes, modernos complacientes
Poetas y colgados, aires de libertad

Y ahí está
La Puerta de Alcalá
Y ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo

La miro de frente y me pierdo en sus ojos
Sus arcos me vigilan, su sombra me acompaña
No intento esconderme, nadie la engaña

Es que me estreches

K-Paz de la Sierra,"Salieron de madrugada
Se oía el canto de los gallos
Iban a ser dos jornadas
A lomo de sus caballos

La fiesta se celebraba
En el rancho del pitayo
Su padre les dio un consejo

Cuando a partir se aprestan
Cuiden muy bien el pellejo
Porque la vida se acaba
En las palabras del viejo

Los tres hermanos pensaban
Pedro le dice a Fabián
Dale un trago a José Luis
Que beba de ese mezcal

Pa' que se sienta feliz
Que ahorita nomas llegar
Nos vamos a divertir
Cuando arribaron al baile

A bailar se dirigieron
La muerte andaba en el aire
Ellos no la presintieron
Como les dijo su padre

Cuando del rancho salieron
Eran muchos los rivales
Viejos rencores surgieron
Rondando tras los jacales

Abrieron todo el fuego
Así matan los cobardes
Cuando los acosa el miedo
Un viejito solitario

Sin esperanza ninguna
Cuida el rancho y tres caballos
Como toda su fortuna
Va al panteón de vez en cuando
A visitar las tres tumbas

A venderlos a la capital
Cinco pesos será el menor precio

Que si son pajarillos silvestres
Les dirás que su tierra no es esa
Que los traes desde tierra caliente

Que dé a diario yo vivo en los campos
Disfrutando de la primavera

K-Paz de la Sierra,"Acompaño a mi sombra por la avenida
Mis pasos se pierden entre tanta gente
Busco una puerta, una salida
Donde convivan pasados y presentes

De pronto me paro, alguien me observa
Levanto la vista y me encuentro con ella

Oí, no más
K-Paz de La Sierra

Una mañana fría llegó Carlos III con aire Encima
Se quitó el sombrero muy lentamente
Bajó de su caballo con voz profunda
Le dijo a su lacayo

Y ahí está La Puerta De Alcalá
Ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo
La Puerta de Alcalá

Lanceros con casaca, monarcas de otras tierras
Fanfarrones que llegan inventando la guerra
Ilusos que resisten bajo el, ""No pasarán""
El sueño eterno como viene se va

Ahí está
La Puerta de Alcalá
Y ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo
La Puerta de Alcalá

Todos los tiranos se abrazan como hermanos
Exhibiendo a las gentes sus calvas indecentes
Manadas de mangantes, doscientos estudiantes
Inician la revuelta son los años sesenta

Ahí está
La Puerta de Alcalá
Y ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo
La Puerta de Alcalá

Un travestí perdido, un guardia pendenciero
Pelos colorados, chinchetas en los cueros
Rockeros insurgentes, modernos complacientes
Poetas y colgados, aires de libertad

Y ahí está
La Puerta de Alcalá
Y ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo
La Puerta de Alcalá

La miro de frente y me pierdo en sus ojos
Sus arcos me vigilan, su sombra me acompaña
No intento esconderme, nadie la engaña
Toda la vida pasa por su mirada

Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala
La Puerta de Alcalá
Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala
La Puerta de Alcalá

Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala
La Puerta de Alcalá
Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala
La Puerta de Alcalá

Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala
La Puerta De Alcalá
Mírala, mírala, mírala, mírala

Tu nombre,tu nombre
Y comienzo a sentir la nostalgia en mi ser, 
Sin poder evitar un lamento de amor, sin fin.

Oh, oh, y aquí estoy, esperando por ti,
Sin poder entender que me hizo alejarte de mi
Y aquí estoy, 
Quiero ver si por fin te decides volver 
Y creer que es posible empezar, una vez mas.

Hoy he vuelto a sentir el deseo de hablar y decir, que te amo
Que no puedo olvidar, esos días de ayer, que hay momentos
Que ya, no me puedo calmar, sin ti.

con gusto escuchare.

supo llenarte mas que yo
claro que se perder

no tienes porque disimular
esas lagrimas están de mas
si tienes que irte vete ya.

que te quedaras pero
el agua hay que dejarla correr

I'm with it though, she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe, Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend, damn they was close
Let's reunite, let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though

Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say ""Boy you got it made
Do you got a cape?"", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait?

Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on?
But, then that let's people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that

You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin'
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin' online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, uhm world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
'Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out

We was 15 with a ASR up in my house
Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin', he made it rappin'

D'où qu'on soit, d'où qu'on vienne
Les laisse pas fissurer ton mental
Si tu gardes la force, la foi
À la fin c'est les rageux qui auront mal

Il a dit qu'il était le meilleur d'sa géné'
Je vais jamais me gêner, tu captes
J'ai même pas ton réseau et tu câbles
On dort plus, nos vies font qu'éviter des tempêtes de sable
Et, tes négros, ils croient faire du sale
J'ai de quoi faire, tu parles
La ferme, de tout façon t'écouteras l'bum-al
Que des bukkakes, j'vous ai vu attendre mes sorties pour sortir vos balles
À tout jamais sur eux, et à tout jamais bien sûr de oim
Ils ont voulu nous griller, nous brûler
Mais bizarrement, tu sais quoi, le faire sans qu'personne les crame
N.E.M.O., écrit ma trame dans un tram
J'amène ta gonzesse au bal de promo, 3-4 bouteilles, de l'amné' et du charme
Avant que mon job soit les mots, j'étais comme Salomon, douze ans un esclave
De ce que les gens pensaient ou non de l'enfant que ma daronne avait à sa charge
Et puis j'ai pris l'temps d'prendre des notes, notes, prendre des coups
Envoyer le même tarif
Ouais on apprend vite et on parie, un peu comme Omar Sharif
Toujours sous son sari des équipes pas encore prêtes font crari
Tous mes vrais bougzers à l'Est, à l'Ouest, dans le Nord, dans l'Sud et à Paris
Et t'es là quand même, je baiserai la France jusqu'à c'que j'aime
Car la vie de mon père que si j'étais de ce pays on serait dans la merde
Y'a chozquel

N'écoute pas les haineux qui te veulent du mal
Rien est joué tu peux me croire sauf si tu baisses les armes
On est tous logés à la même enseigne
D'où qu'on soit, d'où qu'on vienne
Les laisse pas fissurer ton mental
Si tu gardes la force, la foi
À la fin c'est les rageux qui auront mal",Chozquel,2015

Screw (what's the deal my nigga)
Man, King Screw, dedicate this to you my nigga
We love you forever boy (straight up much love)
We ain't goin' never forget you mayn
Never forget the times we had (G love, know I'm saying)
Al-D and Z-Ro (ha) South Park Mexican

[Chorus: x2]
I'll never forget, the times when we crawled together
I'll never forget, the times when we balled together
I'll never forget, the love, hugs, smiles and tears
And the strength to help me conquer my fears

[SPM]
I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

[Verse 4]
Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

[Chorus: x2]

[Willean]
DJ Screw player, I'll never forget
Represent S.U.C., forever my set
I'll never regret, the times we got blowed
On the road doing shows, all across the globe
It's your boy Willean, and I'm holding it down
Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live
And if S.U.C. get a deal, it's goin' be a hundred mill

[Al-D]
If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

[Chorus: x2]",Never Forget,2002
K-Rino,"Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here
'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most
(Your heart's beatin')
And the friends that pretend to be your folks
(Your heart's beatin')
This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
Just make sure they learn the name
(You're not breathin')
That's about to be runnin' the game
(You're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side

To see if our lives was straight
And to see if we gonna walk through those pearly gates (yeah?)

On joue avec les mots
Entre fréros

Hello bande d'enfoiré, j'uis là bien en forme
Ces Diego Moltissanti vire l'argent, les morts
J'ai decidé de noyer tous mes soucis
Le procureur voulait m'enfermer le reste de ma vie

J'appelais Keanue Reeve
Qui me sorte de la matrice
Il m'a donné une pillule bleu
Pour qu'on sorte de nos tiz
Tous les jours on vie
Comme tous les jours ont meurt
Donc on vieillit sans se soucier de nos âmes

Connexion wifi pour qu'on consulte nos mails
Entend l'art trico M.C Barbare
On vient d'Afrique et on reste baba

Tous les jours je cours après le temps
Rime à la recherche de l'étoile filante
Donc toutes les nuits
J'ai les yeux rivés vers le sky
Et du coup je doute sur son existence

Tous les jours mes soucis 
J'les imagine a Miami 
Autour d'une piscine
Dans les oreilles du wizi
Chichas au bec pour l'inspi

Qu'on les menottes, pas pour les minettes 
J'cherche pas les guiness
Ni même qu'on m'reconnaisse

Assortis à mes shoes violettes
J'prend le large à chaque fois 
Qu'j'appuis sur play 
J'oublie mon manque d'oseille, 
Il faut qu'on s'taille car j'en ai marre que tous les jours ce soit la même
J'fais l'taf en feat tous seul au bout de, yep yep yep 
Tous les jours ont vis on meurt sans avoir vu leur solei

Y'a que comme ça que j'me sens comme un pilote de ligne

J'ai mis un micro sur mes lèvres mais pas d'adhésif

Besoin de voir les îles mais pour ça faut de la liasse 
Que j'arrête de chercher des portes de secours dans des impasses
D'ici faut que je me casse 
Vite faite moi la passe 
Que je mette une boule à face' toute
Dans la tombe de Christopher Wallace

Pas besoin de codéine
Pour mes frères j'uis pas prêt à jouer à la wii ici mais à la Scofield
Un flow sorti de l'asile
Découvert dans les champs de Smallville
Poursuivit avec une fin de Benny Hill

Passe moi le mic que je décolle du tarmac 
Que je le découpe avec les épées 
Que j'avais dans le clip de Sad Hill

Ils nous collent à la peau
Tous les jours ont survit 
En galère du ghetto
Entre fréros
Tous les jours ont combat 
La routine au micro
Et puis on rap tous les jours 
On joue avec les mots

K-rlos,"Malgré les galères qu’on vit chaque jour
Malgré les échecs, malgré nos doutes
Il faut savoir se relever, rester debout et ça malgré tout
La, la, la

Tous abîmés par la vie, tous abîmés par le temps
Tous peur devant notre château de cartes affronté le vent
Car la vie ne prévient pas quand il souffle
Repense aux haïtiens et lâche un sourire quand tu souffres
Bouffe de la vie, prend des kilos de souvenir
Vite, trouve de l’appétit dans ses moments intimes que tu vies en famille
Profite de ce paradis, car le bonheur se vie à la vitesse de al lumière
Mais la souffrance au ralenti
Dis moi qui ne connaît pas la douleur
Ne connais pas la peur de l’avenir
Dis-moi qui?
Tout le monde fait sa guerre à son échelle
Tout le monde cherche un peu de chaleur car on se les gèle

Tout le monde à sa manière de se soigner
Oui tout le monde à sa manière de prier
L’important et qu’on vive en paix
Car personne ne meurt sans secret et sans regret

Malgré les galères qu’on vit chaque jour
Malgré les échecs, malgré nos doutes
Il faut savoir se relever, rester debout et ça malgré tout

Ils auront beau marcher sur mes converses neuves
J'ai appris à garder une éponge pour chaque épreuve
Après chaque coup et chaque erreur
Je remets tous sur le A posé sur le pare-brise de ma vie
L’écureuil me tacle pour mes découverts
Je suis de ceux qui lise sur leurs prunelles mon avenir qui s'effrite
Et je suis pas du tout du genre à faire dans le biz et les courses poursuites
J'aime trop ma mère pour qu'elle vienne au parloir voir son fils
Malgré tout les doutes, les couilles je garde le front au sol contre tout leurs shouls
Alors on cours après notre passé
On se morfond sur nos regrets
Boy reste debout

Malgré les galères qu’on vit chaque jour
Malgré les échecs, malgré nos doutes
Il faut savoir se relever, rester debout et ça malgré tout
La, la, la

Un jour on m’a dit que l’homme était insurmontable
Que la patience et la foie étaient rentables
Que tout était dans le mental
Qu’il fallait rester fort pour mieux recevoir nos médailles
Que tu verras dans le miroir celles
Tu te rappelleras de cette victoire celle
Qui te réveillera d’un cauchemar
Car c’est dans l’erreur et dans la douleur et que la vie s’apprend
Dis toi que le bonheur est une décision qui se prend
Car c’est dans l’erreur et dans la douleur et que la vie s’apprend
Dis toi que le bonheur est une décision qui se prend

Mais plutôt des lits superposés cassés dans la nuit
Je suis de ces petits qu'ont grandi avec Michael Jackson
Et l'esprit pervers de Niki Larson
À l'école j'étais un Bart Simpson
Bob Marley dans le casque, on planait sur Kingston
Nos grands frères vivaient comme Tanguy
Et nos darons sur fauteuil se prenaient pour Al Bundy
Dans les poches c'était le Sahara
La daronne rentrait du taff avec les larmes de princesse Sarah
Mes potes s'arrachent, les neurones fument
Et ont la tête plus grosse que dans le Collège Fou-Fou-Fou

Qu'il m'arrive quelque chose de grand

Assis sur un banc comme bien souvent
La tête dans les nuages, comme toi j'attends
Qu'il m'arrive enfin quelque chose de grand, yeah, yeah
Les étoiles filantes passent pas souvent
Mais j'ai appris à être patient
Car je sais que Dieu est grand

Chez moi on grandit comme Luke pour finir comme Anakin
Ya ceux qu'investissent dans le look, ceux qui vendent de la résine
Moi j'ai choisi la musique, celle de l'oncle Sam
Pour avoir de la chance, toucher le mic comme toucher les armes
J'ai vécu dans la cabine de Phone Game
Avec au bout du fil, les couplets d'Iam et d'N.T.M
J'ai laissé mon A.D.N sur tout les micros
Mais c'est pas toujours avec les as qu'on remporte le full
Donc j'ai taffé mes textes, mon univers
Pour que ma musique rassemble plus de monde que Zuckerberg
Hein, tu sais pour rapper
Faut connaître la pointure de sa vie pour trouver chaussure à son pied
Donc j'écris mes textes sans faire le Mesrine
On m'a prédit l'échec, aujourd'hui je les signe
C'est vrai que j'ai quitté le banc
Mais toujours la tête dans les nuages en attendant quelque chose de grand

Je n'écoute pas son discours mais celui du mec debout sur un minaret
On m'a appelé Soprano par rapport à l'appel à la prière
Pas par rapport à Tony du New Jersey
J'ai pas changé
Tu peux me croiser le vendredi le front posé sur la chaussée de ton quartier
Bien sûr que je traîne moins au quartier
À l'âge que j'ai, ma fille me veut au près d'elle ou en train d'enregistrer
Ils n'ont jamais demander d'avoir un père célèbre
Donc je fais tous pour être présent pour ses petits zèbres
C'est fou comme les choses changent
Avant je jouais ma vie sur des notes noires, aujourd'hui sur des blanches
Je t'avoues des fois le succès ça me rend fêlé

K-Ruger,"Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My homie Marley used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin, 16 he was stuntin
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lotta flirtin involved, but dawg
Fuck all that flirtin, I'm tryna get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

What it do? I'm posted up in the parkin lot, my trunk wavin
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin', you see them screens fallin
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin
I'm leanin on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin somethin candy coated, crawlin like a caterpillar
I'm tippin on them four's, I'm jammin on that Screw
I'm lookin for them hoes baby what it do, drive slow homie

Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (Drive slow homie)
If you ridin around the city with nowhere to go (Drive slow homie)
Live today cause tomorrow man, you never know

You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live

And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby it's evident
You see a player flickin, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, ""Just a Lil' Bit"" (just a lil' bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin, through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie drive slow

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie",Drive Slow,2006

It ain't a problem at all when K solve
Three-hundred and sixty degrees rhymes or boulevards
Are charged, by my entourage, who put the Ram in Dodge
Bas cla in bumba claat
Maintain, few remain in the game
So I remain focused and pop's the main aim

Well it's the Funk Doctor Spock, the pon cock lyricist
My mentality's so def yo I ain't even hearin this shit
Biscuits be cockin back when I be coming
I guess they heard how I be takin MC's out by the hundreds
Wanted, for two million and a body alone
And use the microphone as my accomplice
Scientist still trippin, thinkin
What the fuck is this funky fungus that growed amongst us

Sprayed a few, shank a few, rap crews say they shamed too
But can't hang two, like we do
Fuck them, they better bow slow
This rhyme'll cold hit em, real quick cause I'm K-Solo
Battle any dude, this retifuge I'm in cruise
See what the better vet, could do, to you undouche
You three groups, four punkses at a time
I box two and knock em out at the drop of a dime

Workin a shifty hour like a burgular
My crew herbin ya like we never even heard of ya
Odds are evens, that I'mma be the one creepin
My new niggas check the flows of the major deacon
The bazaar, the rap non-superstar
When I step up I pump volume like rah

My afro blows in three-hundred sixty degrees
So this makes me, the light skinned Richard Roundtree
Vocabularies very, loquacious
And gregarious, pump that too, go grab the dictionary
Fly word that we flip on the M-I-K-E mike
My crew be like, this style's hype
Wrong's the opposite forget the bullshhhh
To rhyme like the K-Solo, you need more than a soul kid

Come closer, while I lock it down like I'm supposed ta
You battle me, you won? You might of, but then you woke up
My turbulence will make peanut butter choke up
Call me tha Brick City, Stock Cock Broker

	Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
	Your mom's in our business
	Now tell your moms to mind her business ""Before I let go""

When I first met your moms, I gave your mom respect
But now I see she knows me, I see that she suspects
I'm some bad guy, I don't know why
You have to tell your mother lies about you and I
But when your first told me, she said that I was a no-no
Cause of my haircut and people call me Solo
Before the time you said, you really didn't care
Now you tell me to change my name, or even cut my hair
How would you ever go become somebody's wife
And at the age of 22 you let your mother run your life?
Me, I'm not the type to tell your moms to get lost
Yell out loud to flip and get my point across
See I think you should tell your moms to leave us two alone
And stop reading our love letters and evesdropping on the phone
Cause if you really liked my, you'd let your mommy know
She gotta mind her business ""Before I let go""

	Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
	Your mom's in our business
	Now tell your moms to mind her business ""Before I let go"" (Repeat 2x)

Remember your sister and her boyfriend Sam Seed?
Your momma's the real reason why your sister lost her man
Her and sam went together, for a real long time
But Sam controlled her body while your mom controlled her mind
Not saying she was hurt when your moms made 'em break up
Deep down I could tell, though, your sister wanted to make up
With Sam, because she wanted to become his wife
And now she can't do that because your mother runs her life
You baby, you do the same things, too
You always want to to the crazy things your mommy wants you to do
Like when we went to the movie, she had to come along
I went back and forth and forth and back for peanuts and popcorn
She took advantage, cause I was living fat
I couldn't even watch the movie, she kept me running back
For something that she wanted somewhere else in the store
I walked and got it all til the man said there's no more
And when I got back to the car, she took her time to move over
When I sat in the car, my movie was like over
I was mad, hurt, I didn't want to talk
Deep down I wanted you and your mommy both to walk
I took you home anyway, like what the heck
Cause I was raised to treat people's mothers with respect
But when we got to your home, we wasn't left alone
She waited there in the car with us until I headed home
You called me on the phone, saying you were alone
But that's a lie because I heard your moms breathing on the phone
And if you really like me, let your moms know
She should mind her business ""Before I let go""

	Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
	Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
	Your mom's in our business
	Now tell your moms to mind her business ""Before I let go"" (Repeat 2x)

Without a doubt, me, like when I come to your house
She'll ask me crazy questions and start looking in my mouth
Her friends start laughing and I feel just like a jerk
I told 'em I don't know where my mom and dad work
I really know where they work, but that's between them and me
I can't be putting mom and dad's business in the street
Cause if I told her that my family both work for the state
Right after that she would've asked me how much money do they make
Then she'd go around the town, bragging and boasting
Telling the neighborhood what my family's grossing
Your moms, your moms, why is she so nosey?
She plays me like a game but I'm no ring-around-the-rosey
I even seen your dad at the family barbeque
He said ""I don't see nothing wrong with my daugher seeing you""
But it's your wife mister, she don't think that I'm charming
She thinks she's Mr. Whippit and she thinks I'll squeeze her Charmin
I promise I won't do this to your daugher, calm man
Cause when I'm with girls, my reputation is not harming
If I'm not on tour, I'm working out at my house
I'll pick your daugher up sometime, and I'll even take her out
And every time I try to do this, I see without a doubt
Your wife will follow me around like a cop on a stakeout
And when I told the man that, I thought he would help me out
Til he said ""I can't tell her nothing, she'll kick me out the house""
See, I know you girls, I know you girls, I know you girls, I know you girls
Mothers love you, and they're concerned
But if you don't solve your own problems, then how can you learn?
And guys, if you're in a relationship like this
Don't be afraid to tell your girlfriend tell your moms to mind her business
But after me and you girl, I'd rather stay Solo
Because your moms can't mind her business, I'm a have to let you go
Because your mom is in my business

	Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
	Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
	Your mom's in our business
	Now tell your moms to mind her business ""Before I let go"" (Repeat 2x)

Iced out to go with the rest it seems
More or less the more of the best you seen
Big buzz, only rolling with big thugs
We get in clubs you know you getting ya shit bust
Not too many ducks is going against us
If ya don't know now, you'll know when ya lift up

Never disrespect a nigga gripping the tec, it's my shit
Put the flow in affect with my clique
Go to the death, flow the best, my spit, I'm sick, it's my shit
Try to get slick and niggas is getting hit
You don't want that do you? It comes back to you
And I ain't even trying to rap to you, so suck my dick, it's my shit
Too many willing to pin ya in rap
put a ending to that, do the math with me
Straight to the lab, we're sending you back
Keep going, you know that no one can last wit me
Stay armed with the biggest of arms, got bitch-niggas hitting alarms
Every rhyme is strictly writing to harm

That why you running to a real rider like Twista, or Roysta
Let the thirty caliber anoint ya
Whodie won't even know he hit till he feel his shirt suckin the moisture
Voice ya opinion if ya want to
Kick-ass winner, kick up dust in the middle of the arena
Subpoena motherfuckers like the courts do
We'll blast shortly ya nuts bust and it won't be a misdemeanor
We them niggas that'll come approach ya
Shocking ya body our Bacardi keeps all ya nerves from bleeding
Until we heard no breathing, two undercovers,
we coming we get the dirty even, they know it's serving season
Shit is good as gone, cause I gotta bring the goodies home
The petty packing penny brushing with the pretty pearl handle
Pistol, Pelle Pelle pants and the hoodie on
And you coming with the Midwest shit?
Remember how we took you, you tripping off how we did that shit
Somebody tell me where the weed at
Some niggas knew I was about to snap so he hid that shit
I was gon' get buck, come hard, get crunk
Go into a thing and let the rhyme ride,
and hit them niggas from the blindside
And take the whole opposition down with my dog 5'9
Ceremony for the killers, busting 'em off,
and coming off so you can bust yo' nut
Though I'm bout to bust yo' guts

You can you meet me meet me in the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky!
You could meet me in the sky, (You can meet me in the sky!) the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky.

They done give me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high! 
They done give me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high!
They done give me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high!
They done give me my wings! Let's fly, high, high, high, high!

I done made it up the mountain, lookin' down on the valley, and I'm feelin' I can fly, so I dive off the cliff.
Hear the little kids scream; they don't know I got wings.
'Til I sprinkle them with the dreams, and I hit 'em with the gift.
Say 'Bye bye' to them haters, haters.
No more lies .. they can't fade us, fade us!

Graduate to the new skyscrapers!

When we put 'em on a level that's if you can deal with! We take it to 'em runnin' nothin' but realness!
Surely livin' in the life, it's for the thrills. We went up and over the hill, went through the whole drill!
Haters try to kill with kindness, when there's nothin' they can do to to the finest.
Though they won't dare cross over the line, for tryin', y'all know what's gonna happen, so they might as well remain behind us.
Way behind! We go to hardcore grind, and never take an issue for granted since I'm cool they go and take it for weakness.
Better take it in stride!
They don't wanna see us alive, but you always steady creepin', reapin', weepin', niggas went and got in way too deep in (deep in).
You gotta practice that before you start preachin'. (preachin')
But ain't no way that they can keep up (keep up)
'Cause we keepin' the heat on. It really don't matter where we can meet up!

[Chorus]

Nigga had it bad, cause I never had (...), thought the rainy days was over!
Livin' in the past, livin' ghetto fab', never lookin' back!
But the fact is that I never went nowhere!
The truth is, me and my own ghetto got a love affair. (got a love affair)
It's so real, things we did, my conscious outta here.
I don't care, I deserve everything I earn.
Hell yeah I deserve some pain! I know I hurt!
Stop talkin'! Night-walkin' real night stalkers, zoners, hungry, heard it here first!
If you don't believe me, with wings I'll lead you!

Playa hater hate! They can hear me but they better stay away or see Krayzie look insane!
So if they wanna hate me let 'em hate me from the bottom, way up underneath my feet.
'Cause really I've been turnin' them leaves to never ever let the suckas rise, or let them bustas kill the high.
'Cause they jealous in the mind, they remind me of gravity always grabbin' at me pullin me down.
Passed on for the flight, keepin' me on the ground.
Still I rise and when I takeoff they fall. (they fall, they fall)
Raise to the ceiling, try and stay away from the pretender.
You don't really even get involved. (-volved)
We play 'em all from afar, in a distance. (distance)

And when I met Him in the sky, He had a body like a man and the lower body tellin'
The Lord that he had a plan to make Him sure I wasn't evil.
But I'm comin' with my people. Ain't no sequel, ain't no women, ain't no vessals.
I'ma settle with a scepter and a lethal dosage. I will live forever with a serpent on my head.
Little glory, that's my man! I'll be damned! If I comin' through, I'm runnin' with my pistol.
Weren't for Moses, I'ma die but I'ma come back with y'all (with y'all, with y'all)

Time to break you off, like the roots in music
Pick you which chick that I choose to move with
So if you would tell me who you crew with
I tell you who you are
If they can rap if whether you just with me for the car
If the day when a man drives
Is what drives a man and for it the man dies
For the things he believes in,
If so when he dies it'll assume the he's leaving
Believe me I'm keeping you satisfied
Put the drama aside and just ride,
We could do the darkest weather
Get rich, stacking the cheddar who would keep the blunt licked,
Give me respect and I bet we'll be happy together

Let me know what the deal,
We can roll we can chill,

Striding like Goliath and we ain't sweating the small things
We all kings, turn Vegas into New Orleans
Get cash money with no limit, man we talk green
Woman eavesdrop but sweaty you need not
You can join us, let me show you the way that G's rock
Never touch your purse, your chair or your door handle
Chivalry is dead for boys, I'm more man though
Love it when your Prada dress hotter than Orlando
Picture perfect portrait like you're posing for Van Gogh
The crap table, we sippin' on black label
I'm loyal, I die for my brothers, I'm raps Abel
I'm torn from the cloths of the Gods, defeating all the odds
You fake rap niggas y'all the facade
Y'all the miraged, meanwhile I'm talking to broads
Like after this awesome massage we can talk a ménage
Out in Vegas on business

[Chorus]
We out in Vegas on business
My briefcase full of big face Benjie's
We flyin' by you on the freeway
We spendin', we spendin'
Like all this money burning my pocket
(Conducting organized business, business)
Like all this money burning my pocket
(Conducting organized business, business)
Out in Vegas on business

Yeah, let's hit the strip and smash
Bright casino lights bouncing off the tinted glass
Pull up to the Caesars Palace, pour Louis in the glass
Bartender didn't ask, I'm a repeat customer
It's written on my face, I'm a elite hustler
If life is a bitch I'mma just keep fucking her
Raised in the gutta and I don't miss my home
Italian sports car, French cologne
Of African descent blackened by the sun, dark skin Capone
On capitalism, a rapper eatin' rappers so that's cannibalism
Yeah, you bastards shoud listen I'm on a Hannibal mission
A Carthaginian king burying gold
Bringing the troops to the 7 0 2 area code
Meet on the roof of that Bellagio
The helicopter's waiting on the helipad
Talking code when we in front of that pilot though
Keep our business on the quiet yo
It's hoes in the desert for whoever try to know
Ay yo, land this muhfucka on the Venetian
They got a decent Louis store, I need some shit for this evening
See they finally let the G's win, celebrate our achievements
Pussy niggas don't wanna see they better leave then
We here on business, we mixing it with pleasure
We some pussy pirates these bitches gettin' the hidden treasure
I bet your boyfriend he can tell you're getting fresher
Like, ""where did you get them shoes and that shit that's in your dresser?""
Your Vegas trip with your girls was so regular
Till you ran across me and my predators
We caught you slippin' and this ain't shit but a business trip
When you tell him use censorship
We in Vegas on business, conducting organized biz

K-Young,"Me and my baby started out like two peas in a pod
Me and my baby, nothing can come between she and I
That's my lil misses, little fly, little chick, thick little thighs
Everything I'm into, she alright with it, and she on tip, she on mine
I'mma slide right in, get in her mind cause she's a kepper
Any time she's with me, nah, she ain't gotta lift a finger
She ain't gotta spend a dime, she around me all the time
Cause she's so cool, even my friends don't mind
That's my lil misses, always so calm, always so kind

Lil misses on my mind, misses on my mind
I look forward to her call, I enjoy when you talking
Lil misses on my mind

She never waste my time when she on my line, she stay on my mind
Oh my god when she blow me, she blow me good, it blow my mind
I'm on tour right now, now she texting me saying
I was out doing ecstasy, molly and coke with four of my girls
And I think I gotta throw up and go and lie down
I look at my phone like wow, I think about all the patron I downed
Maybe that's your business, no judgement here, baby that's your lifestyle
She said, ""I'm so glad you not mad""
I said ""no my doll, but I gotta get to stage right now
But please be careful hanging with the all night crowd""

My lil misses on my mind, misses on my mind
Hanging out, poppin' pills, now she sniffin', now she's real
Caught me trippin' on my line

I came back from tour, she done got skinny with acne
She got her hair dyed blond and it's up in a bun
Her ass is flat and it's gone
I asked what the fuck was happening
She reached up and tried to slap me
I slipped and she missed it
And then ran in the bathroom and slammed the door
I was like, hell you alright?
All I heard through the screaming was something about me following chicks on snapchat
And her having pics of me and her in the sack last
And she 'bout to go sell it to a site
She even told me she already sent an email to my wife
Damn, my lil misses blackmailing me and shit
I guess she fell for the hype

My lil misses on my mind, misses on my mind
You completely switched into another bitch
So now I got a psycho mistress on my line

For some reason I believed the bitch
Best thing I could do is tell my wife before my wifey see the shit
Maybe I can loosen her up by taking her on a vacation or skiing trip
Maybe I can lean in for a kiss and plead the fifth
Damn, shit was all good just a week ago until we hit a fever pitch
Now I gotta go on my phone and delete the bitch
Then I get a text saying ""I'm pregnant and I'm keeping it
I'mma get my child support and I plan on paying my lease with it
You ain't never gotta worry about hearing from me again""

It was all good, just a week ago, yeah
High in the sky and I played my role
It was all good, just a week ago, yeah
I understood and now I am alone, yeah
Ah
Call me
What would lincoln's bitch ass do at a time like this?
Shit, I'mma answer my damn phone",Misses (On My Line),2016

Niggaz know, niggaz know where we comin from
And it's gon' go down like this..

[Capone]
Yo, I gots no name, I cause pain, people'll cry
My size vary at the murder scenes, homocide bag me
Try to trace me back to my leader
I put niggaz in chairs to pine boxes way up under the stairs
Niggaz use red dots, make me follow they path
I hit cops, they be raw, tip is ten thou' cash
I'm metamorphic, I'm forced to switch
dumb-dums to hollow tips; unfortunate, you can buy me legit
I get heated when I separate my shell
with the pin in my back, I bang like (?) I got some nerve
They jam right? But I still get respect and heard
I hit niggaz legs for fame, my lead through, shit in the game
I leave a red stain whenever I'm sprayin
I'm known as the be	-you-double-L-E-T, and S-L-you-G
Enough'll make you D-I-E, Queens Finest (yeah yeah)

[Chorus: Algado & Shoballotti]
Yo stolen car -- top down, on point -- real route
Set it off -- thug it out, pull a heist -- peel out
Fingerprints -- ain't none, black mask -- no face
Cash flow -- no sweat, Jakes come -- no trace

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo fuck these niggaz let's ride on these niggaz
It's so simple Dunn I'm down and don't fuck around
Comb the hood, in two black Excursions
Lookin for this nigga so we can merc him
Parked in front of his building for like two hours
Been around the corner for a few hours
Came back, there he go, let's go, that nigga ours
Hopped out the truck, went right at the coward
The gun showers, rain on these niggaz they frontin
He didn't even saw it comin..
Hopped back up in the trucks, light the tree back up
I need that Dunn, havin to deal, with these fake niggaz
and fake bitches, give me that Dutch, it's never enough
Niggaz O.D. off of us (Queens Finest)
It's never enough, bitches O.D. off of us (yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
[Noreaga]
Whaaaat? Can I rap, can I rap?
We keep it under, no rotunda, with the fully thunder
Mad traffic, and I still buddy whack it
Put your name on the affadavit
just to save it, the project ghetto favorite
Laundry mat trap, the Yacub and the rat
Bill Clinton of the ghetto, respect my name
Tecs and 'caine, the rains nearly stretched the lane
Ridiculous, how my shit spit, fake fishes
Non-religious, Christians won't pay visits
Fast for a month, and mix a lot in the trunk
Ice fuckin full of skunk, double barrel of pump
Kick rhymes like priests, I'm a golden boy
I got a brand new whip, and it's stolen boy
Fiends love me, they see I'm still holdin void
(Queens Finest, yeah yeah, Queens Finest, yeah yeah)

[Havoc]
Watch me flow, a nigga like me all about dough
Bonin your hoe, and have her hard to find like 'dro
You know we Range Rov', come through, tinted lay low
But most of these niggaz don't show 'til ya blow
Don't, want to come through Queens, if shorty act stank
Be like, ""Mami won't you meet me halfway?""
Shook cause the crooked side done took a long trip
Niggaz on point runnin the gauntlet, fuck with
niggaz that heartless, picture me, you carcas
CNN Mobb shit, don't let us start to plot shit
Chill Dunn I got this, better learn from what I spit
Hail what the God kick, bow to what this nigga live
Bunch of dead niggaz get hit when they reneg'
Like it's hard to find your fuckin crib
I be up in the cut, in the bushes, pick up
last from where you took it, you hit? Now I'm good kid
