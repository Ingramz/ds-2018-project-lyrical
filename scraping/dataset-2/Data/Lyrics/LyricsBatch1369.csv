Bystrik Rezucha,"Through early morning fog I see
Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And you can do the same thing if you please

Pues que acaso hay alguien más aquí

Creo en los fantasmas terribles de algún extraño lugar
Y en mis tonterías para hacer tu risa estallar

Don't stop and lose your touch, oh no, baby
Hard times knocking on your door, I'll tell them you ain't there no more

I swear by stars above, sweet as honey

hang in and do that sweet thing you do

Now there'll be a day you'll get there, baby, you'll hear the music
play, you'll dance, baby

You can do it, roll with it, baby

C Company,"Once upon a time there was a little boy who wanted to grow up
And be a soldier and serve his country in whatever way he could
He would parade around the house with a sauce pan on his head
For a helmet, a wooden sword in one hand and the American flag in the other
As he grew up, he put away the things of a child but he never let go of the flag
My name is William Calley, I'm a soldier of this land
I've tried to do my duty and to gain the upper hand

But they've made me out a villain they have stamped me with a brand
As we go marching on
I'm just another soldier from the shores of U.S.A.
Forgotten on a battle field then thousand miles away
While life goes on as usual from New York to Santa Fe
As we go marching on
I've seen my buddies ambushed on the left and on the right

And their youthful bodies riddled by the bullets of the night
Where all the rules are broken and the only law is might
As we go marching on
While we're fighting in the jungles they were marching in the street
While we're dying in the rice fields they were helping our defeat
While we're facing V.C. bullets they were sounding a retreat
As we go marching on

With our sweat we took the bunkers, with our tears we took the plain
With our blood we took the mountains and they gave it back again
Still all of us are soldiers, we're too busy to complain
As we go marching on
When I reach my final campground in that land beyond the sun
And the great commander asks me, ""Did you fight or did you run?""
I'll stand both straight and tall stripped of medals, rank and gun
And this is what I'll say

Sir, I followed all my orders and I did the best I could
It's hard to judge the enemy and hard to tell the good
Yet there's not a man among us would not have understood
We took the jungle village exactly like they said
We responded to their rifle fire with everything we had
And when the smoke had cleared away a hundred souls lay dead
Sir, the soldier that's alive is the only once can fight

There's no other way to wage a war when the only one in sight
That you're sure is not a VC is your buddy on your right
When all the wars are over and the battle's finally won
Count me only as a soldier who never left his gun
With the right to serve my country as the only prize I've won
As we go marching on
Glory, glory hallelujah glory, glory hallelujah",Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley,2010
C Drake,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

C Los Beats,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'll keep rolin chrome (yaah)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (yes I am)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (I'm rollin chrome)

Brighten the mood up, when I'm spitting this all

Pockets get fatter, then a only makes them say matter
Squash all the chatter in the southern region
I pledge of allegiance to my niggas not breathing
We all still breathing screaming S.U.C.
And that's the story mafios, and P-A-T

Poppi in the gray lay with the with the fifth on the back of the lac
You know we ride chrome everyday
Having the ghetto dreams like my nigga P-A

And one thing's for sure man southside's riding

Where I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound
And it pounds from within and is pinning me down

Here is a page from the emptiest stage
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found that I belong here

The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat

And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found that I belong

Feels like home
I should have known
From my first breath

God send the only true friend I call mine
Pretend that I'll make amends the next time
Befriend the glorious end of the line

I fell in love for the very first time
With this girl she really blew my mind
Inner sense and whole lotta class
Style that could give you whiplash
We said hello and my heart beat stopped
She was the world and I was on top
Time went by, She filled my universe
We made love, She said I was the first
My boy kept tellin' me. Yo, I don't know
I think your girl's been playing tic tac toe
I'll ask my girl I know she only loves me
Wasn't I the one who took your viginity?
The look on her face read sorrow and gloom
She said ""Yeah, Why do you guys always ask that?""

Hey ladies
Have you ever had a man
Go away for business, come back with a tan
Comes home late at night from work
You cooked him dinner now you feel like a jerk
Sayin' he didn't have time to eat
And he's not even hungry, he wants to RETREAT
To the bedroom he said his head hurts
You're only makin' love in radical spurts
Mysterious calls and the phone goes click
You say to yourself  ""I'm gonna hit him with a brick""
Ain't no way he could be cheatin' on me
I wonder who bought him those BVD's
Dressed to a T to hang with the fellas
Over the guys and I'm getting jealous
Comin' home late smellin' like perfume (fume)

Bust it, baby I know you probably really

Digging in your pocket while you rubbing yo ass
Shit so big just put the club in yo ass
Prep the H2 park it right infront of yo ass

And make you jump inside the whip and smoke a blunt wit yo ass

My situations real, sadness goin' through me
Because my love is not here for my kiss
All I have is thoughts of yesterdays bliss
Images of you stay on my mind
Anticipating and waiting for the clock to unwind
Anxiety plays me as dusk turns to dawn
But I could take the wait
It wont be long
As confidence grows, I start to ready myself
Prepare myself for what lies ahead
As I dread the every minute I have to face without you here
Close but so far as the time draws near
How much more can I take, how much more, what can I do?
Just hold on tight and be strong
I know I'll make it through
Now's the time for the needs to finally go away
I feel you near  and it's a lovely day

Then I look at you
And the worlds all right with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

That was then and this is now
My pulse rate beats fast and at last you're around
I great you
My eyes cannot leave you
I just wanna squeeze you
As I bestow a gentle hello
I couldn't front and play hard to get
Because the boy was wrong
And I felt strong
Ever since we met
When you appear
The tensions go
Mentally calm
Becomes the body the mind and the soul
Let's cut to the chase
Before the time will waste away
So we can enjoy
The walks conversational play
Take a cruise to nowhere
Is anyone out there
Who cares
As long as you're here with me
The best is yet to come
Together well be as one
Our love has just begun
Guaranteed my love
I'll never go away
As long as you're around
It's a lovely day

I wish they could last forever
The rendezvous of coming together
Meeting in places of pleasure
Times we spent were so real
And I could feel, the everlasting love coming through to my appeal
But now the time has come to mind
That we must part and separate to
Make a start with that thought in mind
There's only one thing to say

Somebody's watchin' me

Because the spot getting hot tick tock
I see the devil clearer in my past It can't last

She in love with a hustler, someone she could trust uh
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckers
Sleep all day, and grind all night
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks
And even though sometime, it might seem strange
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she things

[Baby Bash]
Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance
And end up with a over jealous sucker romance
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
Now that's living like, who's the boss
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce
Even though she approached by them big time ballers
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa
And her parents just don't understand what kind of man she in love with,
But she don't give a damn

Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday
And fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes

Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Moms sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Hits fall, we thug niggas and we came in packs

And I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back

California's the state where punk niggas die. 
First thought be survival every mornin' when I rise. 
So many murders and homicides in front of my eyes. 
It's just some ballin' ass niggas down to die for the West Side. 
California's the state where all bustas die. 
First thought be survival every mornin' when I rise. 
So many murders and homicides in front of my eyes. 
It's just some ballin'-ass niggas down to die for the West Side. 
 
It could be the napalm, droppin' non stop bombs, 
Armed like vietnam, dominatin' like King Kong. 
Lyrical madness, step up, take up, and start blastin'. 
Wicked as Stephen King when my mental and vocal clashes. 

Syrran wrap, like a boa constrictor, wrappin' ya. 
Up from your feet to your neck, nigga, attackin' ya. 
These 4-5 hollow tips will have you backin' up. 
I only do my dirt at night like dracula. 
 
I'm wanted by the feds, these niggas, they want me dead, 
'Cause I done spread through their territory like the HIV. 
Sun down spots, suckas swallow glocks. 
If they know by these rocks I'm pushin' for the blocks. 

Every corner you past, that show will run him up in his ass. 
Gettin' the cash, while Mr. Bad puts down the smash. 
I dumps quick, my clique be so thick, 
With hi-tech mob shit, crooked as Soviet.

Movin' tapes like K across every border.

Inflict pain, on any nigger that step in my range. 
Retaliate with hollow tips, blast, and splatter your brain. 
So remain calm, this shit is see-4 bomb, 
Set trip off your motherfuckin' city like 'Nam. 

Best recognize, step up and check eyes. 
Ain't to many busta-ass niggas from the West Side. 
I do or die for mine, livin' life like I'm blind. 
Solo on a flame line, dumpin' hollow tip 9's. 

Survival first, ask questions later. 
Movin' patterns on your bitch-ass 'cause I heard that you was a hater. 
Oh who can save you? 
Defeated your purpose, now you caught up in some deep shit. 

Who got the deepest murder clique, that's some would sick. 
This game is way past wicked. Still I commence to kick it. 
West side niggers stackin' meal tickets. 
Surpassin' weak bitches, evadin' snitches, and sayin' bomb.

Might catch me at the Platinum, sippin' on some Hen, rolex down, 
Ride ST 400 Lex through the town. 
Clown, and you'll catch a hot metal tab up to the chest. 
Don't make me kill a nigga out east and head West Side.

To maintain my composure and attitude when I ride. 
Don' push me, I'm too close to the edge 
Might take one to the head.

Releasin' stress over (?) gin, laced with mud 
From day one I knew is wasn't no motherfuckin' love 
They use to jump doin' hands and now they jump in new as lust 
I was confused first to see a church 
on this hell on earth 
But it was them fools first to took earth 
for what it was worth 
I was raised in this great community, 
when there was no unity 
And niggas be on they own, 
as soon they reached (?cutety?) 
Be you and me 
Runnin' back, in a Cadillac 
Fresh of a jack 
With two straps in a Pontiac 
With only one life to live 
I guess the Lord had only one life to give 
It seems so trifully, bought a hill 
This fast nigga's life's a sin 
It's hell on earth, ain't nothin' worse 
Than givin' birth to kid

Doin' ten instead of me in my Benz on some twins 
Sippin' Hen smokin' indica bomb 
And keep my pedal to the metal til I'm high and gone 
I know you rich niggas hate me, can I keep it real and feel this rap shit?

Drop Mercedes, I'm the placenta of no love 
Til the lord save me, straight thugs that'll dump slugs

But I ride for these motherfuckers, when I don't even ask 
Thug fashion from head to toe, I let the world know 
That this is Thug Life, motherfucker, til I leave this ho 
So as my knuckles drag the concrete, big homies hit the streets 
Transgressions under pressure, preyin' on the weak 
I sink like a fish, I wish upon a ghetto star 
If the enemies come through and ride on me they won't get far 
Big homey got out, hold 22's on a hang 
Runnin' around, sweatin' motherfuckers, talkin' bout ""Let's throw them thangs"" 
Bang, I hit him with a bat and heard his skull crack 
Then I got him the wind in the trach til he shattered, to get the Mac 

[Chorus]

It ain't no love for bitch niggas 
As I dump slugs and pull the plug on you bitch niggas 
Pick up my phone and have some thugs hit you trick niggas 
Wit on gloves or low tommy guns on them stitch niggas 
Hit niggas with H-K's, split niggas with AK's when we mash for the cash 
Doin' a hundred, blastin' buck shots off in that ass 
True outlaws ready for war, souls will never die 
The same day we meet death, the same day we ride 
Dumpin' slugs with Tek 9's, more bulletproofs my 4-5 
I just let em fly, screamin' out ""Bitch nigga die"" 
We's about be a killer nigga, look outside 
Tell me one reason why I should pray for eternal life 
Born and taught in hell, with a gun store on every corner 
Bodyguard, bulletproof doors, it's hard to be a goner

Pushin' weight to my Eastend loc, he called me craze is grey? 
Like Tony but never phony, that bitch (?)

I'm bringin' it to em like this, Mob Figgas, real niggas down to kill niggas 
Five niggas, live niggas, lick and do or die, nigga 
Nine's nigga's time's tickin' when I blow your mind, nigga 
Call me AP-9, nigga, boogie's when we rhyme, nigga 
I hit the block and have it sold 
See my freakers hittin' vicious on them po's, that's the way the game goes 
On tre-low, I stay low, dippin crate loads 
Never had my niggas leavin nappy, runnin big blocks and cavi 

It's the hustler, you figure out I pack the biggest strap 
Boy, I get savage, fold some cabbage, paper chasin' is effect 
Real niggas lost the fake, and a war that's takin' place 
You might get chopped up by the gauge, you ain't the kind that can't relate 
Walk and trip into my car, stompin' a chop off in my drawers 
It's the hustler verse em all, so I blast if it's called fo' 
Your detective ass wears raw do', real niggas keepin' it inside do' 
While real niggas is ridin', that's how we flex when we despise 

The Mob Figgas, I grew up with these niggas 
Trust my life for real niggas, (?) be the first to blast 
so I don't have no fear, when I'm out here 
But life still be makin' me sick 
Had to feel the Gleec kick and see heat rip flesh from the unfortunate 
Allah bless your soul 
I know I was wrong but he crossed the real 
so I prayed that you will have understandin' and feel 
my story, when it's time to wrestle niggas to respect 

Real niggas out to get, out to get it on 
Screamin' ""Fuck em all"" wit my back against the wall 
They can't hold me back, I be the first to dump 
on the worthless filth punk as he jump, felts kick from the pump 
When my nuts was young, we see they hung to the floor 
And when they severs 2-11's like teflon dyin out the door 
What they know? We Mob Figgas, born in them savage times 
Fuck your average ass rhymes, nigga

One hand on the steel, trying to break a nigga's thinking
Ride with shoot, sharpening skills for season whatever the reason

Crying to Mama; I kicking the door to alleviate the whole situation
Fuck with me, he ended up having his whole family erased
Face it, no charges, leaving the body until you better respect game
Fuck that, when niggas spill fuck your hood
When your caught up in a twist flash on us, you'll end up sleeping

West Coast rollin', Benjamins foldin'
Nigga bank accounts holdin', more loot than the jews
And I just stepped fresh up out some county blues
Had me all on the news, 'cause I'm gettin' my paper
And my goal life now is livin' it major
Coppin' Crystal, Champagne
I'm in the 'Natti with the blow brains
Leavin' my mansion up in Spokane
The dope Game, was lovely
Out with the flip rollos and drop Benzes when they clucked me
Now the haters want to mug me, 'cause I'm AMG kid candy on some dub leech
But fuck them tricks 'cause they haters
They stick out like short thumbs around Playaz

Run up in him hit him with a blade up of in his kidney
And leave him face down, real niggaz don't play around
Paralyze that motherfucker from the waste down
'cause he's a bitch turned snitch on the next nigga
On sight I'm takin' his life with the Tec trigga
And give a fuck about his kid, 'cause he didn't give a fuck about mine

I knew he was a flunky, punk nigga dressed like a junkie
Runnin' around with a pound of bunk weed

See I'm all about the cash fool
Blast to get a mill and I keep it real fool
I owe court and the streets, fuck a deal
want to see me cuffed and stuck in the back seat of a cop car
When I got jewels and pull more strings on a good tar/guitar than a rock star
Cop car by the UB want to do me down like Doobie
Straight haters is what you fools be
Hangin' on my balls like newbies
You do three's dumped outta trees is how we do these
Enemies when we WC 'em down like my crew be
Pack heaters nonetheless and now better leave his
Bulletproof vest down in the Beemer
Hit 'em up we lead 'em then streetsweap 'em
We don't need 'em

Whipped his with his ass you'll be sold like blue balls

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
OhhhhhhhhhhhhOhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Verse 1: see-Bo]
Now see I be the man with all the plans
Trips and personal leer jets across the land
See me in bently in front of billboard live
Sipping on cristal crushed ice and lime
While I flex baggets and rubys on my wrist
My niggas be the shit like rotweilers and pits
Top dollers and fits markeys to kiss
Your four keds on my pinkie might crease your lips
Got offshore accounts swizes in japan
Need money machines to count the cash at hand
Push a candy green navy on unleves with four tvs
Gold real smiling like flaming young key I'm all about the money
And I mix it with the hunnys but not a trick
Hoes can't get none from me
Catch me in rag benz count my ends I don't hate we move tapes
State to state
Surprise to see me riding your town
So much ice it'll melt the whole city might drown
Forever stay a playa and ball with tycoons
Bentlys and mansions with like 15 rooms
Fall to my doom all I wanted was the cash
Lambouginis ferraris benz convertable jags
Rolex on my right bravado on my left rollin in sweat
On my personal leer jet tycoon

[Chorus]
All I want to do is to have the better things in life
I'm a tycoon diamond rings and live this life that's all I knew
Was to hustle day and night stack my chips and rub this ice
that's a playa's life ohhhhhhhh yeahhhhhhhhhhh

[Verse 2]
Double are's and movie stars want to know who we are
Quarter million dollar cars in six car garage
It's like a mirage when you step out on the deck
All I wanted was the best so I built the rest
And iced the neck then I spiced the deck with swimming pools and hot tubs
Private flights to met cico puerto rico peruvian flakes
Metro rap cakes that I'm getting for eight
I'm straight don't use it never do I touch
I put this 40 carrots and diamonds and get them crushed
Lost the fourtune and fame I'm pushing the caine
When the fourtune put us stressed to get the fourtune I gained
And still remain the same nigga swerving the lanes
With a cup full of crushed ice pouring the champagne
Smoking the dank while I'm holding a drank
West coast my motto toting all the dank tycoon

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I be a star to those who supposed to be hoes
But only hoes like those in skirts in tight cloths
And those a dealers played out with kangols
Had troppaz so I swooped up the range rolls
Got better hoes gucci sweater cloths
And went from V.S.O.P. to X.O.
From quarter karats to cares girlfriend
Then marriage with a baby to cherish
And a mansion for my parents
Timex to Rolex all gold to diamonds
Now I ""Bling Bling"" like Cash Money cause I'll be shining
My broad stays smothered down
And Victoria's Secret from a disc to her ass crack
Right price to peeping in all
I'm not a pimp I just live when I walk
Karl Kani boxers is fence because of my deal with warlock
Staking lobsters from pork chops
From pissing on lingers and knolies
To pissing criss down at the yacht tycoon

Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers
Before I let this police kid harass me

I might get backed up in the traffic
Niggas is dumping on me when I got my zapper
Creeping up on me when I had one hand on the wheel
One hand on the steel, trying to break a nigga's thinking
Ride with shoot, sharpening skills for season whatever the reason
I'm dealing with drama; send one of them bitchez-ass niggas
Crying to Mama; I kicking the door to alleviate the whole situation
Fuck with me, he ended up having his whole family erased
Face it, no charges, leaving the body until you better respect game
Fuck that, when niggas spill fuck your hood
When your caught up in a twist flash on us, you'll end up sleeping
With the fish singing, shoes honey singing
Them blues and them sad ballads
Fried colla greens and potato salads
So rounded them up; so many family member crying

There ain't no in-between seventeen in that place

And make the world feel us hit them with rounds; hollow tips
When we're finished, niggas chop they ass up

Impala S.S., Benz Beamer, to Lamborghinis and chase my strip
With X.O. Henn and Remi Rolex on my wrist; hundred bill, crisp
I pull a blunt from my lit forty-five from my hip and spit
Incredible, medical hardcore; the deadliest metaliest
Gas ever set off in a war; westcoast, the spot where
We making millin dollar noise; survival in heck-packing heat
Ducking from them, I'm just a thug nigga, step on your street
And draw my heat then I plug niggas I be a G
From the G.B.C., I mug niggas; don't flag, I just sag
And carry a mag and get off in the snitches' asses
You a bitch, but still ride or die, screaming out the block

And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

Yo, I had a dream that I was captain of my soul
I was master of my fate, lost control, and then I sank
So I don't want to take the lead, 'cause I'm prone to make mistakes
All these folks who follow me, goin' end up in the wrong place
So just let me shadow you, just let me trace your lines
Matter of fact, just take my pen, here, you create my rhymes
'Cause if I do this by myself, I'm scared that I'll succeed
And no longer trust in You, 'cause I only trust in me
And see, that's how you end up headed to destruction
Paving a road to nowhere, pour your life out for nothin'
You pulled my card, I'm bluffin', You know what's in my hand
Me, I just roll and trust you, You cause the dice to land
I'm in control of nothing, follow You at any cost
Some call it sovereign will, all I know is you the boss
And man, I'm so at ease, I'm so content
I'll play the background, like it's an instrument

I could play the background
I could play the background
'Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

I know I'm safest when I'm in Your will, and trust Your Word
I know I'm dangerous when I trust myself, my vision blurred
And I ain't got no time to play life's foolish games
Got plenty aims, but do they really Glorify Your name?
And it's a shame, the way I want to do these things for You, yeet
Don't even cling to you, take time to sit and glean from You
It seems like You were patient in my ignorance
If ignorance is bliss, it's 'cause she never heard of this

I could play the background
I could play the background
'Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

I could play the background

And I done took so much, now gimme my glory 
To have a choice to be who you wants to be

Seven and forty days, hey

Ya try to stay sane that's the price of fame 
Spending your life trying to numb the pain 
Ya shake that load off and sing ya song 
Liberate the minds, then you go on home

I must admit, they planted a lot of things 
In the brains and the veins of my strain 
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine 
From them whores, from the flame 
From a post in the game 
Makes it hard to maintain focus 
Then from the glock rounds and lockdowns and burials 
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts 
Cause it's a hard row to hoe 
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall 
And the ground is dry 
But the roots are strong, so some survive 
To your surprise, no one voived their cries 
You got more juice than Zeus 
Slanging lightning trying to frighten 
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti 
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded 
Melanin silicon and collagen injected 
Dissecting my pride, fool I don't want to get it started 
We be the lionhearted, without a fantasy 
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it 
Unless you looking at the canvas of life 
And not through the peephole of mortality 
Single minded mentality 
Getting over on loopholes 
Getting paid two-fold on technicalities 
Clicking your heels, scared to voice how you feel 
Pack the steel 
Picking cotton from the killing fields with no Toto 
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though 
Midwest or Dirty South 
Clean dressed or dirty mouth 
Whether robbing preachers or killing Poor Righteous Teachers 
You a scared demon 
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen 
And your cowardly lies never defying the jackals of babble 
Running with they pack, tail between your legs 
Though the man on your head say the story 
As you downplay your glory 
Cackling, helping the shackling of your brethren happen

Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel

In the Spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle
Yeah, yo, check it

There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice wit her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, tryin' to hold on
To life. She thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her, that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger-survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would of served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would of been me?
All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all

It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see 'em when they taking her
Though she kinda knew,
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middle-sex Prison about six inna morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell.
Put in the basement of a prison wit all males
And the smell of misery, seat-less toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, (paint?,) and begin to read
Two years in a hole. Her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would of been me?
All of this shit so we could be free.
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would f been me?
All of this shit so we could be free, so dig it, people

Yo
From North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done
Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba.

I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah
Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah
We're molded from the same mud, Assata
We share the same Blood, Assata, yeah

May God bless your soul

Freedom! You askin' me about freedom
Asking me about freedom?
I'll be honest with you
I know a whole more about what freedom isn't
Than about what it is, cause I've never been free
I can only share my vision with you of the future
About what freedom is
Uh, the way I see it

Freedom is is the right to be yourself, to be who you are
To be who you want to be, to do what you want to do",A Song for Assata,2000

Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause, just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I, shouldn't I, I cant, I have to, mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale,
Cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue

Couldn'ta been no more than thirteen (Uh-unh)
Supplyin fiends, shorties strictly stressin dir-ty (What?)
I sit on the porch and watch 'em FLEE from the po-lice
But the nighttime blind, and ain't no eyes on the streets (Shhh)
First Law of the Concrete
Better, never ever repeat, nothin ya seen (Uh-unh)
He said he had to make a killin (Uh-huh)
That's how it go whodi, ride and take a livin fo' sho'
He say he kill and kill again, he'll kick in the do' (Yea-ah)
Keep the lick, he trick a milli into mo' (Yeah)
Nobody wit him, he so low, when he creep through (Uh-huh)
Ride a glass Cheverolet, damn near see-through
But they all fall, 'cause he learnt to walk
But he, never learnt to crawl, have mercy Lord

I play to win, stingy, I don't have no air to lend
I'm standin still, talkin 'bout I'm grill
Cee-Lo Seville and steel real
Only millimeters away from my meal
Mighty knife, just enough not inconsiderate ice
Your contemplatin, contestin, please consider it twice
'cause I'm connected with the guy left after the drop of a dime
Or roll or roll down a bat, wonder what blow your mind
I'm heavyweight
and Front Street Skeet, got the snorters geeked-up
and they keep runnin back to the plate
We get it on, get it out the pot
Get on the block, and get it gone
Raised up out of the factories, and then we sit it chrome
Ya won't show, get out doors even if it's ice-cold
And slice O's as the dice rolls, shit
And may Lord have mercy on your hustlin-ass soul

It's 6 O'clock, it's volume 1
Yeah, Greg Street's mixtape

[Verse One: Boondox]
Uh uh
I came up in the hood infested with teenage hustlers
Street grinders, paper chasin scrapin busters
By keepin dust up noses and caine homes; pipes and cans
So they want they ride candy painted just like the man
That Veta tryin not to bite his hand
But they need em to keep em life from they stand
Every night praying for praying go as far as the ceiling
Got me feel like I'm (cursed) from this heart that I'm dealing
And all this liquor hoeing brother and goose-neckin
That I do but I don't want to got me losing blessings
GOD said he'll take the next two steps if I take the first (I did)
But in it to pick and sellin the spur
From under my feet, lost faith and jump in the street
Back to serve a rocks dying to the chrome in the heat
And running with G's that take it to the block with 'em
Tellin me along with my greens up like pot nickel

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Two: Cee-Lo]
You can clock my consistent and endless
Efforts up uplift me
Trees and branches catch draft
When I'm choppin down a path-
To walk down, actually don't even know how talk sound
I'm trying to stop the next step they drawing the chalk round
Matter-of-factually, I'll stand alone with no entourage to back me
GOD is my every existence; exhalation, exactly
I'll pimp prophets so profounding labels don't like contract me
I'm one of a kind; they gotta find a satellite to contact me
Let us bow, I thank the Almighty GOD for right now
For the strictor, smile through the tribulation and trial
For sparing me when the devil was daring me
And scaring me, synonymous for preparing me
And to my family- the Dungeon Family
And ya'll family-- we all family
And to me health and home and my son Keith Stun
My tongue is my gun, revolutions already begun
(Whaa)

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last

Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay

[Verse Three: Kalage]
All I know is charge cards, cars, and clothes
Maan, it's all for sure
And could go and when it's gone- (you alone)
Runnin up yo cell phone callin GOD for hope
And who to say that day ain't all for close
And if you ballin playa, it's only because GOD's your coach
And it don't bout the lies you hold, laws you broke
Thangs ya drink, dank and cigars you smoke
HE gonna forgive and that's you; now don't get me wrong
I like LL, but GOD da G.O.A.T'
HE da greatest of all time, if I'm lying I'm blind
Can I get a Amen (Amen brother)
But we got to stop, we got to stop doin dirt
Coming to Church with a devil tucked in your purse
Sittin some leather from Atlanta, came up finish the prayer
Worried about sister mom's and hair
All along worried bout what sister mom gonna wear
This ya boy or should they ride the martyr there
It don't matter at least that's the moral there
In Sunday service with a Bible lie defer the South
But GOD bless her, we here to thank GOD (hmmmm ahhh)
And that's the step inside Holy Church thinkin
I said step inside his Holy Church thinkin
We all God's Property, and not just Kirk Franklin

[Verse Four: T.I.]
Open my eyes, see the sunrise
Talkin about memories of G's got my tongue tied
Put out some Henn for my friend, why the good die?
But til the end, I'm in the wind where the slug fly
Pray for my sins, I hope I find Heaven close to me
Try to be godly but these haters provokin me
Pull the shotty want them dead is what my heart say
My hard head make me learn shit the hard way
Dodging the fedz ain't the easy way to live, care
But nigga do it everyday to make a meal stack
Your phone tapped, under surveillance, secretly indicted
Being watched daily, livin shady just to drive a Merdede
And fucking ladies, who making babies used against you
Gettin the ?? be the main nigga you be a friend too
How can begin to explain the pain
Can you stay in the rain
Used to be a simple thing, but the game done changed
Now slanging caine is a lifestyle
Risking your freedom just to ball for a short while
Gettin buckwild on the street up on Westside
Downtown Atlanta, while we ride some of the best die
From cocking hammers of these Tec-9s and .45s
Excuse my grammar; but it's fucked up how time fly
It seem like yesterday we play until our days was nights
And yesterday, I just put flowers at his gravesite and that ain't right

C-Lo,"She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We laid under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill, from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Telling it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love making
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned,
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only with men through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom
Between me and you

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Serenade her, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me

She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't conceive her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave does the mind go
Watching Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors there's no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the Creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death
Between me and you 
[Chorus]

He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was in steel
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
To the spirit, yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now there was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself
Between me and you 

[Chorus]

C-Lo,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds
Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep in the clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep into clouds

Your time
Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

Hey mighty love
Watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting
Perfect, like nothing
No hate, no confusion, no strain
Simply peace, simply
Simply, simply, simply

No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge

Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Angels sing and cymbals glare
No one's rich no one's poor
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home

Heaven, heaven is being pops
Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren
Listenin' to they voices when and they laughing and play
And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me round the knees
Yeah, that's heaven to me",Heaven Somewhere,2002

Then there's the birth of my boy
Here to inherit the rhythm
And when I see it in him I ask myself what more can I give him?
And I would love to but I can't spend every moment with him
It's just those big ole eyes that encourage me to keep living
Hey, ooh when I'm singing I'm sharing
Or rhyming I'm shining my light
And although the love is so blinding I still end up finding my wife
All I can do is reminisce 'cause there eyes no rewinding my life
But the future's so bright that it's almost blinding my sight

It's like all a sudden your life is so cool
'Cause everything in it is working for you

Life

This is dedicated to all my folks
Diagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin'
And never took the time to fall in line or follow
Or swallow the thoughts

Of the recognized committees who lurk throughout ya cities
Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type
You from the same type of people try to hold you down
Just because you tailor made for bigger and better things

Never missed a chance to move ahead of things
And what does it bring? I tell you for me
It brought jealousy in back wounds from all the stabbin'
Cats posin' as my fan just to get grabbin' what's mine

I'm livin' in times where my daughters are found around
Kids who can't afford thinkin' caps
But always found drinkin' raps and eatin' off beats
Claimin' laws of the streets, but who made the laws?
Everybody playin' rebel with no sign of a cause

Well I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down, just to be down
You've got to make up your mind, where you want to be
Where you want to go with your life
With your life

I'm never singin' the blues but findin' the clues to maintain
And I been blessed to reign supreme over nearly every dream
I had, and I made it come true
I'm an imperfect man and I'm holdin' the clue

To perfection, it doesn't seem to matter what direction I look
I find people settin' traps
Tryin' to find the goal, without havin' any maps
Even friends of mine, jumped online, just to become my adversary

They felt they were entitled to the dairy I made
They don't come to chill or behave
 
And they got, toast ready to burn
Not learnin' to live, but they yearnin' to take what you earn

Well I feel the world around me
I've found, that others will bring you down, just to be down
You see, you've got to make up your mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with your life
With your life

So quick to place blame, and deny the shame we bring upon ourselves
So many names held accountable for my own account
When a large amount was weighed, that I made and shaped
When I climbed I found

It was hard to find others around to point my fingers at
Which made me realize the truth
The biggest suppressor could be your own ego lookin' for an excuse
To plant roots, in a field of self-sorrow

To sprout and follow the first thing you feel
Nourishes your hunger to be respected, it gets hectic
And when I'm watchin' the news, and my daughter walks in
And choose to ask, 'Why were all those people on the floor
Sleepin', covered in red?' I told her
That they were lookin' for God, but found religion instead

Well I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down, just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with yo' life
With your life, with your life

Oh, bring you down
Sometimes, you got to walk alone, alone
Oh, yeah, I need, ooh, to breathe
I need my space, to live
Y'all know, y'all know, oh

Well I, feel the world around me

And a nigga can fuck, plus the boy gets live (that's right)

The fire, the fury, ya fuck with it not
Ya stoppin' the grace, get out my space and my - face
Fore me and my ace-a lay down the whole place

Recognize, this is the verbalize
Surprise, fuckin' with me wrong way to wise nigga
Hoes, clothes, shows, Vogues, golds
Big ol' bankrolls, that's all a nigga know

Throw yo' elbows, I'm sicker than I suppose
Hoes unchose, 'cause my jewelry froze
You know how it goes, these young niggaz don't want it like this
Go off and get yo' gat, to silence the chit-chat, blast!

So pass, outlast, bout cash

Lo realer, a go-rilla, flow for mo' scrilla

C-Lo,"Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately.
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah,
Rest in peace to Left Eye,
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay,
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers,
And everybody lost period.
All we got is hope!

I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, and I
Wish my brother would of made bail,
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, and I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, and I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, and I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, and I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold them high, and I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, and I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, but uh
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate,
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.
Instead of thinking about who gonna die today,
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.
Sit at the light so long,
And then we gotta move straight forward, 'cause we fight so strong,
So when right go wrong,
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on, let's hope!

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

I wish that you could show some love,
Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing,
Watch the music and have 'em trippin' of the joy I bring, (shit)
I wish that we could hold hands,
Listen instead of dissin' lessons from a grown man, and I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, and I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders,
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, you feel me(I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat,
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your man's gone, and I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And no po-po bring the heat on our peace like they did R. Kelly, and I
Wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breathe again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish that enemies could talk,
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game, let's hope

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic,
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court,
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get 'em on,
And in the famous words of Mr. King why can't we all just get along?
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, and I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, and I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask why are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin' on your knees in church and let's hope

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
'Cause we hopeful!

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.

On the mics somebody might get killed
So many damn rappers there's a stifle in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust all this stuff with Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd a carrel at Murdell Avenue
There we yattin' that ain't pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like sake

But I won't stop till I'm pullin out tracks, tracks
It was lust at first sight
And she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me
And my size was just right
'cause she wanted a man with a little sec-you're-ity

With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves
And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape cool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
'cause I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs
One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up

C-Lo,"See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'

Before we came being in southern wasn't something to claim
The fact wasn't something too fly it was something to blame
Smilin' and juckin' and jivin' I was so ashamed
They gave the dirty apparently appropriate name
I wrote about a revolution and sung from the soul
Spoke with my spirit and mind my ambition was blind
Answering the call of God like a child obeying
Preaching the very same power they killed Martin for saying

But you can't break the mold and not holding your breath
Thought if I died for ya, that would be an honorable death
So sincere my eyes begin to swell up in tear
And it's clear my music may not do well up in here
Oh my God being a nigga must be a good payin' job
With all the fringe benefits, ignorance is bliss
There is a time and the place for everybody's taste
But I know too much and I owe too much

See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'

So here it is, an invitation to an open book
A painful past my heart is still broken look
I know you don't hate me it's not assured that anyone appreciate me
See I've been having a hard time selling my album's lately
In recent news the source couldn't find any microphones to rate me
Using words I could scream an alternative to equate me
Which is true I'm in a box with a view would you still wanna date me?
I could be a pretty good thug but it wouldn't compare to a great me

The final cross to bear is mine it's not a cross to share
But isn't it ironic I still woulda bought a cross to wear
That obviously cost to wear but considerably less
Than the price that it costs to care
Now I have another loss to spare I doubt 'em say that I can't win
Even though I know talking intelligent just ain't in
You most likely to go broke when you just can't bend
So me and J J both gon' have to pay bills

See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'

Listen, people still standin' in line at the world party for some soul food
To get put back in that old mood they say, we like the new 'lo
And we respect everything that you trying to do 'lo
Do what you do but just do more that you know
It's a catch 22 and I couldn't cry
Now I'm under oath with them both and I couldn't lie

Cussed 'em said that I'm too dope and I couldn't fly
But you getting rich talkin' shit so why shouldn't I
I'm just playing but I guess that couldn't go without saying
I'm just gon' ride this revolution until they stop me where I'm stayin'
But I ain't gotta have to lie to ya to make it sound fly to ya
I keep my feet on the ground and bring the sky to ya

See there's no way and there's no how
I'd ever stop now, I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin'
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on

But you can just call him the soul machine

He's bad, he's Cee Lo Green

He's bad, he's Cee Lo Green
But you can just call him the soul machine

Now I came here for you to love, it's computer love
I make them cut through the rug when I do the club
I can take some mental electric sex, refuting love
But Gunplay will be graphic if I do the thug

The day to day experience is the data that I download
And then remaster onto a rapture
Abracadabra before and after, over and over
Losing account of all the dreams that I sold ya

But then I gave ya, at the speed of light trying to save ya
Then I go and now come back a row, whoa
And oh I'm technic to God in a fashion
But you can just call me Lo Go

Whenever you want some soul
Start him up
Whenever you need some soul
Start him up

See he's been given the power
To take you wherever you want to go
Start him up
And tell him what you want

Once you start up the soul machine
You will see what I mean
Open your eyes and enjoy the dream
He can do anything
He's bad

C-Lo,"There is nothing special about me
I am just a lil star
If it seems like I'm shining it's probably
A reflection of something you already are

I forget about myself sometimes
When there's so many others around
When deep inside you feels the darkest
That is where I can always be found
That is where I can always be found
That is where I can always be found

Just keep trying and trying
It's just a matter of timing
Though the grinding is tiring
Don't let it stop you from smiling

Just keep trying and trying
Sooner or later you'll find it
It's surprising how inspiring
It is to see you shining

?Cause in the dark of the night you're all I can see
And you sure look like a star to me

There is nothing special about me
I am just a lil star
If you try to reach out and touch me
You'll see that I'm not really that far

Oh, I may not be the brightest
Nor am I the last one you'll see
But as long as you notice
That's just fine with me
Everything's just fine with me
Everything's just fine with me

Just keep trying and trying
It's just a matter of timing
Though the grinding is tiring
Don't let it stop you from smiling

Just keep trying and trying
Sooner or later you'll find it

It is to see you shining

?Cause in the dark of the night you're all I can see
And you sure look like a star to me

There is nothing special about me
I am just a lil star
I'm running and jumpin'
But barely gettin', gettin' over the bar

I plan on being much more than that
And but that's in due time
But until then I'm guilty
And being human's my crime
Just being human that is my crime
Being human that is my crime

Just keep trying and trying
It's just a matter of timing
Though the grinding is tiring
Don't let it stop you from smiling

Just keep trying and trying
Sooner or later you'll find it
It's surprising how inspiring
It is to see you shining

Suppose you know to call me 'Lo
But you can call me The Soul Machine

Four million flavors of the southern soul flower
But the power that you get from the heart of a human being
Only the mind is mechanic the dynamic happens
When the divine starts to intervene

I don't mean to be heavy
But ""Come save me,"" said this last fiend
'Cause the beginning and the ending and the misassumption
Will make 'em move something in between

Turn the radio on, let the music play
If I could I'd dance my life away
And if you can't seem to find any words to say
Make a joy-ful noise, fifth around it's another day

When you see me you would know that you saw me
Because he always got on his game and his good shoes
Difficult to stop creating can't wait
But they came to see God then great tell 'em the good news

Isn't it ironic how it feels so good?
But I was only just singing the blues
I wouldn't open my mouth about it at all
If I thought that I was only just singing the fool

Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
Maybe 'Lo you should lighten up
I really would if I could

But I really don't think that anybody shell out enough
And I really think true wealth is home and happiness and health
A little cash and you'll need nothing else
And as far as me being good, I can't help myself
Hey

So when you really really need you some soul
I mean dead serious damn near bout to die bout some
Don't be too proud to turn your radio way up loud
Close your eyes and have fun

I used to feel like God was gonna call me too soon
The reason why I had to have my son
And every time I've ever opened my mouth and said something
Bout living was to earn my ones

Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
Wait I'm almost done
And God can truly work a miracle â?? Look at me

Isn't it obvious that I'm one?
And I sing because I'm happy
And I sing because I'm free (I'm free)

C-Lo,"I am the music
I've yet to define myself as just, one thing
Let's just say that

I am the actual and factual supernatural sight and surrounds
Signification of conversation
Two or more words rhyming in song form or spoken syncopation
The reason the rudery reanimation and realization of life is rhythm
I am the heartbeat and the heartache, the here and now

I am the purpose, the point, the living proof of a God somewhere
The lifeline, lifelike lazer beam, the progression and direction
Always will be always was what all comes from and all must return
The center of a perfect circle, I am your soul

Music of your mind, each feeling causing each function
To be in conjunction with the music, I am the music

I am the music

Let's get started shall we? 'Cause you know it's time gone
Every time these n****z rhyme wrong
So uhh, lights, camera, action I'm on
I'll have them standing in line to get their mind blown

I'm selling soul, rapping and singing, and screaming, and yelling soul
Manufacturing, marketing, pricing, packaging and e-mailing soul
With no rehearsal, this one verse'll whole hearse you
Now a commercial but what I must first do

Is make my presentation a bit more personal
Everything must go for a small price you can have the heart of me
There is no part of me that can't be calculated into a commodity
My musings amount to a milestone a million miles above monotony

And it'll make you feel so good, it got to be God, it got to be
I paint prophecy, you know airbrush atrocity with philosophy
And people ask me am I gon' preach one of these days
And I just tell 'em, ""Possibly"", if you let me

I'll end up being everything probably and obviously
It's like any other job would be so you might as well thank God for me
But isn't it amazing, how the antenna ain't nothing but a sinner
You just can't go and be ordained over dinner

Now I can interest an intellectual or A be see it for a beginner
But yes my seasons still change and it is almost winter
And it give it to you at God-speed but yet it's gentle
And when I rhyme I make reading fundamentals

Or even black and white, my lyric is live and living color
My flow if fluorescent like scripture highlighted in bright yellow
And all this for 999, s*** that's wonderful
And the great thing about it is, if you disagree you're money's refundable

But there's always something rewarding about every Cee-Lo Green Recording 'cause even after all your expenses
People still aspire affording
It's incredible how convincing I can be with a camera pointed at me
But really sometimes rapping feel like tapping to make a cracker happy

But when the dat play and the beat get bumping like adolescent acne
It's kinda sad but it's show time, my sentiment exactly
So don't get mad, everybody's doing it, you know you wouldn't mind
A commercial with your own tennis shoe in it

Whether you're selling a dream, selling a scheme or playing a role
Like it or not we're selling soul

Well, I've struggled so hard that I survived
And it's a miracle that I'm still alive

Said stand up, everybody, uh, this is your life
You gotta get it when you can y'all
Half rich for months is your knife
We can't forget about the brothers, the sisters
The lovers who ain't here
You only got one life, y'all, and I repeat the point it ain't clear
And if it ain't fair then what's stopping you from going

Do you not want to be responsible for knowing
'cause ignorance is bliss and ignorance is just so fucking ignorant
You may even be ignorant of this
If you say so my Desoto's the significance of this
I'm good lookin', still fuckin', so fools don't make a dish
Light a candle for love, blow it out and make a wish
And I hope I die happy like fish

'cause I wanna hut two, three, four, what the hell are you waiting for?

(Think about it, are you sure you're really living?)

And it's a miracle that I'm still alive

Peace
How y'all feel out there
That's cool
Alright
You know, sometimes I wanna rap
Sometimes I wanna sing, you know what I mean
Sometimes all it calls for is a nice mellow groove
Hit of rimshot, you know
Just get, you know, get you open
But I wanna do a piece for y'all tonight, it's called sometimes
Alright, so check it out
Sometimes a stranger can be your best friend
Sometimes being angry is the best mood
Sometimes seeing you feel good makes me feel even better
Sometimes hunger is the best food
Sometimes good just ain't good enough
And other times evil will get you even
Sometimes faith is not knowing any better
Sometimes nothing is what you believe in
Woah

Sometimes I don't even want a hit

Sometimes you fail trying
And sometimes happiness hurts worse
Sometimes people live dying
Sometimes it's the last person that makes you first
Sometimes you'll keep what you don't want
And other times you'll give away what you really need
Sometimes a rich man won't have a dollar
And all a poor man has is greed
Woah

Sometimes
Sometimes I just wanna listen
Sounds good to me
Yeah
Ay yo Lock, put them strings right here
Sometimes I don't think people know I'm as good as I really am

Now my recitings are writing over rhythm's
Regularly reinacts facts of my existance
So what proof of my expertise, many emcees know of me
Using unrequested serious infested poetry
To prevoke what persistance
For instance, I don't let the T.V. screen come in between my daily routine
At a spot where me and my boy went
Someone interrupted our enjoyment
What do you know, an out of work emcee looking for employment
But I'm still curteous with my greeting, brother I'm eating
And his style sounded similar to someone elses
So evidently he's been cheating
But I couldn't question the destiny in which we meet
So, you guessed it, I suggested that he just have a seat
And then I explained to him that I remained in the mean time
Mastering mysterious methods of writing
Finding my piece of mind with soft music and moonlighting
Then supernaturaly I forsee the beginning stages
And then eventually pages get filled completely
You see, I dive into the depths of my soul
Seeking to explore the hidden treasure of a pure literature
While these others are unsure
Being that the deepness makes them doubtful
Deliberatly delaying
Saying they'll settle for whatever washes toward the shore
Delirous from dilusion
My feelings were no more direct so the conclusion is seclusion
Because mixed belief create confusion
To remain plain and simplistic, realistic
Accurate, articulate and absolutely artistic
Uninhibited, unadulterated, unstoppable
Unfuckwittable and unforgettable
But since I've been granted the power of choice
Let God bet the voice he is
So all the credibility be his
So let these be words of wisdom and in the same breath be warning
God I shine like Sunday morning
Woah

After bein' 25  you know  just trying to survive in the world 
Bout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows? 
Anyway  just when you start getting that little age and experience to you 
You start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves 
So bust it out  this is what I was thinking  check it 

Yo  the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn 
Began, began with time 
Being my bloodline is one with the divine 
In time brother, you will discover the light 
Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White 
Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right 
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear 
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear 
As a child, given religion with no answer to why 
Just told believe in Jesus 'cause for me he did die 
Curiosity killed the catechism 
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to 
And became a slave to master self 
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health 
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons 
Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital 
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys 
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief 
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em 
And use religion as an emblem 
When it should be a natural way of life 
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right 
That's who got you doing right and got you this far 
Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or Hum do Allah 
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you 
You let that show towards others in the things you do 
'cause when the trumpets blowing, 24 elders surround the throne 
Only 144,000 goin' get home 
Only 144,000 goin' get home 
Only 144,000 goin' get it baby 

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
I've lived and I've learned 
I have taken and I've earned 
I have laughed, I've cried 
I have failed and I have tried 
Sunshine, pouring rain 
Found joy through all my pain 
I just want to be happy with being me 

[Cee-Lo]
Let me voice my concern 
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title 
That their actions didn't earn 
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence 
Subconsciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince 
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place 
Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know 
Who you are in the first place 
So I try to find the clue in you 
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do 
Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden 
Damn, somethin' in me want to know who I am 
So I began my search, my journey started in church 
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief 
Hustling was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets 
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with 
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school 
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only 
Science and math are universal 
Taking elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran 
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites 
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White 
Some leads were granted with insight 
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to over stand 
He still created with the imperfection of man 
So, with followin' I disagree 
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but 
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind 
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas 
You goin' surely find there's no positivity without negativity 
But one side you gonna have to choose 
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse 
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession 
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and 
Can't follow your lesson 
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 

Well, I've lived and I've learned 
I've taken and I've earned 
I have laughed, I have cried 
I failed and I have tried 
Sunshine, pouring rain 
I found joy through my pain 
Just want to be happy, being me

Once upon a time in a crack house (a crack house) 

a nigga was chopping up a key (a key) 

It was drought season (season) 

And everybody was fiending (fiending) 

So they had to come and buy their dope from me 



It all started back in the crack house 

When I was counting up some dope and some mail 

Now beaucoup pagers for sale 

But I ain't have no more fucking yail 

I had to get me some more 

But all the dope is stupid move kinda slow 

Black Adam we gonna go bust down in Texas 

You know that's where I get my dope at 

Taz was sweating kinda harder 

So I took that plane ride to Georgia 

But just remember that I was sitting on that thang 

And that half that I got down in Florida 

I had a bird but I chopped it up and I put it down to rocks (rocks) 

That's when I make my come up, I hit my fucking block 

Fiends was constant fucking sweating, now get out da door 

I chop dimes to nickels, fuckers want to see me chop some more 

10's grow to 20's, 20's grow to 50's

Dear God can you hear me 

My love for money's gonna kill me 

Ya got me selling crack to the children 

And its a shame 'cause I love how I'm living 



Peekin out the window, tryin to cope with a run of that indo 

Parinoid as the fuck while I'm breaking down this kilo 

Like some money to be made, ain't had dope in four days 

As the fiends knock I keep off the block till Mr. gets paid 

Selling phat packs, when I first react it's like dat 

Pay man in flat 

Throwing this block of dope trying to make my money back 

Front you something bitch, front me some dollars 

But if you ain't got no G's, shit nigga I can't hollar 

Cause way down in the Bayou swamps 

When niggas quick to get with some funk 

This hard as the fucker come up 

So the last thang I need is a begging motherfucker 

Stay strapped up, whenever if you will get tapped up

Without a doubt, in and out, like that dank on the road
Let's turn the block, smoke some dope, and I'll show you the rose

I'm makin', sun shine on a cloudy day, you feel me nigga?
Instead of sittin' while I'm whinin' my life away, you haters kill me nigga
From a spot, well fellas dope sack, last night
Sell they soul to make it better than the last time

Hustlas doin' like Wally never be free
And you makin' million dollar plans without me? Make it the last time
Bout my grind, hope to shed this life of crime

Never holdin' up when I get it I split yours
Doin' what'cha want to my noggin' 'cause it's yours
Keep it on the low til' ya bubble and spit yours

Now where the work at? I leave the crime scene in a blaze
Can you work that? Just broke yesterday, now I'm paid
Now it's curse Black, for fools that fake the funk in my way
Daddy bust back, and leave 'em lost in life like a maze

Now feel me flat you gettin' stuck up
And fools that 'sposed to blasted at me, you done fucked up

You punks better listen
Now you started this beef, so put your lip in
Muthafucka spit the game above your neck, like a tech

Picture me, out the frame with them thangs and a vest
You know the rest
Down and dirty out there eatin' curly fries
Tired of spendin' my mornings tellin' my Mama don't worry
'Cause we gone shine ya heard me?

So don't get full of that whatever the fuck
And lose your mind 'cause I'm a lose mine and tear this place up
Now I'm a tell you, this your chance
To stop the buckin' 'cause you fuckin' with a mad man

Muthafucka came from late night to the spot, tryin' to survive in the game
And doin' shows coast to coast, sippin' 'nac on the plane
While you do your thang, I'ma do my thang on the grind
While you rack your brains, I'ma stack change so I can shine

Like that flashlight, you know the one the tags whoop you with
When it's late night, for tryin' to run and swallow your shit
Now I tried to do right, when I got out on the fifth
But I got in tight my playa partna needed a lift

Went and drifted in that lost World of playas and thieves
That's how you flip, in the ghetto when you tryin' to break free
From a family tree of hustlas, playas, felons, and thieves
When they tellin' you they gettin' it yo it's a dream
And here it is ya heard me?

Stop all that damn begging, and go on get your own kid
You know you wrong dog, just cause I'm on dog
Think every time you stick your hand out, like I'm suppose to give you what ya want dog
That shit done ran out, when I was doing time you clowns ran out
Now you wan' keep eating off mine, that shit don't pan out
They bout to cut your lights off, you tell me that shit ery' month
That's just what Loc talking bout, this time dog ain't the one
Ery'time a nigga fell, you'd be right there to catch him
But the one time you deny him, now that clown mad at ya
Look fuck that, take it how you wanna
Better get you a sign, and stand ya ass on the corner
Get off ya ass people, and go on get your hustle on
We all created equal, stop singing all them sad songs
So all you dead beats, won't you please stop calling me
Begging for cheese, but man that ain't what ya need look thug

[Chorus]
We don't owe you fuck you, go get it on your own
Everyday I've been grinding getting it all alone, without you
We don't owe you fuck you, go get it on your own
Everyday I've been grinding getting it all alone, I don't need you

It seems I can't understand, why the fuck my people trip with me like I owe em some'ing
Get off your ass don't look to me for handouts, cause I can't give you nothing
Plus I heard niggaz got a lot to say, about how I live my life
Get this right the reason that I ride alone, is cause half of you niggaz ain't right
Shife maybe just a tad bit, see I can only call what I see
To each it's own do what you do, but the fact remains I'm still a G
Who I be it really don't matter dog, but just know I'm still the same
I grind full time, while you niggaz don't squab a heavyweight in this game
I was told you gotta get up and get it, depending on what you want not what you need
We all need a lot of thangs, but say dog can you succeed
Only time'll tell inside this life, while some of us left alone
And I ain't mad at all I'm a better man, when I get shit on my own

[Chorus]

I was taught, that you gotta be your own man
But everybody that I know, holding out they hand
Looking at me, like I owe they ass something
Stressing me everyday, wasn't part of the plan - 2x

Why they whining, I just do what I do
Please don't waste my time, get off your ass and get you
Look why you trying to count mine, you need to focus on you
I'm out here trying to survive nigga, just like you
They searching for a free ride, that's what a lot of em do
But they ain't nowhere to be found, when you be needing them fools
Look they don't play by the rules, like they ain't even got a clue
So it's best that you keep moving, cause Loc ain't got nothing for you

[Chorus]

Don't need you, I don't need you

I've been doing it, on my own

Big money swanging whips, cause we serve the most
We live by that G code, that's what gangstas do
On the grind stacking chips, with a gangsta crew
Down here sipping lean, that's that purple stuff
Staying thoed getting bucked, playas living it up
Game spitters riding big, is a habit y'all
Everything you dream about, we done had it y'all
We got money yellow hoes, wearing g-string clothes
Sport sweaters in the summer, cause our necks stay froze
Gripping grain having change, hanging low as your belt
If you want to be a man, go and get it yourself
Down here we do it all, break laws and ball

We live it up cause we love it, playa deal with that
Tite getting it how I live, keep it real with that

Abuse them drugs, and hoes don't get no love

Sip on drank, and blow on that stanky dank

I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

Well it ain't no plex with the East and the West 
With plenty drink for your kids and plenty of weed for your chest
So leave your pistol at home cause we ain't trying to go to war

Roll on 20's and smoke pine with me

Steady be sellin, celebratin, for payin our dues
With so much drank in my cup the soda water don't even move

Pour you a glass instead of beating on your ass
Take a chill pill bill
Blow some kill pop the steal

Specialy on the fours doors
Bump the strape againts rows 
Flosh low concert looking like a lumber yard 
Waving my trunk up and down the boulevard
Charge the platinum card and the visa to the max!!!
Still won't get no sleep till my click see some cacs
Cadillacs and six packs we guys bangin screw

Payin do's and stayin tru is the rule of the game

C-Murder,"Ah shit. Man, them pinche black gangstas are at it again
I wonder who they fucked up today?
You motherfucker!
(Got him)

Pull over to the side right now
Man, fuck them motherfuckers!

Yo, Dre! Give me a funky-ass bassline!
Right here!

Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me
Never should've been let out the penitentiary
Ice Cube would like to say
That I'm a crazy mothafucka from around the way
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Now I'm the mothafucka that you read about
Takin' a life or two, that's what the hell I do
You don't like how I'm livin'? Well, fuck you!
This is a gang and I'm in it
My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute
With a right left, right left, you toothless
And then you say: ""Goddamn, they ruthless!""
Everywhere we go they say: ""Damn!""
N.W.A's fuckin' up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don’t just say no, we’re too busy sayin', ""Yeah!""
About drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
Do I look like a mothafuckin' role model?
To a kid lookin' up to me
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me I’ll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta!
Hopin' you sophisticated motherfuckers
Hear what I have to say

When me and my posse stepped in the house
All the punk-ass niggas start breakin' out
'Cause you know, they know what’s up
So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep cryin'
""I got a boyfriend""—bitch, stop lyin'!
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nothin' but a dyke
Suddenly I see some niggas that I don't like
Walked over to 'em, and said, ""What's up?""
The first nigga that I saw, hit him in the jaw
Ren started stompin' him, and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said: ""Let's start some shit""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot
Takin' niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom, boom, boom! Yeah, I was gunnin'
And then you look, all you see is niggas runnin'
And fallin' and yellin' and pushin' and screamin'
And cussin', I stepped back and I kept bustin'
And then I realized it's time for me to go
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N.W.A is wanted for a homicide
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll tell you exactly how he feel
And don't want a fuckin' thing back

Homies all standin' around, just hangin'
Some dope-dealin', some gang-bangin'
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I has to smoke his ass
He kept rollin', I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car—are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin' at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit!
Man, what'cha gon' do now?
(What we're gonna do right here is go way back)
How far you goin' back? (Way back)
""As we go a lil' somethin' like this""—hit it!

Here's a little gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank, yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy-E cold runnin' shit

Well, I'm Eazy-E, the one they're talkin' about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
With the {diamond in the back, sun-roof top}
Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
'Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin' to you
""We want to fuck you, Eazy,"" I want to fuck you too
Because you see, I don’t really take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put a foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll fuck up you and yours
And anything that gets in his way
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality

1. Never talk on the phone in ya house 

2. Never slang dope out ya baby momma's house 

3. Never fuck with snitches 

Cause niggas that talk to the police is bitches 

4. Keep a low key 

And if you movin weight

The first hit for free (damn) 

But the next time you see me 

You betta have twenty G

Pimp hoes for the pussy 

That's the 'Merican way 

Clean up ya dirty money to good money 

Cause legal money last longer than drug money.

Fade Out.",Ghetto D,1997
C-Murder,"[c-murder]
As I wake up and look into the motherfucking mirror
I realize I'm staring into the eyes of a killer
See-murder who I be, tru be my click
My mind's on killing but in the process I'm getting rich
As I walk out the crackhouse strapped
With my bulletproof vest cause I can't live with no bullets up in my chest
I'm a soldier, bitch I told ya
With a shot from the calliop to the magnolia
Cause it's a known fact that I sell crack
You fuck with me I'll smoke your ass like 'cause smoked this track
Beeper blowin I gots to apprehend my drug money
But I see popo's in the car and commence to running
This 'cause I knew keeps his rocks up in a skittles bag
Nigga I'll be a little late but have my cash
Jumped in the caddilac and hit I-10
Got on the mobile lemme see which hoe I'm gonna go up in
Cocked my weapon cause I ain't got no time for no bullshit
Ready to kill one of these hoes jealous ass boyfriend
Nigga, don't hate me cause I'm getting head while I'm smoking weed
And when I'm done I'll fix a sandwich and I'm outie g
? ? ? ? ? ? I ain't workin with it all
I blame that shit on spending half of my life behind bars
The fedz talkin bout, no limit full of drug dealers
But homocide know see-murder is a born killer

Chorus
They say I'm a drug dealer
But look into the eyes of this motherfucking killer x2

My mind playin tricks cause um, I think some dope missing
Time to check my crackhouse cause something fishy
And I ain't taking no shorts nigga ask silkk
I'm known to fold a nigga head like a fuckin quilt
Call bye cause I smell a fuckin murder coming
No limit soldiers bout to have this fuckin party jumping
Infared on ak's for a better aim
T-shirt, bulletproof vest cause, uh, bullets gots no name
Cause six deep is how we mob
Time for a 187, a motherfucking homocide
They put another x up on my tatooes
Laughing as another nigga sing the blues
Like frank nino, I feel funeral homes make a nigga wish they kept their
Motherfuckin ass home
You can take me to jail bitch, but that's dumb
Cause the witness will never make it to the motherfucking courtroom
I'm legendary ask them hoes, see, they be loving
I'm not 2pac but uh, I'll still be thugging
Cause dope, pussy and money is what I live for
Besides my family, that's something I'll kill for
Disrespect my click, and you will feel a
Blast from this motherfucking natural born killa

C-Murder,"featuring see Murder  Porsha 

Intro: see murder (talking) with Porsha singing. 
This is a story about my childhood years. 
For all my niggas. 
For my life as a ghetto child. 
. There's so much pain 

Verse 1: ???? 
I remember as a little kid. 
Growing up. Many of my friends didn't make it up to bricks. 
Punished for the shit that they did  it gets so hard to live. 
Mama cut the same tears  livin' in fears. 
Wondering if their son died or survived. 
But mama, I'm cutting the 45. 
I die, tell mama don't cry. 
Dry eyes, ‘cause how I live. I know to smile. 
A young misbehaved child, running in the streets wild. 
Try to make my money, pop. 
My eyes are getting slim. 
And my life is getting down, and I feeling like death is near. 
And I'm hoping that the heaven's here. 
I cry, ‘cause the Lord knows how m! any years I've tried. 
But this life's a lie. It ain't not a hope unless a nigga die. 
Lord why!!, Lord why!! 

Verse 2: ???? 
My childhood years was kinda rough because my pops weren't there. 
I was left to peer. Always pay but no one to share. 
These hard times, stressin' to sell nickels and dimes. 
Had to support my family, no one else was puttin' time. 
Reminiscing about on dead peers troughout the the years. 
No more tears, my childhood years with scrilla fifth. 
Who's the maycliff for all this fucking fight to stop a nigga. 
Just a price I have to pay, nigga. 
My childhood years 

Chorus repeated once: see-Murder (Porsha singing in the background) 
My childhood years, got my shit in tears. 
It's hella scary. 
I'm trapped, and I don't want to die in a cemetery. 
This ghetto ties got me livin' in pain. 
Lord knows I don't want to die in vain. 

Verse 3: see-Murder 
My childhood years was spend in cemeteries bearing my peers. 
Many tears, that I have shaded, for my niggas disappeared. 
In a bad year. Now with depressed in just memory. 
Drinking Hennessy. To dry away my misery. 
Trapped since birth, a ghetto child living in curse. 
It's getting worse, until I'm covered up in dirt. 
The pain it hurts. 
That be the reason why my blast first. 
‘Cause I refuse to be a victim in the black hears. 
Memories up with child runnin' wild. 
I couldn't smile, because my motherfuckin' life was foul. 
A troubled child, stressin' from his childhood years. 
Heavenly father. Could you please wipe away my tears. 

Verse 4: Reginelli 
I could remember way back, when a! nigga was sick. 
I just to watch my brother do some dangerous shit. 
Staying out all night, mama worrying sick. 
Wondering if he was dead or just play with a bitch. 
But when I saw this wild nigga came up like I did. 
When I eat dwellars, when the niggas start to slanging that shit. 
I tight up on my hustle. Start to paying the bills. 
Shading tills, ‘cause my brother got locked up for three years. 
After that a nigga start to grabbin' the mic. 
Write rap, on sheet of paper, making solider shit tight. 
Three years later, my brother came home from jail. 
Tellin' me he wrote rap, when he was strapped in a cell. 
A week later, we was some No limit soliders. 
Gambino family, for all the readers and rollers. 
But you can tell a nigga been shading some tears. 
By the way I live. 
My childhood years. 

Chorus repeated once. 

Outro: see-murder (talking) with Porsha singing 

Childhood years. 
Shading tears.

Fearin' immediate death, like a fateful pheasant
N my kingdom, only strong soldiers live, that's that law 
Of that ghetto, I broke my hand on a fool's jaw

C-Murder,"Imagine making it big in this rap game
And you think it's all good
I'm here to tell you it ain't baby
You got every eye in the world on you
You gotta understand these people fear what they don't know

Imagine life with no jails and no laws
And no harassment on brothers in fancy cars
Now why they want to trap me, make me a slave
They just mad cause a ghetto nigga break bread

I'm on the ground cuffed up like a dog
Said my cuffs too tight, but they laugh when they see me fall
I guess my skins too dark for them to hear me
I know they don't like me, for some reason I think they fear me
Quit tripping on my chains and my rangs
I want to hit em, but I didn't cause I maintained
They got me FED's on the scene and they sware I got the cream
And the stolen truck green, canine all up in my jeans
They don't realize I'm a soldier
I had a pissed, ask your son, I know he gotta see-Murder disc
Number one in every record store
Mom and pops tap my phones, but you know I ain't slangin' rocks
Take me to jail but I tell em take me off the scene
My first call go to P, he put my mind at ease
You told me not to trip cause it's a bigger picture
And if your tank don't put it on TRU, I'm a come and get ya

Woah, picture life without the crooked cops and without the cell blocks
Would you sell rocks, or would you be like me, I'm shell shocked
And I went through stressin' (why), cause I'm already strapped,
bulletproof vesting
Waiting to be tested by the devil on that level
I used to sit on the porch with my uncle Ben
And I watched the murder scene when I was 13, dad, why they come for me
And it made me crazy, and it made me lose my mind
And from time to time it crossed my mind
What if there wasn't a crime 
Now Slim, would you kill for me and everything that's true for me
If there was no law, and nobody was superstars
No state trooper cars to follow, you wouldn't have to swallow
Your rocks, so toss the glocks with the hollow
I would kill a rich man and drink his blood, would it bring me riches
Or would I just be selling my soul to them wicked witches
We already in babylon, the world is a ghetto and God is like the don,
nigga woah

Now we get only get one minute to pray and a second to die
Could you picture the dark side before I let these bullets fly
From out my 4-5 see, I know what you mean
Is it life or that imagine living life with no breath
My imagination's a motherfucker with a bullet stretch
Too much killing, I won't supply the world with a vest
But that's impossible, killing its unstoppable
As long as they got bullets and guns they got niggas that's droppin' em
Real niggas from that ????? the world that's all about
Real niggas we won't have a reason to kill niggas, heal niggas
My plane it runs so deep I'm a share it with why'all
While my own niggas is trying to cut throat while I'm tryin' to ball

This song right here don't pertain to my most loved. P, Silkk, my cousin
Jimmy, my closest family. This is a question to all my closest homies that I
die for cause I love y'all

A body can't live without a soul up in it
When you dead ain't no second chance, but alive ain't no limit
So you bein TRU to yourself
Well then die for something, then somebody else
I'm surrounded by more thugs then my eyes can see
But I still ask the question how many y'all would bleed for me
I'm see-Murder, but that don't mean shit to a bullet
I make moves with Silkk, cause I know he gonna pull it
I ask P the true meaning of being a brother
He said just some niggas that would die for each other
And can't be separated by money and bitches
When apart we poor, but together we richer
Life is complicated like a game of chess
Anticipating check mate is like waiting for death
If I'm gonna die give the king his life
That's why I ask my soldiers would you ever think twice

Chorus
If I ask the question would you all be true
Would you ride for me like I'm a ride for you
And when times get hard and my life's at stake
Would you hesitate to eliminate x2

I got a question for Boz, would you ride for me?
To them Deli boys nigga would you die for me?
To my homies Kane and Abel would you kill for me?
If a motherfucker wasn't being real to me
And Fiend and Mac, I know you ready to roll
Cause the three of us done been through some shit before
Mia X, I know you always got my back
The Gambino's stay strapped, and me and Prime Suspect
Been shedding tears on the block forever
Just like Big Ed been TRU forever
Mystikal, nigga, would you pop that fool
But not before Serv-On gonna hit that fool
And then he gonna have you looking silly for sure
While V and ???? been watching the door

It's got me knocking on heaven's door
Feel my pain

I lost something in the past that was special to me
You can't feel what I feel cause this shit's to deep
So give love to your motherfucking thugs alive cause
Ain't no seeing when your motherfucking loved ones die
Don't point the finger and criticize what he did
Invest all your thoughts and all the times he hid
Will I ever see my brother again time will tell
I feel like I'm trapped between heaven and hell
I turned on the radio to forget the fun tears
Coming out my eyes cause I  hear I miss my homies 
On top of that my court dates tomorrow
Facing ten years added to my pain and sorrow
Baby momma don't want me to leave my kids
We can move to the country and forget what I did
But reality keep tellin' me that ain't cool
I want to see my kids go to school
Feel my pain

Only thug niggas feel my pain I'ma ride for my homies
Because I'm true to the game
Ain't no love cause my blood ain't the same as yours
It's got me knocking on heaven's door
Feel my pain
Only thug niggas feel my pain I'ma ride for my homies
Because I'm true to the game
Ain't no love cause my blood ain't the same as yours
It's got me knocking on heaven's door
Feel my pain

Nobody knows when your time gone come
I live life to the fullest, true niggas don't run
Anticipating your death make you soft and sick
I leave my worries at home when I'm hanging with my clique
I reminisce about all my niggas that's dead
A lesson was learned when they put you in the grave
It don't matter what you got when a nigger gone get cha
Cause when a nigger gone hit ya a nigger gone hit ya
Bulletproof with ak's with hundred round drums
Can't stop one bullet penetrating your dome
That's why I value nothin but family and friends
You lose material shit you can get it again
But ain't no coming back when you meet the reaper
I done lost to many thugs to the permanant sleeper 
Cause ahh everyday a nigger taking a chance
Only thug niggas feel my pain ( feel my pain )

Only thug niggas feel my pain I'ma ride for my homies
Because I'm true to the game
Ain't no love cause my blood ain't the same as yours
It's got me knocking on heaven's door
Feel my pain
Only thug niggas feel my pain I'ma ride for my homies
Because I'm true to the game
Ain't no love cause my blood ain't the same as yours
It's got me knocking on heaven's door
Feel my pain
Only thug niggas feel my pain I'ma ride for my homies
Because I'm true to the game
Ain't no love cause my blood ain't the same as yours

See the world knows we gonna be thugs forever 
You can take me out the ghetto
But you can't make it better
See the status of your money done changed 
But the status of your danger remains the same
I need to clear my head of these evil thoughts 
And teach magnolian' gateway the shit I was taught
Take a ride wit me nigga to eternity 
And watch you live tuh see anotha century
Life's a bitch who do you trust I put my faith in my glock 
Cause I know its gone bust

But my ghetto ties keep my checkin' in my rearveiw

Who do you trust?
My ghetto ties got me trippin'

He might take me for a faker
He might try to do a jack and that might cost me my life 
If you ever jack its real nigga 
You best kill me or pay the price
Ain't nuttin' I ain't fallen behind
No street machine tell me what you seen
Then tell a nigga about some stoned ass 
Left the murder scene disguised in army green with a infra beam
Own self tryin tuh gum nigga run as soon as he heard the blast fool one
He didn't run tore his ass up with a quick fast sight
Witness that murda the first degree my ghetto ties fuckin' round wit me
Don't do that

How many times have you seen a family nut up and the mom was cut up
I see now but later on I'm gonna be seein' now 
But see how us niggas get caught up 
Quick to go underwater niggas take advantage of the way
Life sold us
I'm full of that freeze I'm fulla them weeds and them v's

Sounded like foe shots commin' from the other room

Gonna get the dilly for a milly
Went to the next room john jones was in the zone

Is that niggas ain't reaching back to a nigga, you feel me?
So I's having problems understanding that shit, you know?

Oh 
It's life or death in my town 
And I'm standin' on deadly ground 
I just want to live my life 
All by myself
 
Life is full of debt 
And life is full of cnflict 
I'm just tired of seein' all my homies out here dyin' quick 
Society today is all twisted 
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin' 
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder 
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder. 
That's why constantly I watch all my enemies 
'Cause death is a disease to all my TRU g'z 
The can't shake it 
They can't seem to break the cycle 
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal 
Ralph Sten said money runs the country 
Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya 
I done see mothers turn on they own kids 
Money make brothers turn on one another. 
Even make each other split the other's wig 
Animosity 
Least of all tops is ta watch ya back 
Life or Death 
'Cause ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath. 

[Chorus: x2] 
 
I'm already dead 
So can't nobody kill me 
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me 
My pain brings anger to a total stranger 
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger 
I just want to be surrounded by somebody that luv me 
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover 
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends 
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in 
Nowadays rappers dying 
So I take it as a message 
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings 
Tell Em' I'ma changed man, but they don't hear me 
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me 
Let the past be the past 
I'm investin' in the future 
Watch the ones that swallow most ya 
And the ones that'll do ya 
My advice to the world 
Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil 
Thoughts 
'Cause there's gotta be another way 
Life or Death? 
See me? 
I trust nobody 
Money is the rule to all evil 
Better watch yourself boo

And nickle plated slug nose and we left the Calli cause
We made niggas, raised in ghetto's and slums
Totin chips and A-K's, money round drugs (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in their shoes
We TRU niggas, bounded by blood and tatooes
Infiltrating my click, fool it ain't gonna happen

C-Murder,"Yo, yo, what's up nigga? You know the streets is a jungle
You gotta survive out here
You need a strong mind to do the shit I do
You ever seen something blown up before
See that nigga cross the street in that Cutlass
Check this out

[Chorus x2]
Survival of the fittest, respect my come up
Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

[Chorus x2]

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

[Chorus x2]

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

Don't blame me for the pain the world has caused
Don't blame me for your own imperfectionate flaws
If every individual were to accept his own blame
I think the world would be a better change
A better change

Nigga don't blame me cause my lyrics hittin your chest like gunshots
And my thoughts seepin into your brain like cooked rocks
It's like a thick I have on a nigga mind is ??? why'all
Sort of like ???????? of thugs
To break off from an overrated government full of corruption and hypocrites
That try to immoralize yourself when they untouchable by laws, that's bullshit
They say I'm overrated, but I'm highly educated
Incarcerated but reinstated and I know them faders really hate it
Rest in peace Malcom and King, TRU soldiers of the black folks
See while why'all gone, I'm a be a mouthpiece for the ghetto
I feel like it's my duty, I be elected through spirit
One of the chosen few soldiers from the infamous No Limit
Records, a cooliation of highly respected ghetto millionaires and servents
Just some independent brothers that deserve it
Now don't point your finger partner, just practice what you preach
Cause it really ain't my fault playa, so don't blame me

[Chorus]
[Mr. Serv-On]
Believe me
If I had my wish I'd robbin every day nigga wake
Cause if you let the world tell em my lyrics are the reason why
Lil niggas took the pains they can't take
Or the troubles he left behind
Why I gotta be the vision
I ain't even lookin at when your child choose music and he choose mine
But if you was a better parent he wouldn't look up to my kind
And time life taught me
The last minutes of your life is like bail, you either make it or you don't
You either goin love me or you won't
But don't blame me when your child ain't got enough to eat
And nigga I appreciate if you goin buy my CD's
But why'all ain't got a decent pair of shoes on his feet
The streets taught me you gotta accept your blame and don't blame it on others
I look at my mother and I watch her suffer
But we beat the bad times in uptown
And nobody gave a fuck, everybody came around
We made it on our own
And turned a fucked up life into a happy home

[Chorus: see-Murder]
[Mia X]
Don't blame me because my skin tone's like God's own
The oldest skeleton was chose to be an Africans born
I'm from a strong race of people who can never be denied
Every tear we cry's like rain water and so our sea dries
Ghetto flowers shades of ebony in full bloom
Women of color got sentenced, blessings unto our womb
They'd rather see us doomed, placin flowers on tombstones
But BeBe's kids multiply while why'all tryin to plum to save your own
Label me wrong because I spit the raw real
Why'all feel all my verses, even if I curse it's straight through em
Screw em, I takes my blame, you hypocrites make me sick
Tryin to sabotage my arches, thoughts stay on some scandalous shit
Get a grip on the way you truly live
Entertainment can't raise your little kids
Run your households
You got to mold their minds and tell them what to look out for
Gangsta rap won't be a cop out no more

Got the never to pull shit, disrespect usual niggas

When we score niggas never just marijuana
Rome by the home copiana from mama drama
Chase blood like a piranha, sleepy eyes from that ganja
Left your neighborhood burning in flames, just for a reminder
Kinda hostile in a war, that was segregated

Call a coroner, dead bodies in my Nautica van
I lay back with the thirty gat in my hand
Cus he's dead, he's a man, only tank dawgs understand
I came up from the dust, never givin' a fuck
14 hollerin' third world, grabbin' my nuts
No limit soldier till I die, ain't no stoppin' me, ain't no droppin' me
That's the way it was, the way it got to be
Tank dawgs back up in 'emm with the soldier shit

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a

Fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact

We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers over exaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

[Chorus: 2X]

Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something

[Chorus: 2X]

Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

No Limit soldier for life, nigga give me my props
I come a long fuckin' way from pullin jacks (?) and slangin' rocks

Bury him, before he bury me
Become a memory, motherfuckers talkin' bout remember see
Nigga, is you crazy, I don't know what death is
The reaper don't fuck with a nigga like me, I'm a handle my biz
Like 4 more, I'm sick with it, you know what I'm sayin'
Don't play no games boy, you know see-Murder ain't playin'
I go to clubs, mean mug, ain't shit gon' happen
I'm a motherfuckin gangsta, niggaz know I ain't just rappin'
Can't stop a crazy motherfucker from doin' what he want to
I'm still facin' ten years on an open charge in California
So believe if you see me on the corner it really don't matter
And respect a real nigga, or watch your fuckin' brains scatter

Verse 2: [Soulja Slim]

Now see-Murder told you bitches don't play no games
And since I got a little paper bitch you think I changed?
? at all times respect my mind
I'd rather be caught with it than without it, I ain't lyin'
'cause soldier haters come in all shapes and sizes
They act like they your people wearin' them different disguises
You get a little baby and you get some fame
They be all in ya face just because of ya name
I'm worldwide, southside is what I claim
Uptown, magnolia, that's whose bringin' the pain
I'm gettin sick and tired, sick and tired of this shit
Life's a bitch, even when you bitch niggaz and hoes snitch
So tell me what the fuck am I suppossed to do 
I run with real niggaz and trill niggaz that's bout it and TRU

It's Mr. Magic, I'm take my time, I'm a handle my business
Either thuggin or rappin, I refuse to leave a witness
Nigga, money don't make me, I make the money
And you niggaz don't scare me, that's why I ain't runnin
I was in the lower nine, its best you back up bitch
Kidnappers and killas y'all niggaz makin' me homesick
My mind is full of battle scars because I ball
And servin' time in the graveyard, times is hard
But my world still remains the same
Infested with anger, that's why I ride with probably one in the chamber

Between the screen we worth more figures than the world got gravediggaz
We made niggaz, picture us for some years

Yo see-Murder, you believe all these people they call me hopeless.

Look here, it's not easy I struggled to get in this position
Taking my people out the ghetto was my only mission
I was jacking and strong arming accomplished i done changed
Making money living good I'm out of the game
See as I refused to see good in my accomplishments
All I ever get is dirty looks, never compliments
I figure jealousy, wishing that why'all could be me
Cause I'm living larger then life at the age of twentythree (ha ha)
a lot of pessimistic people is speaking about my lifestyle
So when I enter the center I look for the smiles
Many expected me to go down the tubes
Now the same people wishing that they could be in my shoes
But I'm the one they call hopeless
Lord forgive em for thinking that I was worthless
I forgive and forget
And I learn from every life experience
I hope why'all feel every word cause this is real it gets

They said I'm hopeless and I never make it
They doubt it, call me an outcast because I'm bout it
Now why you want to label me and say I'm a thug
I never said I wasn't because this ghetto is in my blood
But I maintain through poverty and tears
My only wish was that I make it to see another year
I left my dreams up in the penn, feel my constant struggle
And one man against a nation, damn I miss my brother
I walk a path to a dead end cause I'm lonely
A childhood full of rainy days kept me homeless
I always wondered was I cursed
Since birth I felt I never had a fair chance in life on this wreched earth
My lonely memories of the past, they got me thinking
I don't want to see the future, but die in vain
I ask the Lord will he forgive me
Before I leave this world I want to live a better life because I'm hopeless

I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg, would like to say
That I'mma crazy mothafucker when I'm playin' with my A.K
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out

And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we to busy sayin' yeaaaahhhhhh

To a kid lookin' up to me

Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass

Homies all standin' around just hangin'
Some dope dealin, some gang bangin' ""what up nigga?""
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my double pointin' at his window
He got scared and hit the gas ""Damn""
Right then, I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to Snukes
Sweatin' all the bitches in the Daisy Dukes
We couldn't no play, from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Navs, bitch you crazy?
She was scared and it was showin'
So we all said ""FucK YOU Bitch"" and kept rollin'
To the hood, now we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
Gettin' rowdy, shit but we call it rat pack
On a nigga follow nothin' at all
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fuckin' with my Tank dogs
I might stumble and still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blues
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See, I don't give a fuck cause I keep bailin'

Mothafuck that man, we need some gangsta in this motherfucker
Some of that South shit, you know what I'm sayin?
Some of that shit from the thiz-ird source, you heard me?

Here's another gangsta down to ride
A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the Tank, yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit

Well, I'm C-Murder the one he talkin' about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me, you know they some haters
I said ""See you later"" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back, with the Navy blue top
True niggas on the scene with the triple beam
Cause I'm the C fool, I slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a mothafucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know your jockin' my crew
""We want to fuck you C""
I want to fuck you too
You see, No Limit niggas don't take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with
Cause I'm the kind of nigga that's quick to blast
If you fuck with me, I'mma smoke your ass

If you would just stayed down and been the motherfuckers real partner
You wouldn't have had that problem
But seein, as you want to jump ship and you thought the ship would sink
A motherfucker without turnin' into a submarine
Went under water came back up with a periscope lookin' at your bitch ass
Now, you have no paper, and now you're on a paper caper
Now, you comin' up to my face and you're sayin: Hey can I hang out?
I say: No cause you ain't got no clout, bitch get out

So I could bend these niggas back like chicken wire
Spittin fire, mobbin, s'on when them bullets get to pourin

I severed the crusher, and buried my (..? ..)
Over the dresser, fiend the trigga my lesser
Gon test ya, with a season to kill
And catch me celebratin across the battlefield
Loco, this is the deal, let's put the gun
To the small of his neck, we got caught up and blast
Until there's nothing left, boy
I thought some more niggas kept, what? what?
Cause I ain't facin prison
Exercising my right to exorcism
Completed my mission, huh?
By lettin the land just listen
Cause they the reason my lil homie ain't livin
So, we on a mission

Now it's really on (what's up fool? )
Being crooked, we do it dirty, (we doing it!)
See-murder and fiend (there they go!)
We dump the fifty round magazine
Locin and mobbin, til it's clean (make sure it's clean)
Hooked up with the colonel, and the billy, cause I need cream
Fifteen five, made twenty five, six hummer size (nigga!)
Muthafuckas died, (nigga!) all in one night (they die!)

[steady mobbin' 2] (a lot of these lines are overlapped by screams,
Gunshots, etc. hard to understand...)
Pulled the trigga on my nigga (not my nigga, damn!)
As the forty caliber shell, blew up in the neck
Twice in the head, he was dead 'fore his body hit the ground
(damn dog, don't go nigga!)
Bitches scream, nigga (..? ..)
Pull up next to the bodies, I was runnin
My dog's head was blew off
I'm bustin hella (? ) (buck, buck, buck)
Hit the driver's side window, as they crash into a pole

Some for the driver, the passenger

Verse 1 

As I look in the mirror I see the picture gettin' clearer 
On the rip of this straightest of the life that I live 
But uh I see em comin' before they approach 
Just like a stafty slot until you circle with hope 
I maintaining on your legendary dreams and stack 
Making million dollar moves with many platinum plaques 
Negotiate your freedom, you catchin' CRP 

From the court from blue, come many nights no sleep 
What's the scenario of life when you trapped in crime 
My 'lil homie still incarcerated for packing a nine 
Now history repeat itself, there's black on black 
Check my background, there's evidence just hide it's back 
Eliminate all my foes, we run violent thrusts 
Excuse me for my crime but in God I trust 
Bossalinie unaffected by the eyes of even 
Cause I'm military minded and demand my freedom 

(Chorus) 
Verse 2 
Record labels try to sign for many years in fact 
Want a life time commitment, get you hooked like crack 
Independent, black owned, you can keep your deal 
I remain with No Limit cause the tank be real 
I lose my cousin eight years for the time he spent 
The penitentiary is full of black violent, meant 
Try to make a change, they can't 
Cause they cuffs to tight 

Momma please help us cause my mind ain't right 
It ain't easy being me with my skin so toned 
The mother land ain't been the same since they took me from home 
My mobile phone in the benz, gettin' high with my friends 
Rainy days got us fighting each other, digging our graves 
A cell block full of pictures, can't wait for parole 
I need a second change of life cause I'm getting to old 
And it's cold I can't see, can't sleep at night 
Like a rebel for my freedom, I'll be prepared to fight

I give a shout to my mom she was there for me, 
even though sometimes i felt she never cared for me
Packin pistols wasn't even in my frame of thought 
We had a problem it was understood that we fought
And Money wasn't even on my most wanted list
It wasn't really necessary just to pull a check
And even though I didn't have a dad, 
I used to thank the lord everyday for everything I had
To all my lost thugs i miss ya well, 
I can't forget ya I got ya picture in my cell
and uh I never use ya name in vane, 
but its a shame how you'll never get to share my fame, my nigga
You never saw your son face to face but rest a sure that ya family straight

cause i got a pocket full a dirt that I'm gonna blow on my friends
I'm headin straight to the streets where i learn the game, 
me and my niggas rushin home where we stashed our cane
I went from student to dope dealer hangin out with straight killers, 
i did better til i met the Millers
I remember livin lies slowly doin so bad so broke i had no where to go 
I was wearin the first pair a Jordan's after the fourth pair came out
I messed around and dropped out tryin to make me some clout
I never worried about my education I was confused 
I thought thugs ran the nation until I got on probation,

took me out the game showed me the right way to get paid

Lord I really miss my friends
Lord please help us

Now as I walk through the streets I see many people under pressure
'Cause uh life ain't easy and you know this world gon' test ya
My daddy told me see one day you gon' be faced with this problem
And you and only you must find the knowledge to solve it

My momma said lord gives us tests to measure our faith
And if you really believe in god, then you shall smile on judgement day
'Cause at the crossroads ain't no hunger, and every man the same color
And when it's my time to open 'em gates cause uh

I really miss my brother
And you the only man that can judge me
So please guide me to the right direction
And why can't I put this gun up and use my bible for protection

And it's an everyday struggle, don't expect nothing to change in a week
But lord help us in this hopeless world
'Cause I don't want to die in the streets

Now I done been stop shedding tears, now my eyes bleed when they cry
And I never understand why, everybody gotta die
And everything that's born gotta go, and I really think that's a shame
And I'm so tired of reminiscin'

Trying to put a face to a name
You put my grandfather in my life, and then you took him away
Yeah, big daddy used to drink but uh, he gave me a place to stay
And many kids starving overseas, and even right here on my block

My auntie told me in the year 2000 that the world was gon' stop
Now I don't want to question you lord, but is violence really the answer
And if not, then how come so many innocent people diein' of the cancer
Now revelations say the world gon' end, but the world ain't over yet
And it's up to us to move on, but in our hearts we'll never forget

[Chorus]

[c-murder]
They say god created man, and put man on this earth
And then came woman from there, and from there, there was birth
And ever since eve gave adam the apple, the bible's like the spell
And introduced mankind, not only to heaven, but a place called hell

Even though we try to repent, it's too many gangstas taking us down
My cousin tried to leave the streets, and now he laying in the ground
And jesus died for our sins, but I wonder if he wasted his time
'Cause it's 1999, and this world is still blind

Now I don't want to lose my freedom, cause I'm this close to making it big
Now I don't know if I'm a make a difference
But I just want to be there for my kids
Now that's a hopeless situation, when will it end, I don't know
But lord help cause your children, ain't got no where else to go

Listen up motherfuckers I got a story to tell
All you niggas out there holding hands with these motherfuckers street
Them motherfuckers behind doors holding meat
You might be holding a nasty ass

Chorus (2x):

Nasty bitch, gonna fuck my boy
Now how you gonna fuck my boy
That's why I don't love them hoes
You can't trust these dog ass hoes

Verse: 1

I was in love like a motherfucker with this bitch
But uhh, I wasn't doing nothing but making her rich (shit)
But damn, she used to played it so cooled
I guess she must take see for a fool
I swear the sex had my motherfucking mind gone
And I was tweeking like a fiend for that heroin
And when I put it in, the way that she moaned,
made me never ever wanted to leave her alone
The back rubs in the hot tubs, watching videos
It made me crawl when she took it all down her throat
Surprise, shit I hit her with a five karat
And later on we can talk about marriage (huh)
Ya name tatted on my chest, fuck them other broads
We hold hands when we walking through the shopping malls
My brother told me V charge it to the game
But uhh, listen up, cause it's a motherfucking shame

Chorus (2x)

Verse: 2

I used to page this girl about ten times a day
But after 9, she was hard to find
One-of-a-kind, huh, so I was blind with the problems we had
Found a number in her purse, said it was her dad
I got a phone call from my nigga Jubilee
He told me, he saw my girl in the movies
With another nigga, nut it wasn't me
I said man, you must be tripping, nigga it couldn't be
I thought it was love, but I guess the love was gone
So then I put up the phone and then I went home
Park the car, walked in the door, walked up the stairs
And I damn near slipped on her underwear
Opened the bedroom door, seen a ho,
with a nigga ro, bout to grab my fo-fo, hold
Damn, bitch I thought we loved each other
Nasty bitch gonna fuck my brother

Bitch, get the fuck out my house,
pick up your dirty ass draws, get that cum off your chest, 
and wipe your motherfucking mouth, and get the fuck out, biatch!
Fuck you gonna fuck my motherfucking boy
Ol' cheesy ass ho
I didn't like you anyway
Biatch
I catch you in the club, I'ma sneak your ass
Fuck, nasty bitch

Then they die when the sun come 
Tryin' to bite lightnin' of the sky

Heard the industry was tryin' to finish me
Look bitch, I got your drink
It ain't no motherfuckin' henisey
Then i wastched them playa haters die slow
Eliminate all you bitches on my motherfuckin' stage show

C-Murder,"I remember when we were kids
We shed all our hurt and tears (and tears)
No matter what the weather, what the weather
We were always togerther (always together)
We grew up as time went on
We became separated (seperated)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away ( when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When Kevin went away (when Kevin went away)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away ( when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When Kevin went away (when Kevin went away)

Kevin life ain't tha even tho we gots tah change
See momma don't understand how you died in tha game
And grandma get older, Little Kevin he's a soldier
We done made it out da ghetto ain't no more run'n for tha rollers
Tattooed your face on my arm so you legacy could live on
You said ""P be strong"" with out you we all alone
I know its been a few years you your birthday we shed tears
And I don't wanna question you God
But why he took you and left us here?

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)

Look, just thinkin about you my nigga bring tears to my eyes
I mean I'm hard and all but even tha realish niggaz cry
And when you left, part of me died too
And who ever knew Kevin like I knew Kevin shhh ya'll would cry too
Just think'n about you, if you were still here
How much different remenisin on one of your pictures
Lookin at the family thinkin we always got one miss'n
And I can still remember tha last words (and mine ain't even started)
Look your never forgotton 'cause on your birthday I go and put flowers on your
Grave
I still remember when P and see broke tha news to me at school about your death
Told me ""Silkk time would heal our wounds""
It's been oh five years and I ain't healed yet
Now I feel somthing I'm tryin tryin to be strong
I know moms tryin to hold on
Even tho your here and your gone
I got so many questions, that's why I can't move on
(It's somthing about you)

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)

Now as I could remember (remember)
A couple of months before December (December)
I still can't take tha pain
We all are stuck in this ghetto rain
I learned my lesson, could your blessings
Watch your enemys and watch your friends
And if it ain't your blood don't show that man no love
'Cause kindness make you weak and cause blindness in tha streets
And the vultures commin to get you
When none of you're real homies is wit ya
And its sad can't break the cycle
And take a drink wit my uncle Michael
And my momma question my silence
But I blame this sinceless violence
Don't wanna wake up 'cause when imma asleep
You still alive up in my dreams
A few seconds of happy thoughts to keep my mind at eaze
And then Kevin its like you ghost my body freeze when ever I see him
If anybody got yours ways, you know it'd be him

It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)
It was a sad day (it was a sad day)
When my homie went away (when my homie went away)

Run your muthafuckin' mouth like you a broad or somethin',
These niggas actin' like they muthafuckin' hard or somethin',
I'm from the cold-hearted streets of the CP3,
The Calliope, where the other niggas just like me,
And bullet proofs on my muthafuckin' ass my nigga,
'cause when I bust I hold 'em up and let'em laugh my nigga,
I got some soldiers on that tank, that would ride for me,
My brother Silkk, even told me he would die for me,
You want beef? Or do you really even know what beef is?
We go to war, it's gonna be kinda hard for you and your kids,

You just mad, 'cause you couldn't do that,
Now you spreadin' them lies,

Can't even look me in my face,
Can't even look in my eyes,
But that's alright, 'cause when I catch'cha I'ma catch'cha,
And I'll bet'cha never ever ever ever ever ever ever
Tell a lie, run your lip,
Talk about this nigga right chea,

I refuse to lose, I want the walkin' G shoes
Spit at you about these issues, I bless you
I'm not here to diss you, the issue is relevant
This cold world'll make you kill a nigga
Especially one that's 'bout a dollar bill nigga
Do you got it? do you want it? Do you need it?
Or will you get it? I get it
Big Snoop Dogg said it (nigga)
I'm here to shead it , get down
Right now (what?)
TRU motherfuckin records (who?) in in effect with the Dogg Pound (DPG)
We're open now
And all you niggas from the ghetto lookin' up at me
And can't believe I went from nothin' to somethin', believe it G!
Picture it, see it, touch it
And watch how a real motherfucker does it

[Chorus:KoKane]
It's like kill or be killed, in this here concrete jungle
For black folks, sometimes no don't love no one

If I was sellin' in yo' shoes them nigga would have been the trip
Ghetto see ridin', rollin' till the sun come up

Blue rag damp ni'a in every one of my pockets
Throwin' up high in the sky

It ain't no fakin of mine
It's what I place on the line

I want it all like my dog, fresh socks and growth
Bitches jockin' how I ball, shit drops the chrome
Blazin' chronic, sippin' tonic, how we live for the three
On the street corner, heat, 'cause it's kill or seek he

[chorus]
Verse 3: see-Murder
I'ma steal this boo, when the cops behind me
It's kill or be killed, but them niggas can't find me
It's a test everyday, from the South to the West
Niggas mad, 'cause my nigga Snoop is labelled the best
Guess what? OG, in the game of rap
And everytime that i see 'em, I get a nigga dept
what's up, to my partners Tray Deee and Goldie Loc
Quick motherfuckin' niggas, always gon' smoke
In the concrete jungle, man you know where it's at
It's the place, where you want to leave, don't want to be at
Believe that, you can check in, but you can't check out
Like Rae, everybody doin' their own shit to get paid
You might die, but it all, goes along with the job
Even ride, do whatever it takes to survive
You a bitch! If you snitch on your friends
But you a true motherfucker, you don't fuck with the pigs

Till the death for street glory, it's infinite beef
Though it's most of the reasons lot of niggas six deep

To keep a soul that way, with 44's that spray
The key to the city, it come in bricks or them birds

Born to my work, deserve what's supposed to be mine

And niggas wanted to blast me, police harass me

Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
 
[Mac] 
The ghetto is hot, it's dark, and most of all it's a prison 
Most of my niggas serve life sentences, only the few is risen 
I made it out the hood but my people still there 
Some of them dead, strung out, up in they wheelchair 
I still care from a distance 
and I know that any day could lead me back to that crimey insistence 
I tell the kids be persistent, when they follow they dreams 
Ain't no telling what tomorrow brings 
Ain't no time to be wasting, you want to be a doctor or the patient? 
Hesitation can lead to expiration, only God can predict it, 
Where do we go from here, snorting powder, drinking beer 
Smokin' crack, killin' our peers, I shed tears 
 
Chorus [Sons of Funk] 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
 
[Silkk] 
Where do we go from here, after we all gone 
and where do we go after we ain't got no place to call home 
Hell I'm just glad to be breathing 
?? like I was the projects for a reason 
Shit, tell my niggas we gotta live, and some gotta give 
why'all gotta rise above this shit, and turn negatives into positive 
Yeah I struggled, but I'ma hustler, and that's self explanatory 
So if I die trying, the hood can just tell why'all my story 
Niggas seen killings and drug dealings, 
imagine we'd dream through it all 
Old ladies ?? through the window, I guess she done seen it all 
It's up to you, cause nobody seems to jam with us 
We struggled to long at the bottom, nowhere else to go but up 
 
[Chorus] [Sons of Funk] 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home

And everybody in the hood gone respect you

I might have to check you
All I want from you is a ride or die
Stand by my side sometimes get high
Fly with me to Jamaica
Subtract yourself from these fakas
I told you, when we first met
Good times bad times you won't forget
And you'll see more cash then you ever could get
And you'll have nice things I want to see you with
But you got to be strong, hold on
Stay true, other playas want a piece of you
But you could get with this or you could get with that
But I'ma step back and let me see where your mind at

She gone chill at home instead of go and run the streets

I'm from uptown New Orleans, straight out the hood

Nigga walked up on me mean-muggin' talkin' shit, what!
I don't know this mother fucker I probably done fucked his bitch

Eyes hella red I just smoked me a nickel
I ain't feelin' this shit, I put my hand on my pickel
The nigga started steamin' but I'm cool as a fan
He wanna throw 'em up but I got a gat in my pants

I'm throwed off nigga, missin' a few screws
And I don't give a fuck about puttin' yo ass on the news
And if you ain't from my hood, you know you could get it
We roll hella deep niggas screamin', ""No limit""

I'm a thug nigga, I lean when I walk
My favorite drink is that Incredible Hulk

Run up on the Lac', this ain't a movie but this the endin'
I gotta nigga rollin' with me name Oozy
We stop on the block and this boy ain't choosy

The first one we see better break me off
And if yo shoes too big, take the mother fuckers off
Straight gutter, straight rugged rugged raw
Wicked like you never saw, lets go to war

If talkin' hell is hot my change is 50/50
If I die I'm takin' you with me so come and get me
In my chest yo' bullets'll never hit me, I'm vested up
Touchin' talneshee nigga that's what's up

Riding around P.A bout-it hostages blowing skunk
Cause getting rid of enemies to me ain't really nothin' nothin'

On the curb, posted up with them bouldas

-nigga, I'm out here reminiscin, lookin around, nigga
-reminiscin on what?
-bout how shit done changed, dawg
-all these niggaz dead we grew up with bro baby, daniel
-damn, bro, this shit daily, constantly happenin
-so what, we next or what?
-nigga, we tryin to come up and raise them little ones
-well, let's find a way out this shit
-well, let's do dat there

[master p]
Niggaz dat want to space age hustle
Catch that rocket to the fuckin moon
That be yo final ship, bitch, cause yo ass is doomed
Ain't no comin back, livin in the dope game
Cause once you die, nigga you slangin rocks, then that's yo name
On the wall when they run up,
I got killas coming trough with bubble ups to pick up double ups
And put him in that muthafuckin long black hearse
I mean, once you gone nigga you layin in the dirt
Ain't no love in new orleans,
All the way to richmond, california
Niggaz livin for ghetto dreams
And the ghetto get so crazy
I seen a little bitty baby suckin on daisies
Caught two to the chest, one to the head
5 niggaz walked behind him dressed in red
With ski masks, but niggaz thought it was a clown show
Witches in the st. bernard projects, downed a hoe
And it's sad cause niggaz claimin 3rd ward
9th ward and niggaz claimin 10th ward
All my homies be dyin down south
Run around, talkin shit, killas with gold in they mouth
But I'm a soldier, a rolla, give me ten
I'd rather die than go to the fuckin pen
My partna bos looked to my eyes and said, ""nigga
Is it time for change, niggaz ain't livin in this dope game""
So we jumped into this rap game
And laid it down to all my killas
That tried to teach my nigga the game
Cause once you gone, ain't no comin back
Talked to randall and t-dove
They say, ""p, the streets ain't all that.""
I mean the calliope projects done change
Right from roges tablet you find the fuckin police man
And niggaz still servin bubble ups
Big mo in the projects rappin, and niggas=z tryin to come up
And with this new wave dope game,
I mean this rap game, niggaz tryin to get out to make some change
But down south my homies dyin, niggaz fryin
But stories we ain't buyin

Chorus: repeat 2x

Who (2pac gone, but what rapper) gon be next
To take that final ride (I hope it ain't me who)
Get cashed like a bad check (slammin cadillac doors)
Black hearses when they should be 6-0's

[silkk]
I often wonder wonder if there's a heaven or a hell
Rest in peace to my niggaz that died
Too bad when they died they couldn't come back and tell
If they really is another side, I seen his mother cry
I just wanna know where he went when my cousin died
That last step, then it's yo debt, yo last breath
Then it's the moment you fear
Just think, by the day over, one of us ain't gon be here
Used to ride with a bunch of niggaz, now he's ridin solo
He's dressed up in a suit, when he used to wear polos
I wonder if there's a heaven for a gangsta, a killa, and a shoota
I wish some nigga gunned john gotti had went in the chamber
Moms say my days are numbered cause I live wrong
Even scarface made a song, gangstas really don't live long
I'm tryin to live to a rock candy painted cadillac like outkast say
Ride on them thangs like mack 10, from back side to side like u.g.k.
Convertible lexus like eightball, mjg
500 like my brother master p, I'm a shock the world if I see 23
Maybe not today, but tomorrow off into the funeral parlor
Take pause to bury my boy, as we roll up to the grave yard

Who gon be next...to take that final ride?

Chorus

[c-murder]
I done seen mo crime than a crime lord
Sometimes I sit back and think I seen more death than god
Just last week a nigga got shot up and burned
But me I take heed to shit like that, and I learned
How can I not end up like that nigga?
What the fuck I got to do not to get banged up by that trigga?
Cause in the projects, ain't no love
Niggaz will split yo wig cause they gon on drugs (her-oin)
I hope you feel me, cause I feel the pain of others
I feel for every nigga that got to go on without they brother
But like the game, what goes around comes around
Next week that could be your muthafuckin hearse ridin through that town
That could be yo mama cryin in that steeple
Better yet, that could be you mornin the death of yo people
In the hood, I'm known for peelin caps, so I'm a cap peela
The police know me for sellin drugs, so I'm a drug deala
I reverse the game cause ain't no love for a black man
13 years old, my little cousin got juvenile life for takin a stand
It's a never endin game of death, do or die
So if you kill, be prepared for that final ride

Chorus (2x)

R.i.p. 2pac, nigga, eazy-e, segram, mr. see
And my little brother kevin
Miller, and all y'all tru niggaz and bitches
That done died out there on these streets
And took that final ride
Y'all niggaz ain't forgotten
Cause tru niggaz live forever
Tru niggaz like us
Ya heard me? it's real nigga
We gon see y'all fools in the crossroads

'Cause we make a lot of bustas run from us.
Ain't no such thing as a fist fight
You getting jumped, so you better have your mind right
Give me a call, when it's time to bang up
And I'm there, before the phone hang up

[Chorus]
When my tru homies call me, I'll be there
When my tru homies need me, I'll be there
When my tru homies call me, I'll be there
I'll be around

I knew one day, my time was coming
But my whole world changed when I put tru on my stomach
And nigga tru stand for keeping it real
And that's why we ride for our homies when our people are killed
I love my momma and my daddy for planting my seed
But me and my homies reminisce over hennesy and weed
And all my loved ones lost trying to hustle and bang
I make rip songs just remember your name
And now kevin you a legend
Even though it send chills up my body, see tru up in heaven
No limit is my life I love my job
That's why I roll with tru homies like jimmy and boz
And tru is the tank
And me and silkk and see-murder we the links(lanks)
I love my brothers over bitches and some bank
And when if need me, I'm there for ya blanc

[Chorus]

So I'm there when y'all need me. anytime, now look
For my tru soldiers, I put nothing in front of y'all
If something jump off, I'm jumping in front of y'all
Ya' know what, they bet not touch none of y'all
'Cause everybody gotta go, even if they touch just one of y'all
They say silkk you might die, but that's my call
Wrong or right, they right 'cause that's my dawgs
Thug living, living like sort of like a menace
Form with ex-cons, people on bonds waiting to get sentenced[you know what I'm
Saying
And I ride with this tru click
It's no limit for life, look ain't nothing after this
And damn it feels good to be a soldier
I roll with niggas like see and p
? 
Y'all my brothers when we fuss, I let y'all win
Wouldn't trade y'all life for ten million so I couldn't fight over ten
Tru tattoos and tanks just boz and v
Just two a few that's down to ride wit' me
I know y'all want to let me see y'all doing it on y'all own
But if ya fall never hesitate to call me on the phone [i'll be around]

My block, my spot, my stop stay hot

Everybody knows, keep it real or get John Doe'd

My hair stay nappy, stay bush, stay twist
My attitude is shitty, my hands stay fist
My house stay searched, my cars stay getting stopped
Haters they hate, they wanna see me in a box

But my bulletproof vests, they protecting my chest
Life ain't nothing but a test, it's a big ol' mess
My money stay getting bigger, even when I'm in jail
My name C lil' daddy, that mean you better chill

My nigga turned sour, when I went upstate
Use to be my homie, till I caught this case
Now I wanna slap the taste, I can't wait

My stash, my connect, my ends, my Benz
My God, please forgive me for all my sins

I'm scoping while these niggaz hoping, I'm slipping while they scoping
The streets is treacherous, elements is trying to test us
We take pills make it easy to respect us

Project buildings drug sellers and bank tellers
I'm getting letters from all these hunts and golder fellas
My mission is simple, my music shine even when I'm gone
My life, my debt, my last breath every day along

My life, my life, my life
My life ain't the same, it shows
My life, my life, my life
They got me knocking on heaven's do's

Uhh, if your people locked up you need to send 'em some shit
Cause it's never too late to stop being a bitch
A magazine and some pictures is a nigga's whole world
When I was down them niggas fell out so I'm riding with the girls
Cause they got mo' heart, than them fake ass dudes
They send no letters, no books, and no money for no food
Cause commissary is so very necessary
It's so close to bein slavery, in Texas nigga it's scary
I reached out to C-Murder right before I came home
And when him home, let me go I make sure that his books was on
And three months later that nigga came home too
Ain't no limit to this shit cause now his dream's coming true
I'ma keep riding with Bun cause UGK will never stop
And I'ma stand up for my partner, steady let them off a lot (yeah)
Bitch, and I'm as trill as you can be
They scream ""Free Pimp C"" but not see the pimp free (here I go)

C-Murder,"Oh yeah 

this dope shit done got a lot of my niggas 

taken out the game 

And to my brother Kevin Miller  rest in peace fool 



Verse 1 



Growing up in the Calliope  New Orleans to be exact g 

I had to pack a gat I thought somebody was out to kill me 

I'm paranoid I toss and turn in my sleep g 

My best friend done turned into my motherfucking enemy 

19 years old gold fronts and a mean mug 

I hooked up with my little cousin Jimmy 

learned to slang drugs 

A lot of shit done changed in my fucking neighborhood 

This fast cash got the P living no good 

I'm deep up in this shit and ain't no turning back 

Me and my cousin ?? say I got him for a fucking sack 

I told him check his bitch, but he didn't here me though 

He didn't believe that his bitch was out smoking dope 

Now I gotta stand on my own 2 

I came in this world by myself 

that's the way I'm gone die fool 

One year later and my cousin doing life on a case 

I moved to Richmond California just to fucking get away 

Bumped into my partner King from New Orleans 

He couldn't find a job and I'm back to slanging amphetamines 

And everything was cool for a fucking while g 

Til I went to this club and this fool tried me 

We in the back with some bitches counting hundreds 

Til these suckers walked up and said jack 

these niggas from the country 

We didn't have no gats, I had to make a g move 

Connects and head butting, that's how I did this fool 

King G hit this boy with a upper cut 

30 days in the county, but we didn't give a fuck 



(Chorus) 



Anything goes 

Life's a trip, but that's how the game goes 



Hood riding, homicide 4 deep with them gats cocked 

Ready to put some fools on they back 



1, 2, 3 a nigga slanging keys 

but why you have to mess with P 



Hood riding, homicide 4 deep with them gats cocked 

Ready to put some fools on they biggety back 



Verse 2 



Released from the county on a PO 

The only way to get back on my feet is slang that diggety dope 

Hooked up with my partner, my cutty mac 

Two days later I'm back rolling motherfucking black 

Lexus coup with a droptop Benz 

And in the glove compartment you'll find about 33,000 ends 

I ain't tripping cause the game get deep though 

Got a phone call, couldn't sleep bro 

They say my little brother died back in New Orleans 

Pop pop boom and it killed him, here him scream 

But I ain't tripping cause mama still here a cry 

In Richmond one day the P is gonna die 

And if I do I guess I'm going out like a g though 

Like the movie on the motherfucking Untouchables 

So when I go out, I know I'm fucking living wrong

Down here we like it big, on that Dirty coast
Big money swanging whips, cause we serve the most
We live by that G code, that's what gangstas do
On the grind stacking chips, with a gangsta crew
Down here sipping lean, that's that purple stuff
Staying thoed getting bucked, playas living it up
Game spitters riding big, is a habit y'all
Everything you dream about, we done had it y'all
We got money yellow hoes, wearing g-string clothes
Sport sweaters in the summer, cause our necks stay froze
Gripping grain having change, hanging low as your belt
If you want to be a man, go and get it yourself
Down here we do it all, break laws and ball
Ghetto stars for the cause, either stand or fall
We live it up cause we love it, playa deal with that
Tite getting it how I live, keep it real with that

Abuse them drugs, and hoes don't get no love

In a six hundred Benz, and the top is missing
Sit back and listen, cause what I'm saying is real
From Houston to Huntsville, boys got ice in grills
We love to chill, and ride on candy paint
Sip on drank, and blow on that stanky dank

[Intro]
Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
  Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
  You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
  He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
  So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
  Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
  Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

sometimes I just wish I could sleep it off

thing i know will never happen 
like a safe environment money happiness success
niggas want static than he going to get it 
i came up with blood money that means 
i'm wicked I roll with nothing but ninos 
so they call me a baller i wiped a niggaz ass 
because I'm not a talker 
took a flight to kali came back with some birds 
ten g's for a key from a nigga called dirt 
I like to hear my mack eleven empty out a clip 
shot a fool up in the club and then i changed my outfit
maintain and uphold my statis as a g 
niggaz kiss my ass because i got a lot of money
plain and simple niggaz leave huh when i don't feel'em 
because they know when they fuck up then i'm going to kill'em 
understand i was rasied where the young niggaz roam

??  how I miss my homies so
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

(Chorus)
I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there

Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

(chorus2x)

(Silkk)
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap
Rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace Pac
And all them other soldiers
Make us see it??",End Of The Road,2013

And I'll still respect you tomorrow, and tonight I hit it
But you only got a couple minutes to choose

Boy give us respect, y'all shit on deck)
Aight Snoop, you got the weed (yeah) and I got the liquor (fa sho)

Cause ain't no party like the ones we drove (whassup)
And um, ain't no cars like the ones we drove 
And um, ain't no dollars like the ones we fold
When we give somethin, call us, it's outta control
(So whether it's summertime, winter, spring or fall
Look for somethin big from Silkk and Top Dogg)
We party with nothin but bud, nothin but thugs
East to west, peep the best, keep it stress, nothin but love (yeah)

Any man that hustle because he got to feed his family.... 
That's a real man.nYou see I hustle because I got feed me family 
I got families to feed, I got feed my mama, 
I got to feed big mama, I got to feed my cousin, 
I got to feed my lil' brother, I got to feed my sister, 
I got to feed my kids, I got to feed my people.

[Chorus]
The ghetto's got me hustlin' tryin' to survive
The ghetts got me hustlin' tryin' to stay alive.
The ghetto get me hustlin' tryin' to survive,
And I know I'm goin' to hustle until the day I die.

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

[Chorus]

It's like I'm rich and poor
I open the world and slang dop
It's the world changes know and changes I thorp.
I thank all my big brothers with out him I wouldn't made it through
So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride. 
Keep your head up!

jumped in too quick
ideally cus we both was lonely
we go 2 stores and you never peek at the price
Treat you right had a bad day i just greet you with ice
you know Silkk The Shocker hang with the thugs and the dealers
wasn't the realest Never the type to get in to expressing my feelings
I ain't gon lie It wasn't all bad
Some was good
matter fact it was all that'
Sometimes i feel like we just didn't match
Found a friend
But only friend till then you alwayz came first
Never type to creep Alwayz tried to make things work
What What

[Silkk The Shocker]
I want to be with you but i can't hope you understand and all
Tried to make this thang work
Got knocked you'll be the first person i call
Now with you can be myself
with her it's like i'm living a lie
I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue
Leave or Stay?
God tell me what's a nigga to do
What What What

For real, I know we from different sides and all
And I ain't even goin' lie, I'm a thug
But I got a question for you
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me
What's up?

[Chorus]
So what you want to do
A girl like me, a guy like you
What we could do
It's whatever baby anything that we want to
Will I fall for a thug like you

[Silk]
Could you see yourself fallin' for somebody like me and um
In fact if you could
I got money now
Can you see yourself if you had to move back up in the hood

Now during sex lay there I'm a have to ask if it's good
This rap stuff stressful let's go see if we can relax in the woods
When I first met you at the bus stop lookin' all shy-like
Tellin' your friend how much that you hated my type

But I'm ready to change, 
I'm willin' to put the game on it, put the range on it
Put powerful things on it
Sooner or later probably have tattos with my name on it

Now look I like to live fast, addicted to cash, the 45 on the dash
And you know me, if you know me, o.g. I'm down to act bad
I need a more than a friend but not quite a relationship
A girl when I come off tour I can't wait to get with

Not the stupid chick the one I probably could vacation with
You gotta go somewhere you know what boo go ahead
Take the six
Now you gotta make a choice either wrong or right
You tried before maybe you just need a thug in your life
What's up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You keep, keep on askin me
If I, say if I want to be with you
The tough part is to think I could
Fall for some body like you

[Silk]
You advanced, took a couple chances and shit
Chances with bricks, couple chances now you sittin in 
Mansions and shit
You done gambled with this thug and won

You know what I'm sayin it's thug life
Cock the glock, pop the glock, drop the top and run
I can't change I'm to deep in it so let me know if you wit me
Can't make no promises but if we make it through boo 

Then sky's the limit
We on the west on the beach, we takin trips to the east
Takin shoppin sprees 'til they damn near hurt our feet
Got you a five when you like smashed the four

Didn't even wreck it you just laid there and scratched the door
Step out the house it's more like a fashion show
Anything and everything you want you got that you ain't even gotta
Ask no more...imagine that

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damn ghetto for me
All my girls think I'm not quite ready for you
So now I try to sneak away to be with you

By my side never the less you brought the
Best of me, the years that I' lived

Understand that there's no other if there is just
A few staying true like you never breaking
No rule lord forgive me for the things I have done
To you if you weren't up in my life I wouldn't know
What to do won't complain about no money didn't

If I die tonight all I want to let you know
Remenise on what we had hold me thight
And don't let go girl.

Never ever let me down ,

It's like deep inside of me you could never be replaced,
Like when we struggle we get tested in faith,
But you been strong and stood by me every step-a-the-way,
I thank the lord for the day he brought you into my life,
Changed my world -my destiny - and gave me new life,
So if you got somebody special - that's always been true,
Show love and take note in everything that they do,
I could neva take fjor granted what she's done for me,
Even when we desagree she still stands by me,
Late night - road trips- showin' mad support,
The typa-girl-that every homie should be keepin' close,
'cause your that typa-a-girl that neva let me down,
Encouraged me to see the light when no one else would come
Around, down when I had money- and down when I was broke,
So if I die tonight hold me tight and don't let go!
I guess that you can say I owe my life to you the
Only dream that really matters is to be with you cuzz
Even though we argue and we fight some times
you'll always be my queen until the end of times

I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating

Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s

But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it

Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile

Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
""Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby""
They're all like ""Oh my God it's him""
""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem""
""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock""
""Please Marshall please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back

Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview not you two
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
You got somethin' to say?!
Man no
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
I swear, I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
And these guys they can find every area code

Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like who's D12, how we get started
(What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girl's to take off their
Underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girl's wan to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa

But somehow you got up in my dome. And begged JT to take ya home. Once we got there, all was good. You put it on a pimp like I didn't think you could. Your super thick and extra pretty. The kinda chick you usually find up Magic City. Her eyes were green and her skin was brown. I looked, wow, and then Mamacita kicked me down.

Screwed up, what, chest be looking booed up
With the chemistry it's brewed up tracks get chewed up
Brighten the mood up, when I'm spitting this all
Above the law, coldest nigga you ever saw
Stay there, outlaw hand me up the state
I infiltrate your chest stain and increase the death rate
Don't hate, my, it only makes us madder
Pockets get fatter, then a only makes them say matter
Squash all the chatter in the southern region
I pledge of allegiance to my niggas not breathing
We all still breathing screaming S.U.C.
And that's the story mafios, and P-A-T
Niggas can't see me cause I'm rougher than most

Poppi in the gray lay with the with the fifth on the back of the lac
You know we ride chrome everyday
Having the ghetto dreams like my nigga P-A
We crossed inside and forever we glide
And one thing's for sure man southside's riding
Let's get this cheddar, you got your wood and your leather
Sitting tall on boys pushing dubs or better
This a click full of g's, so we do it with these
Keep the block on pop and the ice on freeze

Yo
I take 10 steps with a bed lamped vision
Study the disorders we've absorbed inside the village
I understand the plagues and shake hands with my grimace that remain up in
My face like top to bottom train car feelings
Lets question the ascension of a broken social icon in various domino affect
I'm blow this hex over the mission
Just to administer the indoor sucker punch to it's pitiful condition

[C-Rayz Walz]
With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized
Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes
That's so much of a lie, you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots
As the truth hits your ears begin to cry
'Why Is It Like This!' Why the fuck do I care?
I don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear
City lights look like bright groups of fire flies
Many see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies
Tires screech to a halt, the ground cries
Spit sparks speak to the streets
The skid marks are replies
Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals]
The hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you)
As I walk out my door, step into the pollution
(I breathe in the problems) exhale solutions
Physically the situation's hard to stop
I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks
Casualties in this apocalypse (street chronicle)
Abnormal abdominals (push-ups phenomenal)
Relaxin drinking my 6-pack maxing
Faxing my thoughts on the satellite, via Donahue (push it)
Table talk, salt and pepper conversation
Integrated sectors, metropolis and mecca
It's a conspiracy (you know), I can't lie dukes
Sometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do

[Chorus (Aesop Rock):]
It goes thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its stagnant, act of development first of madness

Thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
Punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
 
Steadily searching for something new under the sun
But its hurtin, act of development first diversion

[C-Rayz Walz]
A new universe in ancient, so I stay patient
In a gravel pit, travelin thoughts and ravelin, pacing
Embracing light of America, and found a shade of darkness (underground)
The train car used to be my apartment
Sick of people rushin in the doors before I get out
Conductors closing the doors before I get in, I shout
'The Biz is Coming, The Biz is Coming!'?
Don't get worried now (We've been in a cold world!)
We just getting flurries now?

[Aesop Rock]
Yeah, its like slow down,
You're movin much to fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass
Its delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang
But we like 1970 something twenty clicks outside your name (tear obedience)
I apologize for the faulty academics
But they placed us in a miserable stasis
I let bygones be bygones
But tryin to see eye to eye with the face lift
Just ain't working the way the manual paints it
See I soak in a blue note factory
While most cats hassle bandits lamping solo
And when the last red brick topples over the earth
To intercept your crooked little mess
I can be found in a social coma directly to your left
Engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath
Regarding how to document the shady baby steps
I bounce checks like a modern
Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift
Together specimens from the promise land
This for the thinkers
This for the merchants allergic to they own stingers
This for the absurd verdict linkers
This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions
But can't remember where his drink is
I'm wallowing, shrugging I'm plugging your corporation
'Cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation
Answer this: when all that's said and done
Are you a memorable troop or just a lab rat on the run
Choose one

[Intro: from the film ""Scarface""]


Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
your government receives from the drug industry.

Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
this money, which is in the billions, is coming from
your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
our national product, which is of course cocaine.

Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
same time, we are doing business with the very same
government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

[Beat starts]

*Two Men Speak in Spanish*

[Immortal Technique - Worker]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to ""Heso Preisto"" when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position

[Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials

[Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people...the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see

[Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya...mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
c'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough

[Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot? 
Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose (?), chop it and bag it

[Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
Taking pictures and tapping phones 
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo', 
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room

[C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and (?)
Feds will be up in your mouth...like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke

Players do favors for governers and tax makers

[Immortal Technique Speaking] 
The story just told is an example of the path that
drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
the niggas on your block. So when they point the
finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:

[Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City""]
I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
all you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
the ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
business. This is the American way.",Peruvian Cocaine,2003

Had to let you know how I feel,
Had a bunch of girls, but I'ma keep it real,
Them otha chicken-heads couldn't foot the bill,
But you, its somethin' about ya baby,

Maybe cause ya body just right,
Wit a sexy smile,
And you know how to get that dough,
Plus the heart for red just like bo (""q""),
Feel me up, when I'm feelin' low,
When I'm home or out the road, no questions asked,
You know its on as soon as I hit the door, (fa sho!)
And I need that on my team,
Baby you was made for me,
Had somethin' on my mind,
And forgot what it was, and thats because...

I want a cutie with some tight jeans on, that I can scheme on
Treat her nice, take her out and trick some cream on
TV screens all over the U.S. I'm seen on
It ain't all about me, I'm tryin' to put my team on

We never bring luggage, we go shoppin' when the plane lands

While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin' midget sips, I run with the richest cliques

I even buck celebs, nigga fuck the feds

I stay sweatin' out a bitch perm
I love it when a girl ass is fat and they tits firm
I take all the dough my chicks earn
I watched Corleone do it, now it's Chris turn

Pack a three-pound, that's my prerog' like B. Brown
I rip shows in large arenas, like the Garden or Meadowlands

My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share

Disturb the sound of silence

Take my arms that I might reach you""

I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

C. Baglioni,"Quella sua maglietta fina
Tanto stretta al punto che m'immaginavo tutto
E quell'aria da bambina
Che non glie'ho detto mai ma io ci andavo matto
E chiare sere d'estate, il mare, i giochi, le fate
E la paura e la voglia di essere nudi
Un bacio a labbra salate, un fuoco, quattro risate
E far l'amore giù al faro
Ti amo davvero, ti amo lo giuro, ti amo, ti amo davvero

E lei
Lei mi guardava con sospetto
Poi mi sorrideva e mi teneva stretto, stretto
Ed io
Io non ho mai capito niente
Visto che oramai non me lo levo dalla mente
Che lei, lei era

Un piccolo grande amore
Solo un piccolo grande amore
Niente più di questo niente più
Mi manca da morire
Quel suo piccolo grande amore
Adesso che saprei cosa dire
Adesso che saprei cosa fare
Adesso che voglio un piccolo grande amore

Quella camminata strana
Pure in mezzo a chissacchè l'avrei riconosciuta
Mi diceva ""Sei una frana""
Ma io questa cosa qui mica l'ho mai creduta
E lunghe corse affannate incontro a stelle cadute
E mani sempre più ansiose di cose proibite
E le canzoni stonate urlate al cielo lassù
""Chi arriva prima a quel muro""
Non sono sicuro se ti amo davvero
Non sono, non sono sicuro

E lei
Tutto ad un tratto non parlava
Ma le si leggeva chiaro in faccia che soffriva
Ed io
Io non lo so quant'è che ha pianto
Solamente adesso me ne sto rendendo conto
Che lei, lei era

Un piccolo grande amore
Solo un piccolo grande amore
Niente più di questo niente più
Mi manca da morire
Quel suo piccolo grande amore
Adesso che saprei cosa dire
Adesso che saprei cosa fare
Adesso che voglio un piccolo grande amore",Questo Piccolo Grande Amore,2005
C. Barber,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?

We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

To the Mississippi

Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome

C. Holiday,"Sometimes it's hard to say I'm sorry yo

yo, eh, my raps written in a whirlwind, so if my tail spin
just point at me and ill begin where the twirl ends
its difficult to open up, wounds that never shut
and watch it bleed while these rap critics eat it up
but such is destiny, a limit of choice
I'm the coppertone chiller, with the little kid voice
used to never talk, thoughts too deep, they're philosophical
to drop interpretations, quite logical
systematic pressure, I ingest and write my letters
the misery, visibly, breaking me, physically
I walk around half-smiles, hiding pain deep, knowing that I ain't feelin
right and it's hard to sleep/ subconsciously worry about my mom and poppa
she want another life where she marry her a doctor
and after all these years it's just tears
she wanted something more, but it's hard to shift the gears
pops stressin out, didn't know he did nuttin wrong
apologetic, say your sorry but the hurt has been done
same old song, but I don't understand the melody
treated like a criminal, third strike felony
its hard as fuck when you see your pop cry
lookin deep into my face never blinkin an eye
say your sorry

[Chrous]
sorry, didn't mean to hurt nobody
sorry, never knew I was hurtin you
I'm sorry

yo this is for the ladies that I did wrong, it's sort of crazy
that I would write these words up in a song, hopin maybe
to get some closure, relationship's already over
I'm healthy and I'm sober, no brownies made of doja
born in october, I'm a libra in my placement
the qualities of my sign, they leave me here adjacent
to romance, I cant say ive been faithul
ive cheated many times, for experience I'm grateful
even, bleak and honest, posturin like a madonnas
while kissin on your neck, pullin deeper marijuanas
manipulatin, you was giving, I was taking
my girl weve been forsaken, like muslims eating bacon
its kinda squalor, I dont know what else to call it
you opened up your heart and I had to go and spoil it
this is for the sisters who I really got deep
nicky, jackie, queen afuya, Big T
all due respect cause we met for a purpose
I hope you ain't ashamed cause the time wasn't worthless
I'm sorry

[Chorus]

to all my homies gettin my back, I'm never lonely
if I ever dis, raised a fist, I was only
caught up in the moment, thought you was my opponent
I saw myself in you for a minute, and I wanted
to fight me, likely I was mad at self
sometimes it's easier to blame someone else
without ya'll couldn't stand the constant demands of livin rap life
It's only right that we band/ together against the restless tides of oppression
I'm firin rhymes like smith n wessun
progression is made with a simple step, even jesus wept
I'm lettin ya know too long, these feelings kept
inside of my mind, true friends hard to find
now that I let it out, we gotta shine cousin I'm so sorry",Sorry,2007
C. Holmes,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings,1993
C. Infante,"Me equivoqué contigo
Me equivoqué a lo macho
Como muy pocas gentes
Se habrán de equivocar

Te conocí en la iglesia
Y te mire en silencio
Por no turbar tú rezo
Que para mí es sagrado

Por tu carita buena
Por tu mirada clara
Por tantas otras cosas
Hubiera yo jurado

Pero qué triste realidad me has ofrecido
Que decepción tan grande haberte conocido
Quien sabe Dios porque te puso en mi camino

Me equivoqué contigo
Como si no supiera
Que las más grandes penas
Las debo a mis amores

Me equivoque contigo
Después de tantos años
De tantas amarguras
Y tantas decepciones

Pero te hallé en la iglesia
Y tu carita buena
Me hizo formar de nuevo
Un mundo de ilusiones

Pero qué triste realidad me has ofrecido
Que decepción tan grande haberte conocido
Quien sabe Dios porque te puso en mi camino

All the while you plan to be my man
Now I'm in love with you

You make me happy
You make me feel so good
With the things you do for me
Oh baby can't you see that
You make me happy
Make me feel so good
With the things you do for me
Oh baby, baby, baby

Who can make my life so complete baby

Américaine
Avec tes couettes, toute une époque
Let's twist again

Dans tes yeux bleus
C'était l'Amérique à Nancy
Dans tes cheveux
Cinquante étoiles brillaient la nuit
Hello Nancy
Tu te souviens de ce jour-là
Il faisait gris
Quand j'suis parti là-bas

Nancy ou Nancy c'est du pareil au même
Les rues de ma vie sonnent à l'américaine
Nancy ou Nancy c'est le même parfum

Nancy ou Nancy c'était l'adolescence
Des jeux interdits qui rejouent en silence

Parfois tu crois m'apercevoir
