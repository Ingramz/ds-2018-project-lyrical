Van Morrison,"I wished I had you in Carrickfergus,
Only for nights in Ballygrand,
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
The deepest ocean to be by your side.

But the sea is wide and I can't swim over
And neither have I wings to fly.
I wish I could find me a handy boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy days so long ago.
My boyhood friends and my own relations.
Have all passed on like the melting snow.

So I'll spend my days in endless roving,
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus,
On the long road down to the salty sea.

And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink,
With gold and silver I did support her
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink.

I'm drunk today and I'm rarely sober,
A handsome rover from town to town.
Oh but I am sick now and my days are numbered
Come all ye young men and lay me down.",Carrickfergus,1988
Van Morrison,"When Lewellyn comes around
And he goes through Market Town
You'll be on the Celtic Ray
Are you ready?

When McMannus comes around
On his early morning rounds
Crying ""Heron 'a' lay""
You'll be on the Celtic Ray

Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales
I can hear the mothers' voices calling
""Children, children, children""

When the coal brick man comes 'round
On a cold November day
You'll be on the Celtic Ray
Are you ready? Are you ready?

Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales
I can hear the mothers' voices calling
""Children, children, children""

Listen Jimmy! I want to go home.
Listen Jimmy! I want to go home.
I've been away from the Ray too long
I've been away from the Ray too long

All over Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales
I can hear the mothers' voices calling
""Children, children, come home children""
""Children, come home on the Celtic Ray""
""In the early morning we'll go walking
Where the light comes shining through
On the Celtic Ray

Come home children
Come home on the Celtic Ray",Celtic Ray,1988
Van Morrison,"I'll tell me Ma when I go home,
The boys won't leave the girls alone.
They'll pull my hair, they stole my comb,
Well that's alright till I go home.

She is handsome. She is pretty.
She is the bell of Belfast City.
She is courtin' one, two, three.
Please won't you tell me, who is she?

Albert Mooney say's he loves her.
All the boy's are fighting for her.
They knock at the door and ring at the bell
Sayin' ""Oh my true love, are you well""?
Out she comes as white as snow,
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes.
Ole Jenny Murray says she'll die
If you don't get the fella
With the roving eye.

Let the wind and the rain and hail blow high
And the snow come tumbling from the sky,
She's as nice as apple pie.
She'll get her own lad by and by.
When she gets a lad of her own,
She won't tell her Ma when she gets home.
Let them all come as they will
For it's Albert Mooney she loves still.

I'll tell me Ma when I go home,
The boys won't leave the girls alone.
They'll pull my hair, they stole my comb,
Well that's alright till I go home.

She is handsome. She is pretty.
She is the bell of Belfast City.
She is courtin' one, two, three.
Please won't you tell me, who is she?",I'll Tell Me Ma,1988
Van Morrison,"Oh won't you stay
Stay a while with your own ones
Don't ever stray
Stray so far from your own ones
Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
That you share with your own ones

Don't rush away
Rush away from your own ones
Just one more day
One more day with your own ones
Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing 'bout your soul
That you share with your own ones

There's a stranger
And he's standing at your door
Might be your best friend, might be your brother
You may never know

I'm going back
Going back to my own ones
Come back to talk
Talk a while with my own ones
Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing 'bout your soul
You share with your own ones

Oh won't you stay
One more day with your own ones
Don't rush away
Rush away from your own ones

Don't care nothing for your soul

Van Morrison,"Where Lagan streams sing lullabies
There blows a lily fair.
The twilight gleam is in her eye,
The night is on her hair.
And like a lovesick lenashee
She hath my heart in thrall.
No life have I, no liberty,
For love is Lord of all.

And often when the beetles horn
Has lulled the eve to sleep,
I'll steal into her sheiling lorn
And through the doorway creep.
There on the cricket's singing stone,
She makes the bogwood fire
And sings in sweet and undertone,
The song of hearts desire.",My Lagan Love,1988
Van Morrison,"On Raglan Road on an Autumn Day,
I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I may one day rue.

I saw the danger, yet I walked
Along the enchanted way
And I said let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day.

On Grafton Street in November,
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worst of passions pledged.

The Queen of Hearts still baking tarts
And I not making hay,
Well I loved too much; by such and such
Is happiness thrown away.

I gave her the gifts of the mind.
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to all the artists who have
Known true Gods of Sound and Time.

With word and tint I did not stint.
I gave her reams of poems to say
With her own dark hair and her own name there
Like the clouds over fields of May.

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet,
I see her walking now away from me,
So hurriedly. My reason must allow,
For I have wooed, not as I should

A creature made of clay.
When the angel woos the clay, he'll lose
His wings at the dawn of the day.",Raglan Road,1988
Van Morrison,"My young love said to me,
My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind.
She stepped away from me
And this she did say,
""It will not be long love
Till our wedding day"".

She stepped away from me
And she moved through the fair
And fondly I watched her move here
And move there.
And she went her way homeward
With one star awake,
As the swan in the evening
Moved over the lake.

Last night she came to me,
My young love came in.
So softly she entered,
That her feet made no din.
And she came close beside me
And this she did say,
""It will not be long love
Till our wedding day"".",She Moved Through the Fair,1988
Van Morrison,"In Banbridge Town in the County Down
One morning last July,
From a boreen green came a sweet colleen
And she smiled as she passed me by.
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair.
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
For to see I was really there.

[Chorus]
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and
From Galway to Dublin Town,
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down.

As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head,
And I looked with a feelin' rare,
And I say's, say's I, to a passer-by,
""Whose the maid with the nut brown hair""?
He smiled at me and he says, say's he,
""That's the gem of Ireland's crown.
It's Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,
She's the star of the County Down"".

[Chorus]

At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes,
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose.
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Till my plough turns rust colored brown.
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down.

[Chorus]",Star of the County Down,1988
Van Morrison,"Contacting my angel, contacting my angel
She's the one, she's the one, that satisfies
Contacting my angel she's the one that satisfies
She's the one that I adore

In a telepathic message for my baby
In a little village, through the fog
Here comes my baby, I can tell, I can tell
By the way she walks
Said I've been on a journey up the mountain side
And I drank the water from the stream
It was pure, pure water and I got completely healed

I met a presence on the mountain side
And he looked so radiant and he was the
Youth of eternal summers
Like a sweet bird of youth in my soul
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul, in my soul
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul",Contacting My Angel,1989
Van Morrison,"In the daring night when all the
Stars are shining bright

I'd love to write another song
I'm searching everywhere
Though I look for inspiration sometimes
It's just not there
I have to work, I have to play
I have to get in step
If I could write another love song
I know it sure would help

I'd love to write another song
Baby especially for you

Van Morrison,"I'm tired Joey Boy
While you're out with the sheep
My life is so troubled
Now I can't go to sleep
I would walk myself out
But the streets are so dark
I shall wait till the morning
And walk in the park

This life is so simple when
One is at home
And I'm never complaining
When there's work to be done
Oh I'm tired Joey Boy of the makings of men
I would like to be cheerful again

Ambition will take you
And ride you too far and
Conservatism bring you to boredom once more
Sit down by the river
And watch the stream flow
Recall all the dreams
That you once used to know
The things you've forgotten
That took you away
To pastures not greener but meaner

Love of the simple is all that I need
I've no time for schism or lovers of greed
Go up to the mountain, go up to the glen
When silence will touch you
And heartbreak will mend.",I'm Tired Joey Boy,1989
Van Morrison,"On a gold autumn day
You came my way in Orangefield
Saw you standing by the riverside in Orangefield

Saw you standing by the riverside in Orangefield

The last time we stood in the west

And the countryside is so green
Standing on the highest hill with a sense of wonder
You can see everything is made in God
Head back down the roadside 
And give thanks for it all

And the rain came pourin' down
Me and Billy standin' there
With a silver half a crown

Hands are full of a fishin' rod
And the tackle on our backs
We just stood there gettin' wet
With our backs against the fence

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Hope it don't rain all day

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

Then the rain let up and the sun came up
And we were gettin' dry
Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned

And he dropped us up the road
Yeah, we looked at the swim and we jumped right in
Not to mention fishing poles

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Let it run all over me

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

On the way back home we sang a song
But our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man from across the road
With the sunshine in his eyes

Well he lived all alone in his own little home
With a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too, one for me and you
And he said Hey! There you are

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Get it myself from the mountain stream

Van Morrison,"Oh, the smell of the bakery from across the street
Got in my nose
As we carried our ladders down the street
With the wrought iron gate rows
I went home and listened to Jimmie Rodgers in my lunch break
Bought five Woodbines at the shop on the corner
And went straight back to work

Oh, Sam was up on top
And I was on the bottom with the V
We went for lemonade and Paris buns
At the shop and broke for tea
I collected from the lady
And I cleaned the fanlight inside out
I was blowing saxophone on the weekend
In that down joint

What's my line
I'm happy cleaning windows
Take my time
I'll see you when my love grows
Baby don't let it slide
I'm a working man in my prime
Cleaning windows (number a hundred and thirty six)

I heard Leadbelly and Blind Lemon
On the street where I was born
Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee
Muddy Waters singin' I'm a rolling stone
I went home and read my Christmas Humphreys' book on Zen
Curiosity killed the cat
Kerouac's Dharma Bums and On The Road

I can do many wondrous things
I want to know when the spirit moves you
Did ye get healed

And walk about it
Everyday I want to be closer

When you get it down in your soul

And it makes you feel whole

That pervades when we all cry?
How can you watch the violence
That erupts before your eyes?

Just to keep us hangin' on?
Something that just don't mean nothing

Clinging to some other rainbow
While we're standing, waiting in the cold
Telling us the same old story
Knowing time is growing old

That was a wonderful remark
I had my eyes closed in the dark
I sighed a million sighs
I told a million lies, to myself, to myself

How can we listen to you
When we know your talk is cheap?
How can we ever question
Why we give more and you keep?
How can your empty laughter
Fill a room like ours with joy?
When you're only playing with us
Like a child does with a toy?
How can we ever feel the freedom
Or the flame lit by the spark
How can we ever come out even
When reality is stark?

I told a million lies, to myself

On Hyndford Street
Where you could feel the silence at half past eleven
On long summer nights
As the wireless played Radio Luxembourg
And the voices whispered across Beechie River
In the quietness as we sank into restful slumber in the silence
And carried on dreaming, in God
And walks up Cherry Valley from North Road Bridge, railway line
On sunny summer afternoons
Picking apples from the side of the tracks
That spilled over from the gardens of the houses on Cyprus Avenue
Watching the moth catcher working the floodlights in the evenings
And meeting down by the pylons
Playing round Mrs. Kelly's lamp
Going out to Holywood on the bus
And walking from the end of the lines to the seaside
Stopping at Fusco's for ice cream
In the days before rock 'n' roll
Hyndford Street, Abetta Parade
Orangefield, St. Donard's Church
Sunday six-bells, and in between the silence there was conversation
And laughter, and music and singing, and shivers up the back of the neck
And tuning in to Luxembourg late at night
And jazz and blues records during the day
Also Debussy on the third program
Early mornings when contemplation was best
Going up the Castlereagh hills
And the cregagh glens in summer and coming back
To Hyndford Street, feeling wondrous and lit up inside
With a sense of everlasting life
And reading Mr. Jelly Roll and Big Bill Broonzy
And ""Really The Blues"" by ""Mezz"" Mezzrow
And ""Dharma Bums"" by Jack Kerouac
Over and over again
And voices echoing late at night over Beechie River
And it's always being now, and it's always being now
It's always now
Can you feel the silence?
On Hyndford Street where you could feel the silence
At half past eleven on long summer nights

Most of them laughed out loud like nothings been lost
There were hypocrites and parasites and people that drain
Tell me why must I always explain

Why, why must I always explain
Over and over, over again
It's just a job you know and it's no sweet Lorraine
Tell me why must I always explain 

Well I get up in the morning and I get my brief
I go out and stare at the world in complete disbelief
It's not righteous indignation that makes me complain
It's the fact that I always have to explain

I can't be everywhere at once, there's always somebody to see
And I never turned out to be the person that you wanted me to be
And I tell you who I am, time and time and time again
Tell me why must I always explain

Always telling people things they're too lazy to know

Crying like a fire in the Sun
Look out baby, the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers
Better use your sense
Take what you have gathered
From coincidence

The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too is fallin' in over you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the debt you've left
That will not follow you

Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is foldin' over you

And the countryside is so green
Standing on the highest hill with a sense of wonder
You can see everything is made in God
Head back down the roadside

Van Morrison,"Oh, the smell of the bakery from across the street
Got in my nose
As we carried our ladders down the street
With the wrought-iron gate rows
I went home and listened to Jimmie Rodgers in my lunch-break
Bought five Woodbines at the shop on the corner
And went straight back to work. 

Oh, Sam was up on top
And I was on the bottom with the V
We went for lemonade and Paris buns
At the shop and broke for tea
I collected from the lady 
And I cleaned the fanlight inside-out
I was blowing saxophone on the weekend
In that down joint.

I'm happy cleaning windows
Take my time
I'll see you when my love grows

Cleaning windows (number a hundred and thirty-six) 

I heard Leadbelly and Blind Lemon
On the street where I was born
Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, 
Muddy Waters singin' ""I'm A Rolling Stone""
I went home and read my Christmas Humphreys' book on Zen
Curiosity killed the cat
Kerouac's ""Dharma Bums"" and ""On The Road""

Van Morrison,"There's a small cafe on the outskirts of town
I'll be there when the sun goes down
Where the roadside bends
And it twists and turns
Every new generation
And I'll be praying to my higher self
Don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground

There's a roadside jam playin' on the edge of town
In a town called Paradise near the ancient highway
When the train whistle blows
All the sadness that Hank Williams knows
And the river flows
Call them pagan streams and it spins and turns
In a factory in a street called Bread in East Belfast
Where Georgie knows best
What it's like to be Daniel in the lion's den
Got so many friends only most of the time

When the grass is high and the rabbit runs
Though it's talkin' to you and I
And every new generation comes to pay
The dues of the organ grinder jam
And the grinder's switch of the sacrifice
Everybody made to be rational with understanding
And I'll be praying to my higher self
Oh, don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground

What about all the people living in the nightmare hurt
That won't go away no matter how hard they try
They've got to pay time and time again, time and time again
I'll be praying to my higher self
And I'll be standin' there, where the boats go by
When the sun is sinking way over the hill
On a Friday evening when the sun goes down
On the outskirts of town, I want to slip away
I want to slip away, got to get away
And I'll be praying to my higher self
Don't let me down, keep my feet on the ground, don't let me down

You'll be cryin' again, you'll be cryin' again, you'll be cryin' again
By the same wipe the teardrops from your eyes
Have to slip away in the evening when the sun goes down
Over the hill, with a sense of wonder
Everything gonna be right on a Friday evening
All the cars go by all along down
The ancient highway
And I'll be praying, I'll be praying to my higher self
Don't let me down, keep my feet, keep my feet on the ground
Keep my feet on the ground

Traveling like a stranger in the night, all along the ancient highway
Got you in my sights, got you on my mind
I'll be praying in the evening when the sun goes down
Over the mountain, got to get you right in my sight
As the beams on the cars from the overpass
On the ancient highway shine like diamonds in the night
Like diamonds in the night
I'll be praying to my higher self, to my higher self
Don't let me down, don't let me down

And you'll be standing there, while the boats go by
While the boats go by on a Friday evening
Shining your light, shining your light on a Friday evening
Got to slip away, got to slip away down that ancient highway
In a town called Paradise, in a town, in a town
All along, all along that road, all along that road,
All along that road with the trance like vision

I'll be praying to my higher self, don't let me down, don't let me down
Keep my feet on the ground, keep my feet on the ground,
Keep my feet on the ground
Friday evening got to slip away
Watching the view from a car from the overpass
And we're driving down that ancient road
Shining like diamonds in the night, oh diamonds in the night
All along the ancient highway
Got you in my sight, got you in my mind
Got you in my arms and I'm praying, and I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray, to my higher self, ah don't let me down
Don't let me down, give me the fire, ah give me the fire",Ancient Highway,1995
Van Morrison,"Each time I hold somebody new
My arms go cold thinking of you
No one can take your place, darling, in my embrace
I'll never be free.

And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss can put out the fire
Though I may try and try, no one can satisfy
This longing in me.

[Chorus]
I'll never be free from your smile so tender
The sweet surrender in your eyes
I cannot be free when I remember
How you fill me with desire.
Just like a train tracks through my heart
Your love remains while we're apart
That kiss I gave to you
Made me a slave to you
I'll never be free.

And there's no straight answers
Of what this thing called love is all about

When I was a little

A woman will sweet talk
And give you the big eye

A woman's a two faced

Now the rain is falling
Heaven can hear you calling
Doo wee
Heaven blows the lonesome whistle
Blowing across the threshold
Doo wee
Doo wee ta too tee

Evening breeze will start
Trees that crying in the
All in the world wood haunted slide
When you get the blues in the night

So take my word
Or the mocking bird
Will sing a sadder kind of song
Maybe he knows things
He knows things can go wrong

Each time I find myself flat on my face, 
I pick myself up and get back in the race. 

That's life, I can't deny it,

But my heart just won't buy it.

Played in that holy ground where they felt the awe and wonder
And they all were unafraid of the great god Pan

And the wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn
The wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn

When the vision vanished they heard a choir of birds singing
In the heavenly silence between the trance and the reeds
And they stood upon the lawn and listened to the silence

Of the wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn
The wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn
The wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn

Torn between half truth and victimization
Fighting back with counter attacks

When the rough god goes gliding

Riding on in

Gaping wounds that will never heal

There'll be nobody hiding
When that rough god comes riding on in

When you're born with your back against the wall
Won't somebody hand me a bible
Won't you give me that number to call

				",Western Plain,1998
Van Morrison,"You came to see me when the moon was new
Saw you standin' in the pouring rain
Left my message on the window pain
Back on the street again
Back on the beat again
I'm back on the top again

Saw me climbing to the top of the hill
You saw me meeting with the fools on the hill
Learned my lesson and I had my fill
Learnt it all in vain
Went through it all again
Now I'm back on the top again

Always strivin', always climbing way beyond my will
Same old sensation, isolation at the top of the bill
Always seeming, like I'm moving but I'm really going slow
What do you do when you get to the top and there's nowhere to go

Just how I get there will be anybody's guess
With all the so called trappings of success
Left all the deadbeats on the top of the hill
Too busy raisin' Cain
I'm back on the street again
I'm back on the top again

Always strivin', always climbing way beyond my will
It's the same old sensation, isolation at the top of the hill
Always seeming, like I'm moving but I'm really going slow
You'll find out when you get to the top that there's nowhere to go

How you get there will be anybody's guess
With all the so called trappings of success
Left all the deadbeats on the top of the hill
Too busy raisin' Cain
I'm back on the street again
I'm back on the top again

Back on my feet again
I'm back on the street again
I'm back on the top again",Back on Top,1999
Van Morrison,"Well I heard the bells ringing, I was thinking about winning
In this God forsaken place
When my confidence was well, then I tripped and I felt
Right flat on my face
Now I'm standing erect, and I feel like coming back
And the sun is shining gold
Put a smile on my face, get back in the human race
And get on with the show

And I'm taking in the Indian Summer
And I'm soaking it up in my mind
And I'm pretending that it's paradise
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day
On a golden autumn day, an a golden autumn day

In the wee midnight hour I was parking my car
In this dimly lit town,
I was attacked by two thugs, who took me for a mug
And shoved me down on the ground
And they pulled out a knife, and I fought my way up
As they scarpered from the scene
Well this is no New York street, and there's no Bobby on the beat
And things ain't just what they seem

And I'm taking in the Indian Summer
And I'm soaking it up in my mind
And I'm pretending that it's paradise
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day
On a golden autumn day, an a golden autumn day

Who would think this could happen in a city like this
Among Blake's green and pleasant hills,
And we must remember as we go through September
Among these dark satanic mills
If there's such a thing as justice I could take them out and flog them
In the nearest green field
And it might be a lesson to the bleeders of the system
In this whole society

And I'm taking in the Indian Summer
And I'm soaking it up in my mind
And I'm pretending like it's paradise
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day, golden autumn day ...",Golden Autumn Day,1999
Van Morrison,"By the mansion on the hillside
Red sports car comes driving down the road
And pulls up into the driveway
And a story does unfold

She's standing by the rhododendrons
Where the roses are in bloom
Looking out at the Atlantic ocean
And in her head she hums this tune

Thank God the dark nights are drawing in again
'cause high summer has got me down
I'll wait till the end of August
And get off this merry-go-round

And they shut him out of paradise
Called him Lucifer and frowned
She took pride in what God made him
Even before the angels shot him down to the ground

He's a light out of the darkness
And he wears a starry crown
If you see him, nothing will shake him
'cause high summer has got him low down

High summer's got him lonesome
Even when he makes the rounds
There's been no two ways about it
High summer's got him low down

Checked in to the tiny village by the lakeside
Settled down to start a new
Far away from the politicians
And the many chosen few

Far away from the jealousy factor
And everything that was tearing him apart
Far away from the organ grinder
And everyone that played their part

And they shut him out of paradise
Called him Lucifer and frowned
'Cause he took pride in what God made him
Even before the angels shot him to the ground

He's a light out of the darkness
And he wears a starry crown
If you see him nothings shaken
'cause high summer's got him low down

High summer's on the rebound
High summer's got him low down
High summer's on the rebound
High summer's got him down, low down
High summer's on the rebound
High summer's got him low down

When you came back off the boats you didn't want to go anywhere
You sit down to TV in your favorite chair
You watch the big picture fade away down at Harland and Wolff
But you still kept on choppin' wood

And you came back home to Belfast
So you could be with us like
You lived your life of quiet desperation on the side
Going to the shipyard in the morning on your bike

Well the spark was gone but you carried on
You always did the best you could
You sent for us once but everything fell through
But you still kept on choppin' wood choppin' wood

And deep inside your heart you really know oh, just how it feels
And you start breaking down and go into the pain
Keep on moving on a fast train

You're way over the line next thing you're out of your mind
And you're out of your depth in through the window she crept

Man has to sweat and toil his life filled with trouble
Man got to step and fetch it on the double
Man has to work so hard to make it all pay
Man has to struggle all the live long day
Man keeps on moving 'cause he can t keep still
Man has to set his goals and climb up the hill
Man sees the mountains and the deep blue sky
Man has to struggle till the day that he die

Well yes siree Bob them there's the breaks
That's how it is my friend don't make no mistake

Man has to take some action all of the time
Man by his nature's never satisfied
Man just can't vegetate no matter what they say
Man has to make it all the live long day
Man has to create karma that s the way that it is
Man has to keep on going way beyond his will
Man has to keep on being 'cause there s nothing else
And man just always has to go for himself
Take all the gurus when they meditate
Transcend the mundane into some altered state
You just might get there, but you'll have to pay
Man's got to struggle all the live tong day

Well yes siree now Bob them there's the breaks
That s how it is my friend don't make no mistake

Man has to watch the weather and the food that he eats
Man has to keep fit else he's prone to disease
No matter what he does there's stress every which way
Man has to struggle all the live long day
Man is in conflict with his natural self
Man has to suppress his own desires and instincts
Man has to work so hard to keep them at bay
Man has to struggle all the live long day

By people long ago that were conning him

That song to me this day.

Never brought anyone happiness

Oh the faucet started dripping in the kitchen
Last night your picture fell down from the wall
And today the boss said 'sorry son I can't use you anymore
And tonight the light bulb went out down the hall
Oh, things have gone to pieces since you left me

Nothing turns out half right, now it seems
There ain't nothin' in my pocket, but three nickels and a dime

And I'm holding to the pieces of my dreams
Somebody threw a baseball through my window
And the arm fell off my favourite chair today

Oh the man he came today, said he'd haul all my things away
If I didn't get my payments made by ten

Then I took you walkin' outdoors
I walked you up and down the block

This has got to stop, you're way over the top
Pack my things and walk, we can't even talk
This has got to stop, I just had enough
I'm gonna call your bluff, walk you one more lap

And I watched you watching me as I watched you walk away from me
And I went off to that far country
I took a plane out to that Newfoundland
And you said to me that you didn't understand

[Chorus]

Well I came back home and I burnt our house down
I watched it crumble to the ground
Oh it caved in like a piece of balsa wood
I turned to you and said baby, this is just no good

And I worked and I tried to build it all back up again
The day that you told me that you had really changed
Then you knocked down all my castles in the sand
Then I said baby, I know now just where we stand

There is nothing I can hide from you

No matter what sea I've been sailing on

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?

Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease the pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'

When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand

This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ahh
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'

Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now

Sounds along the way
Looking at you looking at me looking right back at you, hey

Where the deer and the provincial angels roam

You do another, So this death can live

Ah, tell 'em about it Darlin'.
Here we go.
She's a waitress at her corner,
Always dancin' nine-to-five.
Well, she ain't no supermodel,
But I'm here to tell you, she's fine, (Ha, ha.)
She's so fine, Johnny.
She's like the classic girl next door,
There's somethin' 'bout her walk:
There's somethin' that goes off inside,
Each time she starts to talk.
Plain Jane,
Oh, I love her name.
She drives me insane.
She's my plain Jane.
She always gets my business,
I can't wait to ring her bell.
(Ah, I bet you can't Donnie.)
She puts a quarter in the jukebox:
Says she don't kiss an' tell.
Is that right, brother.
The way she wears that dress, (Yeah.)
It's time that I confess:
The music starts an' my heart stops,
An' I become a mess.
Plain Jane,
Oh, I love her name.
She drives me insane.
She's my plain Jane.
Nothin' fancy: she's just got everything.
She's so addicting; she's so amazing:
Can't think of anything.
Do, do, do do.
(Whoa, talk to me, plain Jane.)
Do, do, do do, do, do.
Whoa, yeah,

And go spend all the rest?

Tonight?s a California Merlot
May I suggest the calamari
Oysters or the escargot??

Vanaver Caravan,"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

Vance Joy,"I love you in the morning when the blood runs to your cheeks
Babe, you are the first thing and the last thing that I'd see
I was just a boy striking matches upon your heart
I couldn't get no sparks

Ask me to go faster, put my foot down to the floor
Standing at the edge, I feel like I've been here before
Loved you in the darkness and I loved you in fluorescent light
If it don't feel right, babe

You can run and hide, babe
Like a bird you can take flight
If I've been holding on too tight
If I've been holding on

Mmm, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Your mother always told us we should go out to the dance
You can't get struck by lightning if your not standing in the rain
Take it as the truth or you can take it with a grain of salt
If it don't work out

You were in the shower we were talking through the glass
Packing up your suitcase, you were humming to yourself
One day you were smiling
I could tell by how you sounded on the phone
You said, ""I'm coming home, babe""

I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe

I knew you had spirit
Oh won't you let your colors run
Isn't it odd, the way we try to tell ourselves we got limits

Vance Joy,"We came out of the cinema
We were rubbing our eyes
Our mouths were dry from the sugar and the popcorn
And we felt a little guilty
About spending that whole sunny day inside
The movie we were watching
About Bonnie & Clyde
They were driving down a backroad
They thought they were home free
The police knew they were coming
They were hiding in the trees
And they shot 'em down
One hundred and thirty rounds
They shot 'em down

So we might as well say
What's on our minds
'Cause there's no waiting, no
When it's your time to go
When it's your time to go

Later we were walking on the streets of Monterey
The trees beside the water
Reminded you of childhood holidays
Hey babe, I know the way
To a little stretch of beach
Where we can lose ourselves

Don't matter where you've been
You jump into the water and you come out clean
Don't matter where you've been
You jump into this water and you come out clean

So we might as well say

Vance Joy,"You were the one to visit my darkness
You were the brightest way
You dropped the stone into the well
We'd wait for the sound it made
When it got quiet, you could hear your heart
Tell me, what did it say?
I was a bird, you opened the cage
It felt like a clean white page

You came along
You light up my days, my personal sun
Showing me all the ways I could fall
You made me feel new
I'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you
Baby, feel me crash
I'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you

Vance Joy,"I was only ten years old
Like the back of my hand, knew the roads
I swerved my bike and lost control
Over the handles in the air
A lady who came walking by found me lying there
And the nurse at the hospital said

""Little boy, don't be scared
Now your father is waiting in the next room
Little boy, don't be sad
Now your mom's on her way, you'll be out of here soon""

We drove so slowly through these streets
In the suburbs of our dreams
At night my father closed his eyes
He saw the new car in the drive
My mother standing in the doorway
Friday night, a smile on her face
And the voice I can hear in my head

""Little boy, don't be scared
Now you know we'll be sleeping in the next room
Little boy, don't be sad
Now tomorrow is as it is coming 'round soon""

We only need a little space
Just somewhere we could call our place
My mother standing in the doorway
Friday night, a smile on her face
These things always start so small
With no applause and no drum roll
And I came running up the hallway
See the car turn in the driveway

And I'll always be that little boy
And I've always been that little boy
Yeah, I'll always be that little boy
And I'll always be that little boy",Little Boy,2018

Sandy blonde hair, the way it came tumbling down
Just like a waterfall
And if you need a light
I'll be the match to your candle
My darling, I'm ready, to burst into flames for you

I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get

Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't
It feels like you do
Looking like that, you'll open some wounds
How does it start?
And when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
But is it too soon?
To know that I'm with you
There's nothing I can do

And sometime around one
We fell asleep to escape from the sun
And we woke up to the sound of a storm outside
We stood at your front door
You looked at me and said ""baby, this rain changes everything""
And my heart ran away from me

I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get

Vance Wright,"Here we go
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought ta good
There lived a lil' boy who was misled
By anotha lil' boy and this is what he said
""Me, Ya, Ty, we gonna make sum cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why did ya hit me?""
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigga""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radioes it to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked around good and from expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova (?)
Raced up the block doing 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead
He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead""
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
He dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path
Straight 'n narrow or yo' soul gets cast

Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld

This rap here... it may cause concern it's
broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
Love mean happiness... that once was strong
But due to society... even that's turned wrong
Times have changed... and it's cool to look bummy
and be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten... who put you on this Earth?
Who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid goin wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company... hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non cool... your life, don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead... and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves... hey they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hardrocks too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too
And this is a message... that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

""You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
 We like to party, like to party""

Hey young world, the world is yours
Hey young world

""Yo peep this""

Hey Mr. Bigshot... hey, don't you look fly?
But you don't have a nickle... ohhhh, my my my
You've been fightin again and, you forgot why
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.... because you make your family cry
And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
Hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some dust, and
plus, a must so... bigshot you're not
Your friends are talkin and I'm hearin that your girls are what?
You didn't know?  Go steal and rob
And while you're at it... go get a suit for a j-awhh-ob
You see you're actin like this urge is demandin
c'mon, wake up... have some understandin
Society's a weak excuse for a man
It's time for the brothers... rap is trying to take the stand
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you deep
Guides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus
past the age of... a little child, that's true
But folks your age don't act like you do, so
so be mature... and put the point to a halt
And if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult
Don't live in a world... of hate hate hate
Pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
Men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
And if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
So be more mature... and kids do your chores
Make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
You know why, cause that's a man... that's brains no spite
Stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
And a man never loses a fight... in God's sight
Cause righteous laws are overdue
And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

""You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?

Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

Well he's in indian town, and what spots his eye?
A nice looking indian, and honey looked fly
He had to talk because he just couldn't hack it
She wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket
He trotted over and invented a line
He said excuse me, um, do you happen to have the time?
All was on his mind was sex, sex, sex
So she said why do ask? you got your own timex
To poor old dave that line was cold blooded
He felt that her ego was way over flooded
She started to laugh and then she started to say
I'm sorry some times I do get carried away
I didn't mean to like ill treat you
My name is running rabbit and I'm glad to meet you
He said I'm dave, with crazy clout
Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about
Yeah, you must be, because you look like a winner
Come to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner

Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

Well, he met her father, big chief Beretti
He said what's for dinner?
Soup and spaghetti
The dinner was rotten and he swore he's gonna puke it
He never would have took it if he'd known that he had cooked it
Later on they were chilling, in the bedroom
Sitting at the window looking at the moon
Judging from the mood he swore she was hot
He said are you in the mood?
She said no I'm not
From what he believes and from what he gets
When a girl says no, he really thinks she means yes
So, he started touching her and coming out strong
Whispering sweet nothings and singing a song
He said
I'm in the mood for love,
Simply because you're near me,
Funny but when you're near me,
I'm in the mood, don't mean to be rude,
But I'm in the mood for love
She said oh dave, you've got my poor back hurting
I want you, but first close the curtain
He closed the curtain and also the doors
The next thing you knew it was off with those drawers

Take it easy Davy, you're hurting me. stop

Well, he was playing with her tits, they were soft not lumpy
And then he cracked the legs like Humpty-Dumpty
He's fucking, sucking, also finger popping
He had, no intention of stopping
Crazy fun, he did not want to leave
His head was between her tits and he could barely breathe
He had to toss, turn, turn, toss
Meanwhile he was riding her with crazy force
She was burning hot, she said stop, stop.
He said are you talking sex or what?
I guess she didn't realize what she started
Next thing you knew she was acting retarded
She said to him strangely and kind of merry
Stop now, or I'll be unable to marry
He didn't take her warning
He rode her till the morning
He rode that ass till the pussy started yawning

He said what? wait his dick went weak
It said dave, pussies ain't supposed to speak
He gathered his things he wanted to leave this place
But first he wanted to see the vagina face to face
He opened it up, with his bare two thumbs
He seen crabs with spears and indian drums!

Now who the one you're trying to be like with all your might
And anyone that attempted to remove me out the race

Shit on motherfuckers and I tell them who the fuck I am
My name is Rick, but now you know who's rulin it
Pump the world and the DJ put the fuel in it

Vance Wright,"Well I'm sittin on my lunch break, grinnin my teeth (my teeth)
It's the last day of the week, boy what a relief (relief)
My muscles kind of ache, they felt rigid and stuff
so I looked around, and I smoked this big fat spliff
Now I'm happy as can be I'm in this pothead spell
I put some Visine in my eyes so that no one can tell
It's 12:55 almost time for the bell
Put the breathmints in the mouth so that the mouth don't smell
Now back on the job, I don't bother no one
I keep strictly to myself and all my work gets done
Now the job's finally over it's time to have fun
and I'm hangin out with Trevor there's a kid named John
Got real drunker than a skunk and happy as can be
We went, to the Latin Quarters and we got in free
Scoopin all the girls like nuttin with my trunk jewelry
cause I'ma fly brown brother and you can't school me
Boogie Down was performin hey they ain't no joke
And a bunch of Brooklyn kids was lookin all down my throat
Was it my big chains with the big plates on em?
Then they rolled on me and told me to run em

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo homeboy take off your chains man
 Bout to hurt you real fuckin bad, I'm gonna fuck you up""
This was the moment I feared...
""Yo what's the matter stupid?  Take the shits off man!
 The fuck is up?""

I said, ""They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls""
Then a whole bunch of fists just, caved my world
I was in pain, so ashamed, I wish I had not came
Had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, then
I went to an open store that's where I brought/bought me a quart
Then I went to the park, and I sat and I thought
I seen Danny Boy though he's with his girl named Sarah
in one of his cars, I think this one's a Bravera
She calls out to me, but, I really couldn't hear her
So I went just a little bit closer so I'd hear a little clearer
She said, ""I need Veronica Blades that's right near Tilden""
I said, ""I know where that's at cause that's right next to my building""
I gave em the information and they went on their way
I went home, and there I slept til almost three the next day
Then someone knocked on my door, I opened up, no quit!
It was Sarah with some magazines and a bag named Kit
She tried to use me and seduce me and at first I wasn't with it
Then we did it and we did it and we did it and WE DID IT
She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it
The elevator came and Danny Boy was on it

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo what the fuck's goin on here?
 What you doin to my girl homeboy?""
This was the moment I feared...
""Oh I just KNOW y'all didn't just finish fuckin
 I just KNOW y'all ain't just finish fuckin""

Well he was huffin and puffin and he swung at me -- word
So I pulled out my jammy and I silenced the nerd
Then he was dead two in the head I took the cash and the Visa's
She said, ""Don't worry about a thing just make sure nobody sees us""
We went back to her apartment, there was blow in the freezers
She said, ""We're rich we're rich we can have whatever will please us""
Now I don't hang with no one who ain't good for my health
So I put the sugarhead out and I went for self
Now I was rich as I was rich I could have whatever would please me
Now I could wear real gold in front of folks that would tease me
Yah me, I'll be a new neighborhood dad
Cats'll roll up on me screamin, ""Yo Rick my man!!""
I guess I was too fly word up I'm sorry to say
Ya see a cop rolled up on me and told me, ""Make my day""
I said, ""Relax brother,"" but he had proof that I had done it
Yah they had false hair on underwear with my fingerprints all on it
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
And I was the main event on the TV for a while
but now I'm in jail doin life and I'm scared
Some kids snuffed me cold and greased me where no one dared

This was the moment I feared...
""Turn around nigga (HAHAHAHA)
 Spread your cheeks""
This was the moment I feared...

Vance Wright,"Ladies, and gentlemen, and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure
that we are here to present tonight,
Slick Rick, the Ruler!  And MC Ricky D!
Doing their smash hit, ""Mona Lisa,""
you know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out
to bow before his divine majesty

Oh your majesty
Hmm?
Can I kiss your hand?
Mm-hm
(kisses his hand loudly)
Enough!
Come your highness, they await you

Well, it was one of those days, not much to do
I was chillin' downtown, with my old school crew
I went into a store, to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona, what?
Mona Lisa (what?) Mona Lisa, so men made you..
You know what I'm sayin?  So I said, ""Excuse me, dear
my gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money
I'll buy that slice!""
She said, ""Thanks, I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you""
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (ping!) I almost blinded her
She said, ""Great Scott!  Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth""
Ha-ha, hah!  Had to find that funny
So I said, ""No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief?  Please!  Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet""
She almost got cut short, you know, scissors
She tried to disrespect who?!  The Grand Wizard
Me!  ""Well what's your name, son?""
""MC Ricky D,"" but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
""I'm.. sorry and I know that's low class (uh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past""
She said, ""Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin""
A virgin?!  Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin, with her yea wide gap
I said, ""It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky,
R, ravishing
I, impress
C, Courageous; so careless
K, for the Kangols which I've got
that I wear everyday and
Y, why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm
quite polite like Walter Cronkite""
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, ""Hey Rick, don't you know playin' with these snakes is a sin?!?""
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, ""I don't want to see you playin' with these lowlifes no more!
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of her friends""
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it!
And as we were leavin' and drivin' along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song

""If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry, each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide
The pain and the hurt that you gave me
When you said goodbye,
You walked on by..""",Mona Lisa,1988
Vance Wright,"Hauk, who goes yonder?
It is I, sire, Richard of Nottingham
Well, speak up man, what is it?
News from the east, sire, Rick the Ruler has returned

Gather 'round party goers as if your still livin'
And get on down to the old Slick rhythm
Now this one here is called the Ruler my dear
Its a mere party booster that will set things clear
Its a hundred percent proof from champions of truth
And if you feel you need spirit I'll bring back your youth
Relax your mind, and folks unwind
And be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find
And off we go, let the trumpets blow
Well hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Now in these times, at least to me
There's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like Ricky D
Not tryin' to cause trouble cause its really a small thing
But they're bitin what I'm writin
God it's great being the king
Some sound allright, but then they act illy
Try conquering my crown and that's really very silly
Now I'm not the type that gets upset
Try to disrespect folks just to earn respect
But learn this fact, whether white or black
I can't be conquered in my style of rap
For jealousy and envy are dumb ones tools
So Ricky says nothing, he keeps his cool
Revenge is not a mission that the Ruler's on
Just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit, hit it 
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it

Now one day when I was chillin' at this outside jam
I seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands
To beats of records that conquer the streets
Like Pee Wee Herman and Clubhouse Treats
Girls was chillin', boys rule as usual
The slacks, the golds, the rings, I hope I'm not confusin y'all
But everyone in the house looks smashin'
Fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion
And just when you thought nothing couldn't get better
A news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter
A kid ran up to the mike and said ""Alert, hear this,""
Cleared his cloudy throat and then began to persist
He said ""Hallelujah, kids hear this
The Ruler's back and he's here to assist""
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it
Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit it
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit it
Hit it
Hit it 
Hit, hit it

Vance Wright,"well I've been a public figure for quite a long time
known to the whole world for what [my style of rhyme]
but tonight let's talk about the ones who bite
although they know they won't [never get it right]
because they have no [class] and they have no [shame]
they'll bite another brother to boost their own [name]
get paid correct on a one way gimmick
I'm happy for you lowlifes but 'member there's a limit - so say

when I walk into a party cokesnorters laugh
as the girls be crazy coming for my mere autograph
and it seems that they aspiring my new style of rappin'
and brothers all around me out of vanity are snappin'
the girls say 'wow Rick you're so unique
please tell us how you organize the words you speak'
but my will says chill and I go upon my way
'cause class will be taught some other day - so say

well I remember one night when the world was dead quiet
and out of nowhere some boy starts a riot
he tore my clothes, I had to throw blows
a shotgun barrel was dead on my nose
I froze - it was Big Foot and the Toes
yup, a bunch of small timers that (be it?) on my shows
surrounded the ruler with machetes too
they said um 'if you don't teach us how to rap you're through'
I said 'okay, now let me go, please'
I seen an officer - then the officer screamed 'freeze!'
he said 'Slick Rick you okay?'
I had to play it off, some girls were looking my way
so I smacked one in the face and told him 'I won't retire'
and many years from now I'll just be getting higher
for I am the master, set and done
my name is Ricky D and I'm the only one - so say

[...Ricky D] - [...Ricky D]

now when I was a lad my style was bad
so I had to use what little bit of knowledge that I had
so I quote and I wrote 'till I was up to par
some rhymes were [boo-hoo] and some rhymes were [hahahaa!]
I educate myself so I'm able to reach ya
answering the call of teacher, teacher
tell us how you do it, it's so easy for me
the creator of the style, emcee Ricky D
now my only task is to warn all biters
slimy sluts and fake rhyme writers
don't try your luck and get the ruler annoyed
for when I'm through with you boy your whole world will be destroyed
so chill mister muscle or I'll come and hunt ya
if you are a girl I'll make no man want ya
so if you want to rule and no (?) in the way
pay attention to my syllables and come see me and say hey hey

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand the ruler will be
the creator of the style [Ricky D]
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it

Vance Wright,"(Chorus: repeat 4x)
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again

[Verse One]
Aye sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
A serious situation we all go threw
It deals wit your feelins, so here what I say
It's like a dyke, but nothing seems to go your way
Bust this, two people, they really like each other
He says their's no one else
And she claims they're is no other
The feelins are same, and you receive a notion
To reveal your inner thoughts deeply hit emotions

(Chorus:4x)

[Verse Two]
Precious times, hopin they won't end
Tell your mother bout your lover
Or so your best friend
Ya mighty proud while your holdin her hand
Boys, yo that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man
This pressure brings a sort of warmth to ya heart
And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him, and he also loves her
And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on, problems start to occur
And the bond, which combines, y'all turn into a blur
For the feelins were the same, now here's the score
You love him to much, and they don't love him anymore
Or did you have to choose a number
Or because your not bein true
Or maybe they're just plain sick of seein you
Word, now it might seem strange
You better take his quick, and make the right change

(Chorus: 4x)

[Verse Three]
See just when you swore, the boy was wrong and
Then they're gone, and part of ya heart's been stolen
Get back on your feet, wit a hop and a skip
But no, you rather go wit this dead relationship
Hangin around, and buyin him stuff
You seem him every darn day, you don't see him enough
You follow them around, and they claim ya hawkin
When conversation comes, you do all the talkin
Not to mention, attention, we all need a bit
Behind ya back they're sayin, yeah he's all on my tits
They're gettin sick of you, and quite annoyed
And if you had plans for the future, they're now destroyed
You saw what was happenin, and you still let it
And if you ever let him  make love to ya girl, you can forget it
Sweetheart, you been caught, spread around town
Passin then ya thoughts
And break up time, and your recitine the words
Yo this is fromt the heart, and I know the part hearts
Get over it, from now don't take short slick
If it's not true love, you shouldn't deal wit it
Just think of your future, and what is to come
And pay attention to the words that's in this song, they go

(Chorus: 4x)

Do you know, where ya goin to
Do like the things that life is showin you
And are you going to...",Teenage Love,1988
Vance Wright,"Here's an oldie but goodie
Hit it
Excuse me
What?
Can I have your attention?
Mn-hmm
There's just a few things that I've got to mention (Uh-huh)
There's girlies out here that seem appealing
But they all come in your life and cold hurt your feelings
I'm telling you
As Rick is my name
I wouldn't trust not girl unless she feels the same
Treat 'em like a prostitute (Do What?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my first example

Now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while
Plans for the future, she's having your child
Celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts
Telling all your friends about your family thoughts
One friend was drunk so he sstarts to act wild
He tells the truth about the kid
It's not your child
Acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk
He said, ""Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work""
And she led him on and tried to please him
She didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him

Treat 'em like a prostitue (Do What?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my second example

It's your wife
You buy the tramp jewels and clothes
You get sentimental and bring home a rose
Give her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it
All your friends tell you, ""The bith don't' deserve it""
Love is blind, so there goes your wealth
Until one day, you see things for yourself
Came home from work early, Mr. Loverman
You had a card and some candy in your right hand
There's the mailman, he was short yet stout
He went inside your house and didn't come back out
Bust it
Just a friendly stop, come on, is it?
The mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?
The thought alone makes your temperature boil
You say to yourself, she might still  be loyal
You open up your door and stand in a trance
You see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants
Came home to party
At work had a hard day
Look around your house and you say, ""Where the hell are they?""
Run upstairs up to your bedroom
You look inside your room, you see something brewin'
Cover your mouth because you almost choke
You see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat

Treat 'em like a prostitute (Mm-hmm)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my third example

Now your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot
And today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot
As you open up the door she says, ""Get on the floor""
She wants to try things she's never tried before
She takes off your drawers and works you over
She calls you Twinkles
And you call her Rover
Next thing you know, the ho starts to ill
She says, ""I love you, Harold"" and your name is Will
That's not the half 'til you start to ride her
Take off your rubber and there's one more inside her
It's not yours-who can it be?
I think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky

Treat no girlie well, until you're sure of the scoop",Treat Her Like a Prostitute,1988

You're waiting for an answer that's acceptable

And it keeps you guessing helplessly
You're praying for a savior who's exceptional
Someone who'll lift you from your knees
And salve your wounds, hand you the keys
And offer you the kingdom of your dreams

You lock your door, control your space
And curtains drawn, you think that you're impenetrable

You draw a bath and pour some wine
You drink yourself into another time

We should not be apart, just listen to your heart
Different worlds keep us apart
Then, from that day on, things were changing
I could feel love slipping through my hands
You started listening to their talking, suddenly one morning you were gone

What a pro Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking SRO
He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that 

When he smiled the girls went wild with oohs and aahs
And they slapped his face on every vase (on every vahse)

From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you what's a Grecian earn

Say amen there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome ten for ten
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie, he comes, He sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains, and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk

Who put the glad in gladiator? (Hercules)
Whose daring deeds are great theater? (Hercules)
Isn't he bold?
Nobody braver, isn't he sweet our favorite flavor
Hercules, Hercules 
Hercules, Hercules 
Hercules, Hercules 

Bless my soul Herc was on a roll
Undefeated 
Riding high and the nicest guy
Not conceited

He was a nothin' a zero, zero
Now he's a honcho He's a hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes indeed",Zero to Hero [From Disney's Hercules],2005

I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history, been there, done that

He's the earth and heaven to you
Try to keep it hidden,
Honey we can see right through you
Girl you can't conceal it
We know how you're feeling
Who you thinking of

No chance no way I won't say it, no no
(You swoon you sigh why deny it oh oh)
It's too cliche I won't say I'm in love
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming ""Get a grip girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out

Girl you can't deny it
Who you are is how you're feeling
Baby we're not buying
Hon we saw you hit the ceiling
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up that you got got got it bad

No chance no way I won't say it, no no
(Give up, give in, check the grin you're in love)
This scene won't play I won't say I'm in love
(We'll do it until you admit you're in love)
You're way off base I won't say it
Get off my case I won't say it

Por si encuentro la complicidad en tus ojos 
Por si a caso me haces algún gesto y noto 
Que de nuevo ganamos confianza

Tomo aire
Para hablarte muy bajito cuando llegues a mi hombro 
Demasiada tempestad para un viaje 
Mírame pero no digas nada

No sé en qué momento me alejé de ti 
Ni cuando nos giramos para ser
El caso es que ahora somos dos extraños 
En el bar del desengaño y nos falta hasta la sed

¿Cómo lo resolvemos? 
¿Cómo hacemos un ovillo con todo lo que sabemos? 
No me guardes en cajones lo que se merece incendios
Ni me lleves la contraria con recelos sin conciencia

¿Cómo lo rescatamos? 
Encontremos el sentido de lo que nos ha pasado
Tantas veces repetimos lo que ahora ni nombramos
Qué difícil tanta vuelta

Ya sabemos como es aquello de cambiar el rumbo 
Simulamos y ponemos mil alertas 
Cuando alguno de los dos se ronda 

No sé en qué momento se alejó de mí 
Ni cuando nos giramos para ser

¿Cómo hacemos un ovillo con todo lo que sabemos? 
No me guardes en cajones lo que se merece incendios
Ni me lleves la contraria con recelos sin conciencia

Y llegas levantando polvo
Castigándome las ganas
¿Qué ha sido de la prisa de sábanas gastadas? 
Gritamos y gritamos sin llegar a decir más nada

Noches de luna nueva, de libertades varias
De coronaciones al amanecer
De alguna vergüenza que ya superé
Y tantas versiones de un mar

Te cuento que es extraño, ¡qué difícil lo que siento!
Que aunque tu vida es otra y la mía va a destiempo
Suenan las sirenas una y otra vez
¿Cómo puedo verte dentro de otra piel?
Capricho de viento

Ay, mi amor
He dejado tantas pistas en tu puerta
¡Qué locura sentirla entreabierta!
Y que nunca me atreva a llamar

Ay, mi amor
Nos está prohibido volver a equivocarnos
Y es en este miedo donde se consumen años
Y de nuevo es abril
Y de nuevo es abril
Y de nuevo

Vanesa Martín,"Me asusta la distancia que voló la habitación
Y volverán a vernos, nadie lo sabe
Las migajas de la puerta que alguien pase y las recoja
La espuma se va a consumir

Al mismo tiempo, dos
Haciendo escala en cualquier otro corazón
Al mismo tiempo, no
Dejamos a medias nuestra conversación
Nuestra conversación

Me resta algún secreto vago, como la marea
Cuando no sé qué decir, tiro la cuerda
Si en mis luces me dormí, ven y sácanos de aquí
La gloria nos toma y nos deja

Al mismo tiempo, dos
Haciendo escala en cualquier otro corazón
Al mismo tiempo, no
Dejamos a medias, nuestra conversación

Pude aparecer con alguien que en mi vida no sumo
Perdoné sus arrebatos y acolché sus dulces garras
Como si al quitarle hierro, lo malo fuera mejor

Cuando me daba la vuelta, hizo copia de mis llaves
Me cambió el papel de sitio, supuestamente ordenó
Demasiadas conclusiones, para un no tan miserable

Y de lejos me sigue mirando
Ojala Dios medie y le vaya muy bien
De lo que pudo haber sido, ya ni hablo

Ya se fue
Y mi casa a vuelto el olor a verano
Vuelvo a no tener agenda y a beber
En fuentes ajenas, cada vez que salgo

Remolqué mis dudas llenas de deseos tan primarios
Me gustaba mi rutina, no ser fiel a su reloj
Pronuncié las aclamadas palabritas del olvido
Desde el principio lo supe, no sé bien que me freno

En ese tiempo solo andaba para mí
Salía lento de unas sábanas vencidas
De las luces y las sombras de mi vida

Billete de ida hacia un invierno consentido
Tengo grabado todo lo que sé de ti
Algunas noches me escapé a dormir contigo
Tú bien sabes lo que digo, yo también te he visto aquí

Busque mil formas diferentes
Mil formas y otras de olvidarte
Pero en ninguna me encontré, no supe desobedecerme
Busqué mil formas diferentes
En todas te puse delante
Pero en ninguna descansé, no supe desobedecerme

El equilibrio que una vez eché de menos
Me espera en un tablero de ajedrez

Disparando mis sentidos
A ratos vienes a ciegas
Cuantos no has venido

Encontramos la manera, que han pasado ya cien días
Y ahora es cuando de verdad la vida aprieta

Y te habla esta otra mitad, que se niega a razonar
Y que es también del aire, y que es también del aire

A la sombra del árbol que nace
Al cobijo de la vieja calle
Con la prisa entre los dientes
Y el sabor intermitente
De quien sabe de la gloria
Y su desastre

Te juró que esto nunca me pasó
Si quieres ponte mi chaqueta por que yo
Me muero de calor
Que no me cabe dentro el corazón
Que se me parte en dos

Que yo quiero encontrarme en tus ojos
Que me ganes y puedas perderme",Frenar enero,2014
Vanesa Martín,"Hablas como cuando se habla de lo que nunca ha pasado
Casi duele el frío que reposa en tus labios
No entiendo la inercia de tus ojos a mi boca

Cuidas que de tu lenguaje nunca nada comprometa
Y yo que me muero por soltarme la coleta
Que sea tu cuerpo el que empiece a calentarme

Desde aquí, desde esta calma te puedo decir 
Que hoy me rindo por última vez

No descarto volverte a besar 
Pero el brillo caduca a las diez
No me tomes amor, corazón
Si te abrazo, te beso y me voy

Ya este juego se ha acabado
Cada uno por su lado
Sí, ya sé que estuvo bien 
Desarmarnos por los pies
No perdamos el sentido
No podemos consetirlo
Yo no sé de sombras ni sabré

Cantas, de sobra sabes que tú eres la primera
Y yo que a Sabina le bailé más de una letra
Hoy me cuido el alma en los brazos de otro nombre

Desde aquí, desde esta calma te puedo decir

Vanesa Martín,"Hoy no, no insistas 
Que la tormenta va de recogida 
Hoy no quieras, no pretendas 
Deshacer el momento de nuestras vidas 
No, saltaron las alarmas 
Que corrieron las cortinas, ya no 

Sentí como la fuerza del agua arrancó mis verdades 
Enfrentado al olvido descalza sintiéndome nadie 
Hoy no, aléjate, no sigas 
Que me rompes cada vez que me acaricias, mi amor 

Dejemos que el silencio nos destroce poco a poco 
Que mañana al despertar ya estemos locos 
Por dios, aléjate, no insistas 
Ya tocaron las sirenas nuestra huída 

Pasó, ya no se puede matar un rosal en primavera 
Aún se siguen leyendo los ojos cuando se encuentran 
Por dios, aléjate, no sigas 
Que mi calma ya no está 
Y te pienso si te vas 
No me pidas que me quede un poco más 

Dejemos que el silencio nos destroce poco a poco 
Que mañana al despertar ya estemos locos 
Por dios, aléjate, no insistas 
Tú no ves que ya no puedo caminar 
Que sonaron las sirenas y entonaron nuestra huída

Vanesa Martín,"De cualquier manera 
Va pasando el tiempo 
La vida nos cambia 
Y apenas sabemos 

Antes era todo 
Y ahora ya no es nada 
Lo que era grande 
Se vuelve pequeño 

De alguna manera 
Hago lo que quiero 
Aprendí a dejarme llevar 
Porque siento 

El agua mojando mi cara 
El agua mojando mi cara 

Y bebí bebiendo 
De las noches locas 
Y algunos excesos 
Tiraron mi copa 

Que se derramaba 
Haciendo dibujos 
Que en el fondo eran 
Cómplices de historias 

Te haces tan bonita ante mis ojos 
Al mirarte me sonrojo 
Entre tu y yo ha pasado tanto 

Triunfo y batallas 
Que en tu nombre un día viví 
Acércate a mi de cualquier manera 

Te inventas la sensación 
Ni tu ni yo 
Supimos bien como hay que hacer 
No entiendes de nombre ni de edad 
Tu siempre vas de frente 

Te haces tan bonita ante mis ojos 
Al mirarte me sonrojo 
Entre tu y yo ha pasado tanto

Vanesa Martín,"Llenaron nuestro techo de ventanas 
Y detrás pusieron rejas imposibles de romper 
Dijeron que volar estaba a un paso 
Sin contarnos que del aire no te puedes sostener 
Amor ya sabes la que se avecina 
Somos jóvenes y viejos 
Aunque no lo quieras ver 
Me sé de ti hasta lo que no imaginas 
Tu sigues sin saber muy bien qué hacer 

Qué raro se hace el camino de vuelta 
Que injusta la batalla de decir adiós 
Dejemos las excusas en la puerta 
Por si alguien se la lleva por error 

Me olvide del azul de un ayer 
Que está dentro de mí 
Tan solo quedan abrazos 
Me olvide de nacer cada mañana por ti 
Ya te llore y me dolió 
Pero ya quiero seguir, seguir sin ti 

Cayeron como un jarro de agua fría 
Las palabras que dijimos ya no se podrán borrar 
Yo me encerré en mi mundo de mentiras 
Sin querer que amaneciera para no alargarlo mas 
No sé si detenerte de un portazo 
O hacer que el guionista marque su final 
No niego que me cueste más de un rato 
Sentir como te alejas, sentir como te vas 

Me olvide del azul 
De un ayer que está dentro de mí 
Tan solo quedan abrazos 
Me olvide de nacer cada mañana por ti 
Ya te llore y me dolió

Vanesa Martín,"Ni tu lo imaginabas ni yo 
Y alli nos vimos en medio de la fiesta 
Mucho ruido y poca decisión
En el arte de evitar soy una experta

Aquella madrugada no dejó de arder 
Y yo empecé a verle el reflejo al lobo
En un lugar prohibido el se supo ver
Y cuando abrí los ojos estábamos solos

Reconocí su maestría en el amor
Su formas me hicieron ganar la confianza 
Y le quité sin cuidado la ropa 
Advertí, voy a matar, de tanto tiempo que esperé 
Tenerte es casi abandonarme entera

Hay algo inevitable entre los dos 
Aunque ni tu ni yo tomemos conciencia
Fingimos que jugar es lo mejor
Y así la vida no nos pide cuentas

Reconocí su maestría en el amor
Su formas me hicieron ganar la confianza 
Y le quité sin cuidado la ropa 
Advertí, voy a matar, de tanto tiempo que esperé 
Tenerte es casi abandonarme entera

Tal vez un día nos vuelva a pasar 
Al encontrarnos de nuevo 
Mientras tanto viviremos cada uno lo que toca
No sé muy bien mi amor por qué
No sé muy bien por qué

Reconocí su maestría en el amor

Vanesa Martín,"Para serte sincera te he echado de menos, me atrevo a decirlo
Te confieso que ahora duele esta distancia
Y el frío

Yo seguí tus pasos por más que negara volver a sentirlos 
Y me guardé tu voz entre mis cosas

Aún conservo tu hueco entre las madrugadas 
Y dejo una luz encendida en la casa por si tu vuelves 
Buscando la historia que ayer me contabas 
Y luego yo que sé de viajes y noches calladas 
Me hago la tonta y te abrazo a mi espalda

Porque este amor es a prueba de bombas 
No se conforma ni se queda quieto
Abre los ojos y a ratos te nombra

Sale del paso buscando otras bocas 
Por no saber si ha llegado el momento
Si me equivoco y de nuevo te pierdo
Aún no, aún no me salves
No me salves

Abramos paso a un ataque frontal
Aún quedan fuerzas para no parar

Recogemos cajas como dos extraños que no quieren irse
Dime cómo repartimos los abrazos
¿qué hiciste?

Vanesa Martín,"A veces me encuentro contigo
Cuando no te espero
Tras la sorpresa me toca pensarte
Érase una vez este maldito cuento

Aún sigo creyendo en el polvo de las mariposas
No quiero unas alas que vengan ya rotas
El mar siempre supo guardarme el secreto

Él me pide su trozo de arena y después lo pervierte
Vaciando montañas para cuando llegue
Aquella que le hace bajar la marea

Te sentí tan dentro que a veces
Presiento que estás a mi lado
Me gusta contarte lo que me ha pasado
Hasta que descubro que he hablado sola

Llegó para irse como quien viaja a la cola del viento
Me hizo llorar al besarme muy lento
No habrá una ciudad donde no me emocione

No pude dejarte la puerta entreabierta esa tarde
Hacerte pasar para nunca agarrarte
Ya sabes que a ratos resulto una idiota

Yo no pude meterte en la caja de historias pendientes
Hablarte bonito mientras te me duermes
Quedarme tu tiempo a cambio de nada

Te sentí tan dentro que a veces
Presiento que estás a mi lado
Me gusta contarte lo que me ha pasado
Hasta que descubro que he hablado sola

Llegó para irse como quien viaja a la cola del viento
Me hizo llorar al besarme muy lento
No habrá una ciudad donde no me emocione

Te sentí tan dentro que a veces
Presiento que estás a mi lado
Me gusta contarte lo que me ha pasado
Hasta que descubro que he hablado sola

Vanesa Martín,"Apareces de repente en mi vida 
Desordenando sueños 
Tirando expectativas
Y no me queda más remedio que 
Rendirme poco a poco y me acomodo 
Pero haces todo fácil 
Sonríes y te queda 
Echas de un soplo todos mis fantasmas 

Pongo en calma este cuerpo impaciente 
Que te demanda ganas 
Y recurro a mis manos 
Para saciarme de esta lluvia que provocas 
Sin ti la sed me agota 

Cruzas la barrera de este inquieto corazón 
No queda nada más en esta habitación 
Que respirar de ti 
Y de lo libre que ahora soy 
Rompes el silencio con el roce de tu piel 
Si no enciendes la luz yo me cegare 

Hoy necesito encontrarme en tus esquinas 
Detenerme en ti un momento

Vanesa Martín,"Me siento torpe no se que me pasa
Hago todo al revés
Intento acercarme despacio a tu boca
Y allí provocar una encerrona loca
No, no lo hago bien
Si yo pudiera mirarte a los ojos
Y encontrarte sin mas
Dibujo naranjas en atardeceres
Y pinto tu nombre a pesar de la nieve
Ven, corre y besame

Parece que todos lo ven
Y yo sigo ahí sin saber por qué
Excusándote, excusándome
Y yo sigo ahí sin saber por qué
Sin saber por qué
Sin tener por qué

Pasó el invierno llovió demasiado
Los dos sabemos que
Mi mente y la tuya se paran y sienten
Se callan y aguantan ya saben que pueden
Ven, besame otra vez

Vanesa Martín,"Hay un paisaje que espera que alguien lo pinte 
Un señor en el metro que aguanta miradas 
Cuelga un abrigo mojado detrás de la puerta
En la mesilla costumbres y un vaso de agua 
Yo reconozco que a mí algo me pasa contigo

Todo está en tiempo de espera no sé si lo sabes 
Vuelvo a mi casa y te juro que me siento grande 
Yo a ti te dejo pasar como quien aguanta el hambre 
Como quien vive la lluvia detrás del cristal 

Bienvenidos todos al momento 
En que los sueños se visten de gala 
Nos sentimos a veces pequeños 
Así es la vida, no sé qué esperabas 
En un ratito que estaré contigo 
Sabremos como hacer canciones 
Para el alma
Tú me sabes diferente 
Revolucionas y a veces me calmas 
Entenderme no es tarea fácil 
Tú me perdonas si a veces te pierdes 
Que en un ratito ya estaré contigo 
Cantaremos hasta que 
Nos encontremos sin querer

Una mujer se maquilla en mitad de una sala 
Un niño quiere contarte y no encuentra palabras 
Todo se puede cambiar 
Que nunca te pare nadie 
Somos la fuerza de un grito que no callará

Te dijeron algo tus amigos sobre mi
He salido algunos ratos por entretenerme

Al tener la sensación, de que alguien abría la puerta

Cómo se hace una vida contigo
Cómo le hablaré al amor sin ti
Yo me despedí de un modo muy valiente

Si te acercas, mis manos lo celebrarán

Que sin querer, al descubierto
Deja sus sentimientos
Volaran los dÃ­as de pasiÃ³n robada,
los silencios nunca cuentan la verdad
Caricias que no has de perder,
Destino y piel, morir, nacer,
Distancia y abismo
CADA V EZ QUE ESTOY SIN TI,
El atardecer mÃ¡s bello duele,
Cada lÃ¡grima por ti, apaga el sol
CADA VEZ QUE ESTOY SIN TI
La razÃ³n de mi universo muere
Cada instante que te di,
Fue en mi corazÃ³n, fue mi perdiciÃ³n
Mil y una noches pasarÃ¡n, en el desvÃ¡n
Donde duermen los sueÃ±os
Que paran el tiempo
Promesas de un amor sin fin,
Grabado en mi, lluvia en mis manos,
Agridulce mis besos
VolverÃ¡n los dÃ­as de pasiÃ³n robada,
Los silencios nunca cuentan la verdad
CADA VEZ QUE ESTOY SIN TI
Esta herida me ha vestido
Desnudando mi fragilidad,
Este amor no tiene olvido,
Ni fecha de caducidad
CADA VEZ QUE ESTOY SIN",Cada vez que estoy sin tí [Directo 20 años],2018

Juro que hay algunas que yo ni conozco
Inevitablemente ya me acostumbré 
A dejarle a la izquierda lo que no controlo
Dices que hace un año que no estoy aquí
Acaba de caer un jarro de agua fría
En este túnel nadie nos podrá escuchar
No hay cobertura de tu boca a la mía

Una excusa más y te lamentas 
Mi lector de ojos no te encuentra

Es demasiado tarde para dar la vuelta 
Demasiado pronto para saber quién soy 
Mi vida se quedó rondando alguna puerta 
Alguna puerta 
Pero también saltó a pleno pulmón

Las tornas van cambiando y yo no pido cuentas 
En más de una ocasión me he jodido yo 
Vencí al delirio por la escuadra y sin grandeza 
Y nos vamos a la cama sigue siendo “nos”

Tu paso tormenta
Silencio que se rompe con sutil naturaleza

Voy encendiendo luces por la casa
La vida sucediendo y todo pasa
Como pasa un olor

Me sabe con descaro
Y se me sube a la cabeza
Me rindo entre sus manos
Mientras pienso en como besa
Intullo lo que viene y lo que queda
Trazando cordenadas imperfectas
Buscándonos

Pídeme lo que tú quieras
Sácame de esta duda
Pídeme la tentación
Cuando estemos a oscuras
Pídeme el diario de tu piel
Pídeme lo que jamás seré
Pídeme, pídeme, pídeme, pídeme

Las trampas de mi mente
Dibujándome un camino
Me siento un pasajero
Marcha atrás con su destino
Tenemos tanta paz como maneras
Son restos del deseo que no lleva
Siempre dejándonos, dejándonos

Helps to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Doing what, we used to do back then?
But the only thing, that's different now
You won't admit your love, that's if you love me again

Every time I close my eyes, the visions reappear
And when I wake up you're not near
Could you fall in love with me again?
'Cause all I see is you, every time I close my eyes

When you look at me, I wish that you were mine once again
'Cause now I love you more than I did then
And I'm hoping that we can mend it all back
'Cause when we're together, the spark is there
And the flame comes back

Every time I close my eyes, the visions reappear
And when I wake up you're not near
Could you fall in love with me again?
'Cause all I see is you, every time I close my eyes

Should I say this to you and just let it go?
Tell you what I feel and just let it show
No matter how hard that I think this through
My feelings are the same, I'm in love with you

Every time I close my eyes, the visions reappear
And when I wake up you're not near
Could you fall in love with me again?

I’m quick to hurry up
I run all day, I run through the night

She gets a little bit horny, from the vibrations off the floor

Those words jump off the letter, that I found behind our
Bed, haunting me they echo in my head
In my head...

It's too late to try and work it out
There's no way to turn this thing around
It's all there in the letter that I found
I've memorized it line for line
Too bad the letter isn't mine....

""When can I next see you? I've been counting down the days.
I promise you our secret will be safe.""

No, I just can't continue, reading through my tears,

You wanted me to find it, girl.
You never tried to hide it, girl.
The writing nevere fades, the words are here to stay.

I hope you find this letter, I'm writing you today,
These will be the last words that I say....

A guaranteed way to ease all the pain that we have
The hurt that we feel and the healing we need from the past
And I know there's no way we'll survive
If love doesn't keep us alive
You're the only way that I see out of this
And escape from this madness

I know You have the power to make me a change
Keep me from going insane
You're the only one I can put my trust
and I know it won't take much
Just one simple touch from above

So won't You please let the shower begin
Let the waters flow deeply within
When I lift my head up to the open sky
Feel the rain soothe the pain

An ounce of Your love is enough
'Cause it comes from above
So gentle and sweet, no on can compete
With Your love

So kind and full of compassion for me
Treat me so gentle and sweet
Lord, You make my life so much worth living for
'Cause right when You showed up, I was ready to leave through the door
Now my heart feels so safe in Your hands
I feel I'm wanted and needed again
And it's all because of You I'm here to stay

Hoping he would take her body to the sky

You stutter by his face

How it is crazy tough

I'm standing in the rain and I'm beaten up
Put up your blue umbrella
Have a little courage to tell him, tell her
But it is now or never
Forget about the rain and all the crazy weather

To be caught in a web of a heavy grip
Where you might want believe or try to admit
That the one that you love is a fool you don't realize
When will you finally wake up
And the love that you hold is a taste of bad luck
And all that you have is a bag full of lies
He's blinded you deep by the look in the pit of his eyes

A total catastrophe

Why we always fussing over silly little things why do we care?
Can't we see the beauty in the difference and appreciate it there?

But maybe if we took a look and listened good we'd all know what to do

Wants a little something from that special guy
It's there right in her eyes
Though she's not pretending she could tell no lies
She hiding like a spy
Hoping he would take her body to the sky
Love makes her start to fly
She feels a little sweeter like an apple pie
She's got that crazy side
Wants to open up so he can realise
That she is paralysed
By the divas hangin' over compromise

Cuz you know that it would get you down someday
Those secretes in your life
Fallin for your love will never be the same
Can't speak or play the game
You were so distracted you forgot your name
You stutter by his face
Or maybe her reflection on the windowframe
What's this you want to say?
How you wish that you could tell them either way
But then you start to flower
Open up and tell them it's the final hour

Fell a little harder than you thought you would
How deep is bitter love
Gotta let it out because you've had enough
How it is crazy tough
Heart beats a little faster when you're feeling touched
This situation's rough
I'm standing in the rain and I'm beaten up
Put up your blue umbrella
Have a little courage to tell him, tell her
But it is now or never
Forget about the rain and all the crazy weather

How does it feel like this
To be caught in a web of a heavy grip
Where you might want believe or try to admit
That the one that you love is a fool you don't realize
When will you finally wake up
And the love that you hold is a taste of bad luck
And all that you have is a bag full of lies
He's blinded you deep by the look in the pit of his eyes

And If I knew that this could be
A total catastrophe
I probably would have told you a little sooner so you wouldn't get hurt
If I could change this possibly
It would be how you want this to be

It is hard to see past all the dirt and the mud
You tell everyone that it's great and okay
When you know in your heart
That it hurts and it won't go away
Afraid to let go of the hand
That you held so tight when he said I'm your man
But his eyes seem to sway at the flick of a switch
And you are alone in the dark with a bruised broken heart

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and it's heading into black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts

Funny when the bottom drops
How she forgets to fight, to fight

And it's one more day in paradise
One more day in paradise

As darkness quickly steals the light
That shined within her eyes
She slowly swallows all her fear
And soothes her mind with lies
Well all she wants and all she needs
Are reasons to survive
A day in which the sun will take
Her artificial light, her light

And it's one more day in paradise
One more day in paradise

Just tryin' to get by
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy
But he was looking to the sky

And as he asked if I would come along
I started to realize
That every day he finds just what he's looking for
Like a shooting star he shines

And he said, ""Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right
In the palm of your hand?""

And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Although they did not feel, no
For I felt what I had not felt before
And you'd swear those words couldn't heal that

And as I looked up into those eyes
His vision borrows mine
And I know he's no stranger
For I feel I've held him for all of time

And he said, ""Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams right
In the palm of your hand""
In the palm of your hand

Please come with me
See what I see
Touch the stars for time will not flee
Time will not flee, can't you see?

Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
As I wake in bed
And the boy, that ordinary boy
Or was it all in my head?

Didn't he ask if I would come along?
It all seemed so real
But as I looked to the door
I saw that boy standing there with a deal

And he said, ""Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right
In the palm of your hand""
In the palm of your hand, in the palm of your hand

Deep within the blue
A day out from the county I see you

There's nothing you can do
Someone gently says to you
The doctors says that now it won't be long

Try and live up to the moment
And I hope that I don't blow it
What is it in me that she hears
It's just a song she likes
Her little arms around my neck
And the dying girl whispers in my ear

Tell me now can you feel it
I've been keeping company with a ghost
She comes to me like a piece of summer
She comes to me on the days when I need it most
Summer dies and nothing lasts forever
You were so fine
The way you stand up to your fears
Summer dies and it's just moments we have together
I give my bones
For you to get a few more years
For you and me

More in life than trying to survive
Oh Annie

My boyfriend took pictures of me as I held you
I travel alone
And the loneliness brings me to tears
The summer dies
And there's just moments we have together
I give my bones for you to get a few more years
For you and me

More in life than trying to survive
Oh Annie

Stronger than the hands that hold you
Sing along to the song on the radio
If I drank too much, then I'll admit there's just
This once I to forget hold on and days gone by

Tell me now, can you feel it?
I can't keep this all to myself

And she needs me

Heroes and Thieves at my door
I can't seem to tell them apart anymore
Just when I've figured it out
Well darlin' it's you I'm without

Well I'm stubborn and wrong
But at least I know it
Keep moving along until I can get through this
But maybe this song is the best I can do it
So I'm patiently waiting on these

Heroes and Thieves at my door
I can't seem to tell them apart anymore
Just when I've figured it out
Well darlin' it's you
Darlin' it's you oh
Darlin' it's you I'm

Without your comforting logic
Like these days are the ones I'll miss
And I see a solitude that I can't find without you
Ah ah, ah
La da da

Well, it seems like I'm getting closer somehow
A flicker of peace that I've finally found
Thank you for believing in me now
'Cause I do need it

Well, give me a year or two
And I'll mend my ways and see these mistakes and
When I see the truth
Well, darlin' trust me
When I can't see
I'll be coming back, I'll be coming back to you

These heroes and thieves at my door
I can't seem to tell them apart anymore
Just when I've figured it out
Well, darlin' it's you

Vanessa Carlton,"Some people live in a house on a hill
And they wish they were someplace else
There's nobody there when the evening is still
Secrets with no one to tell

And some I have known
Have a ship where they sleep
With sounds of rocks on the coast
They sail over oceans five fathoms deep
They can't find what they want the most

And even now
When I'm alone
I've always known
With you
I am home

And some live in towns
Cardboard shack on concrete
All blustered, and bustling life
They search for the color
You can never quite see
Â??Cause it's all white on white

And even now
When I'm alone
I've always known
With you
I am home

And even now
When I'm alone
I've always known
With you
I am home

For me it's a glimpse
And a smile on your face
A touch of your hands
An honest embrace

For where I lay, it's you I keep
This changing world
And fall asleep
With you all I know is
I'm coming home

Hold fire bright
As crickets call out
To the moonlight
And as you lean in
To steal a kiss
I'll never need more than this

We all share the pain
Of our histories
But the ache goes away
If you could see
This night under stars
Well I call it peace
If you say ill never need more than this

And the trees grow so thick
You can barely see through
And the forest bestows
All the simplest of truths
And you think you'll be happy
If granted one more wish
But the truth is
You'll never need more
You'll never need more
You'll never need more than this.

Want so much in this life
There's so much to be
We sail through our youth
So impatiently
Until we see
That the years move along
And soldiers and heroes come home
And they carry a song don't

Live in forgotten times
May this always remind
You of the sea under the skies
You looking glass ?
Lets make this our story
Lets live in the glory
Time it fades away precious as a song
'cause someday we'll be gone

Hold fire bright.
As we watch the glow
Of the morning light
Someday our bones here they will lie
And so we sing

We sow our truth, wait patiently

We ebb and we flow so
Got my toes on my pup at the foot of my bed
My heart always seems to know
Now take the glitz back, I want the soul instead
'Cause I found some kind of fairytale

I used to
Hover outside my truth
Always worry of what I'd lose
Take away my record deal
Go on, I don't need it
Spent the last 2 years getting to what's real
And now I can see so clear
I hope you feel just like I feel
I found some kind of fairytale

Want a garden by the ocean tide
Because I lose my way searching for stage lights
Well, Stevie knows and I thank her so

And I come home
I hope to see this boy I know
I cant wait for us to be alone

Flipping through the radio
We sing along to the indie show
The songs they plague me more than I can say

In the tape I made you
Hope you think of me when it plays through
Feel kind of sad now that its done

And you think my times were free
All the ways you say to me
Sweet versions of lets wait and see

But you're always a golden boy
And I'm the girl that you enjoy
My parents say Is'nt he a gifted son
Time is always passing by
And still I have to wonder why
You cant come to tell me I'm the one

Summer goes and we have grown
We have our friends live on our own
Still I'm not the girl you want me to be

Say gravity can bend the time
Funny I always liked your mind
But this whole thing is crushing me

But you're always a golden boy
In this girls heart that you destroyed
You smile at me then have your fun
Time is always passing by
Still I give you another try
And hope that you will see that I'm the one

Say your scared
Get too close
Come lets see how it goes
See you now at the show
7th in the 7th row
Now when you look at me
You see what I've known for so long
Sad that you can be so lovely and so wrong

Came to say that I've moved
I see your face
You don't approve
I guess you could say that I'm already gone

But your always be my golden boy
I'm the summer girl
That you enjoyed
Some melodies are best left undone
I feel the time pass away
But in my songs you'll always stay

With a suitcase in my hand
And filled with love and life and grand delusions

Waiting for the thoughts to fade

The day  missing

Do I push too hard
I fall too fast

I cry

And weigh so heavy on my chest
And I'm crushed by your expectation
I only want to do some good
To dumb to know if I could
And I just wanna feel the days I'm in

And do I go too far
Not far enough
Why cant I keep my big mouth shut and do
And lead the life that we should

Am I getting through?

Fique em casa, não tome vento
Mas é duro ficar na tua
Quando à luz da lua
Tantos gatos pela rua
Toda a noite vão cantando assim

Nós, gatos, já nascemos pobres
Porém, já nascemos livres
Senhor, senhora, senhorio
Felino, não reconhecerás

De manhã eu voltei pra casa
Fui barrada na portaria
Sem filé e sem almofada
Por causa da cantoria
Mas agora o meu dia-a-dia
É no meio da gataria
Pela rua virando lata
Eu sou mais eu, mais gata
Numa louca serenata
Que de noite sai cantando assim

Nós, gatos, já nascemos pobres
Porém, já nascemos livres
Senhor, senhora, senhorio
Felino, não reconhecerás

Nós, gatos, já nascemos pobres
Porém, já nascemos livres
Senhor, senhora, senhorio
Felino, não reconhecerás

O meu mundo era o apartamento
Detefon, almofada e trato
Todo dia filé-mignon
Ou mesmo um bom filé de gato
Me diziam todo momento
Fique em casa, não tome vento
Mas é duro ficar na tua
Quando à luz da lua
Tantos gatos pela rua
Toda a noite vão cantando assim

Nós, gatos, já nascemos pobres
Porém, já nascemos livres
Senhor, senhora, senhorio
Felino, não reconhecerás

Se você quiser eu vou te dar um amor
Desses de cinema
Não vai te faltar carinho
Plano ou assunto ao longo do dia
Se você quiser eu largo tudo, vou pro mundo
Com você meu bem
Nessa nossa estrada só terá belas praias e cachoeiras

Aonde o vento é brisa, onde não haja quem possa
Com a nossa felicidade 
Vamos brindar a vida, meu bem
Aonde o vento é brisa e o céu claro de estrelas

Gastar das horas pra te ver dormir
Enquanto o mundo roda em vão

Eu tomo o tempo, o velho gasta solidão
Em meio aos pombos na Praça da Sé
O pôr do Sol invade o chão do apartamento

Vermelhos são seus beijos
Que meigos são seus olhos
Ver que tudo pode retroceder

Que aquele velho pode ser eu
No fundo da alma há solidão
E um frio que suplica um aconchego

Vermelhos são seus beijos
Quase que me queimam
Que meigo são seus olhos
Lânguida face

Seus beijos são vermelhos
Quase que me queimam
Que meigos são seus olhos
Lânguida face

Ver que tudo pode retroceder
Que aquele velho pode ser eu
No fundo da alma há solidão
E um frio que suplica um aconchego

Vermelhos são seus beijos
Quase que me queimam
Que meigos são seus olhos
Lânguida face

Seus beijos são vermelhos
Quase que me queimam
Que meigos são seus olhos
Lânguida face

E esse tal alguém não ser seu
Fico desejando nós gastando o mar
Pôr do sol, postal, mais ninguém
Peço tanto a Deus para esquecer

Mas só de pedir me lembro
Minha linda flor, meu jasmim será
Meus melhores beijos serão seus
Sinto que você é ligado a mim
Sempre que estou indo, volto atrás
Estou entregue a ponto de estar sempre só
Esperando um sim ou nunca mais
É tanta graça lá fora passa
O tempo sem você
Mas pode sim
Ser sim amado e tudo acontecer

Sinto absoluto o dom de existir, não há solidão, nem pena
Nessa doação, milagres do amor
Sinto uma extensão divina
É tanta graça lá fora passa
O tempo sem você
Mas pode sim
Ser sim amado e tudo acontecer
