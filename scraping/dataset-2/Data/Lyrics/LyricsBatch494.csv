Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me",Don't Worry 'Bout Me,1999
Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell
Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell

Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

You said that Edison would never make that light
You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite
The point of the song is I'm always wrong
But with you baby I'm oh so right.",I May Be Wrong,1999
Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1999
Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"Why do you go on pretending
You know you want to be free
Darling, you know I'll let you go
You'd do the same for me
 
I understand
And darling, you are not to blame
If when we kiss it's not the same
I understand
It's not your fault because your heart has changed it's mind
You didn't mean to be unkind
I understand
Forgetting you will be far from easy
I've grown so used to your charms
I'll miss that old thrill and no one can fill
The place here in my arms
But if you find our love was really meant to be
Then darling, hurry back to me
And I'll understand

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"I'm thru with love,
I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.
Emotion.

Did you good by the spring 
And all it meant to me
a good neighbor 
The things that used to be.
For I must have you or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.
That's why I'm thru with love.",I'm Thru with Love,1999
Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"Happiness comes with success 
And that I guess is true 
But success is more or less 
A point of view 

I'm no millionaire 
But I'm not the type to care 
'Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams 
It's my universe 
Even with an empty purse 
'Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams 

I wouldn't take the wealth of Wall Street 
For a road where nature trods 
And I calculate that I'm worth my weight 
In goldenrod's 

Lucky, lucky me 
I can live in luxury 
'Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams",I've Got a Pocketful of Dreams,1999
Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town 
 
Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town 
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"The moon was all aglow
But heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

The stars all seemed to know
You didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evenin' appears
I sigh but there's no regretting
In spite of my tears

Who wouldn't believe those lips
Who wouldn't believe those eyes

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
Can't you see? Oh, you have captured me!
Being so glamorous, now can't you be amorous just with me,
Make it soon, Cop a look at that moon.

Love is just around the corner,
Any cozy little corner,
Love is just around the corner,
When I'm around you.

I'm a sentimental mourner,
And I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me on that corner,
Just waiting for you.

Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us,
You are cuter than Venus,
And what's more you've got arms!

And I'm around you.

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely

I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1999
Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1999
Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"You say you're falling in love with me
That's why I sit here and cry
For that is something that never can be
And here's the reason why
 
For you're not the kind of a boy (girl) for a girl (boy) like me
'Cause I'm just a song and a dance, you're a symphony
You say that you never would doubt me

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink

Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again
Beguiled again
A simpering whimpering child again
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I mean a lot
But now I'm like sweet seventeen a lot

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love",Dancing on the Ceiling,2000
Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair.
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air.
The walls of my room fade away in the blue,
And I'm deep in a dream of you.

The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing,
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.
My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start;
My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart.
Awake or asleep, ev'ry mem'ry I'll keep
Deep in a dream of you.",Deep in a Dream,2000

And when you smiled at me,

Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"Once I was young, yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps
Once I was young, but never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was
Then you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Once I was old, twenty years or so
Rather well preserved, the wrinkles didn't show
Once I was old, but not too old for fun
I used to hunt for little girls up my imaginary gun

I stood with you and listened to a wedding tune, 
And didn't I go with you on your honeymoon?

And if I'm not mistaken, dear, I pay them still

Though spring is here, to me it's still September

Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2000
Johnny Guarnieri Quintet,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,2000

To sing your praises
But there aren't any magic adjectives
To tell you all you are!

Too marvelous for words

And that old standby, amorous

It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean, they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much

We'll be together again 
Your kiss, your smile 
Are memories I'll treasure forever 
So try thinking with your heart 
We'll be together again

Times when I know you'll be sad

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise

What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone,2000

It keeps repeating for you constantly.
You're all I'm needing

Et l'on oublie
Dans les nuages
Tous les soucis du monde

Le ciel nous fait rêver
Mais sur la terre
On a trouvé
Une amitié profonde

Les copains
Une fois sur deux
Pour une fille
Se bagarrent entre eux

Mais très vite
Ils n'y pensent plus
Et jour et nuit
Chacun poursuit sa ronde

La, la, la, la, la

Nous aurions vaincu des sommets 
Rempli de cristal de lumière

Il en est même qui m'envient
Mais ils ne savent pas dans la vie
Que parfois je m'ennuie
Je cherche celle qui serait mienne
Mais comment faire pour la trouver?
Le temps s'en va, le temps m'entraîne
Je ne fais que passer

Et dans la nuit je file 
Tout seul de ville en ville
Je ne suis qu'une pierre qui roule toujours
J'ai bien la fortune et plus
Et mon nom partout dans la rue
Pourtant je cherche tout simplement l'amour

Plus d'une fille souvent me guettent
Quand s'éteignent les projecteurs
Soudain sur moi elles se jettent
Mais pas une dans mon cœur

Dans la nuit je file
Tout seul de ville en ville
Je ne suis qu'une pierre qui roule toujours
Il me faut rire et danser
Puis le spectacle terminé
S'en aller ailleurs au lever du jour

Johnny Hallyday,"Ce soir-là nous avions bu champagne et whisky
Et je me souviens que nous étions un p'tit peu gris
Mais si nos cœurs se sont enflammés
D'un amour brûlant et spontané
C'est la faute, c'est la faute au twist

Et tu n'as rien dit lorsque je t'ai tutoyée
Sur un ton que j'ai parfois un peu familier
Si tu n'as pas rougi ce soir-là
Parce que ma main glissa sur ton bras
C'est la faute, c'est la faute au twist

Du rythme excitant
Ainsi va l'amour
Et on a tout fait
Pour plaire à l'amour

Ainsi bien qu'on dansait et riait sans raison
Et puis j'ai pu profiter de cette occasion
Pour te serrer, serrer bien plus fort
Bien plus fort contre mon corps
Ca va de soi
C'est la faute, c'est la faute au twist

Et c'est ainsi que nous nous sommes aimés
Si nous avons commis quelques petits péchés
Si tu m'as cédé sans façon
Souvent je me pose la question

Est-ce bien, bien la faute au twist?
N'est-ce pas la faute à l'amour?
N'est-ce pas la faute à tes yeux?
N'est-ce pas la faute ton corps?

À partir de maintenant

Rien ne sera plus comme avant pour moi
À partir de maintenant

",A Partir de Maintenant,1980
Johnny Hallyday,"J'ai compris quand j'ai eu ma première vrai guitare
Que commençait la ma vie et mon histoire
J'ai chanté sur trois accords que je connaissais
Ma première musique déjà 1ui ressemblait

Le blues de ma vie
Blues dans mon c?ur
De brouillards de pluie
Quand j'avais le splin sans amour sans amis

Après il y a eu pour moi la première vraie chanson
En lettre de feu j'ai vu briller mon nom
Au fond de moi un démon me poussait
Et sans le savoir malgré moi je chantais

Le blues de ma vie
Le rock 'n roll
le blues de mes nuits
Rendait la musique et les filles folles folles folles

La moitié de ma vie je la passe sur la scène
A chanter l'amour la violence la peine et la haine
Si je ne sais plus ce que j'ai fait de première guitare
Je n'ai pas oublié ce blues qui chante dans ma mémoire

Et c'est toujours le blues de ma vie
Le rock 'n roll
Tout devient folie
La musique et les filles sont folles folles folles

Je suis bien tellement bien, je suis loin
Derrière moi l'orchestre tourne tourne bien
J'oublie tout, je suis fou, loin de tout
Quand les guitares crient et qu'un saxo pleure dans la nuit
Blues de ma vie

Et puis l'amour est venu briller dans mon ciel
Elle avait des yeux d'or et des cheveux couleur de miel
J'ai eu si mal que j'ai fini par croire que j'étais mort
Et c'est un peu pour elle que chaque soir je chante encore

Le blues de ma vie
Le rock 'n roll
Le blues de l'oubli
Qu'elle m'a laissé au c?ur avant qu'elle ne s'envole

J'ai compris ce jour d'été où elle est partie
Que je n'aimerai plus jamais de ma vie
Et dans mon c?ur il ne peut plus vraiment faire très froid
On reste tout seul
Le blues ma guitare et moi

Et je chante le blues de ma vie
Et je chante le blues de l'oubli
Et je chante le blues dans la nuit
Et je chante le blues de ma vie...","Le Blues, Ma Guitare et Moi",1981
Johnny Hallyday,"Tout l'argent du monde, gardez-le pour vous
Et vous pourrez dire aux plus belles blondes
Qu'elles ne se pendront plus à mon cou

Moi je ne veux qu'elle encore et toujours

Non, rien d'autre que son amour

Ouais, toutes ces princesses qui règnent la nuit
Peuvent garder leur corps et leurs richesses
Elles ne font plus partie de ma vie

Moi, je ne veux qu'elle encore et toujours
Je n'ai besoin de rien
Non, rien d'autre que son amour

Plus jamais dans leurs rêves de gloire

J'ai la paix sur les lèvres et les doigt sur un colt
Je joue avec les femmes à poker interdit
Mais je perdrais mon âme à gagner un ami

Je joue avec les femmes à poker interdit
Mais je perdrais mon âme à gagner un ami

Mon corps se bat et mon cœur danse
Je suis patience et passion
Entre violon et violence
Entre violence et violon

Je viens de rues bizarres où les guitares électriques
Coloraient ma mémoire de rêves d'Amérique
Je flottais sur l'Atlantique, de Fender en Gibson
Je roulais des mécaniques sans Harley Davidson

Et j'allais au ""Las Vegas"", le diable avait seize ans
Mais pour l'école d'en face, l'enfant est un enfant
J'allais au bout de ma rue comme au bout de la vie
Et j'avais tout connu sans avoir rien appris

J'allais au bout de ma rue comme au bout de la vie
Et j'avais tout connu sans avoir rien appris

Mon corps se bat et mon cœur danse
Je suis patience et passion
Entre violon et violence
Oui, entre violence et violon

Il y a deux hommes en moi, l'un prend et l'autre donne
L'un condamne celui à qui l'autre pardonne
Je suis entré en vie, côté cour, un matin
Et j'espère en sortir, en vie, côté jardin

Je suis entré en vie, côté cour, un matin

Back Street

Le Calypso du Square de la Trinité
En a vu passer, oui, des stars de quartier
Mais ils ont tellement rêvé tout éveillé
Le hasard la magie les a réalisé

Jacques Dutronc ne pensait pas encore à Hardy
Long Christon fondait diligences et taxis
Claude Moine dit Schmoll ignorait tout de Eddy
Un certain Jean-Philippe attendait son Johnny

Mes seize ans brûlent encore dans mes souvenirs
Des clichés qui n'arrivent pas à mourir

Bill Haley n'était déjà plus jeune premier
L'arrivée d'un Presley l'avait détrôné
Gene Vincent pleurait en chantant Baby blues
Moi j'aimais tout ça et passait pour un fou

Out on the edge

Out on the edge

If ther’s time, before I’m gone
I’m gonna find out why

I know there is a price to pay
I know that it’s the risk I take
At least I know that I’m alive
When I’m fighting to survive

Don’t tell me I don’t understand
It’s never black and white
You tell me I should have a plan
When I only have tonight

It’s midnight

And I know ev’ry night you won’t be alone

Here come a taxi
Round the corner
He’ll pay the gare
And you’ll open the door
The staircase tryin’ to find your keys
My poor heart can’t take no more
And I keep thinkin’ ‘bout the way it used to be
When the one that held you so tight used to be me

Choir : 
And when you turn out the lights
I can see it once again
I can fell the moment when
You gave your love to me
And when you turn out the lights
A remember all the years
And the rain that keeps on fallin
Cannot wash away my teras

Was I sleepin’
Was I dreamin’
And another night has gone
And I wonder, yes I wonder
How long can I go on
And I tell myself I won’t go back no more
But deep down I know I’ll be waitin’
Like all of those nights before

Ouais, ça y est
J'ai presque oublié

Les nuits à faire l'amour
Pour ne penser qu'à elle
La vouloir contre moi
Et la sentir ailleurs

Attendre d'elle un geste
Un regard, un appel
Et rester seul toujours
Au pire comme au meilleur

Oublier
Oui, jamais
J' pourrai oublier

Oublier
Non, jamais
Non, j' pourrai oublier

J'suis payé pour en parler
Ah jamais, jamais, jamais
Non, j'pourrai l'oublier

J'suis payé pour en parler
Jamais, jamais, jamais
Non, j'pourrai l'oublier

Jamais, jamais, jamais
Non, j'pourrai l'oublier

",Oublier,1988
Johnny Hallyday,"A ma naissance, cinquante centimètres
Trois kilos deux et les yeux bleu pâle
Une espèce de duvet sur la tête
A part ça, tout est normal

Fils unique plein d'affection
Et, c'est bien logique
Sans profession

Quinze ans après, j'ai pris la route
Je devais partir pour assumer
Mais au fond du cœur, j'avais des doutes
J'aimais trop la liberté

Bon physique sans prétention
Caractéristique, sans profession

Sans profession

Vingt bougies sur mon dernier gâteau
Que j'ai soufflées entre deux cuisses
Avant d'arriver sous les drapeaux
Amené par la police

Erotique, plein de passion
Oui, mais pour les flics
Sans profession

Sans profession

Dix ans plus tard, beaucoup de souvenirs
Peu de bons par rapport aux pourris
Ceux que l'on cherche à détruire
Et qui reviennent chaque nuit

Romantique, plein d'émotion
Tendre et sympathique
Sans profession

Sans profession

Et cent quatre-vingt-cinq centimètres
Mais dans mon linceul, un corps parfait
Pas de lichen collé à mon être

Mais sur l'acte de décès
Fils unique, plein d'ambition
Mort pour la musique
Sans profession

Sans profession

Johnny Hallyday,"Toute ma vie, j'ai roulé sur des routes incertaines, inhumaines
Pas de valises, pas d'enfants, pas de femmes
Il ne me reste plus aucune chaîne
Dans cette voiture pourrie

Y a des souvenirs d'amours qui sont morts en une nuit
On s'aimait au Texas
On s'aime plus en Californie
Le temps que la route défile

De ville en ville
Je ne sais plus bien ce que j'allais chercher
Et dans la lumière de mes phares, aveuglé
J'ai cru voir, tout mon passé
Qui défilait, halluciné

Je suis rien qu'un fantôme, qui roule le long des routes
Je ressemble à tous ceux que j'ai connus sans doute
Je suis toutes ces filles, ces hommes, ces pauvres mômes
J'suis rien qu'un fantôme

Je suis un menteur, je suis un amant, un loser, un enfant
Un cow-boy, un marin, un bagnard, un gitan
Un cinglé, un poète, une putain, une maman
Je suis rien qu'un fantôme

Dans ma vieille caisse usée, ont brûlé des milliers de cigarettes
Tous les rêves, tous les rires, les amis
Aujourd'hui, qu'est-ce qu'il reste
Ma vie comme un nuage
J'aurai voulu au moins conserver ton image

Je t'ai connue à Phoenix
Je t'ai perdue à Vegas
Le temps que la route se passe

De ville en ville
De ville en ville

Dans mes phares
J'en ai tant vu filer
J'en ai tant connu que je mélange, filles d'hôtels
Types étranges
Tous les démons
Et tous les anges
Et toutes mes fautes

Je suis rien qu'un fantôme, qui roule le long des routes
Je ressemble à tous ceux que j'ai connus sans doute
Je suis toutes ces filles, ces hommes, ces pauvres mômes
Rien qu'un fantôme

Je suis un menteur, je suis un amant, un loser, un enfant
Un cow-boy, un marin, un bagnard, un gitan
Un cinglé, un poète, une putain, une maman
Je suis rien qu'un fantôme

Rien qu'un fantôme
Je suis rien qu'un fantôme
Je suis toutes ces filles, ces hommes, ces pauvres mômes
Rien qu'un fantôme

Toute la nuit j'ai compté les chemins parcourus, le temps perdu
Je savais plus qui j'étais
Où j'étais, quand le matin est venu

Et le moteur s'est tu
Et je suis sorti pour voir ma Cadillac foutue
Et ça m'a fait marrer, cette pauvre chose, délabrée
Qui ressemblait à mon passé

Je suis rien qu'un fantôme, qui roule le long des routes
Je ressemble à tous ceux que j'ai connus sans doute
Je suis toutes ces filles, ces hommes, ces pauvres mômes
Rien qu'un fantôme

Je suis un menteur, je suis un amant, un loser, un enfant
Un cow-boy, un marin, un bagnard, un gitan
Un cinglé, un poète, une putain, une maman
Rien qu'un fantôme

Johnny Hallyday,"Toute la nuit, il a joué sur sa guitare
Au fond d’un vieux café
Un peu de soleil, sur le goudron mouillé
Les gens s’en vont, le jour va se lever

C’est la dernière chanson d’un amour blessé
Y a la guerre quelque part, loin du café
Comme un amour bizarre qui veut jamais rentrer
Tout ça est normal et la guitare fait…mal

La femme qui vient le soir, s’habille en noir
Elle sourit quand il joue le blues
Elle demande chaque soir la même chanson
La même chanson qui est toute son histoire

Et c’est son parfum qui traîne dans le matin
On empile les chaises, pour balayer
C’est toute une histoire qu’il faudrait oublier
Tout ça est normal et la guitare fait…mal

Il y a pas si longtemps, pas très longtemps
Il jouait pour pouvoir l’aimer
Malgré les journées où il perdait sa vie
Pour la voir arriver quand venait la nuit

Il attend la nuit et cette femme aussi
Comme on attend son dernier train
Qui va l’emporter vers son vrai destin
Tout ça est normal et la guitare fait…mal

la guitare fait…mal",La Guitare Fait Mal,1991
Johnny Hallyday,"Love the way you wear you hair down long
Like the way your voice sounds on the telephone
You know you're looking sexy in tight blue jeans
But there's one thing I got to ask you please

Do you have a garter belt
Would you wear stockings
Do you have a garter belt
Would you wear stockings

I don't mean to put no heat on you
But I wonder if you feel the way I do 
You don't have to worry ?cause it's alright
I ain't kinky baby, I know what I like

Would you wear stockings
If I call out for help

Johnny Hallyday,"Au grand cirque de pierres, sous le soleil de juin
Des hommes, assis par terre, ont bravé le destin
C'était pourtant hier et c'est déjà si loin

Je m'en souviens
Un printemps comme les autres que celui de Pékin
A qui est-ce la faute si on n'en dit plus rien?
C'était pourtant hier, qu'en ferons-nous demain?
Qu'en ferons-nous demain?

A force de subir les coups
Y a des cris que l'on n'entend plus
Des voix qui n'ont plus d'autres issues
Que de maudire sans mot dire

A force de haïr les fous
Y a des hommes qui lèvent leurs chaînes
Mourir peut-être, mais debout
A tien an men

Une génération muselée, mutilée
De sa révolution qu'on n'a pas écoutée
C'était pourtant hier, c'est déjà oublié
Mais ce n'est rien

Si le corps est vaincu, brûle toujours la flamme
Que rien n'éteindra plus à l'écueil de son âme
C'est encore aujourd'hui et ce sera demain
Et ce sera demain

A force de subir les coups
Y a des hommes qui brisent leurs chaînes
Mourir peut-être, mais debout

Cette illusion de toi

Ton parfum est si fort
Que tu es là ma tête tourne
Et je te vois c'est bien toi, oh non

Dans cette fumée tu es l'arc-en-ciel
Dans un ciel gris

Et mon esprit détruit

Tu réclames ta liberté
A ton père qui ne peut pas
Et ne veut pas comprendre

Il voudrait te voir derrière son établi
Un marteau en main toute ta vie
Samedi soir la sortie est obligatoire
Et s'arrête au cinéma

Et dans les froids moments de l'incertitude
Il y a au plus profond de ta solitude
Derrière les murs de l'incompréhension

Un espoir rempli de passion
Tu prendras l'avenir comme il te viendra
Si tu veux il sera pour toi

Et dans les rues mouillées aux couleurs de l'ennui
Et ce chien qui hurle au silence de la nuit
Ton cœur trop serré a envie d'exploser

A la face d'un monde résigné
Tes yeux aveuglés par l'enfance trompée
S'ouvriront sur la vérité

Ta génération en veut à la terre entière
Le long des routes il ne trouve que la misère
Mais tes doigts sont en or et sur ta guitare

Tu joueras pour sortir du noir
Devant les lumières de la célébrité
Tu pourras faire briller le nom

Que ton père t'a donné
Ouais, que ton père t'a donné

Oh oui, je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue, dans la rue

Je suis né dans la ville où les murs sont toujours gris
Derrière un terrain vague où se trouvent les taudis
Dans un berceau de fer je devais grandir
Ne vous étonnez pas si je ne sais pas sourire

Parce que je suis né dans la rue

J'ai du me battre encore plus fort pour la garder

De la souffrance elle a la palme

Johnny Hallyday,"Je veux t'emmener à Nashville
Là où je ne suis pas né
Te montrer les rues de la ville
Là où je n'ai jamais joué

Les copains d'enfance
La graine de violence
Mon rêve tout bleu
Comme un blues

Je veux t'emmener à Nashville
Là où je ne suis pas né
Rechercher la première fille
Qui ne m'a jamais aimé

La première voiture
Les jeans p'tits durs
Mon rêve tout bleu
Comme un blues

Je veux t'emmener à Nashville
Là où je ne suis pas né
Te montrer la bague qui brille
Du collège d'où j' n'ai pas été viré

La première guitare
L'audition d'un soir
Mon rêve tout bleu
Comme un blues

Johnny Hallyday,"Ne me quitte pas
Il faut oublier
Tout peut s'oublier
Qui s'enfuit déjà

Oublier le temps
Des malentendus
Et le temps perdu
À savoir comment

Oublier ces heures
Qui tuaient parfois
À coups de pourquoi
Le cœur du bonheur

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Non, ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Moi je t'offrirai
Des perles de pluie
Venues d'un pays
Où il ne pleut pas

Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'après ma mort
Pour couvrir ton corps d'or et de lumière

Je ferai un domaine
Où l'amour sera roi
Où l'amour sera loi, où tu seras reine

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensés
Que tu comprendras

Je te parlerai
De ces amants-là
Qui ont vu deux fois leurs cœurs s'embraser

Je te raconterai
L'histoire de ce roi
Mort de n'avoir pas pu
Pas pu te rencontrer

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Non, ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
D'un ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux

Il est paraît-il
Des terres brûlées
Donnant plus de blé qu'un meilleur avril

Et quand vient le soir
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie, le rouge et le noir
Ne s'épousent-ils pas?

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Je ne vais plus pleurer
Oh, je ne veux plus parler
Je me cacherai là

À te regarder
Danser et sourire
Et à t'écouter chanter
Chanter et puis rire

Oh, laisse-moi devenir
L'ombre de ton ombre
L'ombre de ta main
L'ombre de ton chien

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Non, ne me quitte pas",Ne Me Quitte Pas (Zénith 84),1998
Johnny Hallyday,"Qu'est-ce qu'il m'arrive ?
Mon cœur s'en va à la dérive
Noyé dans l'ombre de toi

Revoilà ma solitude
Moi qui croyais qu'elle avait fini par me laisser
Par m'oublier

Cette maison vide ne veut plus rien dire
Il y a trop de toi, trop de souvenirs
Qui traînent encore

Revoilà ma solitude
Et c'est l'hiver, même en plein été
Et dans mes nuits et dans ma vie

Comme une maladie, comme un grand froid
Au fond de mon cœur, au bout de mes doigts
Elle est là

Tu vas défaire tes cheveux rien que pour lui
Tu vas lui dire les même mots qu'à moi
Vous allez faire l'amour et puis
Tu seras bien dans ton oubli
Je te dois la solitude, merci

Revoilà ma solitude
Une chaise vide et un lit trop grand
Ton livre ouvert, lui aussi t'attend

Elle me colle au cœur, elle ne s'en va pas
Quand l'amour se meurt, elle attend déjà
Elle est presque là

Revoilà ma solitude
J'ai la tête vide et le cœur désert
Paris la nuit est un enfer

Elle se lit dans mes yeux
Elle s'entend dans ma voix
Dès que tu es partie
Elle n'attendait que ça
Et la voilà

Tu vas défaire tes cheveux rien que pour lui
Tu vas lui dire les même mots qu'à moi
Vous allez faire l'amour et puis
Tu seras bien dans ton oubli
Je te dois la solitude, merci

Revoilà ma solitude
Et je t'aime encore

Je l'ai vue sous la pluie
Dans l'éclair de ma lame

Qui marchait en rêvant près du Mississippi

Mon Amérique à moi
Mon Amérique à moi

Mon Amérique à moi, c'est jamais les gratte-ciel
Ni les flics, ni les fusils, ni la drogue, ni le sang
C'est plutôt les enfants qui sur leurs vélos rouges
Distribuent les journaux aux portes des maisons
Y a des bouteilles de lait sur tous les paillassons

Mon Amérique à moi
Mon Amérique à moi

Mon Amérique à moi, c'est un petit studio
En Floride dans la banlieue près d'Orlando
Avec trois guitares, deux batteurs, trois banjos
On avait enregistré une nouvelle version de ""Blue Suede shoes""
Sur un air paresseux et nonchalant de blues

Mon Amérique à moi
Mon Amérique à moi

Mon Amérique à moi est telle que je la rêve
Telle que je l'ai vécue, telle que vous l'avez vue
Dans les films noir et blanc, la lumière était belle
Et les figurants des westerns semblaient tout droit venus
Des albums illustrés signés Norman Rockwell

Mon Amérique à moi
Mon Amérique à moi

Mon Amérique à moi est modeste et tranquille
Elle me dit : ""Good morning !"" avec un grand sourire
Me sert du café chaud, des pommes à la vanille
M'invite pour passer Noël au Tennessee
Et pour faire du cheval dans la Ouest Virginie

Mon Amérique à moi
Mon Amérique à moi

Mon Amérique à moi, c'est toujours cette fille en jean
Je ne sais pas pourquoi elle court dans ma mémoire

Il nous reste nos chansons

Souvenirs, souvenirs
Quelque part dans le matin
Où le soleil semblait rire
Tout le long de nos chemins

Nous n´avions au fond de nos poches
Qu´un peu d´espoir
Mais nous partions comme Gavroche
Le cœur assez bavard

Souvenirs, souvenirs
Vous revenez dans ma vie
Illuminant l´avenir
Lorsque mon ciel est trop gris

On dit que le temps vous emporte
Et pourtant ça, j´en suis certain
Souvenirs, souvenirs
Vous resterez mes copains",Souvenirs Souvenirs,1998

Comme je t´aime

Si tu veux bien me laisser faire
Pendant une journée entière
Je suis capable pour te plaire

Sans perdre plus de dix secondes
Je promets devant tout le monde
De te donner 24000 baisers

Plus j´ai envie de t´embrasser

Et comme je ne suis pas de glace
Je ne laisserais pas ma place
Quand je te donne 24000 baisers

Et je ne peux pas m´arrêter

En me voyant toujours sincère
Me permettra de t´embrasser

D'avoir des milliers d'embêtements crois-moi
Oui laisse donc un peu les filles

La deuxième fois que j'ai crié 
Ce fut un cri de volupté 
Lorsqu'une femme m'attira 
Nu, tremblant, entre ses bras

Fut celui de l'homme comblé

Ne battrait jamais pour aucun autre cœur
Et tout est perdu
Car il ne bat plus
Mais il pleure mon amour déçu

Sur ma vie je t'ai juré un jour
De t'aimer jusqu'au dernier jour de mes jours
Et même à présent
Je tiendrai serment
Malgré tout le mal que tu m'as fait
Sur ma vie, Chérie, je t'attendrai

Johnny Hallyday,"C'est la nuit dans le quartier des fous
Les matons ont tiré les verrous
Sur des tueurs, des voleurs de cachous
Des flambeurs, des tatoués des loulous

Oui, la liberté, faut la payer
Et on enterre nos corps sous le mirador

Et la liberté, faut la rêver
Quand on promène nos corps sous le mirador

C'est la nuit mais c'est pas le Pérou
Y a des prisons à ciel ouvert partout

Il y a pas d'école pour apprendre à aimer
Il y a des écoles pour apprendre à tuer

Oui, la liberté, faut la payer
Et on enterre nos corps sous le mirador

La liberté, faut la rêver
Quand on promène nos corps sous le mirador

Sûr qu'on a des doutes et des problèmes
Du fond du trou on peut plus dire, je t'aime

La chance ici, s'appelle plus la veine
La veine ici, c'est bien fini, le cœur se bat sans bruit

Johnny Hallyday,"De la fenêtre de mon train
Un soir j'ai vu une fille
Qui avait les cheveux si clairs
Que j'ai cru un instant rêver

Nous étions à la fin du jour
Et j'avais longtemps, longtemps voyagé
J'avais des cendres dans la bouche
Et je me sentais fatigué

Mais les cheveux de cette fille
Si blonds, si clairs, si transparents
Me redonnèrent cette fraîcheur
Que connaissent seuls les enfants

Elle n'attendait rien ni personne
Je suis descendu sur le quai
Elle m'a fait visiter sa ville
Et marcher dans des champs de blé

Près d'un fleuve sauvage et rapide
Nous avons ensemble dormi
Et je crois bien l'avoir aimée
Au bout de la première nuit

Si vous prenez parfois le train
Surveillez les quais désertés
Quelque part il y a cette fille
Elle ressemble à l'été

Elle n'attendra rien ni personne
Mais ne lui parlez pas de moi
Car je l'ai quittée un matin
Je me demande encore pourquoi

C'était une fille aux yeux clairs

But all of those vows you made were never to be
Though we're apart, you're part of me still

For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill.

Des passants au regard vide
Au teint de plâtre livide
Pétrifiés semblaient attendre
Et soudain on vit descendre

La nuit en plein jour
Du ciel un discours
Les gens criaient, ""Au secours""

Avec la nuit qui s'achève
Les murs tombaient en poussière
Et j'ai dit une prière

What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before

Et qui n'est pas rentré

Je m'en vais prendre le train
A cinq heures demain matin, sans billet
Dans le dernier des fourgons

C'est ça la vie, tant
Qu'il y aura
Des trains qui s'en vont au loin
Je sauterai dans leur fourgon

Johnny Hallyday,"Parc'qu'ils sont au seuil de la vie
Et parce que tout, tout leur sourit
Les jeunes parfois font du chahut
Ils se bousculent dans la rue
Mais je vous le dis simplement
Ce n'est pas méchant

S'ils portent les cheveux un peu longs
Des blue jeans et même des blousons
C'est qu'ils en pincent pour cette tenue
Et c'est mieux que d'marcher nu
Aussi je le dis simplement
Ce n'est pas méchant

Parmi les gens plus âgés
Qui leur donnent tort
Il en est en vérité
Qui font bien plus fort
Et on se demande à les voir parfois
Faire la nouba
Si les jeunes c'est bien ce que l'on croit

On peut les voir quand vient l'printemps
À trois ou quatre c'est amusant
Sur une moto d'un demi-cheval
Qui fait un bruit infernal
Mais entre nous sincèrement
Ce n'est pas méchant

Parce qu'ils claquent des doigts en chantant
On dit que les jeunes sont fatigants
Oui oui oui et dans les machines à sous
Qui dansent et font les p'tits fous
Entre nous j'l'avoue franchement
Ce n'est pas méchant

Parfois à la belle saison
Filles et garçons
Sans s'occuper des passants
S'embrassent sur un banc
Alors on se met à les critiquer
C'est insensé
Puisque l'amour n'est pas un péché

Parce qu'ils ne sont pas encore mûrs
Aux joies, aux peines de la nature
Oui oui oui pardonnez-leur ces petits défauts
Ils ne sont pas bien bien gros
Mais au fond tout ça vraiment

Du bout du cœur

Un simple mot, et l'aveu
D'une larme au bord de tes yeux
Feront de moi un homme heureux

Un jour viendra, tu sauras
Toutes ces choses
Qui ont fait ma vie
Bien plus noire que rose
Tu comprendras mes pudeurs
Et tous ces mots qui me font peur
Que j'ai cachés, comme un voleur

Toi c'est le ciel qui t'a envoyée
Vers moi pour me réapprendre à aimer
Attends, laisse faire les jours
Laisse le temps au temps, et à l'amour

Un jour viendra tu me diras ""je t'aime""
Et j'aimerai.

Un jour viendra tu me diras ""je t'aime""
Du bout des yeux
Mais le dire quand même
Dans le ciel de ton regard
Lire ton désir est ma victoire
Un jour viendra, tu m'aimeras

Toi, c'est la vie qui t'a envoyée
Vers moi, qui n'ai jamais fait
Que passer
A côté des choses essentielles
Par défi pour brûler mes ailes

Un jour viendra tu me diras ""je t'aime""
Et j'aimerai

Attends, laisse faire les jours
Laisse le temps au temps, et à l'amour

Johnny Hallyday,"Mes baskets blanches, mes locks, l'encre a coulé comme le Trois Rivières 
Au fond des blocs, enfants des îles, fils d'une classe ouvrière 
L'idole des jeunes, Doc restera le même de Porte de la Chapelle, aux ondes hertziennes 

À l'heure où le monde se bouscule 
Je repasse ma vie à l'envers 
J'en ai fait des rêves, des calculs 
J'ai jamais voulu vraiment me laisser faire (jamais, jamais, jamais, jamais)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien) 
Rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)
La moindre trace, je l'ai bâtie de mes mains (mes rêves, nos poings, ont guidé nos destins) 

Mes baskets blanche, mon RER, l'encre a coulé dans ma carrière 
À temps plein, viser le haut, contemple mon temple est légendaire 
Mon air A.M.E.R, mon teint, mes rêves sont restés les mêmes 
J'ai tant porté le flambeau, représenté l'honneur des miens 

Mes baskets blanches, ma grande gueule, de l'encre sur les mains
Mon stylo était meurtri et coupable ennemi numéro un
Entre merde et pertes blanches, j'ai le goût pour la revanche
Boxeur, breakeur, rappeur, acteur, attitude franche 

J'ai chanté les Hommes, leurs désirs 
Les destins fragiles et l'amour (je suis né dans la rue)
On a voulu que j' tombe sur place 
Moi, j'ai souvent fait face et je combats toujours (le combat continue)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien) 
Rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)
La moindre trace, je l'ai bâtie de mes mains (mes rêves, nos poings, ont guidé nos destins) 

Dis l'heure de Hip Hop Rock 
Des burnes dans le froc 
Fusion guitares et pe-ra pour civils et colboques 
Ministère, Johnny 
Aussi burnés qu'un keuf sous Sarkozy 
Liberté dans ma musique et l'savoir comme Uzi 
Baskets blanches et blousons noirs, génération, manque d'espoir 
Exempté de conneries, que ce gardien me foute la paix 
Lascars abandonnés, j'ai le rêve des cités dortoirs 
Mon rap tout-terrain, mon R.T.T, c'est ça qui est la vérité 

L'être humain porte en lui le meilleur (ouais) 
Je sens encore le poids de mes erreurs, de mes erreurs (ouais)
Le pire a si souvent été là 
La peine guidait mes pas mais je la garde au fond de moi (jusqu'au dernier souffle)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien) 
Non, rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)

Oui, abandonné

Et la fille qui l'attend

Sans qu'il parle, elle comprend
Sa vie, comme c'est bon d'être heureux

Johnny Hallyday,"All right!
Je dédie cette chanson à Daniel Balavoine

Les coups de poings dans l'âme 
Le froid de la lame qui court 
Chaque jour me pousse un peu plus vers la fin 
Quand je monte sur scène comme on prend le dernier train 

Même les soirs de drame 
Il faut trouver la flamme qui brûle
Puis toucher les femmes qui me tendent les mains 
Qui me crient qu'elles m'aiment et dont je ne sais rien 

C'est pour ça qu'aujourd'hui je suis fatigué 
C'est pour ça qu'aujourd'hui je voudrais crier

Je ne suis pas un héros 
Faut pas croire ce que disent les journaux 
Je ne suis pas un héros, un héros 
Oh, non, non, non!

Mais quand les cris de femmes 
S'accrochent à mes larmes je sais 
Oui que c'est pour m'aider à porter tous mes chagrins 
Et je me dis qu'elles rêvent mais ça leur fait du bien 

Et à coups de pieds dans l'âme 
Oui, j'ai trouvé la trame qu'il faut 
Mais pour mourir célèbre il ne faut rien emporter 
Que ce que les autres n'ont pas voulu garder

Johnny Hallyday,"J'ai rêvé la nuit dernière
Que je me baladais dans les champs
Le ciel était couleur argent
Je crois qu'il y avait une rivière

J'suis entré dans une forêt
C'était joli, les peupliers
Quelque part, une feuille est tombée

Et Sammy m'a secoué
Parce que j'ronflais
Plus de peupliers
Mercredi, mes gosses vont m'visiter
Mais faut avoir la santé
Enfin, façon de parler

Parfois j'me joue le coup du tunnel
La lime à ongles, cent mètres, ça presse
Mais j'suis con en Edmond Dantès
Et ma fille de l'air bat de l'aile

Alors j'me jette sur des pages blanches
Un best-seller de la souffrance
Du croustillant, de la violence

Et puis j' m'en fous d'écrire
Sammy sait pas lire
Plus scribouiller
Mercredi, on va voir la télé
Mais faut avoir la santé
Enfin, façon de parler

Ici, y a des questions à ne jamais poser
Du genre ""Sammy, qu'est-ce qu'on fait aujourd'hui ?""

Ici, y a des parfums à ne pas se rappeler
""Sammy, si t'avais vu son sourire""

Ici, y a certains mots à ne pas prononcer
""Sammy, je me ferais bien un café-calva
Dans un certain café-tabac
Au coin de la Rue des Martyrs""

J'ai rêvé la nuit dernière
Qu'elle dormait contre mon épaule
Complètement nue, elle était drôle
Appliquée comme une prière
J'ai posé mes mains sur son cou
Je voulais que le temps s'arrête

J'ai serré, un peu trop peut-être
Et Sammy gentiment m'a réveillé
C'est terminé

Sans s'accrocher l'air pitoyable

Although you're full of misery 
You mustn't show a trace of sadness 
Never look for sympathy

The way of pocketing your pride 
Sometimes face humiliation 
While you were burning up inside 

Facing reality is often hard to do 
When it seems happiness is gone 

You've got to learn to hide your tears 
And tell your heart life must go on 

You've got to learn to leave the table 
When love's no longer being served 
To show everybody that you're able 
To leave without saying a word 

You've got to learn to hide your sorrow 
And go on living as before 
What good is thinking of tomorrow
Who knows what it may have in store 

You've got to learn to be much stronger

And listen to advice 
And sometimes pay the price 
And learn to live with a broken heart",You've Got to Learn,2008
Johnny Hallyday,"Er stand im Rampenlicht, in der Hand die Gitarre
Grell geschminkt sein Gesicht, wild zerzaust seine Haare
Sonst war nichts mit ihm los Aber das merkte keiner
Er war ein Superstar – und nicht irgendeiner!
Seine Finger war\'n bunt Niemand sah seine Wunden
Bis auf Platz Nummer 1 hat er sich hoch geschunden
War die Stimme die sang auch der Schrei seiner Seele
niemals fiel je der Satz : „Seht doch, wie ich mich quäle!“

Und das nannte er Leben!
Und das nannte er Leben!

In ihm war alles leer Doch er merkte das schon
Er besang doch nicht sie sondern sein Mikrophon
Und die Boxen da hinten, die heulten wie wild
Und der Mann der da sang passte gar nicht ins Bild
Doch 10000 und mehr hat er hypnotisiert
Sein Gesicht nass vom Schweiß
Doch er fühlt nur, er friert
Und noch nachts im Hotel ist sein Tag nicht komplett
denn da wartet auf ihn irgendeiner im Bett

Und das nannte er Leben!
Und das nannte er Leben!

Ja, er hatte es geschafft Er sprang über den Zaun
Sein Gesicht so vernarbt durch die Träume der Frau\'n
Wie ein hungriges Tier, so verschlang er die Zeit
Nahm, was immer sich bot und war doch nie zu zweit
Und seine Welt war zu groß um ihm Heimat zu sein
Und für das, was er suchte war sie ihm zu klein
Eines Tages, da merkte er, dass nichts mehr lief
Und er fiel und er fiel in ein endloses Tief

Und das nannte er Leben!
Und das nannte er Leben!
Leben
Und das nannte er Leben!
Und das nannte er Leben!

Des mains qui se tendent
Des coeurs qui attentent
Je suis ceux qui m'ont aimé

Elle se lit dans tes yeux
Dans ces chansons qui nous rassemblent
Autour de ce feu
Que rien n'atteint

Just when I thought I was really okay,

Like a forest fire, Down, down,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

Looked like I'd found peace of mind,
Looked like I was gonna make it this time --

And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad

Carry it home and cook it for supper

Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack

Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman

N'en vouloir a personne, et jusqu'au bout être encore qui nous sommes

Etre a genoux

Dans la peau l'envie, dans le corps la vie

Si tu finis par l'accepter

Un doigt posé sur la détente
Courbé sous le poids de ta croix
Même au plus fort de la tourmente
Un jour l'amour te trouvera

Un jour l'amour te trouvera
Et te laissera désarmé
Si tu lui ouvres enfin les bras
Si tu finis par l'accepter

Sur les pages blanches
D'un monde aussi pressé
Que les trains fantômes

Dans le cœur des hommes

Ne verra pas le jour
À tous les rescapés
D'une époque sans visage

Que je ne suis qu'un homme

Que je ne suis qu'un homme

Prisonnier de l'instinct
En recherche encore
Un remède au destin
Aux peines sur nos épaules

Le vie qu'on a rêvé
Noyé au fond des fioles
Au fond du cœur des hommes

La mémoire dans la peau
Je me rappelle de tout
Ce qu'on s'était promis
Comme au premier jour
J'aurais voulu rester
Pour le pire, le meilleur

Johnny Hallyday Orchestre,"Je m'appelle Jean-Philippe Smet
Je suis né à Paris
Vous me connaissez mieux sous le nom de Johnny

Un soir de juin en 1943
Je suis né dans la rue par une nuit d'orage
Oh oui, je suis né dans la rue
Oh oui, je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue, dans la rue

Je suis né dans la ville où les murs sont toujours gris
Derrière un terrain vague où se trouvent les taudis
Dans un berceau de fer je devais grandir
Ne vous étonnez pas si je ne sais pas sourire

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Oh oui, je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue

Je n'ai pas eu de père pour me faire rentrer le soir
Et bien, souvent ma mère travaillait pendant la nuit
Je jouais de la guitare assis sur le trottoir
Le cœur comme une pierre je commençais ma vie

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue, dans la rue

J'ai du me battre pour avoir la vie que j'aimais
J'ai du me battre encore plus fort pour la garder
De tous les côtés de la ville on me cherchait
Les poings se sont serrés depuis je n'ai pas changé

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Oh, oui, je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue

Maintenant je ne vie plus où les murs sont toujours gris
Mon nom est en argent et ma guitare est en or
Mes chansons d'hier sont bien les mêmes qu'aujourd'hui
Mais quand la nuit arrive je retourne dans la rue

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Oh je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue
Oh oui
Dans la rue, ouhais, ouhais

On me parle avec respect, je dîne chez des rois
On me choisit mes amis, les meilleurs qui soient
On voudrait me faire changer, mais c'est une cause perdue
Vous perdez votre temps, je reviendrai à la rue

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Oh oui je suis né dans la rue, dans la rue, dans la rue
Dans la rue

Et bien, j'espère que ce nouveau 33 tours vous aura plu
J'espère que vous avez aimé le nouveau style de blues
Que nous avons essayé de créer pour vous
A bientôt, salut

Maintenant je ne vie plus où les murs sont toujours gris
Mon nom est en argent et ma guitare est en or
Mes chansons d'hier sont bien les mêmes qu'aujourd'hui
Mais quand la nuit arrive, je retourne dans la rue

Parce que je suis né dans la rue
Oh oui, je suis né dans la rue, la rue, dans la rue

Un scarabée est mort
Je le porte autour de mon cou
Fleur de porcelaine
Aux parfums interdits
Je n'accepterai que les fous

Je ne recommencerai jamais ce que j'ai fait
Oh non, non, oh

Jouets de soldats morts
Poursuivant des enfants
Ils courent dans ma direction
Rêvent de musique
Aux couleurs de cristal
Qui réclament ma protection

Je ne recommencerai jamais ce que j'ai fait
Oh non, oh

Les bras du soleil
Aux ongles de diamant
Ont capturé mon esprit
Sous un ciel de feu
Mes souvenirs d'amour
Reviennent autour de ma vie

Je ne recommencerai jamais ce que j'ai fait
Oh, oh, oh non

Voleur d'étincelles
Et fabricant de fièvres
Viendra pour arrêter le temps
Et la mort vaincue
Non, n'aura pas d'empire

Johnny Hammond,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

It's too late.",It's Too Late,1971
Johnny Hammond,"I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show,

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so

Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh ooh (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh

Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no

Everything has its time
Show me a reason

Cats sit on the window sill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, of the sky

Every man has his goal

Winter comes after fall

To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest

Oh, eagles belong where they can fly

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

No quiet browns or grays, I'll take my days instead
And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day
The colors of my life will leave a shining light to show the way

The colors of my life, are softer than a breeze
The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

Johnny Hartman,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive

Johnny Hartman,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there so warm and fair 

All summer long
we sang a song
And then we strolled on golden sand
Two friends
and the summer wind 

Like painted skies, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the bright blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
That piper man
One day, it called to you
And I lost you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter winds
They have come and they have gone
And still those days
Those lonely days
They go on and on

To all the nights that never end?

What a rare mood I'm in!

Johnny Hartman,"So I walk a little too fast, and I drive a little too fast,
And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?

So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much,
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd,
So that people are apt to stare.

Do they know, do they care, that it's only 
That I'm lonely, and low as can be?
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all.

So I smoke a little too much, and I joke a little too much,
And the tunes I request are not always the best,
But the ones where the trumpets blare.

Bien loin sur un coteau
Il existe un petit village
Bien loin sur le coteau
Il existe un petit hameau
Où les garçons vivent rangés
Où les filles sont sages
Où les garçons vivent rangés
Avec leur fleur d'oranger.

Par les beaux soirs de juin
On prend le frais devant les portes
Par les beaux soirs de juin
On va courir sur les chemins
Ce sont des cris et des chansons
Qu'le vent du nord emporte
Ce sont des cris et des chansons
Qu'il emporte à la maison.

Passe pour être un peu sorcière

Pas loin du cimetière
Le diable dans un gros buisson
Pas bien loin de la maison.

Vit un spectacle inoubliable
La gentille Suzon
Était allée sur le gazon
Elle a vu derrière un buisson

En train de prendr' une leçon
D'amour près de la maison.

Monsieur Dupont est fonctionnaire
Ils ont l'air très bien, très bourgeois :
Canne, chapeau melon, moustaches légendaires !
Mais qu'y a-t-il donc ?
Mais qu'y a-t-il donc ?
Ce soir, Monsieur Durand vocifère
Puis il insulte Monsieur Dupont
Qui lui réplique autoritaire :
Nous laverons ça dans le sang ; mon ami
Dans le sang, dans le sang, je vous dis !

Ils partirent au petit jour
Dans un paysage d'amour…
Quelques vaches se retournèrent,
Dans le ciel, le soleil rouillé
Luisait, et les arbres mouillés
Se racontaient à leur manière
« C'est Monsieur Dupont, c'est Monsieur Durand
Qui vont vider une querelle
Et qui brandissent en tremblant
Un revolver ancien modèl' »
C'est Monsieur Dupont, c'est Monsieur Durand
Qui vont se battre, mal à l'aise

Avec des figur's de jaunisse
Puis ils se font photographier

Dès l'instant qu'ils lèvent le bras
Avec un peu de flou, pour faire plus artiste.
Mais qu'y a-t-il donc ? Mais qu'y a-t-il donc ?

Comme tremble son pantalon
Comme il s'agite sans réserve…

Dans le sang, dans le sang, je vous jure,
Nous laverons ça dans le sang, mon ami,
Dans le sang, dans le sang, je vous dis ! »

Avaient, pour vider leur querelle,

Chez le Duc de Barbarency
Qui demeure ici
Château, villas, maisons superbes
Jardins fleuris, bel aqueduc

Et sur les marches du perron
Douze laquais chantent en rond 

Attention
Tout est Duc ici, Monsieur, tout est Duc
Tout est au Duc, tout est au Duc
Il possède à lui seul des millions de ducats
Ah oui, vraiment Monsieur c'est fou ce que le Duc a

Il nerveux, il est nerveux
Et nous cherchons en vain depuis un truc
Pour faire pousser les poils du Duc

Le soir c'est un grand diner
Car le Duc a tué
A la chasse des isards
Des pies, des lézards

Qui n'a pas plus de vingt printemps
Et moi je suis tout feu tout flamme
Et je ne tiens plus mon coeur battant

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Johnny Hodges,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Johnny Hodges,"Love is like a hydrant: it turns off and on
Like some friendships when your money's gone
Love stands in with the loan sharks when your heart's in pawn

Had some broad wings like some aeroplane
I would fly away forever
Never to come again

For love, oh, love, oh, loveless love
Has set our hearts from gold-less gold
From milk-less milk and silk-less silk
We are growing used to soul-less souls

That's why we have a pure full law
In everything we find a flaw

Just to fly away from loveless love",Loveless Love,1959

Johnny Hodges,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1966

You're jetting along with your girlie

I never wink back at fireflies

But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark

Johnny Holiday,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Steals across the meadows of my heart

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

We all left Washington
To lick the Rebel boys in grey 
At the Battle of Bull Run
They came from Pennsylvania and some from Maryland
To see the Rebel boys get spanked by Honest Abe's broad hand

We said we'll run â??em to Atlanta and to Galveston Bay
But they ran us back to Washington and Philadelphia
And Philadelphia

The ladies wore their brightest shawls
The gentlemen were gay
They came to see their Yankee boys WHIP old Virginia

When a soldier said to me
Would you rather have Jeff Davis' hat or the sword of Bobbie Lee

We said we'll run â??em to Atlanta and to Galveston Bay
But they ran us back to Washington and Philadelphia
And Philadelphia

And then the general doffed his hat and said let's rest a spell
Before the first and we all heard that awful rebel yell
The waters of Manasas creek became a ruby red
Many a Reb and Yankee boy lay in the willows dead

We said we'll run â??em to Atlanta and to Galveston Bay
But they ran us back to Washington and Philadelphia
And Philadelphia

A fight locked in the jest of time too horrible to tell
Virginny's true green countryside became a lake of hell

To plough my cotton in the early fall
He's runnin' around, it was an awful sin
I had to build a fence to keep my donkey in

I rigged up a wire with a battery charge
To keep my donkey from a-running at large
Inside this bin I turned him loose
Thrilled by volts of electrified juice

Well, which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence

Now, the first time he backed up against it
He threw back his ears and he had a fit
He brayed real loud and he hit high gear
He jumped up into the stratosphere

I just got word from Albuquerque
A donkey up there was looking for work
He's my donkey and his name is Jack
Oh, how I wish he'd come on back

Well, which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence

Now, more word came from Palomar
A man up there was a-watching the star
While looking through his telescope
He nearly had himself a stroke

He saw something riding up the rainbow trail
With two long ears and a puckered up tail
The thing he saw when he 'firmed the states
Was a donkey heading for the pearly gates

The Germans had the biggest ship, they had the biggest guns
The Bismarck was the fastest ship that ever sailed the sea
On her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship, the Hood
And every British seaman, he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismarck, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

 We'll find the German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
 We gotta sink the Bismarck  cause the world depends on us
 Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
 When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down

The Hood found the Bismarck on that fatal day
The Bismarck started firin' fifteen miles away
""We gotta sink the Bismarck"" was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away, the mighty Hood went down

For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people ""put every ship a-sail
'Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta sink the Bismarck to the bottom of the sea""

 We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
 We gotta sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
 Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
 When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down

The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismarck made its run
The admiral of the British fleet said ""turn those bows around
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down""

The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismarck, they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
""Sink the Bismarck"" was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

We found that German battleship been makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
We hit the deck a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
Yeah, we found the mighty Bismarck and prepared to cut her down

Johnny Horton,"Well a-way down yonder on the Candy Creek
I whittled out a fiddle from my wagon seat.
I fiddled my fiddle and I rubbed my bow
Play a little tune wherever I go.

Sleepy-eyed John, you better your britches on
Sleepy-eyed John, better tie your shoe.
Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
And try to get to heaven 'fore the Devil gets to you.

Well, Sleepy-eyed John he stole a goose
The goose he flopped but he couldn't get loose.
Said John to the goose ""If you don't be still,
We'll miss my supper down in Candyville.""

Well Sleepy-eyed John he had a wooden leg.
The little leg was nothing but a little wooden peg.
One shoe off and one shoe on
He'll do the double shuffle 'til the cows come home.

Now I got twenty dollars for to build a fence
I took my money and I ain't worked since.
Sold my buggy and I sold my plow
I wouldn't take a dollar for my journey now.

Well over the hickory and down the pine
The raccoon laughed and the old hound whined.
John said ""Sic 'em"" and the raccoon left
They crossed Green River in a minute and a half.

Johnny Horton,"When the last sole flicker of the sun goes down
And they turn the lights on all over town
That's when you see me walkin' Broad and Main
I'm gonna see my sugar coated baby

I'm just like a kitten, playin' with a string
When I'm a-holdin' that pretty little thing
She's as sweet as honey all the way around
And she's sugar coated all the way down

Well I'm drownin' myself in her eyes of blue
'Cause each and every kiss is just like brand new
I bet when you find me I'll be nestled in her arms
Havin' myself a-lost a week in her charms

Well her love I get for nothing, it don't come on the cuff
It comes from her heart and I never get enough
She kisses me it's like a drink of wine
It warms me all over just to know that she's mine",Sugar-Coated Baby,1991
Johnny Horton,"If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
There is one who's smiling face the Gods would see
Cause she'll walk along beside me up to golden stairs
Oh they'll never ever take her love from me
What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave
And to see her love turn into sympathy
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave
Oh they'll never ever take her love from me
[ strings ]
I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the used to be
Someone else's arms may hold her now in uncaress
But they'll never eever take her love from me
I thought I'd make her happy if I'd step aside
But I knew her love would never set me free
Even on the day that she became another's bride
Oh they'll never never take her love from me

Oh wagon trains rollin' along they fade from my visions and in time will be gone
I see an eagle in space my people will follow oh oh a vanishing race
I I ou I I I ou I I ou

An Indian brave rolled along one day on a lonely mountain trail
And he gazed below with a heart of woe where the prairie schooners sail
A vision formed like a mortal storm in the dust of the wagon train
A vanishing race appeared in space and he sang his sad refrain
I I ou I I I ou I I ou
Oh wagon trains rollin' along

Oh now great spirits on high please spare them the sorrow you show to my eye oh oh
Now my blankets are roll and I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh

Johnny Horton,"Give me my cycle with star-filled sky above
And a good lookin' woman with a heart full of love
I'll go to any honky in any old town cause I am the wild one and I'll never settle down
I am the wild one I am the wild one I am the wild one I'll never settle down

I got a gal in every town who claims she loves me so
I love 'em and leave 'em I want 'em all to know

I know I'll have to travel fast and leave without a load

Johnny Horton,"Words can cause our love to tumble
Jealous words are so unkind
Words can cause a heart to stumble
Or they make a waste of time

Words are sweet when your love speaks them
With her heart or with her eyes
Words can make your darlin' happy
Or they make your darlin' cry

The man on the drum is out from dumb and the bassman he plays from his soul

You keep a havin' your fun you lucky son of a gun on a honky tonk hardwood floor

Your payday's Saturday you're broke on Sunday come Monday you're feelin' saur
You got big black eyes that you pick up from little from a little guy the night before

Johnny Horton,"Coal, smoke, valve oil and steam
My heart is sad, I'm living in dreams
I can't tell why I love the smell
Of coal, smoke, valve oil and steam

I worked for the railroad all of my life
To make a home, for my Darlin' wife
But now, I'm retired and feelin' so low
Weary and tired with a heart full of woe

Coal, smoke, valve oil and steam
My heart is sad, I'm living in dreams
I can't tell why I love the smell
Of coal, smoke, valve oil and steam

I pull on the whistle to clear the line
And to bring that Fireball in on time
Oh time in your life, please take me back
Let me hear the driver's click again on the track

Coal, smoke, valve oil and steam
My heart is sad, I'm living in dreams
I can't tell why I love the smell
Of coal, smoke, valve oil and steam

A short forty years went flyin' on by
Now I'm so lonesome, I could die
If I find heaven, the way I've been told
I'll go an engine down a track made of gold

I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road.
Found my treasure at the end of love's rainbow.
I found a love for which I'm pinin',
Pretty as a ring, her love was shinin'.

I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road.
I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road,
'Cause I've found the key to this lovesick code.
I found a love, an' that's no lyin'
A gal I can trust without denyin'.

I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road.
I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road.
Now I've found the gal to share this heavy load.
I vowed to her that I would take her,
I'd take her to the preacher an' never forsake her.

I'm done rovin' down this lonesome road,
For to her apron strings, now I am sewed.
