Bloc Party,"All the clouds are black
Mother is cried out
Someone else broke my fall
I don't remember
Internationally bastardized
Internationally tongue-tied
The truth is I'm not sorry
It's bigger than the both of us
A pillar of salt, a box of want
You were pulled out of the embers
It was never my intention
All the clouds are black
Mother is cried out

Summertime has come and gone
All used up with wishful thinking
Get sussed out, get cynical
In this world there are no second chances
Crawling round on all fours
Curl yourself into a circle
I will tear myself apart
If you promise to paint me
As a work of art

You don't need to preach to me
I'm a believer baby
You don't need to preach to me
I'm a believer
If you want lies I can tell them
If you want lies I got 'em
All the pennies in the Thames
Will not make it how it was",Always New Depths,2005

I can give you life, I can take it away 

A heart of stone, a smoking gun 
I'm working it out 
Why'd you feel so underrated? 
Why'd you feel so negated? 

Turning away from the light 
Becoming adult 
Turning into my soul 
I wanted to bite not destroy 
To feel her underneath 
Turning into my soul 

She don't think straight 
She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops 
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will 
And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news 
Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled 

And if you feel a little left behind 
I will see you on the other side 

Cos I'm on fire 
I'm on fire when you come 

I'm on fire so stub me out

Then that's the way it is

I still feel you and the taste of cigarettes
What could I ever run to

You never wanted to alarm me but I'm the one that's drowning now

I could sleep forever these days because in my dreams I see you again
But this time fleshed out fuller face in your confirmation dress
It was so like you to visit me to let me know you were OK
It was so like you to visit me, always worrying about someone else

At your funeral I was so upset, so upset,
In your life you were larger than this
Statuesque

I see signs now all the time that your not dead your sleeping
I believe in anything that brings you back home to me",Signs,2008

Malevolent and without thought
Uprooting trees, destroying cars
Cold and relentless, with arms outstretched

No boat nor brick
Nor crucifix can hold it back
I've been wicked
I've been arrogant

[Chorus]
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss (Silent about it)
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
And I cannot say that I was not warned or was misled
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss

Awaken from dreams of drunken car crashes
You saddened my friends and claimed all my lovers
I tried to stay still, so it will not see
Its talons rake the side of my face
When did you become such a slut?

[Chorus]

And I didn't think I'd catch fire when I held my hand to the flame
And I didn't think it would catch up as fast as I could have run

I ain't afraid to shine different.. c'mon

Devoted life to the dream of lights and fortune and fame
I might just gain the vision, or just might be livin in vain
See in the game it's cool strolls and platinum thugs
Stack the cash, drugs and women; bubble in crime, trouble in time
I stay humble with mine, had drama for words
Encountered some birds who tried to take the shine
But I'm illuminatin like a thousand frozen wrists in the glint of the sun
Worth the Franklin Mint and Wall Street combined into one
They can't see it yet though, different like niggaz sayin petrol
for gas, english metric system, graded on the past
Just tryin to reach y'all, no one's at my arms length
want to stay in the race but slowly runnin out of breath
They all alike, can't understand, maybe it's safest
to play the role and be another glitch in The Matrix
Repetitive flow, embedded in dough
I run the risk of pissin everybody off, but I don't care if you know

[Chorus: Jean Grae]
Yo I'm on the line like white, china, table
Lay it all out for the shit; nigga, no, doubt
Fuck real, I'm right, told you the last time man
Fuck y'all, say it
Bring it, lay it all out for the shit; nigga, no, doubt
Fuck real, I'm right, told you the last time
Things ain't different, say it
Bring it, I'm on, now

[Jean Grae]
Quit for good, too many times, shit maybe I should
But it won't prevent rejection reappearin in life
I even lay the toughest down for you
Paint the ground blood pink for you, only so that you feel me right
Then hear me tight from the ills perhaps
But not a lot of scenes like movie stills are fleein from fiends and caps
I had, thrills and high spills, couple of hot chases
Romance with Jacks, Jills in dirty places
No jail cell been filled and no court cases
But committed murder of flesh, two of my own faces
At best I'm, a dime each, not a dozen, never cheap
Fornicated adultery once and now I never cheat
Younger sibling or two, family disfunctional
Problem with bein on time, hardly ever punctual
Punchclocks give me the runs, just not in my blood Akki
y'all flashin guns at me, time to go?  Let it be

[Chorus]

[Jean Grae]
See I got these bill collectors, practically at the door chillin
I can't explain to Visa how I'm tryin to stack a million
Hustle on the side for chump change, it's not big time
I only do it for fries, chicken and wine and hump days
Reality spit, dudes and rap bitches sick of me
And if they right, they still print, I'm tryin to do calligraphy
All real, sit up just all night, just thinkin it's all wrong
Won't sleep 'til everything's alright
I made brush fire noise; I need four alarm
Three A.M. on the lawn with two kids and one slipper on
Blaze now, your days phase out like old sitcoms
Tryin to save the show by puttin new fuckin kids on
Love me or not, respect it for what it's worth
I'm like a bundle of dough in a knot in a purse under your cot
Undiscovered lines like connectin the dots
It's gonna happen, sooner or later
Fuck rappin, just givin data

Yeah, the ones that poison all the food you consume
The ones that never told you about Mount Vesuvius Tomb
The Bird Flu is a lie, the Swine Flu is a lie
Why would that even come as a surprise?

It caused cancer and it cost a lot of people their lives

In case you couldn't tell
My given name is Dickie, I come from Billericay
And I'm doing very well

Had a love affair with Nina
In the back of my Cortina
A seasoned up hyena could not have been more obscener
She took me to the cleaners
And other misdemeanours
But I got right up between her
Rum and her Ribena

Well, you ask Joyce and Vicki
If candy-floss is sticky
I'm not a blinking thicky
I'm Billericay Dickie
And I'm doing very well

I bought a lot of brandy
When I was courting Sandy
Took eight to make her randy
And all I had was shandy
Another thing with Sandy 
What often came in handy
Was passing her a 'Mandy'
She didn't half go bandy

So you ask Joyce and Vicki
If I ever took the mickey
I'm not a flipping thicky
I'm billeicay dickie
And I'm doing very well

I'd rondez-vouez with Janet
Quite near the Isle of Thanet
She looked more like a gannet
She wasn't half a prannet
Her mother tried to ban it
Her father helped me plan it
And when I captured Janet she bruised her pomegranet

So you ask Joyce and Vicki
If I ever shaped up tricky
I'm not a blooming thicky
I'm Billericay Dickie
And I'm doing very well

You should never hold a candle if you don't know where it's been
The jackpot is in the handle on a normal fruit machine

With blotched and lagered skin
Blockheads with food particles in their teeth
What a horrible state they're in

Under pale mauve vests
Shoes like dead pigs' noses
Cornflake packet jacket, 
Catalogue trousers
A mouth what never closes

You must have seen Blockheads 
In raucous teams
Dressed up after work
Who screw their poor old Eileens
Get sloshed and go berserk

Rotary accessory watches
Hire-purchase signet rings
A beauty to the bully boys
No lonely vestige clings

Why shouldn't they do as they please?

Or pissing in your swimming pool?

Doch ich bin wachsam, nicht verträumt
Ich hab mein Herz am rechten Fleck
Und unterscheide so Gold von Dreck
Doch diese Ratten lauern überall
Denn diese Ratten sind in Überzahl
Verfolgt von Schmarotzern
Du fliegst auf ohne Vorwarnung
Bald schon zerfetzt vor deinem Haus
Deine Tür, sie geht drauf und ich schau einfach drauf
Immer wieder auf dein' Schädel mit dem Waffenlauf
In deinem Viertel reden alle
„Siehst du Blokk, Junge, lauf“
Zerstör' ich deine Wohnung
Hau' deinen Kopf an den Knauf
Ich raste aus und lass der Wut jetzt freien Lauf
Keiner kann das Monster stoppen in seinem Adrenalinrausch
Weder du noch deine Wohnung kommen heil wieder raus
Und ich renn zu meiner Karre weg
Die Knarre aus dem Staub

Augen auf, pass auf
Geh in Deckung oder es passiert dir auch
Dass auch du schnell mal zum Täter wirst
Pass auch, Augen auf
Geh in Deckung oder es passiert dir auch
Dass auch du schnell mal zum Täter wirst

Waffe weg, Maske weg
Zeit vergeht und ich vergess' den Dreck
Ich chill' im Studio und recorde einen Track
Und bin mir sicher keiner kennt dieses Versteck
Totenstille, alles ruhig
Das Unterbewusstsein verstärkt meine Furcht
Und ich schau' aus dem Fenster, die Straße ist leer
Trotzdem kommt's mir so vor als wenn dort jemand wär
Meine Tür, sie springt auf und sie hauen einfach drauf
Und befördern mich zu Boden, treten mir in meinen Bauch
Ich versuch' sie zu erkennen, doch seh' nur den Waffenlauf
Laserpointer auf den Schädel, auch wenn's so nicht einer glaubt
Ich glaub ich kratz' hier ab und denk an Racheakt
Doch als ich dann erkenne, wer mir in die Fresse lacht
Dann wird mir alles klar, es jetzt alles egal
Sie sind gekommen mit dem Haftbefehl der letzten Tat

Augen auf, pass auf
Geh in Deckung oder es passiert dir auch
Dass auch du schnell mal zum Täter wirst
Pass auch, Augen auf
Geh in Deckung oder es passiert dir auch
Dass auch du schnell mal zum Täter wirst

Bin in Haft seit einem Tag
Mein Anwalt kommt und er fragt
Ob ich die Tat wirklich tat
Ihr könnt euch denken, was ich ihm sag
Es ist doch klar, die Tat ist wahr
Beweise weg (alles wunderbar)
Ist was mein Anwalt sagt
Danach ein Händeschlag
Wir gehen gemeinsam raus, das noch am selben Tag

Gibt ist es irgendwie besser wenn es sich dreht
Die anderen Eltern gucken dumm wenn sie die Kinder holt
Lästern wiederholt denn die beiden tragen Gummistiefel statt Winterschuhe
Sie muss sich zwingen zu lächeln obwohl sie nichts mehr fühlt
Sitzt betäubt vor der scheiß Glotze das Licht ist kühl
Sieht den Geissens zu wie sie Geld verbrennen
Doch das Leben was sie führt, ist leider aus 'ner anderen Sendung auf RTL
Wartet auf 'nen Menschen, der sie hält
Wenn sie kippt wenn sie fällt sie berührt und sagt dass sie ihm gefällt
Sie hat den letzten Traum verworfen, es widert sie an
Wenn sie merkt, sie beginnt sich zu bemitleiden, deswegen wird sie zum Stein
Küsst ihre Kleinen, gute Nacht, morgen gehts wieder so

Mutter ist am Weinen, wenn es heulend aus der Tür ging

Denn von vorne und von hinten, fickte sie das Leben
Keine Kohle zum ausgeben, sondern Eintrag in der Schufa
Keine Arbeit, weil sie in der Schule nicht so gut war
Keine Perspektive, sie kennt nur das Hartz 4
Zumindest was davon noch bleibt, wenn er am Automaten spielt
Diese Welt ist gefickt von Medien und TV
Internet, Instagram, immer on, immer drauf
Klink mich aus, aus dem Netz und halt meine Augen auf
Und berichte euch davon, wenn ich von Block zu Block lauf

Blonde Ja.,"I’m looking at the sun
Through my mighty magnifying glass
I’m heating up that stone cold star
While burning every flower around

And you, at the gallery, taking pictures of art
And me, down the boulevard, flirting with life
You, me, nobody but us
Little kisses beneath a pale shade of love

I’m looking at the sun
I’m looking at the sun
I’m looking at the sun

‘Cause something’s burning in me

And me, by the riverside, playing with fire

He left his home, he left his car and left his job back in the city
He left her ghost, he took the road, and faced his fate
Just when a bluebird flying around sat on his shoulder
And told him “Pal, you’re out of luck, you’re going the wrong way.”

Felt there was no moon (no moon)
No moon (no moon)

He felt surprised, he asked him why, he didn’t say and flew off quickly
He tried to run, tried to go back and tried to escape
But when the Greyhound hit the road he thought “It’s over.
I’ll be alright. I’ll take my chance. I’ll keep my way.”

He kept his path, embraced his faith, got off the bus down by the crossroad
Took his guitar, walked down the road towards the sea

You go out at night and eat up bars

Do the invisible dance

Looks like a baby with an old man's eyes

Although I'm young I got a job to do
Hid the microfilm in the lining of my shoe
Call it a business trip
Got to hide inside my trench coat and be clever
I got my papers and a cyanide pill
My Polaroid's a taser in disguise
There's a base in the hills
And the wheat fields looks like Kansas in November

Astrovia, sweet comrade, your nation is your gun
Your love reads like the broken code you sent me
One last contact in red square, unless I have to run
And the long arms of the KGB detect me

Can't trust a soul, secret messenger
Just the rules that lie like circuits in your brain
And a cool .45. The wind is ice and foreign air tastes strange

I.C.B.M. Bang! Bang! You're dead!

of the forty planets, satellites, moons, stars, 
and any other inhabited orbs 
with contestants entered in the annual Grande Trex, 
the only inter-galactic race. 
This year's event promises excitement to surpass all previous races. 
As many of you fans already know the route or track of the orbits, glides, etc. 
has been increased by 5,000 million kilometers 
thus enabling Grande Trex to include the be	'Arc System, 
in our present event and for all succeeding GT races.

What's a drag race? Can't you see those dragons

Negative bearing swell
Dragons fly they symbolize in myth and saga breathing fire
Look up there's one flying higher
Faster than the SCC
Is science hiding witchery?

Grande Trex fans throughout the universe are well informed 
on the risks pilots take in entering this race, i.e. 
re-entry into some of the alien atmospheres is tricky business 
which can cause a craft to implode, explode, melt, 
lose automatic structure, etc., while en route. 
The craft are scheduled to surface launch 0700.5100 
Greenwich time and are assembled on one of our very own stars, 
Neutron Einstar EV 9. 
The excitement is at a fevered pitch as the countdown approaches zero. 
These hypersonic inertial transition ships 
can calculate the negligible quantity of spherical differential for tight orbit, 
are sonar-radar balanced and translate windage occurrence, 
offset verniers, retrieve, execute prepare, 
delay code and report astrogational error in a micro-second. 
Naturally these specialized craft are equipped with apparatus capable 
of highly sensitive maneuverability. 
They can dive, sweep, run random parallel paths, 
alternate axes, circumnavigate for rapid survey, spin, 
count milibaricly while simultaneously displaying an accurate diagram grid 
for safety measures, not to mention the quanta limitation fixtures for sea level, 
ground level, level off, and hover bearings. 
We have retained as an added feature to stimulate more thrills, 
the computer over-ride for a three and one half hours to two gens during 
which pilots and co-pilots manually control free-fall, latitude, 
longitude, protact gravity, revise dimensional equations, 
run programme checks, submerge in the wild oceans of Jonrin 22, 
to photograph as much territory as they can in addition 
to the requisite three thousand automatic shots. 
The postulate for mischance runs high but not as high as the tension 
and competitive spirit right here on Earth and all over 
the 4 galaxies represented in this Seventh Grande Trex.

And my heart was stuck in this emptiness zone

(I could not start)

At the rifle range
(She left me so hot)
At the rifle range

Like a victim of truce I was strung on a noose
Cracking at the news of a prey let loose
I turned around to stare at the face she would wear
And I ran through the gallows, her heart was down there

At the rifle range

At the rifle range

At the rifle range
(I heard a shot)
At the rifle range

With visions of acid, how I wish they bled
The drumming's of fear 'cause they're getting so near
And I think of a lion who was devoured down there

They weren't in a hurry
They planned a lovely honeymoon
Sue had a brand new Chevy

Only 30 payments due
They had outstanding tickets
They had no car insurance
But they had lots of things to do

They were getting organized
They had their plans all finalized
The date was set for Saturday
Susie and Jeffrey, they're gonna get married
They're going for a blood test

What if I don't pass my blood test?
What about our marriage licence?
What if I can't be deprogrammed?

Don't act like it's your last chance
We could have fun at the Spahn Ranch
It's not like Gordon Avenue

He drove into a wall
Don't get excited, now don't shout
I'll scratch your eyes out
Now we can't have our honeymoon

Don't touch she's my fiance
Say, but I like the way you play
An autograph from Orson Welles
I'm a fan, here's my record
(It's one we can't get programmed)
We want to give to all of you

They had a little argument
Sue took her foot off the brake
He drove the car into a wall

Took a little fall and now you wanna end it all

Who's gonna love me if I liquidate and drown me?

If I go with you my folks'll get uptight

The nights are phosphorescent
And the days are beautiful and bright
Until whispering mist it comes falling down on me

Oh there's fire burning
Looking for the magic
In the night time all this
Brings the magic back to me
I'm looking for the magic in the places I remember it to be

It's in the night time alleys
Winding through my deepest memory
And just one simple thought brings the magic back to me

And just one simple thought brings the magic back to me",Magic (Asadoya Yunta),2004

I was always better in the multitude
But now I like it up here all alone in my ivory tower

I watch it all through a telescope

I get so bored with his shtick and his mini-minute dick

Like your dirty thoughts, like your Cream of Wheat

Never may be great, level down and read 'em

What kind of a name is that
Shooting past me on the turnpike
Should have told you to take a hike
But there was something
I don't know what

That I guess I kind of like, that nasty attitude
Mediterranean lastitude
I guess you did give me a rush
Yeah you gave me a thrill
Felt so hot and flushed
I even had to take a pill
And your pattern yeah your method yeah
The way you deliver long and slow
The way you get your percussion going
Going strong, and it's my turn to be blowing

Yeah singing my song
You think you know me
Think again
Who's your friend
Who put this freak flag in the mail
Why you sending me this pig tail
You back in Jail
I got your post card saying
How it is in that pen your in
Signed don't forget me, lot's of love from adrenaline

Give it a rest, give it a rest
You got one dimension pure pretension
Cross the river start to shiver
Over to the big smoke, and it's no joke
I told you one more word from you
About Jersey and your dead

You can read my hand, I've got no defence

Coming into contact with outer entities
We could entertain each one with our theosophies

Blondie Chaplin,"So many years ago but I remember
A distant sunset on the open sea
Fascinated by the sailing ships
On a crimson shore that seemed to call out to me

I still can feel the hope that fills my heart
I still can taste the ocean breeze (Sail away)

As I sail away to the farthest reaches
Follow the sun to the white sand beaches
I only know what the west wind teaches
Won't you sail away with me?

(Sail away) Made a wish upon a falling star
(Sail away) Never thought that we would get this far (Sail away)
I won't be lonely you can be my only
Won't you sail away with me?

For a while I almost gave up dreaming
But still this image stayed alive in my soul
While I was working trying to make a living
My so-called life was spinning out of control

Summer wind was blowing through my head
The endless current of my dreams (Sail away)

As I sail away to the farthest reaches
Follow the sun to the white sand beaches
I only know what the west wind teaches
Won't you sail away with me? (Sail away)

Sail away to a land without time
Drink my water from a shell that I find
I won't be lonely you can be my only
Won't you sail away with me?

Oh, let me take you there to another land
Don't expect the world to understand (Sail away)

We can sail away while we still have time
There's a million places that I have in mind
As we cast our fate to the open sea
Sail away with me

Never thought that we would get this far
Try and imagine how our life would be
If you could sail away with me

Is it fate?

Why I exist

Do we live again?
Show me, show me truth, is there hope?
Hope to ever break free

I'll know what to do
I won't be missed

Will my rapture really fade?

It feeds me

And still you play your games
But you hair looks great
And your sound is so stridently tame.

I searched for something pure
In a world of shit,
I thought I found some hope;
A place to speak some truth
A place to share some pain;
A place to rage against a world that is
Cleary insane. Ha, ha !

What a sucker, I believed in the lie.

Another tired joke.

And fashion here reigns
One more American game for all the

Blood or Whiskey,"I was walking out the road when I heard the noise behind me
And I saw them standing there one two three
And I knew that I was shagged I did not think they could find me
And the hate was on their faces plain to see
Well it's great to see you lads
It's a long time since I robbed you
Did you miss the hundred pounds I took that day
And I reached inside my coat and I read them my prescription
And I laughed at how they turned and ran away
These are the things I will always remember
They have seen me through hatred and pain
They kept me warm in the dark of December
When the light has gone they still remain
It was long so long ago on a stormy night she left me
At the time it seemed so brutal and so tough
I saw her the other day with her husband and ten kids
And I thought she had turned out to be sorta rough
One fine day when I was young and I left home for the first time
And it felt as if my life had begun
My old father grabbed my hand I can still recall his words
He said be sure to never trust a hippy son
When the sun goes down I won't surrender to despair and moan
I will sustain it anytime of year June or September
When the light has gone they still remain.",Always Remember,1996

Feminism is Da Brat, Missy Elliot, Lil Kim, and Angie Martinez on the “Not Tonight” track
Feminism says as a woman in my arena you are not my competition
As a woman in my arena your light doesn’t make mine any dimmer
Dear Missy
I did not grow up to be you
But I did grow up to be me
And to be in love with who this woman is
To be a woman playing a man’s game
And not be apologetic about any of it
If you ask me why representation is important
I will tell you that on the days I don’t feel pretty
I hear the sweet voice of Missy singing to me
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don’t stop, get it till your clothes get wet
I will tell you that right now there are a million black girls
Just waiting to see someone who looks like them",By Ourselves,2016
Blood Orange,"Later because of the fact that we're waiting for the working girls to get there
(And what is it those girls are doing?)
 Well, they're making money for the balls, or they're making their costumes
Their outfits, or you know getting, getting it together like that
(What is their profession?) something like that
At times they do expect sexual favors, but that is between myself and them
So I do not wish to further speak about that
If they do, but at most times ninety-nine percent of the time they don't
Ninety-five percent of the time they don't

If you marry a woman in the suburbs
A regular woman is married to her husband
And she wants him to buy her a washer and dryer set
In order for him to buy that, I'm sure she'd have to 
Go bed with him anyway to give him what he wants
For her to get what she wants
So in the long run, it all ends up the same way

Blood Raw,"I was born 1980 September 3rd
That's the day checks come out and vics gets served
So you know I got the blood of a hustla in my vain
My daddy had 3 brother that all gave me some game
They was raised in the projects I was born in the hood
I was raised on the block my mom did what she could
Always got what I need sometimes I got a lil mo
But I grew up watching g's on the set gettin dough
I made be	's n see's up in to 5th grade
It went to d's n f's 'cause I didn't want to behave
I was the class clown Christopher raise hair
I show my dick to them hoes and I get expelled
Yeah I get punished I was supposed to be inside
I snuck out the back round the school fo lunch time
The police spotted me id break out and run
Make em run behind me that was my way of having fun
Somewhere in 87 might of been 88
I knew of Baby and Slim we was from round the same way
They moved a lot of weight but I ain't gone tell it all *shhh*
I´m a cut this boy short 'cause my moms was involved

You can put it together it was what it wasn't
Nah cakes to be baked but she had cakes in the owen
She told me if I touch it that id fuck it up
If I knew what I know now I would of took it n cut it up
92 roll round that's when it got real
My daddy got set up kidnapped robbed and killed
Cash Money Records was started that same year
That's when my thuggin started I was gettin it how I live
My moma needed help I was outta control
The streets took me under I was on a dead end row
The hood barber stand knew Baby and hit him up
Told him I had skills he needed to peep me up
He did that snatch me him Slim and Fresh was feelin me
Took me to studio from that we made history

In the mid east of that I was doin my thang
And I met this four foot hustla they called him Lil Wayne
That was my lil nigga called my lil brotha
Baby drew a cross between us but I still love him
Universal up to deal we went to get mills
That's when nigga decided to not keep it real
I had a idea I didn't want to believe it
I wouldn't thought of it in a million years he'll do that to Geezy
I had a dope habbit and markie was on my back
So he turned his back but look how I shookback
You know how it go you get up when you fall
The streets all over they rooted for the underdog
I got Kizzle I got Snipe I got Gar on my team
And I got click of niggas ready for war on my team
From Detroit to Atlanta Texas and Nashville
Play if you want and you see how the gat feel

Yeah, it's the DJ Khaled, Khaled, Khaled
I do this for the projects
I got the mothafucking gutta on this track
I got the projects on this one

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can to your target
Nothing can save you know

See you dun push the wrong button
And cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka, it was mine

Time and time
They get me out the tandem
Me are da true, I traded mine in
For caveman king

You don't wanna fuck with
The Southside Gotcha boys
Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas
Y'all some boxy boys

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the street life

Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top, east to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled, nigga we the best

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Yo, bdah, bdah, bdah
Khaled, go let me see 'em
Hand me the fucking clever
'Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the evil Kinevel people
Who try to stunt

Call me Danny Glover
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel
Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Nothing can save you now

Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon' shoot a hundred rounds
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old Chevy and Figaro
Blood shed apart my feet

And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me, I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye

Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah
It's the final warning

Khaled, these niggas talking
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin'
I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin

'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors
Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake
I'ma tell you once don't be scared of the Dre

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who your calling
Nothing can save you now

I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that
And it ain't gon' take all day
We know where you live at

I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep 'em mad shawty
That's how we kill 'em babies
Holla Khaled, and tell him I'm on the way now
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town

Look at me it's shawty
So bossy, and I don't feel like that
Can't stop me now, now, now
You see what's happening?
Big shit dun popped off
I'm the best nigga, you can ask Khaled
I'm the best nigga

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you're calling

And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose

And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, ""Just look behind""

Tellin' your daughter it was him who was sent
I saw him down there in a long white gown
Takin' sinners and holdin' them down

John, John, won't you wash 'em away?
Make us ready for the judgement day
Take us down and hold us under
Make the Heavens roar with thunder, now

The waters are dirty and the reason is
Holy John had to wash away our sins
Yes he did

He came to town, two weeks ago
Didn't take long before everyone did know
Down to the riverside, they all did flock
And watch him stand upon the rock
I saw him down there in a long white gown
Takin' sinners and holdin' them down

John, John, won't you wash 'em away?
Make us ready for the judgement day
Take us down and hold us under
Make the Heavens roar with thunder, now

The waters are dirty and the reason is
Holy John had to wash away our sins
Oh yes he did

Ooh can't you see that the water's dirty
And everybody knows that the reason is
Holy John has to wash away, wash away
Wash away everybody's sins

To bestow great Death upon sheep

Beheaded, your prophet will lie before his feet
On torment your soul will be forevermore

As lightning strikes before you
Forced down to kneel before him

Oh, the famine of gods word will drain you in vain
You'll gasp for mercy

Beheaded, your prophet will lie before his feet

Exposed to the heat

I see your jealousy as you're watching (I see you watching)
You're watching (It's all good)
It's kinda sexy to me (I love it)
How you're watching, you're watching
I see your face (I see your face)
You want to touch it (You want to touch it)
Come to my place (Come to the crib)
And let's discuss it (Let's chop it up)
Tonight you'll be (Tonight you goin' be a superstar, baby)
A superstar
Come, let me sign you up (Let's get into it)

Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Action! (You need that)

Oh, it's the lights (You're blinded by the)
Satisfaction (You need that)
Hollywood (uh, uh, uh, uh, c'mon)

Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high rise
I hide behind my shades because the fame is blindin' my eyes
My god, I know how Ozzy Oz must have felt when he was Oz hot
As I have got, I have got to make this stop
People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart
It'll change those 'cause if they had love for you into strangers
When the fame starts, it's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when a train departs
Stranger things have happened
Rappin', stackin' platinum plaques
Born in Brooklyn, got a place in Manhattan
Goin' back to Brooklyn to escape the madness
When your friends is Chris and Gwyneth
When your girl is more famous than Juventus
Then it's time to get all your windows tinted
Keep your eyes squinted, it's goin' flash any minute
The music biz is like musical chairs
It's about where you stand when the music stop spinnin'

The ride of your life, but you gotta keep them hits up
Can't put your guard down, gotta keep your mitts up
Take a sip, sir, it's so intoxicating ain't it?
Try not to get jaded
Hollywood's been good to ya
Startin' to feel like buzz to ya
Don't lie, go on fly, you're addicted to the light
Without the fame, how you gon' survive?
It's like bein' on heroin, you so high

And everybody's warning you about it (I tried to tell you)
And once you taste it you can't live without it (It's addicting)
Not 'cause you choose to not live without it (you sure you want this, baby?)
It's now a part of you, it's now a part of you (It's a part of you)

Jimmy Morrison, all of them ended by Hollywood

You're not the real thing baby you're parkay you're not butter
Gonna have to get you home and lube you up with fluff-n-nutter
Scope it scope it baby looking so fit

Playing games and laying dames you know I know you know it
Quick to get the condom you know the jimmy fits too snug
Lean you against the fire place and ride you on the bear skin rug
Chow down my ding dong come and sing along

Slip a grip around my tip and then you'll be my kling-on

Coo coo ca choo now what ya gonna do
Butter up butter cup did ya really think
It would really last that long
My attention span hutches and when

You wake up you know that I'll be gone
Cocoa butter beach blonde wearing that thin thong
You know I got a thing for you it's only an inch long
Picking up your signals like you're a tv station

I'm looking for the channel to have immoral applications
Looking so fine cosmo behind
Fermentation of time like reunite wine
Well I'm bubbling up and steaming like an active volcano

I think I clogged up all your pipes better get yourself some draino
I get annoyed cause I can't avoid
Baby sounding like a mongoloid
I gots the skills to keep ya busy all night

If you do not bite I hope you blow like dynamite
Happy thanksgiving would you like a little white meat?
I'll stuff my butterballs then you can eat

A text of intricate words and other spoken effects
Like a preacher on the mount teaching things he doesn't follow
When you tried to hit the brake but pushed on the throttle
Mr. Goody Two Shoes picture the scenario
Your girl blew me as I blew your stereo
And I gots more bass than a baseball diamond
Don't put me on your chalkboard cause I'm not down with Simon
Sonic boom in your room assume you're not there
Booty licken' nugget picken' with your dad downstairs

You can call it big-boned, I prefer to call it gut
Your Buddha your Shamu your Jabba the fuckin' Hutt
You had harpoon scars and your boobies were hairy
I smelt tuna melt but I wasn't gonna worry
It was three a.m. and I wasn't gettin' squat
So I rolled you up in flour and aimed it for the wet spot
I was buttering rolls like a soup kitchen Christian
Then it hit me something bit me while my little rod was fishin'
I was deep sea fishing I took a fat chance
But how was I supposed to know that jabberjaws 
Lived in your pants 
At that junction I came to realize
That only Frank Purdue likes thighs that size
Fatty fatty boom ba latty I gotta lament

I just wish I was queer so I could get chicks
Chicks dig guys that are
Queer guys that don't dig

Chicks that don't dig guys like me
See I'm not queer I'm too ugly
But if I were handsome just imagine how great it would be
Incognito as gay though but not actually that way though pseudo homo

Phony
Maybe it's a stupid theory or maybe just stupidity
But if I was a queerbee in the fashion industry
Scoring with a super model would be easy

'Cause 'super model' means voluptuous but is also is synonymous with
'Super dumb'
Ya see I'd be a good listener so she'd treat me like a sister and soon

No I'm not Princess Di and I don't want to be a queen

Anyway if I were gay I'd have to change my name to Dirk or Lewis
Hang out with my mom's hair stylist his name is Kip he's got a lisp he

And wear my mother's lingerie learn the songs of Broadway
And appreciate Depeche Mode and avant garde ballet

Or where a fish net shirt by Chams with my Sergio Valenti jeans
And my mirror never lies but it always verifies

And yea I took my mom to the prom but hey she asked me first

But at least this time I didn't find my date in the back of a hearse
About as popular with the girls with Englebert Humperdink
And that might be 'cause everybody calls me Shrinky Dink

He says live life at Benny Hill freak out speed
Not a quote of what he wrote but a paraphrase
Make it up as you go Keyser Soze
Highlights yes but don't underline 'em
Just live for N.O.W. like Gloria Hudson
Life is like Marion Barry
It's not all it's cracked up to be
Like Fred Sanford when the big one comes
Find the meaning of life is there is none
It's twenty-four hours when you call it a day
Be Frank and say ""I Did It My Way""
Don't give a flying nun no don't give
Just have more fun than a well-oiled midget
If life were picture perfect you could frame it
But the world is a diaper so let someone else change it

Life is an aimless drive that ya take alone
Might as well enjoy the ride take the long way home

All born equal unless you're Canadian
Then halfway through decay like Uranium
You define what's death-defying
Get the most out of life or at the least die trying
Are you Evil Knievel jumping a train?
Or running with scissors like Frasier Crane?
Have really good times do really bad things
'Cause the show ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
Like Elton John with his candle in the wind
It's hard to blow out a flame as big as him
But we've all got to Wang Chung with the Grim Reaper
Whether you're Einstein whether you're Beaker
Death is certain so it's definitely worth flirtin'
Don't expect a bright light no just curtains
Life is like a penis most people don't know it
But most people suck so they usually blow it

Won't have to take her skinny ass out to a fancy dinner

No I can't be tied down with a girl that wants me tied up

With the thrill of a kill vengefully the engine will
Roar forth steer the dead leave forced
Driven by fear shift gears veer towards
The foolishly equipped swift these
Failed bids breathed taillights from the crypt
Reflect upon the way beyond redemption
Let the necronometer beckon for the destined
Blessed when first lent sin then condemned to bear the burden
Of this curse the consequence of which can never be averted
Each tormented attempt that is made in vain
To evade this debt which is certain to be paid
Without question is met with a counterclocked surge
In reverse as if backmasked words of the black mass were
All heard by a clutch engaged

Damned once sam went down to georgia
Speed was forged of the divine salt
Mined from the vaults of flame by the lost
Named as those sought as faults rests beneath
The wrong that was spawned from the tired screech
Of essence halted engulfed in the scent of exhaustion
A false witness with the sensed end is brought
To bended knees when abandoned belief in
The mephistophelian plea for wicked unleashed sends
Heed to reap grim an infernally decreed
Reposession vested in the fallen creed called on to retrieve
Meed with the fueled intention of deprived intervention
The thundered calm that comes from the rattle of descension
Numbs the panicked from a havoc that reeks of oil
Barreling down this mortal coil

Pajama time 
Come here little kiddies, on my lap 
Guess who's back with a brand new rap 
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case 
Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys 
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything, 
But little boys 
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor, 
I'm just psycho 
I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
Good God, dip, do a little slide 
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor 
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go

I dunno where I'm goin' 
All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body 
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah 
Now what's your name girl, what's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind 
Dre aah aah, beer goggles, blind, I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm

All I know is this much, I'm not guilty 
They said save it boy, we got you on tape 
Telling an old lady to ""touch my body"" 
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real tense, no one makes a sound 
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now 
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
Now step back to reality, look it's B.Rabbit, you signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba

Bloodlet,"I feel it enter my soul. Paranoid obsession won't let him leave home. 'Cause he's seen her face in the mirror, all tattered and torn. Glass bottom words won't leave her alone. 'Cause she's seen the angel that kills her. Can't see, don't know that the words are creation. Hell bent on destruction and lies. Fear's child sells him theory that hope is alive... This conflict lies in the back pocket of an unnamed angel. Still searching for the sign that completes the circle of it's life. Don't know what it finds will define it's life from the bottom of it's soul. Is your friend OK? Look like the lonely one who wants things to change. But things, they change to fast. Held in contempt of the righteous. He believes in serrated words. Left undisturbed will haunt him forever.

Heaven sent, chosen few. Stealing the cracks below a screaming trumpet. Four heads on six wings that blow the four winds as the seventh trumpet sounds. I told that man what you had said and he looked at me and lied. Cried and closed his eyes, died and drew the line. Time goes as I go and I go high. His deed warms me. This darkness caresses me again. The sloppy image of painted truth rides through the heart of its maker. This man, his ability etched. Sports the hemorrhage from her dead socket. Now we can't wake him. Through holes in walls these angels walk. Hole in his soul this demon breathes. Knows in his heart, the seraphim will fall. When the winds die will the treason still bleed. Who's left holding the smoking gun... I am. Cold whispers help burn this sinners eyes. Pulls him back to birth. I witness the end. True beauty.



",Seraphim,1998
Bloodlet,"Everyday I reach down into the dirt
Hoping to find me a little nugget of gold
But all I got is some worms
Everyday I pull green slime down to my heart
Grab it with both hands and hold until my lungs burn
I think tragedy sleeps at the foot of my bed
Its incessant breathing keeps me awake
Every time I wake up it takes me at least 10 minutes to remember my name
And sometimes I get it wrong
Every time I reach out into the world hoping to find a kindred soul I get burned

And it all becomes a testament to thee
With no return it all means nothing

Seems shadowed
To me

We wield the tools
And by His grace and through the same the service
Is just and true
And still the threat is so real
Removed from His view
Compells me
Makes me praise His name in everything I do
We do as of your will now
Now is the stand
His sacrifice
Showed more compassion than any other man
Pray hard

My weight, just average
And my IQ is like you'd estimate, just average
But evidently he does not agree

Consequently if I seem at sea
It amazes me, it simply amazes me
What he sees in me dazzles me
Dazes me

That I've learned to clip my wings
And soften my ways
These are ordinary things unworthy of praise
Yet he praises my

Just knowing I try for him
When so many would
If they could, die for him

And nothing much fazes me
But to see me in his eyes
It just amazes me

It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me

But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books

And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds

And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me

And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''

I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you

Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep

You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu

But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own

Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best

Blossom Dearie,"Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me.",The Physician,1960
