Vinnie Colaiuta,"So ya
Thought ya
Might like to
Go to the show.
To feel that warm thrill of confusion,
That space cadet glow.
I've got some bad news for you sunshine,
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you folks really stand.

Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall!
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me,
Get him up against the wall!
That one looks Jewish!
And that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint,
And another with spots!
If I had my way,
I'd have all of you shot!",In the Flesh,2014
Vinnie Cutro & New York City Soundscape,"In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me

Vinnie Moore,"Fly into the rising sun,
Faces, smiling everyone
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition
I feel it in my heart

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

Talk about her like a Queen
Dancing in a Eastern Dream
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river
That carries me away

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

But I'm at home and I just don't belong 

So far away from the garden we love
She is what moves in the soul of a dove
Soon I shall see just how black was my night
When we're alone in Her City of light

Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire
I get high

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me
",Woman from Tokyo,1995
Vinnie Moore,"Black night is not right,
I don't feel so bright,
I don't care to sit tight.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

I don't need a dark tree,
I don't want a rough sea,
I can't feel, I can't see.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

Black night, black night,
I don't need black night,
I can't see dark night.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.",Black Night,1997
Vinnie Moore,"Just a few roots, replanted. 

Good Golly, said little Miss Molly
When she was rockin' in the house of blue light
Tutti Frutti was oh so rooty
When she was rockin' to the east and west
Lucille was oh so real
When she didn't do her daddies will
Come on baby, drive me crazy--do it, do it

I'm a speed king you go to hear me sing
I'm a speed king see me fly

Saturday night and I just got paid
Gonna fool about ain't gonna save
Some people gonna rock some people gonna roll
Gonna have a party to save my soul
Hard headed woman and a soft hearted man
They been causing trouble since it all began
Take a little rice take a little beans
Gonna rock and roll down to New Orleans",Speed King,1997
Vinnie Paz,"[Vinnie Paz talking]
Yo, this fuckin' Vinnie Paz baby
Esoteric baby, 7L baby

It's like this, yo, yo, yo

[Vinnie Paz]
This Vinnie Paz let me tell you how I handle my beef
Hands in ya safe, watch how I slang to a beat
And you weak motherfuckas better stand at my feet
'Fore I beat motherfuckas when I handle my heat
So consider this verse here a motherfuckin' bomb threat
Cause I ain't even let out, all of my dogs yet
I ain't even pulled out my four fours yet
I ain't even let out, all of the launch yet
That's why ya plams sweatin', you fake bitch
I'm strong like Iron Mike Tyse in eight six
You fake snitch, you get slashed wid fast razors
Fuckin' wid Paz mean you dead, and that's basics
Slash racist, he'll rob ya parents and go
why'all crazy big wid no skill like ?????? bo
Vinnie Paz bring physical rain
And the only thing why'all feel is physical pain, what

Hook:
We steady blastin, ya city gon' crash in
Ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
See a wack rapper, and start smashin'
""And that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction""

[Esoteric]
I'm like Bill Gates motherfucka
You're like Philbert Grate's younger brother
My rap style's undiscovered
Dames wide like the frame or the Lincoln Navigator
Style just like an aborigine that wrestles alligators
You know the deal crab rappers peel
I give 'em shit that they can feel
My style's like steel
You can stop tanks wid it, rob banks wid it
Plot pranks walk planks block shanks wid it
That's why when I challege you cats you ain't wid it
And that's where the battle is at you can't spit it
Rappers tryna play-che, that'll be the day-che
Pulls a forty-five and ain't just spittin' reggae
Today's pay day, we on some dumber shit
Rip you out the whip throw ya body up the front of it
Put you in check, put my foot to your neck
You lookin' up to Esoteric and I've come to collect

Hook (2x)
[Vinnie Paz]
The Army is back, and we bombin' the track
Armed wid a gat, blood spill onto the DAT
Regardless of that, battery assault wid a mack
And Vinnie Paz a motherfuckin' dog when I rap
You beef wid one of us, we all in ya back
And a muh'fucker like me, put claws on ya back
Stalk you like that, why'all just talk like Grovano
My team, they fuck up more keys than a piano

[Esoteric]
Yo check it, my method on the microphone's murderin'
Blood curdlin', surfacin', the soul purpose still
Circling, in ya shitty deck
I defeat a vet, leave him wreck his breath
watch him bleed to death
Cause I'm the type of rapper that packs to full capacity
Actin' like you packin' a gapper to pull the blast on me
With Vinnie Paz on my side known as Ikon

Bashing ya face, tell ya army, get back to their base
C'mon cousin, that's how we get down
We the only reason that you eat and breath in this town
We beatin' them down
Raise a blade, buck 50
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
Stuck with me, we ain't leaving the game
And keep it dirty cause we never had a reason to change
We keep it the same, start a war with the glock nine
And thug like a mob, and rock mine
So let me speak the truth again
The ancient babylonian's with nubian
You need to watch what you read in your class
'Cause the devil try to have you or repeatin the pass
I'm ready to go to war for Mumia
Fuck George Bush and his war, we gawn see him

Yeah, walk with me now
Yeah, walk with me now
Tryna step into the zone with Vinnie Paz is a
understand that I ain't really fuckin around
Yea... Yea, walk with me now
Live raps crack ya jaw (Live raps crack ya jaw)
Yea, walk with me now

I came down, the shame clown, kickin' my same sound
I'ma reign now, giant fist-splitted James Brown
I'm the poet, who rhymes was quoted
Lines are loaded
Shine decoded the vote and flow and showing signs I wrote it
At a auction, B, style cost some g's
Challangers eyes makes tears like they're forced of these
Percee P, that's me I get nasty
Rock it flashy, pass me the mic at your ass, G
But I make wrecks, tape decks at my apex
Packing latex, and safe sex with chicks and stricken paychecks
Killing ya, fillin' ya with rhymes similar
To bullets in the cylinder of a dillinger spillin' ya brainfat
I'll blast ya later, you be then essays
And be there next day like JFK's assasinator
Nobody, ever win to represent us, never did
Why you had to take us, I take every cent and your hottie

Yea, walk with me now
Yea, walk with me now
Tryna step into the zone with Vinnie Paz is a
Understand that I ain't really fuckin' around

I'm like a dessert eagle when the hammer is cocked back
Anybody holdin' any money should drop that
We shot back, spit a gospel of force
And burn y'll, with my philosophical torch
We're just tryna bring the raw shit
Smoke a L, drink a forty on the block, raw shit
The hardcore shit, for ya'll the dumbed out
Standin' the back of the club and pull the gun out
Everybody run out, the sun out, it's over
I'll take it back to the past like Sankofa

Yea, it's vinnie paz baby. Stoupe the enemy of mankind
It's like a brotherhood, it's all blood
It's all love baby, it's all love

Vinnie Paz,"[Voice-Over]
Once more, it has been done
That in order to save it
You would have to raise the specter again
I am going to tell them the truth
About their ministry of justice
But if we didn't though
It would surely be cause for war!

[Canibus]
Ok its time to get started..
Don't want to but the forces forced me
When it can't category allegory
They translated it for me
You-M-L-O-you-T: Umlaut
That's the reason I bend vowels when I spew from the mouth
Spit threw and out the very grotesque few are best
Burn through vests
Since the university of Budapest
Sitting in a room with a windowless view
Concentrating; looking at you
Freeze frame frozen at the very moment
The wormhole opens
You know Canibus has spoken
The circumference of a third eye so vibrant
To me, Ezekiel's Wheel was just a spare tire
My epithelial genetic fiber was forged in the protoplasmic fires in a black geyser
The explosion can described as a white Iris
When the absolute began, I don't know where I was
I musta just been a piece of micro dust
That's why I the fuck love mics so much
My micro, macro robotic rap flow
The Magna Carta of the entire rap world
Mayflower 2002 Phase 1
Adapt to the press of gravity is laid on my lungs
The theory of communication called cannons
Dissertation with a makeover in camouflage makeup
Light waves bend to the wake of bust
Mics buckle with white knuckles, metacarpals crush
Acid reflux all over your face, you fuck
Grab heart with bare hands,
Squeeze and spray blood
You iller than me? Gimme a call:
W-W-W-N-A-M-I-org
Dear boss,
You mind if I share my thoughts?
Psychotherapy is expensive, can you share my costs?
In a cushioned room with leather doors
Handwriting experts take a look at the letters I draw
Excessive graftedness, there's no space between words
Excessive cross-outs: it must be my nerves
Rhymes that vaporize dis-ablize and destabilize
Pray to God, say Goodbye
Six minutes Vinnie Paz you're on
Lyrically this is the liberty of Liberal Arts

[Chorus]
Canibus: Consume Creatine and Create
CAnibus: Anemometers analyze air intake
CaNibus: The H.N.I.C that narrates

[Vinnie Paz, AKA Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
I'm the god of war,
The resurrector of the horror-core
The carnivore, destroying you wasn't hard at all
I started raw, so the haters could see what could happen
I was Allah while the pagans were speaking in Latin
I'm the origin of science and math
I'm the origin of everything you trying to grasp
Been dying to ask if Jedi Mind is the real
Well I'll let you inside my mind and you decide how it feel
I'm dying to kill
And bring to you apocalypse
I start a lot beef with lots of guns and lots of clips
Fuck the head, I'm aimin right for your esophagus
Hang you from a hook then drink the blood your body drips
I got the power of the lead a fucking shotty spits
And leave you weaker than the mafia that's Gotti-less
With Canibus: get deep like psychoanalysts
Vinne Paz the fucking Hand-to-Fist-Philanthropist

What? Its fucking Vinnie Paz daddy
Yeah Jedi Mind baby
(For the people of the world)
Canibus baby
Let it now be noted

What's the fucking deal?

That here in our decision
This is what we stand for
Justice, Truth and the value of a single human being

These motherfuckers they're controlling us now
But no one's talking about it, made us modern day slaves

Head in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the grave
By then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up
Welcome to the end of days

Everybody enslaved, only some are aware
That the government releasing poison in the air
That's the reason I collect so many guns in my lair
I ain't never caught slipping, never underprepared
Yeah, The Shaitan army, they just break it proudly
George Bush the grandson of Aleister Crowley
They want you to believe the lie that the enemy Saudi
The enemy ain't Saudi, the enemy around me
There's fluoride in the water but nobody know that
It's also a prominent ingredient in Prozac (For real?)
How could any government bestow that?
A proud people who believe in political throwback
That's not all that I'm here to present you
I know about the black pope in Solomon's Temple
Yeah, about the Vatican assassins and how they will get you
And how they cloned Barack Hussein Obama in a test tube

And you know that that's the information that they suppress and devour
Who you think the motherfuckers that crashed in the tower?
Who you think that made it turn into ash in an hour?
The same ones that invaded Jerome
The ones that never told you about the skeletons on the moon
Yeah, the ones that poison all the food you consume
The ones that never told you about Mount Vesuvius Tomb
The Bird Flu is a lie, the Swine Flu is a lie
Why would that even come as a surprise?
Yeah, the Polio vaccine made you die
It caused cancer and it cost a lot of people their lives
Do y'all know about Bohemian Grove?
How the world leader sacrificing children in robes?
Lucifer is God in the public school system
I suggest you open up your ears and you listen

It's like we all know what's going down

I’m a bull in a china shop, watch how the uzi spit
Who we with, bros with hammers and they like too legit
I ain’t got any time for your foolishness
Raw raps from the same place where the sits
He the mo’fucker always sippin’ goose and shit
Stomp a rapper out, Timberland boots and shit
The left hand is what I give you the with
The right hand is where I write all of the ruthless shit
Survival of the fit or my little boozy shit
My hands are made of stone cut from that Madusa shit
Big gold chains, we was on that shit
Still roll with the kids I stole the Gucci with
I punch you dead in the face so fuck the music shit
The guns command though, Hollywood movie shit
Y’all aware y’all on some Lollapalooza shit
Let the beard grow
Y’all are scared when I step inside the booth and shit
Cuttin’ mo’fuckers cell roll on some sushi shit
Y’all are cowards, y’all’ll only talk on computer shit
This a Haitian ritual, I’m on my voodoo shit

Find out who’s the realest (Vinnie)
Rock and not quit
What I’ma hit you with
You motherfuckers better duck

Death before dishonor, [?] blood y’all are fake
I let the 4.5 blocka blocka while I was [?]
Dead Sea overlook the view from inside a grave
The dictionary definition of dominate
Y’all weak Germantown
Fat bull, but my pockets never out of shape
You a bitch, security guard lock the gates
The Louis Vuitton bootleg, Prada fake
I’m tryin’ to make the same money that Madonna make
Eyes never lie, I’m surprised that you not with
Rhymes and one tape, record an album in an hour’s
You a pile of waste, I see a sucker and salivate
Cutting motherfuckers of, time to consolidate
A thousand pounds of weight’ll force your heart to
It’s Armageddon for you motherfuckers, lock the date
Any bitch I meet means that I’ma copulate
My revolution will be met with Peter Tosh’s fate
That’s the reason that the God is tryin’ to populate

Brah",The Oracle,2012
Vinnie Paz,"I walk in the Pentagon with a blood soaked hatchet
Leave the president's nose shattered
Stretch his neck like go gadget, and toe tag it

You a stone cold faggot
I hold the chrome in a jacket
Go toe to toe with a savage
And roll you over a cactus

Funeral's are closed caskets, coke addicts
Chrome ratches, the whole package
I'll beat Moses on the head with them stone tablets

I killed Kennedy, brains blown all over Onassis
I'll hold my own with the axes
And turn the pope into ashes

Designed frequency, I'm a holy divine lyrical deity
Even atheists and heathens and non-believers believe in me
The punk-ass devil was born soft
I'll piledrive you like Paul Orndorff
Steal his pitchfork and rip his horns off
I'm the born force

Sick fuck, I'll skin you alive and then carry the bones
Load the ruger up and shoot you up like I'm Marion Jones

Guinea that carry the throne
Gimme, it's that or be stoned
Trinity, that'll be home

We bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck

New jack pussy, young rappers think their rapping is good
Young rappers get treated like fetuses in planned parenthood
This ain't no Mickey Mouse, zip-a-dee-doo-dah Disney
It's the claws of a grizzly
It ain't Wayne and Drizzy, it's Thorburn and Vinnie

And R.A., that’s my brother there, anyone who unaware
I'mma leave em stumbling as if they had a ton of beer
I'm from Philly, it ain't a sucker to ever come from here
You a pussy, you see confrontation and you run from there

What kind of dirty bitch did your daddy put his sperm in?
Kiddie porn web searchin', pervert jerkin, you serpents is Satan's servants

You get slain for certain if you put your faith inside of Satan serpents
Stick the blade in you while I embrace you like my favorite person

Stay in Hell burning, slaves with chains on your brain like a turban
I make Abel kill Cain and get bible pages reversin', brains burstin'

It takes a taste of bourbon for me to rape a virgin
And Vinnie deal with mathematics like an Asian person

We bout to spaz, R.A.Annotate and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck

Hands like Roberto Durán, it's the flight 103 Pan Am
It's the Gulf War between Iraq and Iran
Treat you like Indians I'm snatching your land
I'm more dapper than Dan, I'm Rakim I master the plan
I bring the roots without having a band

Without having a fan I coulda never took care of my fam
I coulda never done all the tours on the shores of Japan

Still an apostle from Sham, still I'm like God in Sudan

Vinnie Paz,"Ayo, hoes holler hallelujah, how I maneuver
Passenger's side with Ruger, kinda sewer
My mind is a sewer, infested with garbage
Crime, rhyming and music, disrespecting the market
Like a Mexican martyr, boy, I do it to death
Nothing left with the carcass, squeeze a Tec on the target
Aim the wreck at your artist, flames, a mess on the carpet
Then hit everything except for the daughter
Cat burglar to a merciful murderer
Certainly not with the circus, they trying serve
I'm either too hood for my own good
Or I'm too good for my own hood
Cold is the climate in the hearse
Where they found me in the dirt, too demonic for the church
I body any and everybody until the day they put my body in the earth
This is ghetto gossip while I work

Live from Venice, the something menace
Put me in the Guinness for raising hell up for all the sinners
High as tinters, violinists, I string them all along
Tied to the flow like water skis in the red ocean
Hang like an apostrophe, any MC no Qu'ran
I prayed to the God, then prayed on their bodies all at once
Sun setting, never regretting the day's events are gone
Forgive me for my sins, with everything that I ?
Sweaty, sick as spaghetti, my noodle machete sharp
To niggas that wanna spark, I pray for you, hallelujah
Quick as a cougar when I maneuver
You spit maneuver, eating Peruvian in my rishwa pen
Pretty Julia Robinson, I'm a woman robbing you
Of your coolness, part of the reach like the stewardess
Underground like the sewage is, who fucking with the kid?
Did this show evidence?
International, such an animal, yeah I really been
Killing on the daily, you niggas crazy and asterisk
Star, follow me you could probably find the main jar
I been major, it's Rapsody, boy

I don't trust the score, I've been baffled by judges' cards before
Never leave it in their hands, that's the art of war
I learned the proper punching power started from the floor
Ground up, renovate, a wall is just another door
Resurrected like the phoenix, blazing every stage
Spread my wings and fly, but gravity's a heavy cage
Hellfire and heaven's rage on every page
Revelation propaganda, maybe it's the seven plagues
Aiming at the tower, same commercial, different station
They stuck on training wheels and tracing paper, vapor chasing
I'm half amazing, a quarter sinner, a quarter savior
Fascinated, Rakaa seen the wretched paint the righteous painting
My travel agent's favorite, preacher's son, no sign of fading
The lights weaponized, fireworks at night displaying
The blazing arrows fly, a thousand points of light just raining
Careful when you're in the quarters, chariots are hydroplaning

Fucker, we from the hundreds now
Kill a fuck assumption, we bucking off or we ducking down
Couple blocks away from the form, check how we run this town
You fuckers get this work in this bun, check my circumference now
Circle wasn't set stretching, yoga flame
Hottest rapper in the streets and they don't even know his name
Kept the dope, boy, and I ain't even need a golden chain
I'm focused, man, you shooting like a rookie that don't know his range
Smoking, watch me go insane, opus and the Novocaine
Shit was once an open game, we got it by a rope and chain
Losing all control of wild paintings in my broken brain
I don't think you get it, scrap me down for anything you niggas sending at me
Young niggas flexing, mean mugs but trigger happy
I'm getting high, I don't ever let a minute pass me
I'm feeling famished, bitch, I'm sick of fasting
About that action, we can get it cracking
Never find shit to match

I caught a body, they called it a verse
Called the cops, I caught the life, they calling a hearse
Pain is easy in reverse, I think pleasure hurts
The first rule is win, the second's don't forget the first
I think the worst now behind us
Hello first-timers, it's welcome to one-liners
Question anything against the center of alignment
This rock ain't a diamond until it's polished up and shining
Decide to ride the retro minutes to the summit's peak
Others fall trying to climb it because their stomach weak
When we climbing in the summer heat
They throwing shade against the team when the others meet
Despite the ?
After this drops, nothing’s best kept but nothing’s secret
If nothing’s nothing, then what the fuck is getting even?
Just an odd man out, another duck in season
What’s yours is yours, what’s mines is mines
It seems as simple as it simply rhymes
I keep the simpleton spit in all the sympathy lines
I mean it’s Craig G rap came on symphony shines

Slay the Nazarene, you just fire water, I’m gasoline
It ain't A day in Philly if I don't pass a fiend
It’s blood everywhere, similar assassins seem
Purify the water, correlate the tour to a maccabee
You think that you could box a Vinnie? 
Dummy, that’s obscene
The nine milli, silly, dummy, but the mac is mean
The downstairs wild pretty, but the attic clean
You have unbearable lightness and just a lack of being
You ain’t built to shoot the fire with me, that’s the thing
I’m only after one thing, money, that’s the rings
I’m only after one head, money, that’s the king’s
A rack on a bigger rack and so he have to sing
I got an Ingraham Mac Eleven and it has a beam
And that’s a beautiful love there, it has a gleam
You wasn’t in a platoon, cousin, cause that was Shane
Old school, still loaded the guns with Vaseline

Selling the J dirty boogie, gray hoodie, hit the dougie
Pinky rings on racks of chicken nuggets
Shit’s like shooting fish in a bucket, damn the hummus
I’m in Japan for the summer, land the plane
Or Jamaica, black rain in the forecast
Four-four class, open a stolen Accord door and haul ass
Body disposed by Albanian doorman for four grand, aw man

While you was arguing who was getting the top of the bunk
I was arguing about who getting the Glock or the pump
Can train paratrooper maneuvers, watch me swoop in
And have these bitches dribbling my balls like Sheryl Swoope's friends
(Oh yeah we balling mayne)
But that's only the start
I play the Master P role, you play Lil' Romeo's part
I'm a leader not a follower, gasoline I be gargling
Ready to spit it out in front of a flame and make some carcasses
You shopping in bargain bins, I'm outside parking my Benz
Grenade man, much more than a marketing trend
And if I could I'd shoot napalm bullets
Atomic hollow points before the military even got the joints
Some futuristic shit, sniper rifles with pistol grips
Heat seeking .50 cals with rocket guiding missile tips

Everything's a death threat, rugged like a Bing monster
Lock me up you could throw away the key

Working extra hard, young niggas fucked the game up
Snap back (backpack), nigga we done did that
Kids napping on me only getting niggas kidnapped
Got the game gift wrapped, money looking mummy tight

Vinnie Paz,"""We have to stop thinking that we must have military solutions
To the problems we face in the world""
Yeah
""The solutions that we need are""
Picking up where we left off
""Dealing of sickness, disease, and hunger
Now that’s fundamental
If you want to end terrorism, you have to stop being terrorists
Which is what war is""

They told you World War II was a people’s war
Logic should have told them it was Imperialist war
18 million served in the armed forces
10 million more overseas – that’s enormous
25 million workers paid for war bonds
All of the while people question why the war’s on
There was an undercurrent of reluctance
There were under-publicized signs of resistance
Hitler’s Germany was unspeakable evil
But let’s discuss real quick what we did to people
We opposed the Haitian revolution
We turned Guam, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii into institutions
Pretended to help Cuba win freedom from Spain
This country’s built on the blood of other people’s pain
Blacks is looking at anti-Semitism in Germany
And saw the situation here was mirroring it perfectly
We appeased Hitler all throughout the '30s
Only years later we pretended we was worried
Roosevelt was hesitant to be gritty
And caused a resolution to be buried in committee

The main interest was never to stop fascism
But advancing Imperialist interests of that prism
Roosevelt ain’t care about oppression of the Jews
The power was the priority, I’m telling you the truth
Hitler not the reason that we entered the land
Roosevelt was mad that we got hit by Japan
Historians will tell you he provoked that shit
He told lies in attempts to sugar coat that shit
In ‘45 troops were jammed onto the Queen Mary
The blacks were stowed down in the depths of the same ferry
See there’s a parallel you have to understand
That they wanted them to fight but wouldn’t treat them like a man
Industrial mobilization had a few divided
The economic royalists denounced and derided
The irony of victory was heavily a price
The war ended, 3 million men was in strike
There’s no peace in a world of capitalism
Nazi eugenics economic rationalism
The lesson was that war solved problems of control
Regardless if it causes any problems for the soul

The black revolt in the '50s came as a surprise
It shouldn’t have after we took so many of their lives
You can’t erase the memory of an oppressed people
Reparation doesn’t make it any less evil
Some black folks joined the Communist party
Richard Wright spoke of disillusionment with the body
The party was accused of exploiting black people
Angelo Herndon felt everything was equal
He was arrested they convicted for insurrection
How the fuck it’s insurrection I call it dissension
Gave him 5 years when all he wanted was protection
There was other black men that made the same connection
Benjamin Davis defended Herndon as a savior
Then Paul Robeson; he only magnified the danger
Harry Truman had to deal with the militant mood
But how the fuck that gonna work when he a racist too?
In ’54 they said they ended segregation
10 years later no changes
Revolt was always minutes away about to bust
Rosa Parks refused the black section of the bus

The freedom riders were spreading across the nation
They went to jail for marching and fighting discrimination
Fbi stood by, Justice Department stood by
While civil rights workers were beaten, they just stood by
3 civil rights workers, 2 black and 1 white
Arrested in Philadelphia, Mississippi one night
They were released, beaten with chains and shot to death
There were arrests made but it was not confessed
The national government remained silent
The president wouldn’t defend blacks against violence
Civil rights laws were passed but they were fraud
Equality was enforced poorly or was ignored
Martin Luther King’s speech floored whoever heard it
5 years later he was targeted and murdered
In ’65 the Watts Riots burned into the streets
The black man would no longer turn the other cheek
The Black Panther Party scared Nixon
But that did nothing to change his position
A new black consciousness was born and still alive
And that came from the will to survive

This is the part where I would talk about Vietnam
But me and Rugged Man we already made a song
By the '70s distrust had spread across the nation
Basic discontent political alienation
55,000 died in the war of moral shame
And then Watergate was added to the hall of pain
The Watergate burglaries was rather complicated
But in the end mostly all of them exonerated
Nixon had CIA a G Gordon Liddy
Lie about the Democratic National Committee
But eventually they all flipped on him
And told the Senate that they had a lot of shit on him
After that it was a swift and a sudden fall
Nixon resigned before they could impeach the ball
They got rid of Nixon but they kept the system
His foreign policy still remains in position
Corporate interests still remained in position
His closest advisors remain in position
Vietnam recession and unrest
All adds up to a motherfucking mess

After Watergate and Vietnam
There was a deep economic insecurity in this world of ours
Environmental deterioration took its toll
A cultural violence upon the families took its toll
Problems couldn’t be solved without bold changes
But no major party candidates proposed changes
American political tradition held fast
Urban communities turning into hell fast
Black folks are bitterly disappointed with Carter
Opposed federal aid the poor people didn’t bother
Reagan got elected and he built a military up
A trillion dollars later
And this motherfucker dummy up
He cut benefits for the poor to get the money up
Social security, disability went belly up
Unemployment grew in the Reagan years
30 million people unemployed in the Reagan years
Welfare became an object of attack
Especially if you was latino or you was black
I’m just scratching the surface of what was wrong
We’ll pick the conversation up in the next song

To be continued
You can’t be neutral on a moving train
I told y’all before
You can’t believe everything that your teacher tell you
Who is your teacher?
Your teacher just learned what they was taught
How do you know what they was taught was correct?
Y'kna mean?
Dig into the real history of this country
And the fact that it was built on blood
We gonna go around for a third time
But for now I’m just blessing y’all with this one
A continuation of the first
You can’t be neutral on a moving train

Vinny Fazzari,"Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to th tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,

Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Everyone I know is sure it shines for you,
Even in my dreams

I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems
I've found a paradise,
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,

It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one,
When other lovers are gone we'll live on,
We'll live on.

Can you feel when I'm holding you near
All the things that I do?

And I'm off'in you while you sleep
And you talking but it's so cheap
And I'm popular for a reason
I got a pool but it's sharks swimmin in the deep end
Don't get much sleep, two minutes and get a dream in
Is all you need
It's crazy
The colony was lost at sea getting wavy
The rawest rapper
Baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn
I'm sending shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope
We holier than all of Jesus' kids
But we speaking in heathens
And all of these Even Stevens
Who don't need a reason
Just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleepin
Cheeba gon' keep me dreaming
I'm faded
Been in Cali a lil too long it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm instagram camera shy
Samurais
Fucking up a Jerm beat
Teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
The sound amplified screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom ride
My pockets fat I'm still looking for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation we could pantomime
Girl you could come a little closer put your hand in mine
This life a prison it's time to set you free
Watching movies in silence describing what I see

Vinny Raniolo,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2015

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

Vinson Valega,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2001
Vinson Valega,"Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart 

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart 

I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion 

Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart 

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart 

I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love's glory

Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart",Send One Your Love,2001

Without a song the road would never bend

A man is born but he's no good no-how
Without a song

I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul

That lived within the heart of me

Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Even told the golden daffodils

I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

After it brought my lover near

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

[story about the memory artist Giordano Bruno]

THROUGH THE LABYRINTH OF THE MIND.

You built all memories on a framework
Of the zodiac and other known structures,
Every thought was linked to a special picture.
You stigmatized their keenness and location
On a deep and shrouded level. Remembering, controlling
Was the way to higher knowledge.

In the nature you saw the outlines of an universal intelligence,
Every process a reflecting mirror. Symbols meant to trigger
The shadow of the ideas in the maze of recollection.
A vortex of information reigned inside
And found its way,
THROUGH THE LABYRINTH OF THE MIND.
With self-hypnosis you put it in
A dynamic pattern,
IN THE LABYRINTH OF THE MIND

No physical laws were rooted in your system
Everything was forces of thoughts and sensations,
Which is streaming through man.

Mist and rain just a condition of unawareness,
And volcanos a state of rage.

A prophet in cosmology, like Copernicus
You saw the stars as suns.
And a warrior who fought with intellctual swords,
With arrow-sharp words.

In the nature you saw the outlines of an universal intelligence,
Every process a reflecting mirror. Symbols meant to trigger
The shadow of the ideas in the maze of recollection.
A vortex of information reigned inside
And found its way,
THROUGH THE LABYRINTH OF THE MIND.
With self-hypnosis you put it in
A dynamic pattern,
IN THE LABYRINTH OF THE MIND

But from silence you can't flee""

Remotely viewing other planes
Using my mind's eye to gaze
As I detect the spiral's stains
In microbes, mountains and every inch of space

Trembling before its divinity
It may be larger than infinity

Vintersorg,"Born in the auroral arc's centre 
With eyes reflecting its sublime ways 
A splendid vision to enter, 
Robed in the semblance of beams in haze 

It enlights his eternal questioning 
Of worlds in space afar 
As the curtain of the known is vanishing 
Under the portrait of a star 

He sees a paradise in every flower 
A solar system in every spark 
He's trying to reach a subliminal power 
And slowly sinks into the dark 

Scenic radiance hides its embers 
In the function of rising a tide 
But mountain summits still remembers 
Where it use to ride 

His heart, the thunders imitation 
His breath, the gentle winds vocation 
In a pensive spirit unsealing the bodly cocoon 
As his mind swallows the moon 

He sees a paradise in every flower 
A solar system in every spark 
He's trying to reach a subliminal power 
And slowly sinks into the dark 

Like a mental Columbus in ecstasy, 
Controlling his spiritual cave 
But just a microscopical cell in the galaxy 
So, he's both master and slave 

A burning comet which tries to pass 
Through the universal door 
Where ashrams lurks in the hourglass 
Deep within the cosmic core 

He sees a paradise in every flower 
A solar system in every spark 
He's trying to reach a subliminal power 
And slowly sinks into the dark",The Explorer,2002
Vintersorg,"Revealed are the legends coronal
In a fiery illusion
An esoteric festival
The logical is trapped in confusion

Unmasked are theorems of invocation
Consigned to the thirsty soul
Parallel dimension's fragmentation
With a stronghold in a black hole

Where phantoms channel the connection
In a metaphysical drama
Like Maxwell's demon if taught to perfection
My eyes, the soul's panorama

At childhood I felt a concealed motion
(wisdom through the mother's milk)
Waves in the interstellar ocean,
Shapes under veils of silk

Still they let me feel their presence
The archetype around me, inside me
In every atom and second their essence
As well as in the vibration frequency of the open sea

Rainbows in colours never seen
In symbioses with Nordic light that flashes in green

In rapids of blood glorious
And in the reckless fire victorious
I can trace their mark

Engorges my ocular ardour 
Hiding in the auroral breakup's visibility 
Its genie I once saw 

Growing in the binocular's prism, 
Systematic in the substorm's fractions 
With a trapping boundary like magnetism 
A lodestar in flaming actions 

Awake! All you constellations 
To space's serene sonata 
Forget the daily tribulations 
And join the nebular multicoloured strata 

I crown you kings of the hemispheres 
Burn wild, like an untamed lion

From the offspring carnival within Orion

Vintersorg,"The optical nerve screened off since birth,
Alone where the proximity of darkness reposed
By undiscovered mysteries, as concealed in dirt
The quiescent eye got exposed

The physical range of vision lost,
Between iris and synapses the link is broken
But the presence of mind over-crossed
The barriers that stood like fluency token

Reading pictures through the aura's energy,
A sensor for visual thinking and analysis
From that exterior compass into interior synergy
A merging of spirit and mind into synthesis

Pictorial impulses trigger the mechanism,
A mental blending of their entrance
Soul-born impressions end the blindsight's schism,
And expands the human competence

Functions in the hidden eye,
A window to intuitive perception

And lights the immense conception

Explore the lining of sensibility
To understand the spirit's anatomy

Is vaster than astronomy

Just as a signature of the paranormal

Vintersorg,"The curtains never fall they only rise
At the cosmic theater
Standing ovations came at the 15 billion-mark""

Blurs and vague impressions aside
The engineer, the director
Had the galaxies disposed, and then exposed
For the explorers who never took an answer for an answer

A matter of time not space
How far linearity has permitted us to see
Outwards means backwards in a universe so vast
Stretched in time, see it commence
A set of celestial fragments
At immeasurable expanses

How far a flicker can force itself
Through dimness, through fields of emission
The shine slowly turning red
A burgundy sense of distance

An overturned curtain call
The velvety draperies eternally rising
Into infinite blurs of timelessness
For an audience correctly dressed in
Extravagant suits of flaming curiosity
The witnesses and surveyors of celestial enchantment

Hunted by distance and time
The curtain reluctantly withdraws
A prelude to the swirling drama:
Creation formation design
Or deduction destruction collapse
All depending on the angle",Curtains,2004
Vintersorg,"An extension of the theories
Gravitates across the seas
Changing the accepted terms,
But still it only confirms
That it is as equal close (or far)
To an atom as it's to a star

We know that signals trigger nerves,
But what starts the signal's curves?
That's in charge of every thought,
From that source our conscious is taught
That it is as equal close (or far)
To an atom as it's to a star

So, is knowledge a friend or a foe?
'Cause you don't suffer from what you don't know
But in arguments we hunt the reasons
That explains the Thesis's seasons
Chaos, order and complexity,
That challenges our intellectuality
For things that lie in the asymmetric hole,
For too long, we've given the Devil that role

We're the parameter that draws
The map of the existing laws
To break those laws isn't a crime,
It solved Newton's conflict with ""time""

Into the arena Einstein stepped
And widened the universal concept
He opened a new detecting phase,
But Dark Matter is still a maze

Analysis with a microscope
Only tenses the polymathic rope
In that focus we eagerly stir,
But the focus seems more like a blur

""Our quest of the highest theory,
Is controlled by that theory,
So the way we think
Is the closest link?

Gives us richly faceted clues,

Vintersorg,"""With whom shall I have this dialogue?
The mad, the noble, the wit?

About the anonymous cosmic shadow""

This demon keeps my conscious awake
From sleep, rest and the calm
Disillusioned I rinse my ache
In the ocean's whispering psalm

The ocean theory covers Earth,
But I seek what has entire control
What nature introduced the genesis birth?
Known Deities? I curse 'em all

I've set my sails for this odyssey
To locate its mystic exile
A crusade through the mind's liberty,
Not a journey in nautical miles

A voyage in science and fate
To disrobe the acceleration from zero
To dive into it and investigate,
Terrifies even the bravest hero

In the corridors of time we're sons,
Entrapped in lonely spaces
But star dusted electrons
Are my kinsmen, just with odd faces

Still fantasies unveil their sloids,
When patience turns to fear
To examine the darkest, coldest voids
For the hiding engineer

But our past is still our present
If we can't the knowledge rift over-span
An eternal transformation is what the matrix represents,
Like the child is father to the man

""Some hide their confusion behind a religious mask,
Like puppet thespians in ""God's"" masquerade
'Cause the blur grows for every time we ask,
What generates the spherical parade?""",Matrix Odyssey,2004
Vintersorg,"Sensory impulses commanding us
Still we're aware of its center
Structuring thoughts from a blurry muss
With the analogy of electricity to enter

I've painted a world in the dark,
With elegant patterns and connections
This cosmic genesis' lightning arc,
Shapes my body's complexion

A microscopical macrocosm,
Of distant mountains and inner plasm,
All the elements are eloquenced by infinity
A microscopical macrocosm,
I and Me float through its chasms,
Filtering the universe through a living internity

Thousands of pathway's directory,
Lie dormant in this unexplored animator
In its lobe rests our closest galaxy
Reading, visions from the spiral generator

Atoms composed into a condition
Of thinking and intuition

Envelop the surroundings of man
Wavelengths build its sparkling attraction,
Is it an accident or a plan?

Creation models, one by one
Don't dare to look closely at the signs
But why should one fear, the things that are dun?
It's just what Nature itself designs

TRracing the substances in age and distance,
Scanning the extensive universe
Following the grammar of the known existence, but
Exploring the possibility of a vaster multiverse

Maybe it's time to solve the enigma,
To let philosophy have its toll
To gaze beyond the factor of sigma,
The constructions may resemble a Russian doll

From molecules to giant stars
The steps increase without intervention
Let your mind slip through the earthly bars,
'Cause the stars are the molecules in the next dimension?

But still the complex connection sustains",A Sphere in a Sphere? (To Infinity),2004
Vintersorg,"If you glance into nebular haze
Toward the light of a galactic emperor
An excursion through an advanced maze,
Following the intensity of a burning superior

The rays travel where man would find immediate death,
Yearly, daily, hourly, and in the stillness of a breath
Seeing the unseen,
Meeting matter without sheen

Eight minutes of experiences not understandable
In a puzzling journey of particle suction
I would sell my soul if it were possible
To ride the sun's frequent eruptions

When the sunspot process peaks so fast
The magnetic stellar dice is cast
Oscillation in the dualism,
Light and darkness polytheism

Reaching to know, high and below

Learning calculations made by the magnanimous
Using the magnitude parallax as the cosmic tool
Ignored by the narrow-minded as ridiculous,
But even Newton was called a fool!

""What once was watched from Gallilei's observatory?
Still falls under the same category
But my wonderings will not rest
Until the insight is burning in my chest""

So many pieces to put in place,
So many riddles to solve in this extended maze

""I'm sitting at the sunset transfixed by the idea
That our cosmos may be just one out of many planes
Like all the raindrops at the end build a sea
But that's hardly what you think of when it rains""",Star Puzzled,2004

Vinyl Kings,"I took a chance
All I did was touch you
Our second dance
Was when I knew I was too
Deep in over my own head
I tried to stop, but lost my cool and said,
""I Love You"" 

I took a chance
I didn't know what you'd say
It's out of my hands
Even though my heart would 
Break if you don't feel the same.
My heart and mind are never gonna change
I love you. 

Why should I try to hide it?
Why should I try to fight it?
It's no good.
What if I didn't say it?
And you were right there waitin' for the words. 

I took a chance
I'm glad I told you
'Cause you understand
I see it as I hold you

Vinyl Kings,"When I was only ten years old
My father said to me
""Son you're getting up in years,
What will you want to be?""
And as I pondered my reply
In front of my T.V.
That Sunday night Ed Sullivan
Made it all clear to me.

[Chorus]
I took a trip straight into Rock and Roll
A little bit, and I lost all control
And that was it, no more, no less, I guess it got the best of me.
A little trip and I was on my way
A little bit was more than I could take
And that was it, the night I saw it all
The Beatles on T.V.

""Please forgive me mother dear,
I know it must sound strange.
I need to let my golden hair
Grow longer every day.""
I bought myself a used guitar
And I learned how to play,
But I never learned the passing chords
They just got in my way.

[Chorus]

I promise to send you a letter
When I am a big jetsetter
Just say you believe in me
And send me all your love.

That's when I lost all control",A Little Trip,2002

Violara,"This is me

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
Woah, we are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're making me to go, you're begging me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love, and I'm chained to your side

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

And if I'm losing control will you turn me away or touch me deep inside?
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this could die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

",Love Is a Battlefield,

Most thugs front when they get the chance (say what?) 
Some thugs hit the blunt when they get the chance (say what?) 
Live thugs stack chedder, then they make plans (say what?) 

I, Cool J, NY2K 
Rule milleniums with my compadres 
They tounges sway with really nothing to say 
They pack guns, but I stack funds 
I'm second to none 
My hot streak's just begun 
You want to bring beef? You got to serve it well-done 
You ran the wrong way, now you livin' on the run 
Not some, each one's a bum, every one 
Coughed up a lung, became my son 
Flames I brung, platinumn weighs a ton 
Heavy on the chest, I pitty all the rest 
I put 'em to the test 
I spit it like I'm blessed 
I testify 
I have no need to lie 
I buried many, still many want to die 
I zone out crazy, starin' don't faze me 
Got ya whole strategy shook 
It's too daisy

Clack, relaod, clack, reload 
Got ya pictures sittin' in my lap

Strive till I get that 
Never mind a set-back 
No time to wet that 
A lyrical hi-jack, you don't want to try that 
Creep wit' my CD, don't let 'em know you buy that 
One in the snips, one in the whip with the low jack 
Call a 911 to get the LL back 
Original bells, LL 
Rocked them till they fell 
Competition bailed 
Looked like mince green when mic had 'em swelled 
Wrote all them rhymes and never gonna sell 
Meanwhile, I'm countin' prezzies in the the 'tel 
And in the meanwhile, I throw my baby in Chanelle 

[Chorus] 
Unh, I'm lyrically hot tonight, come on 
Unh, I'm lyrically hot tonight, come on 
Layin' low to catch you on stage so I can run on 
Matter fact, you not on my level, I throw my son on 
Mission is complete, technique is unique 
Defeat the rhyme weak and mine ya knee-deep 
Rewind a rip beats and give jeeps the heat 
Even if you walkin', wit' ya walkman in the street 
Actin' gassed up, but you really on need 
How you countin' your paper kid, without a GED? 
Slow down, let me do my thing now, hold up 
Maybe that's the reason you stressed, quick to roll up 
Put the L down, picked the other LL up 
Maybe we can straighten this out before it's toe-up 
Watch me closely, boom! I'm a blow-up 
And spend the whole rest of my life stackin' dough up 

[Chorus] 
Whoo, Vinnie Biggs, you hot with this one, dawg

Unh, all my peeps, my peeps, my peeps across the land 
Know what I mean? we gonna keep gettin' paper

Spittin' hot shit tryin' to see grand
Imprinted on my mind every minute
Make my plans and you always in it, yo

You're such a vivrant thing,
Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing

And even though we both fly
Give each other space and not the evil eye
Actin' like grownups
Don't even try to hide cause the spot blown up

I say 'I dunno' but you say 'Gladly'

We go on and on and on and on and on and

All the willy that I kick make the other niggaz maddest
Movin', to your town and situation
Shorty thought she subtle but she really was blatant when she

Shook her thing and violated
Now these wolf-like thoughts are formulated
I'm sayin, ""Yo is this some heartfelt shit here?
Am I strong-backed nigga? Well shit yeah""

Plus we can hold a convo'
Or go to the movies, my crib, whatever yo
Just want to see you by my side
We on 95, know the stash is in the ride

A rappin' nigga for real
You would find me in a cypher if I didn't cop a deal
Rap slate like big grate
You buy, I sell, we split big cake

Uh uh, just move your little thing
Move it around and shake your little thing

Bitch, I'm a muthafuckin' villan
Stand in my way and you're witnessin' the killin'
Creepin' up without a clue
And once you in the scope, yo' ass is through
So bitch, you better get a grip
'cause Anybody Killa's on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Detroit!

""J is his name and the boy's comin'...""
Straight outta Detroit!
Is it nut that I'm cut
Like whut?
And make your sister eat butt
Dangerous
A thug claimin' Southwest
I'll leave an axe hangin' outta yo' chest
See I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a muthafuckin' cop, I'ma stop him
Play it smart and ask for directions
And then shank him in the fuckin' midsection
To me, it's kinda funny, this Prozac
I don't know where the fuck I'm goin' or where the fuck I'm at
I'm just rollin', lookin' for some ecstasy
So I can get high and fuck this bitch next to me
Ruthless...is the label that's floppin'
But the hatchetman be choppin'
'cause it really don't matter bout me
It's all Anybody Killa and Blaze Ya Dead Homie
Feel a little gust of wind and you're dead
'cause an axe just severed yo' head
And what about the bitch that got shot?
She gave me herpes so I shot her in the back
This be an autobiography
Of Blaze, he's dead and gone, but ain't lonely
Dark Lotus will slaughter your mother
And slap your brother
Straight outta Detroit!

Keep looking
Look in my mind. (Panic Attack)
You just might get hurt

(Violent J)
First of all I stab people, like even myself
I wouldn't advise it though doc it fucks up my health
I hang out with bad people we cause mischief and mayhem
People like Shaggy and that E-S-H-A-M
I panic over everything man, my faucets they drip
I headbutted my mom over that shit and swelled up her lip
(Urgh) She hit me with a big wooden spoon
I ran into the bathroom
I took off my panties and sat there and cried and took a dune
Plus I hide in bushes, and I play with my dick
Wait! Did I say I had panties on?
Scratch that shit!
Anyway, them bushes I'm jerking my dick off
Yet possums are looking I get off
Tell me how to stop my panic attack!!

Look in my mind. (Panic Attack)
Carefull. (Don't get hurt)

I popped off all my pills they told I should pop some more

But I paint it with dog shit when nobody else is around
Wait, no I don't

Gather round my wealthy friends and endure the horrifying sights
Only your worst nightmares can produce
Actual human beings of a deformed nature
Come at once and come and indulge yourself
In our own twisted amusement of another's misfortune
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, enter our three ring show of freaks""

Ring one, a dung a dung dung
My name's Violent J and I staple my tongue
To the desk in school then I run down the hall
Scaring the shit out of all y'all bitches
Which is why you don't invite mine to your parties
Just 'cause I don't look like everybody
I guess you're just a bunch of hot shots
They act like they ain't never seen a Cyclops

And what's the big deal about my neck
Just because now and then I like to let it stretch
Up a couple feet to get a better sight
Is that any reason to scream and run in fright
No, so, what's up with that?
So what if I got another arm growing out of my back
I guess I'm just another freak show thing
And now they got me in the three ring

Three ring a ding a ding ding, people love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding, it's the same as everywhere
Three ring a ding a ding ding, people love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding, it's the same as everywhere

Ring two, how do you do?
I'm Shaggy 2 Dope, chicken-faced bitch, who?
You don't try to front ho
Try to play me out just 'cause I'm an albino
Or maybe it's the sack growin' out my neck
But don't jet baby, heh, not yet
I'm popping in like a pound of lead
Black n blue, his next roll and drop me on my head

Oh shit, I knew I had to fuck up my circuits
'Cause when I was two, my momma left me at the circus
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows
Like bad boys, hermaphrodites and old man crow
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone
So don't be stickin', your finger in my face stank
Or your stomach might receive a shank from the

Three ring a ding a ding ding, people love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding, it's the same as everywhere
Three ring a ding a ding ding, people love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding, it's the same as everywhere

I certainly hope you're enjoying yourselves
Here at our three ring exhibit
But to be honest I really don't see
What's so fuckin' funny about it
These fuckin' people are real

Ring three, the ICP
Look if you want but I wouldn't lay a hand on me
That's how you get fucked up
We'll squeeze your windpipe shut
Yo, I'm a nerd word, I drink Thunderbird
I chill with my homies on a crackhouse curb
Nobody wanna hang with a freak
Who's clinically dead with no heart beat

Fuck that, bitch, suck that
I was born with a wang but I never had a nut sac
Just two balls hanging with no protection so
I move real careful and slow
You can call me a weirdo, call me a freak
Just 'cause my nose curl up like the iron shriek
Is that the reason nobody wanna hang, fuck It
I chill with the three rings

Well, that's it, I hope you're satisfied
I hope you had a good time
You fucking heartless bastards
You saw what you wanted
So grab your fucking kids
And that fat flop of shit wife of yours
And get the fuck out of our circus tent

You cold-hearted sons of bitches
You think they look fucked up
Just wait till I kick your
Fucking lips in a couple times
You'll be sitting up here like a bitch
And we'll laughing at your folded ass

They'll call you lumpy after I done put knots
All over your fuckin' forehead, yeah
Hey, hey little boy, come here
How'd you like it if I tied your neck in a knot

You don't need aluminol, I'm leavin blood everywhere 
And I'm aiming for the head and hair of everybody there 
I'm like a grasshopper quick to jump, I'm spreading my wings 
You say the wicked shit'll die, I say you faggots seeing things 
And all you bitches know: I'm gangsta. don't ask me to dance 
I might straight panic, pull the gat, and blow your pussy out your pants 
It's the wicked shit. it's e and j. it's hotter than hell 
And every devil's night, we hunt them down and slaughter d12

Turn and face the camera, ""where your hatches at?"" 
Throw em up why'all

Guess who coming in? 
Grab my gun again 
They told me he was one of them 
So I done him in 
A killer's on the hunt again 
Smoke my blunt again 
Fatality finished him, I won again 
Repentance, my vengeance, so I'm not sentenced a hundred years 
It's burning my ears, and blood is mixed with my tears, fears

Violent J,"If everything is going my way 
Then why does it suck so much to be Eric Ritter today? 
I'm like the captain of the football team 
And every girl who's someone in my school, they want to suck my dick or sleep with me 
I get big props, and high fives 
For them quarter back sneaks from the 30 yard line 
I never fuck with drugs, I only drink for the buzz 
I can handle my liquor, and my daddy is a judge 
And he looks out for me 
But what about the prom queen? 
It's been at least two weeks since she's been heard from or seen 
Susan Casada, her momma is a lawyer and her daddy is a doctor 
Her picture's in my locker 
Her body's in the lagoon, underneath the lily pads 
Glow from the moon, dark watery tomb 
Consumed the body, then pulled her below 
I wrapped her in my letterman coat and slit her throat 
Then I let go 
Loudest splash I ever heard 
And from that day forward I haven't spoken a word 

And from that day forward I haven't spoken a word

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
The marsh lagoon 
So many want to dump their dead in here 
Only the water 
Only the waters know what stories they bare 

My name's not important 
You never thought you'd see the day when you would see me again 
But now I caught you 
I've been abused, confused but uplifted 
So I choose to keep this inside but that shifted to a hate that'd keep me alive 
Until your heart stops 
Then padlock your time box and dropped it in a black marsh 
To hell and back is where my mind has been 
And once upon a time I had a friend I thought I really could confide in 
Flashbacks of the touching 
Uncomfortable feeling 
Can't sleep much at night 
I'm crawling the ceiling 
Got me feeling like I'm sick and depressed 
Cause everybody that I told, they just laid it to rest 
But now I'm twenty five 
And I'm sick of all the talking 
Now I'm stalking you, waiting by the door that you'll be walking through 
No disguise so you can recognize my face 
And all the shame and disgrace will be the reason I dismantle you 
I handle you like a candle 
Break you in half and then I laugh at you 
Soak you in gas and make you flammable 
I burned the body and I gathered the ash 
And then I sprinkle the lagoon every time I get the chance 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

I got dark secrets 
Eventually I told everybody 
One day I'ma snap and leave a crime scene bloody 
But they only think I'm playing 
I'm just a Dave from Donut Hut 
They always like ""What up Dave Nut?"" when I show up 
But that doesn't really bother me I suppose 
Yet there's a darkness inside of me 
Which eagerly grows 
When I was younger I murdered off some neighborhood squirrels 
And this abandoned garage was like my own private world 
Now it's ""Honey, I had a bad dream again"" 
I'm tripping 
Demons eating me alive and burning within 
I gotta feed it 
I roll down another dark street 
I'm trying to find something alive so I can smother out it's heartbeat 
I'm thinking a hooker 
You think I'm bullshitting? 
I reach for my leathers, but I only find my wife's mittens in the glove box 
Circle some blocks 
I pick the chick up, I let her suck the dick up, before I cut her neck up 
She kicked for a minute, not putting much in it 
I never thought I'd get this mad 
I'm glad I did it, I admit it 
Feel so much better, a neck wetter, a throat shredder 
I got blood on my sweater and I better not get a head, of myself 
The first matter is disposal of the body 
I found the perfect spot out past my Uncle Marty's 
It's some hidden lagoon where it be dark all the time 
I dumped her there and got on with mine 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Only the trees 
Only the fish 
Only the bugs 
And only the water 
Truly really know 
What happened that night 
When right went wrong 
That's how they got there

Violent J,"I mean what do you got going on there that's so good?

Man, it ain't always all good at home
But the few days it is makes it all worth while.
It's all about time and chance it's gotta be
You got trailer park moms winning powerball lottery
And if a little girl gets stuck in a well
You got the whole world feeling the Hell
And trying to help,
We got good intentions, maybe bad ideas
Like fucking fine nedens laced with ghonerea
But the adventure is real and ain't nobody alone
Especially me, so come the fuck on, let's get home
I got bitches to fuck we being rich as
Truck at the Mexican festival hitting switches
The bed be elevating, no hating
Only congratulating, and the hoes steady tailgating
With their neden holes waiting
On daytons, man that truck was so tight,
That's why I'm trying to go back sometimes it be alright
And the rest of the bullshit, I can walk right through
I'm trying to see a wheel chair,
A hot nurse, at a 100 and 2 years old
And the tree

And the herb
And the smoke
And the ganj'

The tree is all right

[Chorus:]
It ain't much going on but that's where I belong
Because some of them days be shiny diamonds, (sometimes)
And it can't be wrong,
Because some of them nights the moon be shining, (sometimes)
Like a world of gold, so much unexplored
And I be climbing, homies rhyming, heaven
I'm in, people can do they thing

And mine is singing, (singing) I'm singing
Like Michael Jackson y'all
I said I'm singing, (singing) I'm singing

We scrubs, your everyday Joe's, Mike's, and Tom Dub's
But that's are thing and we love that shit
And people sick, thinking wicked shit gone quit
Tell me why do stress be, L-I-F-E
Everyday's a new adventure for the fella's with me
We only got so long I'm tryna get out and see
I'm tryna get out and be, who tryna do it like me
You might see from above, you might fall in love,
You might get your dick sucked from the back like what
You might discover your nitch, and look you ain't a bitch
All this just days after you was gone quit
I ain't on some mother you whack motherfucker
This shit for juggalos, we talking to each other
Not them other hoes, we shudder those hoes to back rows

Violent J,"What up y'all?
This Jed Thumpman
Let me tell y'all a little story
About a muthafucka that I know named Blaze
Now everytime we roll up a joint
Muthafuckas always be talkin' about Blaze Blaze Blaze
Man fuck Blaze
This muthafucka act like he puttin' it down for the hood
Talkin' bout everybody know Blaze, big baller
I don't give a fuck
Dead muthafucka don't get no special treatment from me
Look at Sarie's son little Eric
You know that muthafucka down to wear a wheelchair
I hate that muthafucka
And I don't show him no special treatment
So Blaze can kiss my ass

I put in work for my hood
So fuck a 9 to 5
You can find me on the corner
Hustlin' on the grind
They call me Mr. Lump Lump
So when their heads hear the thunder and the bump bump
They come out runnin' like the kids to the ice cream man
Children I'm sorry it's Blaze in the loony van
Playin' Atari, and I gotta do a crime to loot and 8 ball
Semi automatic with a clip for the law
All I want to do is make money and smoke
Fuck hella bitches, and slang my dope
The law ain't good for a muthafuckin thang
But eatin' mad donuts, and gettin' all in the way
I been gone for more than a day, and some things changed
Some many died and some faded away
I represent the ghetto from Harlem to Pinewood
I ride for the hood, I put it down for the hood

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

I've been dead to the world for the last 11 years
My body's decomposing, I'm missin' part of my ear
Still gonna rock till the day I die again
Get up back from the dead, and ryde again
Walk again, talk thug shit, right
Empty mack clips, right
Keep it old school, want to see that bitch? Uh huh
When it's thugs in King's coats and Raider's caps
Killers, jerry curls, and baseball bats
Ready to die like everyday
I put it down like a muthafucka, everyday
I drink brew and smoke weed like, everyday
And we all trying to get paid but anyway
Killas don't talk, but this one do
Talk you out your wallet let the 45 blast you
Twice in the chest, once in the face
Plus the extra heater on the safe side in case
Your bitch is wack well she can catch one too
Cause if you're down with your hood
Then your hood down with you

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

Psychopathic just like thugs
We ball, and we fight
And just like the freaks I come out every night
Holdin' down the sidewalk
Standin' amongst muthafuckas that's soon to be outlined in chalk
Sippin' on a cold ass 40 of OE
Live from the DET we OG
Pissy drunk always, we dead bumpin'
Stay thug with the throw away in the trunk
Bitch slapper, fuck a bitch rapper
Bitches were made for fuckin' but that's another chapter
Bitch you don't know me, don't approach me
Thinkin' that you're down with Blaze ya dead homie
G Blood imbedded in street blocks
That's why I put it down, and blast with many shots
Bullet holes in my chest, it's all good
Man I even died for my hood, muthafucka

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

And you always down to jack a bitch for her ride
Or the colors that you rep make others upset
Then you might be gang related! (ain't nothin' wrong)

Never once been seen alone
Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slangin' rocks on tha block with a knot in ya sock
Then you might be
Gang related! murder rap
Notches all in your belt
Robbery and sellin'
Trees the only jobs that you held
Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
Then you might be
Gang related! in and out tha penitentiary

Still clockin' ""g""s from what you learned on tha streets

Did your crew's name originate in Illinois?
Do you cross your enemies out with a ""k""
Then you gang related to muthafucka like Violent J

I'm always asked if I'm gang related
By police and the public and I'm startin' to hate it
If I wasn't already that would sure make me think
About the problems that I have and what I'd do to be free
Besides gang related's such a harsh word
For them to call a bunch of homies takin' over tha world
Willin' to die for everything that we built
The battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed

Do you participate in gang related activities?
03's, 211's, 187's?

Take anybody killa
I know him but I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him
He's fuckin' crazy as hell
You wouldn't know
Right now he's chewin' holes in the floor here at the studio
I don't even want to do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol-whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
But I just happen to be the master bitch-slappery
The bottom line, I won't say it again until you play it again
If you're gang related hope you're my friend
'cause if I see you wearin' some shit I don't like
I'm shuttin' your cranium down with a lead pipe

Violent J,"I was looking for some shoes, and some brand new shorts
And took a minute to relax, with some snacks in the food court
I was half way finished, with my value meal
When I spotted this little cutie, with some sex appeal
I winked at her, she gave me a look like I'm a booger
I thought ""Bitch, I'd rather spend my money on a hooker""
Then a bright idea, ran across my mind
If I could swipe a manikin, I'd have a freak all the time
No listening to her lip, no putting up with her shit
No having her act a fool, the way them bitches get
So I hid in the clothes rack, at ""Frederick's of Hollywood""
And waited until they closed, and it was all good
I snatched this little fine ass, strawberry blonde
With her ass jutted out, with nothin' but some sale panties on
Alarms rang out, I ran to the ride
And stuffed my new, lifeless sex friend, quickly inside

I love a manikin, should I be panicking
I don't know what's happening, but I love her
I'm taking her home

I love a manikin, should I be panicking
I don't know what's happening, but I love her
I'm taking her home

I went to this little traveling, carnival deal
Nothing but a few games, a ferris wheel
Haunted house, bumper cars, and a wax museum
I went through it once, I'll never be the same
She was waxy, sexy, smooth, and scratchable
Hourglass titties, and ass was unmatchable
I waited for us to be alone, and I kissed her
Licked her wax neck, and started caressing her
She don't get old, rosy red and pretty
I'm sneaking her out of here, and taking her with me
To my trailer in the woods, I laid her down gently
I bent her arm upwards, accidentally
I took a box cutter and I made an incision
I carved out a little hole in her, for the neden
It hit it, then I set her toes on fire
And cried, watching her slowly expire

I love a manikin, should I be panicking
I don't know what's happening, but I love her
I'm taking her home

Everyday I see her, when I'm riding to work
Look in the window, just a little shirt and short skirt
Her eyes follow me, whereever I go
And she's always in some brand new clothes, and a new pose
Banging ass, and not a wrinkle to be found
With a face like a doll, and she never makes a sound
I bet she likes to talk, when she gets fucked
But then she'd probably never shut the fuck up, with my luck
She always seems so happy when I'm around
And if it wasn't for this window, we'd be fucking on the ground
I wanna take her ass home for keeps, she never sleeps
I don't even think I seen her off her feet
Tonight's the night, that I'ma get her
I can't even take it anymore, when I see her, I start to shiver
Lip quiver, with the butterfly stomach
Leave the truck going, I'ma just grab her and start running

I love a manikin, should I be panicking
I don't know what's happening, but I love her
I'm taking her home

Wanna touch her
She's in my dreams
Wanna hold her, kiss her
I'm taking her home
She's not real
But I feel like I need her in my arms tonight, wrong or right
I'm taking her home",Manikin,2016

Y lo falso con lo dudoso
Cuánto será mi dolor

Maldigo la primavera
Con sus jardines en flor
Y del otoño el color
Yo lo maldigo de veras
A la nube pasajera
La maldigo tanto y tanto
Porque me asiste un quebranto
Maldigo el invierno entero
Con el verano embustero
Maldigo profano y santo
Cuánto será mi dolor

Maldigo a la solitaria
Figura de la bandera
Maldigo cualquier emblema
La venus y la araucaria
El trino de la canaria
El cosmos y sus planetas
La tierra y todas sus grietas
Porque me aqueja un pesar
Maldigo del ancho mar
Sus puertos y sus caletas
Cuánto será mi dolor

Maldigo luna y paisaje
Los valles y los desiertos
Maldigo muerto por muerto
Y al vivo de rey a paje
Al ave con su plumaje
Yo la maldigo a porfía
Las aulas, las sacristías
Porque me aflige un dolor
Maldigo el vocablo amor
Con toda su porquería
Cuánto será mi dolor

Maldigo por fin lo blanco
Lo negro con lo amarillo
Obispos y monaguillos
Ministros y predicantes
Yo los maldigo llorando
Lo libre y lo prisionero
Lo dulce y lo pendenciero
Le pongo mi maldición
En griego y español
Por culpa de un traicionero
Cuánto será mi dolor",Maldigo del Alto Cielo,1966

Violeta Parra,"Ya se va para los cielos
Ese querido angelito
A rogar por sus abuelos
Por sus padres y hermanitos

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca su sitio
Adentro de una amapola
O dentro de un pajarito

La tierra lo está esperando
Con su corazón abierto
Por eso és que el angelito
Parece que está despierto

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca su centro
En el brillo de una rosa
O de un pececito nuevo

En su cunita de tierra
Lo arrullará una campana
Mientras la lluvia le limpia
Su carita en la mañana

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca su diana
En el misterio del mundo
Que le ha abierto su ventana

Las mariposas alegres
De ver el bello angelito
Alrededor de su cuna
Le caminan despacito

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma va derechito
A saludar a la luna
Y de paso al lucerito

Adónde se fué su gracia
Adónde se fué su dulzura
Por qué se cae su cuerpo
Como una fruta madura

Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma busca en la altura
La explicación de su vida
Cortada con tal premura
La explicación de su muerte
Prisionera en una tumba
Cuando se muere en la carne
El alma se queda oscura",Rin del Angelito,1966
Violeta Parra,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17,1966

Je viens d'entamer t'aime ou t'aime pas c'est la même
Hé laisse moi passer pendant que tu discutes
j'ai compris que c'est ceux qui trainent que le système exécute

Même si je me perd par moment je sais où je n'irai pas
La vie c'est de savoir comment
C'est pas si simple de compter que sur soi
A force de faire confiance j'ai failli perdre foi

Même si je me perd par moment je sais où je n'irai pas
La vie c'est de savoir comment
C'est pas si simple de compter que sur soi
A force de faire confiance j'ai failli perdre foi




Quand on est seul c'est dur de garder le cap, quand on est 2 lutter c'est plus facile
pour qu'on s'tape
J'fais le constat et la merde est constante, on peut compter que sur soi
alors je compte et j'tente
J'suis 100 pourcent / sans mascara/ pas de mesquinerie ni d'or 24 carats
Ho, mama tu ne m'a pas prévenu que c'était dingue,
le monde est bad si tu ne bouges pas on t'flinque
On m'dis « ferme ta gueule clest pas un truc de femme ni un compte de fée
c'est un monde d'animal
Ho chérie dis moi mais pourquoi tant de haine si j'rap mieux que toi tu flip pas quand je mène
La jalousie frappe, l'envie cogne les gens s'étranglent /
le temps pése et la haine comme offrande
On s'étend / la paresse contamine et si tu vis encore la mort t'examines

Même si je me perd par moment je sais où je n'irai pas
La vie c'est de savoir comment
C'est pas si simple de compter que sur soi
A force de faire confiance j'ai failli perdre foi

Même si je me perd par moment je sais où je n'irai pas

Viper,"Lifestorm broke my anchors
Like a wreck I've been
Sea and sky were just one darkness
Such a brilliant radiance you came

I'm alive, I'm alive
Just by the light
From your eyes

And I need you to be
Like the heaven I seek
But clouds showed me
And I saw

You were just the moonlight
And the moon belongs to
No one, no one,..",Moonlight,1997
Viper,"My time is ending fast
My pain is growing
You have to hear my prayers
Evil thoughts are coming
The midnight train will leave me
To live in shadows
Don't walk across my meanings
There's no return
The curse is waiting for me
The sky is crying
and while we're fighting lonely
Our honor dies
So why do we keep on fighting
Beside the disgrace
The final comes as lightning
We'll rest in peace
In front of my eyes the men shout
I've got no fear
We hear the bombs cry loud
Nightmare is here
Legions of blind men marching
No fate no future
For fucking flag we're fighting
Our death is right
Seconds are running faster
They are my life
I'm just a slave of violence
Ready to die

Control the youngers
Of children they made soldiers
Of soldiers they made dead",Nightmares,1997
Virg Dzurinko,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1999
Virg Dzurinko,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1999
Virg Dzurinko,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1999

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

You won't believe me that I love you only

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

The smell of old velvet
Dampness and gloom
Her sweat covered body
Masturbatin' in her room
I know that you wanna believe
That I sinned and I lied
Let the fire console you tonite
It's your turn to cry- cry, babe.

Alone with the memory
Of the way it might've been
Woman it's crazy
Pride was the sin
A thousand year darkness
A season of pain
With one Judas kiss
You're screaming my name

[Chorus:]
Wastin' your life away
(Baby) It's a crown of thorns
You wear
Crown of thorns
...My, my...

Tracks on the carpet
Cracks in the glass
Seven years spent in torment- alone
Shakin' your ass
You walked out on me
Couldn't see...

That I wasn't to blame
Let the lies and the coke and
The Poison
Shoot into your veins...
...Shoot it babe.

Alone with the memory
Of the way it might've been
Woman it's crazy
Pride was the sin
A thousand year darkness
A season of pain
With one Judas kiss
You're screaming my name

[Chorus]

After the face of beauty
Becomes the face of despair
Bound by the flesh of treason
Under the hunting wings
Oh, Lord...

Alone with the memory
Of the way it might have been
You're fuckin' crazy
Pride was your sin
A thousand year darkness
A season of pain
With blood on your lips...
I'm not to blame..

[Chorus]

Love lies bleeding... love dies...
...When I was dyin' in the cold by
The side of the road
You were lying in a warm embrace
When I was bleedin' in the rain
On an empty street
You were makin' love to someone else...
Shallow and cruel- you were never true..
What'd I ever do to you?
..Oh, I don't need you...
Wear your crown.. fuck off
...Your house is empty- open..
...Open to the wind and rain...

Dust raised, born to die
Funeral train comin'
In the hours of the damned
Lock your daughters weeping
Keep'em from this voodoo man

[Chorus:]
Jet Black- black as the river flown
Black as my heart on a night of love
Jet Black- under the burning sky

(Black is the love the we used to share)

Hidin' on the outside
The kill completes the chase
Sidewalk screamin' rat race
Ev'ry fuckin' day
Runnin' from the wreckage
Of this burned out paradise
Our love becomes a weapon
My eyes reflect the night

(Black is the space between the stars)

...Oh, you got it right now
Blood and gasoline
Crucify my spirit
Don't gimme your prayers

Watch her walk... see the silence
Watch the venom drip...
...Drip from her legs
Like diamonds.. like wine
Cool child... let it go...

There like an angel
A vision of light
The last rose of Summer
The last Rose of Summer
Bloomed in my sight

Alone with the wind
And the sun in her hair
I've never seen anything so fair

And you're all I need
All I need...

Our love will never die
I walk with you,
Last Rose of Summer's day
Make love to me

Wake with the sunrise
When dreams walk the sky
She whispers, ""I love you""
Then sings, laughs and cries

A song of emotion
Borne of angel wings
Free as the seasons
Where love eternal springs

And you're all I need
All I need...

Our love will never die
I walk with you,
Last Rose of Summer's day
Make love to me

...Sweet love
Don't cry no more
I'm with you babe...



",Last Rose of Summer,1992

I see the winter in her eyes
As I turn to go
See the pain on her face
A frozen rose

With the toss of her hair
And the bite of her lip
She'll ask me so shy
""Anything left to say?""

And I say
""No, no baby, not this time
Again-
This time it's over
You've got to learn""

[Chorus:]
Now, darlin' love is cruel
Darlin' love is blind
Love is pain
So cry
Shed a tear today
Shed a tear my baby
Love is pain

I see our love out of reach
Arms intwined with lies
What shattered the night
Still haunts me in the rain

Now you're lost child, lost
Like a ship on the storm
Your distant eyes
Are shadows of others I've known

I Love you

Don't say that you want love
As you're walking out my door
Don't say that you need love
'Cause I can't love you
Anymore
Lay down in rapture
In this crowded town of fear
Hang your head in sharne my dear
You gocca roll alone

[Chorus:]
Love's gone
It's gone away

Highway in starlite
You shed your blood upon the sun
You lock your love
In bitterness
And now you're left with no one
God, I loved you one time
When we walked the world alone
The face that love could not
Forgive
The heart will turn to stone

If I had possession
Of the secrets of your soul
I could satisfy, glorify
Your body and your mind
Of, I feel love, babe
I like your look
Funky rhythm
Baby, take it all the way

Heigh, ho, silver
She's a long, blonde, loaded gun
A spirit of ice until the evening comes
Then you hypnotize, tantalize and
Lay it on the line

And your body tastes like fire and ice
With another push
I'm gonna... get it inside

And it makes you wild

Cirl, show your love'

Stung by the gods of hate 
I'm rising in power, I'm rising unchained 
Call this a sacred vow 
All that I tell you now
I may be bloody, but I am unbowed
I am power

Harken the hour, season and day 
Phantom of dark misery
Summon your demons, hunger and hate 
Spirit of impurity 
Ravaged by fire, stripped and enslaved 
Torn from the world that I know
I'll never cry out, buckle or kneel 
I am the king of my soul

Stung by the gods of wrath 
Blinded by circumstance 
I'm rising in power, I'm rising unchained
All that I tell you now 
Sure as a sacred vow 
I may be bloody, but I am unbowed

Die, fall on your sword, fall on your knees 
Die like your son nailed to his tree 
Die by my hand, die by my sword 
Right on this site, vultures defile


Die, fall on your sword, fall on your knees 
Die in the sun nailed to these trees 
Die by my hand, die in my heart 
Flung from the heights, forever fall

I sing of power, magick and might 
A sonnet of pure victory 
A hymn to the fearless, the savage, the brave
The spirit of our liberty 
Total my debts, tally my sins, charge each offence on my scroll 
I'll never alter the course of my steele, I am the king of my soul

Lashed by the winds of fate 
Stung by the gods of hate 
I'm rising in power through murdering rain 
Stronger than faith allows 
Braver than hero's vows 
My head is bloody, but I am unbowed 
I am power

I see my vision, I see the line 
Circling onward, looking for nine
I know the answer is not to be found 
Searching in darkness with eyes of the blind 
And in the morning, 
Two will remain 
To carry us onward, to guard the flame 
That we know
There'll be time, for all, for all 
We don't need you, we're fine on our own 
We don't want you, leave us alone

A voice of reason crying in the dark
A raging fire from a spark
Breathe through me

I'm a savage, I'm a king
I fought deceivers
I conquered evil

Animal, grace in form and power
Dignity,a conscious thought
The judgement hour

A voice of reason crying in the dark
A divine vision from the heart
Breathe through me

I'm a savage, I'm a king
I fought deceivers
I conquered evil

Innocent eyes, shine down on me
Don't, don't, don't blind your eyes to me
I'm here with you
Always, again today
Can you feel me?
I'm with you
Never, never surrender
Oh, the power, the glory is yours
My kingdom, on high, again
Can you see?
I'm with you now...

Iron pounding dongs of Glory, Soaring on command
Screaming I rejoin the fray

Take me where the thunder walks, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE
Take my where the falcon flies, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE

Sound the trumpet, crack the mountain, let the arrow fly
Through the land of Lamentation, let the tidings fly
Mercury, the God and I

Take me where the thunder walks, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE
Take me where the falcon flies, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE

Spark the ashes, free the temple, stem the crimson tide
Toll the bells of Freedom souting
Praise for those who've died
Wield the Sword of Destiny

Take me where the thunder walks, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE
Take me where the falcon flies, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE
A SYMPHONY OF STEELE

If passion denies you, don't die on your knees
Fight with a vengeance what weakness decrees
The Wrath of the Tempest, the cries of the slain
Tragic in splendor, in death you are free
I follow the Sign, bring on the sound of thunder,
bring on the rain
Spirit of Dark Enchantment remember my name!!!

The Statue stares the Apparition smiles
Am I here living in Mystery to the last
When all Gods must die...
I am yours, Pain lives inside of me
To the End when the Final Rain must Fall... Away...

I raise my head I say Farewell

Blackened Eyes, Shadows of Misery
To the End when all Gods must die
I am yours, Death walks inside of me
For the last, for my Requiem... Again...

I Fear the ARMS OF MERCURY Surround me
From the Corners of the World I say goodbye
I know the End is coming soon
From the Margent of the World I say Farewell
I know the pain that I've caused
I know the Lives that were Lost
In this Dark Time the Eyes deny to wash all this Blood from my Hands...
In the End will we all pay this Price...

SPIRITS OF LIVING FIRE!!!

In the night we gather for the slaying of the beast
The chosen kings of fire summoned by the priests
Lord give me strength to crush my enemies
Their pain and their suffering will be music to my ears

BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - wash away my pain, wash away my fate
Let me rise up born again
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - blood runs from the sky, I'm the Lord of flies
On the wings of hate I rise

Soon it will be over abd we'll gather for the feast
Hear the weeping of their woman as they grovel at our feet
The gods have shown their favor, my victory is known
Your gods have proven false, your death is mine to own

BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - wash away my pain, wash away my tears
Let me rise up born again
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - give power to my call, devouring their flesh
Purify as all - RAIN OF FIRE

Like a comet from hell
devouring their flesh

Trample to dust in the fire of lust
With fire we slay all who stand in our way
A covenant bound in the world underground
We slash and we strike see your head on a spike

Once free and so brave, now your people are slaves, oh...
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - the sons of Anu rise, the fields of blood are mine
On a burning horse I ride
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - ravager of towns our covenant is bound
In your kingdom underground
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - rape our enemies, burn their village bright
In a golden wall of light
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - blood runs from the sky, the veils of death divide
And the crucified arise - RAIN OF FIRE!!!

Unholy terror kills the light
Phantom furies whirl
Like a plague above the world
Seductive demons breathe
Writhing lust they take your seed
They're the daughter's of despair
A succubus is here

Black night, in lust descending
Black night, they bring the devil's rain

Feasting on your flesh
They come in different forms
From a lovely nymphet girl
To a beast with scaly horns
Desire turns to greed
Your loins ache for release
Like pollen and the bees
You perpetuate the creed

Black night, in lust descending
Black night, they bring the devil's rain

The succubus lives on your blood and your seed
A vision of hell she delights when you bleed
Desire is torture like thirst without water
So just beware of the girl, in your bed

Virginia Boys,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn.

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill.

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man.

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam

Your lips told me that you would wait
But your lips deceived me and told me a lie
While your heart was sealing my fate

Are you all alone
With a memory
Now that I am gone
Darling, are you missing me

Out of the clear sky a letter then came
And just like a bolt from the blue
My castles came tumbling a I read it o'er

So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, darling, I know so well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night

If that's alright with you

And the shadow that I'm chasing is my only friend 
And I'm sinking in the quicksand 
Cause I never found a place to stand 
And Lord knows, finally I'm a man 

Everybody's got souls to blame 
But the shadows keep it in ache 
My eyes have seen the glory 
But it's lost with every step you take 
Finally you'll know what's wrong 
When the gift that keeps on giving's gone 
But in between these mountains and you 
His soul's still trying to shine again

Virginia O'Brien,"I bought a bonnet to suit my face 
I had my petticoat trimmed with lace 
I looked at the mirror, around I twirled 
And then I went out in the wide, wide world 

I dreamed of gentlemen I would meet 
I saw them all kneeling at my feet 
I can't understand it, my hair is all curled 
But my goodness me, it's a great big world 

[Chorus:]
And it's a cold, cold, cold and we'll soon be old 
Alas and a lack, it's a great big world. 

I learned to sew and I learned to bake 
I even frosted an angel cake 
On Saturday evening, when folks dropped in 
My house was as neat as a brand new pin 

I thought by learning each social grace 
A chap might learn to forget my face 
I can't understand it, I've knitted and pearled 
But my goodness me it's a great big world! 

[Chorus]

I had no petticoat trimmed with lace 
My angel cake was a sure disgrace 
My face was my fortune, my mother said 
And my dancing slippers of bright, bright red. 

A million miles I've danced or more 
In hopes Prince Charming would cross the floor 
I can't understand it, I've Waltzed and I've whirled 
But my goodness me, it's a great big world. 

[Chorus x 2]

But I'll keep on knitting and doing it well

E a se mirar
Na lua triste no céu, meu bem

Se você quiser amor
Vem comigo a Salvador

Bem mais além
Bem mais além do que o fim do mar
Bem mais além

É que ninguém nunca teve mais
Mais do que eu

(George Jones - Bernard Spurlock)
Â« Â© '59 Glad Music Â»
WITH MELBA MONTGOMERY

You cheated on me (you cheated me)
I tried to be fair (I tried to be fair)
But you don't believe enduring your share
But I've learned my lesson (I've learned my lesson)
And now I can say (now I can say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
Your kisses don't thrill me like they used to do
Your arms only chill me I'm glad that we're through
My heart was once yearning (my heart was once yearning)
But now I can say (now I can say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
You fool me a while (you fool me a while)
You thought you were wise (you thought you were wise)
You even believed I fell for your life
But the trick's turned on you (the trick's turned on you)
Now gladly I say (now gladly I say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
Your kisses don't thrill me...

dawn got a different shine
I find that it burns
like a fire on the hearth
I learned this day would come
they were liars from the start
my pride is in my heart
so you'll never know
how far Miguel will go
until they digging up your skeletal
remains I see change
on the horizon
or is it just the next bomber as it flies in
wise men once let me know
if it's not worth it then let it go
or pop first and  dead your foe
now it seems like the options are dropping
there's no more talking
smart bombs are locked in
and more often than not
innocent people gotta get dropped
for their leaders horrible plot
while the one calling the shots
fly free as a bird
words they speak are absurd
though they're frequently heard
'cause they control the radio
it's crazy though
the dj's won't play me though
unless I line their bank account
with crazy dough
and even corporate labels
deep into debt, through spending in deficit
bootlegging and internet
meet the new me see a brain that's been cloned
silicone flesh meshed with titanium bones
I'm aiming my poems, at dictators
reigning on thrones
who raised their seeds cold
in a cradle of stone
then cast them in the street
never gave them a home
the ones who shun the path
that our saviors have shown
we stole all of the crops
that the natives have grown
we must stick together
no one made it alone
'cause radiation give you cancer
in your face from your phone
or your throat from the smoke
when you blazing a bone
when you don't agree with leaders
and behavior they've shown
speak out there's no effect
if your state is unknownI got sick of talking
and caught aids in my poem
now I spit from a coffin
and a grave is my dome
I grown by own body
from dirt and grime
it blows my damn mind
like my brain was a landmine
and I can't find
a path out  this nightmare
does it end right here
or extend for light years?!

Judas did it for the money and so do these world leaders
They cheat us like George Bush at the polls
They hearts must be cold like the winds of the poles
Either that or they lack soul spilling red blood for black gold
Human sacrifice, make me wonder bout nine eleven
What they doin' in the heavens on that space station
And we buggin off grand theft auto
For the PlayStation, what you got faith in
The book of revelations, or media publication
If you ask certain people they all fabrication
Congratulations, to anyone who found they life's purpose
The earth is perfect but the world is flawed
Mistakes are a part of life just learn from yours
They making weapons out of germs for war
AIDS bombs straight through your front door
And I'm sure they got a cure, what they hiding it for?
I've learned greed is a whore with abcess sores
I wouldn't go in her raw, or even touch her
Up in hell's kitchen trying to get a little supper
Hunger pains is a mother, but whatever don't kill us make us tougher

Why do you, want to split our world in two
People tell me true, what are you trying to do? (2x)

[Hashim Misah]
I'm out for presidents to represent me
And I ain't talking bout Bush, he got paper cause his fam is crooks
Man they push more weight then Jay-Z
Off the books and Dick Cheney stay in beef like P, caught in a jux
So felonious, masonic monks and I ain't talking bout Thelonious
Look at the signs, study the times
To make the stock market climb the army get on the grind
Punks jump up in a war get creamed like calomine
On the blocks youths slang rocks like kids in Palestine
It's all unraveling like a dutch, pal o' mine
Get your shit straight, cause death spreads quicker than hate
Gossip in the hood or see-I's upstate
Kid it's easy to get busted down, trusting in clowns
Don't trust every body cause their flesh is brown
I seen devils darker than Wes Snipes banging them pipes
Sixteen heated rounds like a heavy-weight fight
Taking the life of the innocent, scandalous place we livin' in
Tuff love, making plans with omnipotent
Cause we true soldiers, and gettin' older
I got a queen who got my back lifting the world off my shoulders
It's all about family, once you start overstanding me
They can't control us........................................
And we ain't talking g.i. joe bro' it's more like cobrah

[Hook 2x]
[Virtuoso]
From the cradle to the time that your able to watch cable
My fam pray to save you my son these are the days you
Oughta cherish, with faults greater than our merits
We launch assaults from which the salt of the earth could perish
Mostly over which parrish or mosque you attend
Why let religion tear us apart we all men
Or are we the worst kind of animals?
Lifeless mechanical, selfish tyrannical
Like their leader, with heaters aimed for the slaughter
Powerful because he has the same name as his father
Both engaging, in insider trading and nepotism
They so concerned with the weapons system
When will the lesson hit them
There's only so much atmosphere around this astral sphere
So if your blasting there something will happen here
Thunder claps the air, poison gas that's clear
Invades our oxygen, venomous toxins in
Your blood like bites from venomous moccasins
Men have been talking in, riddles for too long
Proving who's strong not planning to move on
We used Saddam to bruise Iran
Confusion ensued to who we'd choose to bomb
Conducting operas, fuck giving choppers ta'
Them cats who's gats are now busting shots at ya'
They trying to topple your regime, the gestapo with the cream
Got plots to cop nukes from russian mafia
By who's poll is George Bush popular?
That's not my leader cheater never would have fought for ya'
You just the lesser of two evils
Who both want the first holocaust since Hitler called jews evil
Why do people need biological weapons
They must want to get in final conflict armmagedon

These words of mad music ringing clear
I drink them in but it's gone too soon

The image deja-vu's again
My head is spinning with a rhapsody
The moment's over but it's not the end
We cry, We sigh, Again we love

The crystal shimmer of a blue sea
Sun kissed beaches, but there's no one there

Reflections, of the place between the sky
It's too black, casting shadows
On the bridges built so close to that aura

Walking (to the sign) before my eyes
Dreaming (it's too late) to realise
Stop! You've gone too far this time
You're toying with reality

Blocks on blocks are all around
Neon lit for silent sound

Figures (in a doorway) in the night
Dancing (moving shadows) with the light
Talking to a stranger
On the bridges built so close to that aura

Standing, on a runway all alone
Listening, to an engine heading home
Crying, on the inside
Wishing I could get away from that aura

Lying, on the runway all alone
Listening to an engine heading home
Stop! you've gone too far this time
You're toying with reality

Watch the sweeping shadows span 'til the night comes
Man and beast in that ancient stance
It's the Horseman
Horseman!

Silhouetting the desert sky in a strange haze
Riding strong with the note, ""I'm high in a strange daze""
Slowly he smiles, silently sighs, slither to black, shading his eyes
Nothing changes, nothing stops the Horseman
Horseman!

The race is on again, the pace is on again
The moves are from the reign,
The straps are pulling hard, the sweat is running hot
The light is dimming fast
His task is almost done, this race is almost won
His journey nears it's end
Fool, passionate delight, cuts through his heart tonight
He screams all night!

I can see them smile at me
Tear apart everything I do
Pulling me down

If your brother won't rock then your sister will

That boy is guilty of loving you

And though you belong to another
And I may not stand a ghost of a chance
I'll tell the world that I love you
And I'm a victim of circumstance
That's been proven guilty, oh, yes, I am

Did you know one touch of your hand

Vision,"I see her face in my dreams – like a star shining all across the sea
I remember this moment – years ago there was only you and me
When I wake up in sadness – I realize my deep wounds never heal 
Living only in memories – all is lost, coldness I can feel

Sky turned darker and darker – soulless voices whispering her name 
End came closer and closer – endless sleep was sweeping in her veins

She faded away – like a rose on a winterday
I remember her last words – please don´t cry for me

Lost in endless night – take me there, where I see you again
Reach out for the light – when will I break my pain
Come and fly with me – all across the raging sea 
Together we will be – when will I ever be free

One night I was dreaming – seemed to me like reality, so clear
A fallen angel inside me – speaks to me, tells me what has to be done
There´s a fire in my heart – burning bright like the glory of a king
For too long I was waiting – now my soul is flowing in the wind

She faded away – like a rose on a winterday
I remember her last words – please don´t cry for me

The threat of your hostility
Your talk behind my back
What the fuck should I do?
Induces my attack
To make myself a man
What the fuck should I do
I'll never give up my pride
I'm doing the best that I can
And I'll never surrender my hate

You're the one who made me this way
Suppressed anger for all these years now

They are all but the pathetic

Therefore their prosperity
It will never ever be granted

What the fuck, I can't breathe
Ask yourself a question, do you need to conform?
Pray for the forgiveness as you're stripped of your rights
With the brain-washing games that are engaged to restrain now
White collared people always seem to decide
The power to cure the power to kill
Worthless
The power is ours we'll use it at will
Complexed is society, waging pressure upon our backs
And punishing our methods with their profits
These lashes killing and it pushes down, breaking our knees deep into the ground
And faulting, on the preside, once again I just can't decide
What's up with this world, what the fuck I can't breathe
Books of knowledge showing their glint forms of torture
Dropping the oppressor is our only solution
Psychanalytical ways will never ever succeed

But we had fought for conformity?

Rearrange and learn from what you've done

Makes me so sick I can't even see
I will prevail

And the good shall return and this I do swear
Though my eyes I have seen your o.k.

Through the heartbreak through the sorrow

A waste of time in the face of indulgence
Sometimes these chains they do claim
Excess is always best

Pulling at the walls of that vanity
Melting, pounding
Scratching out the path beneath your feet

Slice this skin again

To change this world
Is it the solemn faces in the tower?
Is it the weakness?
Convincing eyes-multiple
Contributing to the aggression
Take up arms upon you
That persuades me to
They claim the states in distress
Due to the rise in crime
I feel the manifest
Has broken far west
No one really cares so it's your death
Was it a suicide? Was it a homicide?

Nothing has changed cause nothing was done
To control our resources to contain out pollutants
Well hemp could have saved the world
In fear of your economy
But you're too scared
Tripping, falling, locked out inside
Control, resist products that left us
Slipping, drowning, crumble down
It's running through our veins
Dwindled, endangered, dying extinct
It's gonna end this world
You say we caught this disease
Spread through your culture
We're growing every day
Your children turning to us
The pleasant way is gone

Some people are just too stupid to realize
That they HAD vision for you and I
I'll do my very best to try and fight against
Their invasion coming from the dying fields
Their days of labor withers their alliance
Their generation will rot in the golden grooves
Our generation prevails in the fucking end
To destroy to employ
To cock that gun
One time too many - don't choose this one
One way sight point of view, point of disclaim
Our destruction is for memory

",Suffer,1996
Vision of Disorder,"My perception my infection
Self destruct so addictive
Lazy bloody eyes
Here's a taste of death here's your taste of death
And I wish that I could feel the things you feel
I don't feel content
And through my eyes I see all your disgust
And I wish that I could see the things you see
Stomach still uneasy
You don't understand
Can't escape the hate
And from it I'll run
Put you in the river
And from you I'll hide
Standing in the rain
And I'll cut myself in a muddy cove
So when I die
There will be no
You've made me change so
I'll pull the fuckin' trigger watch your head combust
Processed information makes the world go round
Pull the fuckin trigger watch your head combust
You alienated me and made me the stranger
By pointing your fingers
This disease will spread and infect
So instill the values you protect
I see all your disgust
And through my eyes
Yellow running red becoming
Don't you take my actions
Just waiting for the pain
Turn them against me
I feel myself breakI feel myself breaking




",Through My Eyes,1996
Vision of Disorder,"Viola she watch me reign 
Viola my head engaged 
As she dances the Lilac bloom 
Viola can't watch you 
I Let her into the sun in a jaded shade 
I threw the people in a shallow grave 
And then she dances through the tear in my eye 
I gave them candy 
A mouthful of dirt 
Don't think I forgot 
And don't think I'm so strange 
I ain't your typical human and I'll tear your world apart 
I Left them in their heads 
As I ran their Line 
I've seen their vision as it all did die 
I've seen their faces as they took them to their helm 
I gave them shadows that never emerged 
Father, where did you go? 
Mother, what have you done? 
Well you bashed my head in 
You made me crazy 
Murderer 
I'll murder her 
Shallow days in my eyes 
Something's wrong 
I'll lay you on the ground 
It's too long 
It's too long since I tasted control 
It's too long 
So long since I tasted control. 
In my head I feel my pain 
I saw your game 
All is dead 
I'll cut you down Viola 
I'll cut you down my mother 
I'll cut you down 
Murderer

",Viola,1996
Vision of Disorder,"Get away
I try and try and trying to undo
Get away, that's what they always say
So convincing all that way
Though I can't relate
Though I detest
Choose to neglect all the thoughts of false communication
I will choose to
What they want of me
Though you reject concentrating, contemplating on
What they'll never see
What they perceive is burning in the grass
So this is what you see
Try to lose your own
Confusion as melts upon your back
And you resist in-tact
Come and taste misery
This is this is dread
As it burns on my tongue
Shelter me, bury me
I think I will for your thrill
I think I'll try all this time
Get away-Rage
Where we settle in the paths
As I look as I look on back I realize
The faceless dead



",Watering Disease,1996
Vision of Disorder,"Level, Crumble 
Level by the hatred 
Can't really explain our nature 
Genocide was created 
Blown into the backs of children 
Pushing - miles away 
Down 
There's no acceptance 
There is no control 
Breeding adolence 
Come on 
I said it's to me 
To me there is nothing 
But total annihilation 
Come to us Armageddon 
Give us all what we deserve 
I lack the provision 
I lack the self control 
I lack the way to be 
Will to grow old 
I pull the shotgun close; 
Close to my chest 
Grants me security in the New York City mirth 
Your eyes bleed 
Level, Crumble

",Ways to Destroy One's Ambition,1996
Vision of Disorder,"Litigation got me thinking
In the window all these letters
This will be your own catastrophe
As you wait zone zero
I don't care what you think
I don't care what you say
I don't care about them
I don't care any
I don't care what you think
I don't care what you say
I don't care about them
I don't care anything
No hope - for alliance
No hope - for sadness
No chance - for forgiveness
Nothing - but your misery
Nothing - you can do
As it - melts and grinds you
Inside - pain you spent
In the - misery
Sometimes it will tell
Where you've been and what I've seen
What I've found as I lay
In your ground by your side
Execution
Mass pollution
My solution
Kill the humans
Los Angeles
Engrossed in flame
I don't care what you think
I don't care what you say
I don't care about them
I don't care any
Lost in time in your mind
Nothing's left they all died
I don't care what you think
I don't care what you say
I don't care about them
I don't care anything
Generation caught beneath
All these guns
Out of reach
Where were all your profits during
The atomic Shower of flesh
Ashes
Kiss it goodbye
",Zone Zero,1996
Vision of Disorder,"An undistinguised knot of waste
The man laid open, a soul to test
Feel some pressure
Building in your chest, is this your last breath?

Alone exposed to just blood and bone
An empty practice for the hordes
Ritual
Like complicated insects will

We walk alone
Scouring graveyards
In search of ourselves
We discover strangers

The sleeping eyes of time passed by
What might have been sin or doubt
The side that's dried and petrified
Why mercy's expected is beyond the point of points
Of points....
Of points....

Open up your eyes
Never to realize
Coming from the riverside
Are screams of MERCY...

Cry, we have come too far...
Lonely sunrise, climbing into the sky,
Only to sleep...
Dusted twilight, spilling into moonlight
All our lives we're waiting to die

IN FEAR OF THE RIVER
We trample under a billion stars
And vines that wind over the houses
And past the trees
Smothering everything...

When all drops silent
A grave where no light gets in
The world resents it
When all is placid
A tranquil place in time
Our Earth shattered
We ain't getting by


",By the River,1998
Vision of Disorder,"Leave you, in the depths of a virtual silence
Believe, in the concept of compliance
Never do you ever feel a thing
For the revolution I hope to bring
How long is it gonna be?
Until you see.
Everything you did
Everyone you exploit
May come to destroy you
Don't spend much time with apathy,
Just want you to see catasprophy
That's about to be unleashed
No chance for recovery
Not assuming, you're proving
A thing to me
Cause it's an emotional overload
And it seems to persits
You can't recognize
You can't realize this feeling inside
Just what you trying to prove?
I'm not feeling the things you're feeling
I ai'nt reacting for the things you're giving
All your questions, they irritate
Take compassion, throw it away
Just another dollar for your pocket
I'll do my best to try and stop you
Show you all what I got
I won't stop until you drop
You're pathetic, you hypocrite
I'll stick your face in the shit
What's it gonna take to designate
Rearrange, twist up the fate
A new method to fuel thought
Instead of being sold you're being bought!
How's it feeling, to know you're stealing
From the ones who feel
I will, hurt you, break you
Replace you with hate
I must lacerate, exterminate
All the weakness within
I know it was a waste
Self injecting my own resurrection
CHORUS
I bet you want to take this all the way
If you could, I bet you would
One more thing I have to say
Now is the time to be rid of the flakes
The ones playing the part of the fake


",Clone,1998
Vision of Disorder,"Pathetic creatures,
Walking endless,
Pathetic species,
Lost in a myth
Breeding like rats,
Glorious glimpse at the heavens
Casting down on shallow threads
Over horizons that lay unlimited
Sunlight upon my face
Crazy world, crazy girl
Lost in the sunlight
Slaughtered, murdered
Over tragic century
Spreading claiming
A victim's plea
Don't find me misleading, deceiving
I am what I seem
A symbol a product a broken culture

but, bruised, stoned, drunk, 
Walking dead...
I don't need your conclusion, 
I don't need your reason
I will live the life I wanna live
Help me Jesus I can't,
Give what they want me to give
Only lost highways I stray
Towards the sunlight,
Where no one dares to wear a face

all colors blend,
Into sunlight
Rain down on me
Crazy world, crazy girl
In the sunlight.
What of the horrors, what of the hate
What of the fear, that we all face.
In you in me... b/c of our skin
We separate, retaliate the colors collide 
In attempt to fuckin' survive
A twisted culture

CHORUS
Into the streets again, we all try to defend
A sacred place to feel safe. It's like a 
Mockery of a society that's been laid
To waste with no chance. a place of broken 
Dreams a place where nothing seems just 
What it seems to be. 
I try to open my eyes to a much 
Brighter light.

but it seems to be, dying,
Taking us to the grave.... 


",Colorblind,1998
Vision of Disorder,"You look me straight in the eyes
It's like a reaction felt straight to the heart

makes me feel like I've been alive
Makes me wonder if I got he strength to carry on
Not just to get by

what's with you son?
A fatal vision not the only one
It's like sand in my face
I feel the blood drip in my eyes

it's like a constant picture inside
Never fades, never slips away
It stays imprinted inside

I slipped again, underneath again
Eyes slip back into the head
I see the pictures again
I grit my teeth in my sleep
A shallow imprint, step to the grave
You ain't getting far,
You're a walking stone
You ain't getting very far

where you gonna run
When you're running from yourself
You look up to me
Believe me,
Believe

I'll tear you apart
Cause I ain't one to fuck with
Someday I'll cut you just like they cut me
So look me straight in the eyes

vengeance and hate runs deep
I'll always know where you sleep


",Imprint,1998
Vision of Disorder,"When something so special
Seems to slide away
The truth is most lethal
It's breathing in your face.
When you coming to me,
Tell me what's going on
Holding your head up high
There's no shame in letting go
What happened to you and I
Thought you would never leave me
When smoke gets in your eyes
Trust in me
We all wander out in the night
Under starlight
I just need one more fix
To keep me away from it
I beg, I plead for you to
Leave me!
Cause it's killing me and dragging me down
Cuts and bruises
Bruises and scabs
It's getting really hard to laugh
At these tears as the crystal's gleam
3 days and still no sleep
I wait for dead to come to me!
If you were to give me your hand
I'd make you understand
If I were to leave you behind
It would only be a matter of time
Before we meet again....



",Jada Bloom,1998
Vision of Disorder,"Count down everyday in life,
Held down, now you feel confined
Walls keep closing in,
Still I got my grip
Never to lose it
Some are confused, somefeel the shame
Always left out in the rain
Some say the other, needs to be smothered
Place the balme
It's time to reignite the flame
No time to recognize the pain
One chance to rise above the rest
Now you know what I mean
Never giving in
Alert always on point
Expect nothing but the best
Commit break away today
Accept forms of change
'Cause it's in you, 'cause it's in me
Evolution of the mind
Life is a sea, life is a lie
It ain't gonna stop for anyone
Why you trying to hold me?
Can't you see your never gonna hold me
No one's clock is ever gonna own me
'cause I'm too strong and I lead a smart life
Educated, re?????? Through insight
Refined through years of discipline
If it's me against you I'm gonna win
Defeat is a word I never knew
Now is yo;ur chance what the fuck you gonna do
All oy you have a chance to be something
Don't let it slip away
Could of but you never did
Would of forever's in the past
Should of were you afraid
Of what you would find
You can't trust it
Subjection to an illnes
You know what you see, ain't what it seems
Now you're grasping to no avail
Why you reaching for my hand
Save it for someone who gives a fuck
'cause it's all in my heart


",Landslide,1998
Vision of Disorder,"I've been trying to bring myself away,
Breaking down the walls
Of misuse, the abuse 
The unfortunate temptations
There is only death!
Feeding off of me,
These locusts of the dead earth
Give it to me 
I swear I'm feigning 
Time I gave it ways, 
Time I let it get by 
Let it slip on through my fingers 
Never asking why, never justified, 
Allegations against me 
I told you, there is only death 
In the canyons 
Cut out your infections 
To the locusts of the dead earth 
I want you to see what I mean 
I want you to be where I've been 
Still is stand and fight 
I will weed out the fake 
Never look over my shoulder 
To hesitate, deliberate, I won't be
Your brother! 
FAKE FUCK! 


",Locust of the Dead Earth,1998
Vision of Disorder,"Rebirth, what the fuck did you think you would see
A burnt out complexion staring at me
Rebirth of tragedy
You've been tripping, I've been growing
Deeper inside I feel like this in me
I've lived it, I've been it,
The addict you've become
So what you got for me
Scraping the plate
I always knew you'd come,
I always knew you'd fall on down
Collision of the blue lights the drag
Deeper comes the ring in my eyes
I think I'm seeping out of my skin
You know it's all a part of my head
Came down, you came down
Scraping the plate
Rebirth of tragedy
The mouths move with no voices
I smeared your face again
My face against the wall
I've been coming far too close
So what you got for me
Scraping the plate
I always knew you'd fall..
Down


",Rebirth of Tragedy,1998
Vision of Disorder,"Push it
You feel it, you feel sick
Kill yourself
Bleed the vein
The dogs are calling
The dogs are calling
My name through the trees
Confusion comes clear in the depths of the blur
Time can't save you, time won't spare you
I now it hurts, I know it burns
But someday you'll see
True faith absorbed the needle's plunge
Sister don't follow me
I walked down a road, now I will never leave
Push it, pull it, let the blood run over the skin
These tears, these tears are only revealing half the sin
9 to 5, to the bone, all your lives,
You're just killing time
Where to go?
So kill yourselves, bleed that vein, dogs are calling
Confusion will come to those who run

",Twelve Steps to Nothing,1998
Vision of Disorder,"Words no action.
Spineless bastards
Your world's a joke.
You better watch your step
Where you put your foot.
Where you pointing that finger
All your ignorance
Your talking so much shit
Seems like a degree of jealousy
I can't break from the hate I feel
It's too late can't go change the tide
You were the one to talk
With your scattered accusations
Nothing but a punk caught up in the masses
Up in you, what the fuck you gonna do
Go bitch go get your friends
Your all so superficial so god damn predictable
Suckers until the end
I've been living in too much sin
Someday you shall see the light
By then dust and bone.
I'll break every tooth in your face
It's too late you should have kept away
You were the one to talk with
Scattered accusations
You're nothing but a punk caught up in the masses
Watch what you're saying
Watch what you're doing
Cause people are subjected to change
I ain't slipping
I ain't leaving
Be straight when you come at me
No standards, just actions
I'm pushing past the point of success
So you best check yourself
When you're talking your shit
Where you're getting your facts from
For your information
I never sunk the needed
Only time can bleed the vein
I told you I've been 
Living in too much fucking sin
Someday you shall see the light
By then dust and bone.
Biting on cool lips below
Searching for the sun
Mindless bastards
Pointing fingers
Mindless bastards
Your world's a joke..
",Up in You,1998
Vision of Disorder,"Pulled from the innocence
Arms of deliverance
Mouths of forgiveness
Tongues of ignorance
Let your minds lead the way
Be yourself and you shall find
It's gonna be a long hard road
And to wherever you roam
Look for me under red sky
Feed the fire with a flame
Be yourself but don't abstain
We're all free, all the same
Prosper and live, prosper and gain
I know that nothing's perfect
I feel that we're connected
To you I can give
Through all, you can live
I feel like I never have before
And I think that I'll survive
To walk a million endless nights
Introspection - what you are
Dig in deeper - to see what you are
What you are and what you could become
'cause we're not living in a world that's giving
It's only matter of fact That we can all just extract
Any form of virus
So if you decide to explode 
Look to me, not yourself, come to me
Start a new beginning
Stop your wasted dreaming
Life is too short for questions
That don't provide the answers


",What You Are,1998
Vision of Disorder,"Dangerous roads unravel inside of me.
I feel so hollow,
The darkest pills I've swallowed.
God won't you take me.
I've got to get myself away,
In the shadows I'll always be 
Hidden from the eyes that stare,
Come and take a chance if you dare.
Broken years and shattering eyes,
Scars that keep me alive.
A lesson lost is a lesson learned,
And in the end, we all burn.
The strength of one's spine is all in the eyes...
I tear my brain out endlessly,
Searching for something that will never be.
No rest, never to expect something of this world,
'cause this world owes me nothing.
Submission.
What you deserve is what you will get in the end
No handouts.
All your receiving in what you've given to me!


",Adelaide,1999
Vision of Disorder,"I've often wondered about the demons coming in the pale skirts of midnight,
I never really paid much attention to them though.
I knew they were coming (and they came).
And it made me sick to see myself all broken down,
Couldn't get a grip,
On my dour self,
As I slipped into a state of disbelief...
Don't even think for a second,
Don't you put your filth and guilt on me,
Don't you put your filthy hands on me,
Don't you say you ever believed in me when you did nothing but lead me....
Into a forest of nothing but darkness
With no thought regardless of my heart relentless,
Processed...
Something is broken and I can't recover,
I saw the waves were crashing,
My arms were bleeding,
My eyes deceived me,
My eyes will bleed...
To trust and to sleep,
To trust,
To deceive,
Never in my life have I ever felt such,
Desperation...
Progressed...
Never felt so alone,
I couldn't face tomorrow,
Because the sting of today,
Has left me here in dismay.
Under the sheets of green,
Just recollecting,
I told myself,
Never shed a tear for you and those who are alike,
And so I turned away.
And I never look back...
Something is broken and I can't recover...
So I saved myself from your fuckin' misery,
That lingers reputed relation,
I'm falling to function,
Because of temptation,
We should fuck ourselves...
Don't talk to me about your love....
