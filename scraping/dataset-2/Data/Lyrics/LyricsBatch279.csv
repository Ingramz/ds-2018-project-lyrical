Freddie Hubbard,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001
Freddie Hubbard,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2002
Freddie Hubbard,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2009
Freddie Hubbard,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon/Ornithology,2009
Freddie Hubbard,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",Lover Come Back To Me/Quicksilver,2009
Freddie Hubbard,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,2012
Freddie Hubbard,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Belle,2015
Freddie Hubbard Quintet,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,2017
Freddie Jackson,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down",Good Morning Heartache,1985
Freddie Jackson,"Got someone else to keep you warm.
You've been seen in cozy places,
But there's a calm before the storm.
Like hes been seen with other faces.
Folks say he changes with the night,
To break her heart is second nature.
Oh girl hell never do you right.
I'm warning you your hearts in danger,
But you can put your love on me,
And you wont be lonely.
Ill be waiting patiently, 'cause I love you only.
He can never love you like I do, like I do.
No hell never ever love you, baby, like I do.
Ooh hell never ever need you, need you,
Half as much as I do, like I do.
He could never want you, never want you baby, like I do.
I know I can be over sensitive.
Well I wouldn't if you didn't mean so much to me.
The grass always seems greener,
Over on the other side, you see.
But you can bet your love on me,
Girl you wont be lonely, no,
I'm into you totally, you see,
You see I love you only.
I see that fire in your eyes,
And all this passion comes as no surprise.
Here's hoping soon you'll recognize,
But until then let me emphasize,
Na, na, na, na, na
Hell never love you, like I do, na, na, na, na, no.
Bet your love on me,
Bet your love on me, and you wont be lonely.
I'm into you totally,
Totally cause I love you only.
Hell never ever ever, like I do, never, not like",He'll Never Love You (Like I Do),1985
Freddie Jackson,"Woke up this morning with a smile upon my face
Had a dream last night that love was here to stay
To know you're not here with me is tearing me apart
Can't you feel the pain that's down inside of my heart?

[Chorus: x2]
Gotta feelin' somethin' here is bound to change
Love is just a touch away

Something is happening I think you ought to know

I remember when I first heard your name
Janay, still I get the rush
That I get that day I laid eyes on you

Janay
Memories floatin' my mind seems like yesterday
It chills up and down my spine
How can I go on feeling this way?
How can I go on another day?

Janay, Janay, how could something so right go so wrong?
Janay, how could I let your beauty slip away?
Janay, to get you back there is nothing I would not pay

That I shared with you, Janay

Your emotions they hide within
You've got your heart securely locked away
And you won't let nobody in

I can teach you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

CHORUS
Have you ever loved somebody
Can you learn to love somebody
When somebody loves you (can you tell me please)
Have you ever known that feeling
Ooh that special feeling (don't it feel good)
When somebody loves you

Oh, When you think that it's safe, girl
Just take a look around
I will be there behind you
There's nothing to fear, no
‘Cuz I can never hurt you
I think the world about you
Can you learn to love me, too
Can you learn to love me, too

Mmm, I can teach you how to love again (love again)
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

CHORUS 2x ",Have You Ever Loved Somebody,1996
Freddie Jackson,"They can take all my money
That won't bring me pain
The power of love inside me
Beats all material things

I don't wanna lose your love
Cause you mean the world to me
I don't wanna lose your love
And all that we've come to be

As we lay here together
And I'm so into you

Than the things that we do, no

Something I've been longing to say
Lately you've been distant
Growing further every day

A heartbreak is a hard thing
And it's something we don't have to do

So hear me out, so hear me out

Just look around, baby
Look around and you're gonna see
Just look around, baby
No one's gonna love you like me

So you tell me what you're feeling
Has nothing to do with me
I know imagination's
Not getting the best of me, no

Still the feeling's changing
Where's the magic in your touch
And the world you used to love so much?
Can you help me out? Can we work it out?

Just look around, baby
Look around and you're gonna see
Just look around, baby
No one's gonna love you like me

Sometimes it's all a big surprise

But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

And share your dreams with me

Is the one thing you can't see

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I dreamed the only woman I ever loved
People, turned her back on me
Let me tell you little more about the dream

I dream of working a graveyard shift
For the long nights a week
When I left home my baby's in bed
My baby, she was fast asleep

When I'm done sick of my job
And I had to go home
And when I got there my bed was empty
My baby she was gone

It couldn't let this worry
It all happened in my sleep
All the things that has been so bad
And I don't want you from seven to seven next weekend

And that's why, that's why, that's why I had a dream
Lord, that's worrying me

It was twenty years ago, I was about fourteen years old,
When I first heard that Wolfman's howl.
He sneaked me through the door, there was whisky on the floor, 
And the fuzz they were on the prowl
 It seems so long ago,
I'm living on the Highway now

He's a giant of a man, He always understands 
The very best notes to use
His hand make two of mine, his heart beat right on time
He taught me how to sing the blues
He's the reason why I choose to live on the highway now

I played the blues with Walter, and Muddy pulled me through
I know a Jimmy Rogers song or two
But there's one thing I know, no matter where I go
I can do a little howling too
That's why I sing these blues, I'm living on the highway now

The years have come and gone but the blues still go on

Oh the wind it is high tonight 
I keep lookin' for my baby but she's not in sight 
And I would like to start all over again

Baby can I change my mind

Baby can I change my, my mind

I want ya'll to play this at funerals in the hood. 

Til all this black on black crime stop. 

Some say the blind lead the blind. 

But in the ghetto you never know  

When it's gon be yo time. 

[Sons of Funk  Mo B. Dick  O'dell] 

Sittin at the ghetto thinkin bout 

All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!) 

Candy painted cadillacs and triple gold 

That's how me and my boys rolled 

How could it be? 

Somebody took my boy from me 

My best friend's gone 

And I'm so all alone 

I really miss my homies 

Even though they gone away 

I know you in a better place 

And I hope to see ya soon someday 

[Master P] 

I used to hang with my boy even slang with my boy 

Used to bang with my boy, goddam I miss my boy 

We started out youngstas in the park throwin birds 

In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt 

The game got me workin, got me perkin, never jerkin 

Still blowin dolja fo ya cause I know you up there workin 

Ya little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight 

But today's a sad day to see the t-shirt with ya face 

From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall 

In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall 

In the projects you's a legend on the street you was a star 

But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin in that black car 

A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried 

You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire 

Why soldiers ride for yo name leave it vain 

Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change 

Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall 

The ghetto persons that lost they loved ones to these ghetto scandals 

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!) 

Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli) 

All my homies who done made it to the crossroads 

(Biggie Smalls) 

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell] 

How could it be? 

Somebody took my boy from me 

(It's like I can't believe you gone) 

My best friend's gone 

(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on) 

And I'm so all alone 

(Everytime I see something you done left 

I really miss my homies 

(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg) 

Even though they gone away 

(I just keep reminiscin) 

I know you in a better place 

(Cause I know you alright) 

And I hope to see ya soon someday 

(And I keep smilin, knowin I'm a see you in the crossroads] 

[Pimp C] 

We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys 

But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy 

Off in the club smokin weed til 3, hollerin at the hoes 

Spendin $4000 on me on gators and clothes 

When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game 

Nigga told me, ""see, leave that dope, cause rappin is yo thang"" 

I ain't gone even lie, some nights I ride and cry 

Wonderin why the real niggas always the ones to die 

So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind 

I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time 

I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs 

For all the niggas in the game that be sellin ki's 

I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong 

But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone 

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell] 

Even though you gone away 

(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon be forgotten) 

I know you in a better place 

(Cause as long as I'm here 

You gon live through me and other TRU playas) 

I really miss my homies 

Even though they gone away 

I know you in a better place 

And I hope to see ya soon someday 

[Silkk] 

I'm just sittin here dazed thinkin bout all the times we had 

Thinkin the past, some was good and some was bad 

Remember Dante? 

It was a group of us, just a group of five 

Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive 

To all my soldiers before me, may ya'll rest in peace 

When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies 

He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me 

Wishin I could rewind time like demos 

Me and you gettin girls, writin down numbers like memos 

Makin million dollar bets, makin all our money stretch like limos 

Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry 

But if I close my eyes and visualize me together 

Then I suddenly want to smile 

To see you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up 

You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us 

Even though you was wrong, I never could belive that that was true 

You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos 

See me and see and P forever gon be ridin and thuggin 

Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it 

And rest in peace to my brother 

We gon miss you 

(I love these fools) 

I know you in a better place 

(Every time I get on my knees) 

And I hope to see ya soon someday 

(I pray for you, I'm glad you in a better place 

I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin 

Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)",Brandy,1997

It's so hard to believe this is happening to me
An amazing feeling coming through...

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

I want to love you, I love every little thing about you
I want to love you, love you, love you
Born to love you, born to love you, yes I was born to love you
Born to love you, born to love you every single day of my life

Freddie Mercury,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember","Goin' Back [Larru Lurex, 1973 B-Side]",2006

Freddie Mercury,"While you are imagining, imagine for instance,
The sights that you can take advantage of
Look at the beautiful cloud formations below you and above you
This could be heaven

Think of the colour of the sun as it shines off the clouds
In these days, in these days, in these days of cool reflection
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections

You sit by me and everything's fine
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone

This world could be free, this world could be one,
In this world of cool deception
Just smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection

You come to me, soothe my troubled mind
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be one
We should bring love to our daughters and sons

Love, love, love, love
(This could be heaven for everyone)
So take a seat and sit by my side a while
You know I like your style

(This could be heaven for everyone)
So what can we do to clean up this mess
Just feel so helpless
This could be heaven for everyone

So lift up your voice at least you'll have cared
At least you'll have dared
Listen. What people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals

Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone

This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone etc.
And this is the end of this section.",Heaven For Everyone,2013

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

Ah, that you used to say?
(Spoken): Did you mean it baby?
Of a house with a lovely, lovely garden,
And a little baby some day.
Ah!  Tell me, where did I go wrong, honey?
Whatever changed your mind, baby?
I've asked myself these questions over a million times, baby, baby.
(Oh! How could you do it!)
 
My Whole World Ended the moment you left me, Yeah, baby. 
Honey, My Whole World Ended the moment you left me.
It tumbled down to the ground, baby, baby, baby.
 
Now my body is numb, I feel so senseless to the touch,
My life is so wasted without you, 
I guess I loved you much too much.
How can I face tomorrow, 
When yesterday is all I see?
I just don't wanna face tomorrow, if you're not sharing it with me.
Baby, baby, 
(Tell me why.)

Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space

Somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person and still in love with you

Freddy Cole,"Lady, morning's just a moment away, 
And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Cause I needed you so desperately.
We were too blind to see, but then,
Most of all, I do love you",Still,2005
Freddy Cole,"This love of mine goes on and on, 
Though life is empty since you have gone. 
You're always on my mind, though out of sight, 
It's lonesome through the day, 
But oh the night. 
I cry my heart out, it's bound to break, 
Since nothing matters, let it break. 
I ask the sun and the moon, 
The stars that shine, 
What's to become of it, 
This love of mine.",This Love of Mine,2005
Freddy Cole,"What now my love
Now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb
I've become unreal

I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul
What now my love
Now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars
Tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

What now my love
Now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die

What now my love
Now there is nothing
Only my last goodbye

Because of you my romance had its start
Because of you the sun will shine
The moon and stars will say you're mine

It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you my life is now worthwhile

Blame it on my youth.
If only for you I did exist,
Blame it on my youth.

You meant more than anything,
All the world to me!

If you were on my mind all night and day,
Blame it on my youth.
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray,
Blame it on my youth.

If I cried a little bit
When first I learned the truth,
Don't blame it on my heart,

Walk with me in the gentle rain.
Don't be afraid, I've a hand for your hand,

They are warm, like the gentle rain.
Come little one, you have me in the world
And our love will be sweet, very sweet.

Every day would be
The first day of Spring
Every heart would have
A new song to sing
And we'd sing of the joy
Every morning would bring

If I ruled the world
Every man would be
As free as a bird
Every voice would be
A voice to be heard
Take my word
We would treasure each day
That occurred

My world would be
A beautiful place
Where we would weave
Such a wonderful dream
My world would wear
A smile on its face
Like the man in the moon
When the moon beams

If I ruled the world
Every man would say
The world was his friend
There'd be happiness
That no man could end
No my friend
Not if I ruled the world

Would be held up high
There'd be sunshine
In everyone's sky

Brought such a flame to me
Then let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye
With every new love you'll come back to me
In other eyes it's you I'll see

If I love again, though it's someone new
If I love again, it will still be you

In someone's else's fond embrace
I'll close my eyes and see your face

Freddy Cole,"Will I ever find the boy in my mind
The one who is my ideal?
Maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass him by
And never even know that he is my ideal?

Freddy Cole,"Once in a while won't you try to give one little thought to me,
Though someone else may be nearer your heart.

Once in a while won't you dream of the moments I shared with you,
Moments before we two drifted apart.

If love can remember that spark may burn again.

Knowing you think of me once in a while.",Once in a While,2007

On graduation day
You handed me your book
I signed this way

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you

We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you

Then I went far away

And you found someone new
I read your letter dear
And I wrote back to you

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
Good luck God bless you too

Is that your little girl
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book, too

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.

Freddy Johnson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1998

She sat down beside the little Swedish boy and they began to dream

Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, and a brawla, brawla sooit 
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, and a brawla sooit
Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, add a little brawla, brawla too it

The brawla is the boy and girl, the Hut-Sut is their dream
The sooit is the teacher who caught them by the stream

Hut-Sut Rawlson on the Rillerah, and a brawla sooit

Now the boy and girl are back in school, shattered is their dream

In love with a beautiful dream
But they love to sing, swing all the live long day

Mein Kind sei nicht traurig, tut auch der Abschied weh
Dein Herz geht an Bord und fort muss die Reise gehen
Dein Schmerz wird vergehen und schön wird das Wiedersehen

Mich trägt die Sehnsucht fort in die blaue Ferne
Unter mir Meer und über mir Nacht und Sterne
Vor mir die Welt. So treibt mich der Wind des Lebens
Wein' nicht mein Kind, die Tränen sie sind vergebens

Nur Erinnerung an Stunden der Liebe
Bleibt noch an Land zurück

Wenn der Sturmwind sein Lied singt
Dann winkt mir der großen Freiheit Glück

Wie blau ist das Meer?
Wie groß kann der Himmel sein?
Ich schau hoch vom Mastkorb
Weit in die Welt hinein

Nach vorn geht mein Blick
Zurück darf kein Seemann schauen
Kap Horn liegt auf Lee
Jetzt heißt es auf Gott vertrauen

Seemann gib Acht, denn strahlt auch als Gruß des Friedens
Hell in der Nacht das leuchtende Kreuz des Südens
Schroff ist das Riff und schnell geht ein Schiff zugrunde
Früh oder spät schlägt jedem von uns die Stunde

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Two millionaires with a dream are we,

Two millionaires with a dream are we,
We'll make our love survive

No little cold water flat have we,
Warmed by a glow of insolvency,
Up to your necks in security.
How can love survive?
How can I show what I feel for you?
I cannot go out and steal for you,
I cannot die like Camille for you.

How can love survive?
You millionaires with financial affairs 
Are too busy for simple pleasure.
When you are poor it is toujours l'amour,
For l'amour all the poor have leisure!

Caught in our gold plated chains are we,
Lost in our wealthy domains are we,
Trapped by our capital gains are we,
But we'll keep romance alive.
Trapped by your capital gains are we,
We'll (You'll) make our (your) love survive!",How Can Love Survive?,1988

Frederica Von Stade,"She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee
Her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair
I even heard her singing in the abbey

She's always late for chapel
But her penitence is real
She's always late for everything
Except for every meal
I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

I'd like to say a word in her behalf

How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?

A will-o'-the wisp! 
A clown!

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather
She's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!

She'd out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle! She is wild!
She's a riddle! She's a child!
She's a headache! She's an angel!
She's a girl!

Frederica Von Stade,"You dear attractive dewy-eyed idealist,
Today you have to learn to be a realist.

You may be bent on doing deed of daring due,
But up against a shark, what can a herring do?

Be wise, compromise.
Compromise, and be wise!
Let them think you're on their side, be noncommittal.
I will not bow my head to the men I despise!
You won't have to bow your head to stoop a little.
Why not learn to put your faith and your reliance,
On an obvious and simple fact of science?

A crazy planet full of crazy people,
Is somersaulting all around the sky.
And every time it turns another somersault,
Another day goes by.
And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it.
No, you can't stop it even if you tried.
So, I'm not going to worry,
No, I'm not going to worry,
Every time I see another day go by.

While somersaulting at a cockeyed angle,
We make a cockeyed circle 'round the sun.
And when we circle back to where we started from,
Another year has run.

And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it,
If the earth wants to roll around the sun.
You're a fool if you worry.
You're a fool if you worry,
Over anything but little number one.

That's you!
That's I!
And I!
And me!
That all absorbing character.
That fascinating creature.
That super special feature,
Me!

So every star on every whirling planet,
And every constellation in the sky,
Revolves around the center of the universe,
That lovely thing called, I.

And there's no way to stop it.
No, there's no way to stop it,
And I know, though I cannot tell you why (sigh).

Et reviendrons à la verdure
Nous évanouir dans la nature
Vous oublierez les lâches anarchies
Mon trône vous sera promis
Nous resterons assis entre deux mondes
Sans jamais avoir à choisir
Seulement le bonheur de vieillir
Sur d’autres terres que nous rendrons
fécondes
Bénissons ces têtes blondes
Quand vous en serez là
Moi, j’attendrai à la pointe du jour
Une étreinte d’amour
Une étreinte d’amour
Et je me tiendrai droit
Le dernier homme à la pointe du jour
Vos défuntes amours
Un ultime secours
Et je me tiendrai droit

Aux naissantes amours
Je vous ferai la cour

Frederick Dvonch,"An ordinary couple
Is all we'll ever be,
For all I want of living
Is to keep you close to me,
To laugh and weep together
While time goes on its flight,
To kiss you ev'ry morning
An to kiss you ev'ry night.

We'll meet our daily problems
And rest when day is done,
Our arms around each other 
In the fading sun.

Across the years we'll ride, 
Our arms around each other
Our children by our side,

A very good place to start
When you read, you begin with--

[SUNG] Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name, I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will lead us back to Do, oh, oh, oh

Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will lead us back to Do
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do-- So-- Do

[SPOKEN] Now, children, once you have these notes in your head, you can sing a
million tunes by mixing them up--like this:
[SUNG] So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re... [SPOKEN] Now you do it.
[CHILDREN] So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re
[MARIA] So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do

[SUNG BY ALL] So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re
So, Do, La, Ti, Do, Re, Do
[LITTLE GIRL] But it doesn't mean anything!
[MARIA] So we put in words--one word for every note:

You can sing most an--why--thing. [SPOKEN] Together!

Frederick Fennell,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night

Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

    Some gamblers who lost when my fixed dice were tossed,
    Still pursue me, but haven't a trace,
    I'm sort of a cad, tho not totally bad,
    There are places I can't show my face!

It's an actor's life for me! Being who I choose to be!
Thinking lines on a page, I'm always on stage!
It's an actor's life, it's an actor's , actor's life for me!

    No personna I'm not, with the talent I've got!
    It's an actor's life, it's an actor's, actor's life for me!
    An actor's life you bet!
