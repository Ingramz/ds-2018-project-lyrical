Starshine, they ain't gonna find me

Stand easy with myself, with myself
Jumping up, I'm low, low, low, low

Leviticus, oh

Snatch a piece of my wonderin'
Distant-far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like
Skin of my boot like
Fly in my soup like
Where's the waitress?
Can't take this, really, can't finish this?
These years and all these creatures

It's my mistake, I'll make it
J-dub to the boom now make it
Bounce-wiggle bounce-wiggle
Shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cutthroats
Bound to blow the brain out

Cut to the brain
This ain't no game
I'll show no shame
I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted Cain
I'll twist again
I'll push the blade
As plain as day

Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
It's you and who and you-know-where
We's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear
We happy or we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart, from start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach
The soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth ovah
We turn up the o-god

All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone
All alone, all alone

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be
Come and save the night
'Cause I don't leave
When the morning comes, it doesn't 
Seem to say an awful lot to me

Jamie Hewlett,"In demon days, it's cold inside
You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there
All the glasses are too big
Bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that yet you don't want me back
Before it fall down, falling down falling down
Falling out to go far from the soul

Well these demon days are so cold inside
It's so hard to live, and so to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause Mother Earth has a soul to leave
When lies become reality
You love yourself because it's easy
Pick yourself up it's a brand new day
So turn yourself round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
Turn yourself around to the soul

Jamie Hewlett,"Got off a plane to the countryside
I drove to the mountain and holding the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead

Don't go over the edge, eh
You'll make a big mistake, hey

So no loose ends
Nothing to see me down
How are we going to work this out

Dreams aren't bad, I had turned back
I love the girl
But God only knows it's
Getting hard to see the sun coming through
I love you
But what are we going to do

Picture on the dreamer
I'll take you deeper
Down to the sleepy glow
Time is a low

Jamie Hewlett,"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured, as it was, by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excessive violence that was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses, but no one noticed them
They only saw shadows you see, without the truth to the eyes
The happy folk were blind

Falling out of airplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead

In time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
It's rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world

Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?

And as the strange folk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain
Holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the monkey would stir from it's deep sleep
Then there came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany so immense
That it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called monkey had spoken
There was only fire, and then
Nothing

Oh little town in USA, the time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you want
But where were you when it all came down on me?
Did you call me out?",Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head,2005
Jamie Hewlett,"Who put me down on the bottom of the food chain

No split clown bum 
Your old hit sound dumb 
Hold it now, crown 'I'm

Got 'em 'round town 
Coulda drowned in it 
Woulda floated bloated 

Voted sugar coated 
Loaded hip shooter 
Draw for the poor 
Free coffee at the banks 
Hit through the straw 
None more for me, thanks 

That blanks the raw 
That dang sure stank lit 
Sank passed the pit for more hardcore prank spit 

Crank it on blast 
Roll past front street 
Blew the whole spot

Juiced off a junk treat

My guess is yes you can 
Like, can I kick it?
Wicked 
Liquor shot 
If you happy and you know it 
As you clap your hands to the thick snot 
Of a poet flowin' 
Broke a pen and I'm in cope hymen 
Dope or rhymin all worth it then 
The Hope Diamond 
Required off the blackmarket 
Or wire tappin' 
Couldn't target a jar of spit 
The rapid fire spark lit 
Zzzz! 
A rapper bug zapper 
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or a dapper 
Plug yer trap or it's maximum exposure 
The beast got family in numbers asking 'em for closure 
Aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em clean it 
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it 
She wore a filled-in thong 
A billabong 
And said, nah, fo'realla 
The Villain on a Gorilla jawn?

Jamie Hewlett,"Oh, oh
Oh, green world
Don't desert me now
Bring me back to fallen town
Where someone is still alive

Fighting for something new in this
When no one needs the heart of me and I'll
Get out somewhere other than me before

(Than me before)

O green world
Don't deserve me now
I'm made of you and you of me
But where are we?
Oh no

Sells to lie
Phone with talk, you stars
Suppose you
Down when you're in fast
'Cause it seems so little to you

But now you're in love, you know
You know, me too
You know, me too
I hope sex and drugs rust into my self, holy

It feels like you're with your father in the place you love",O Green World,2005

Down lowly
Make up for the time you've wasted
Come slowly
And claim back the boy you left behind

Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out
To the stars
Get on the fame

The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, all played out
They said the memories
All fade out, fade out, all fade out
Tell me did you feel that?

Don't slow down
Even if it's only to escape
Just down, low down
Before somebody steals your place man

Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out
To the stars
Get on the fame
And the conversation's over

We're all played out, played out, all played out

And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

If you believe me to let me be
But if you do,
You guess you know what I'm about to say

[Chorus: x2]",Hurricane,2008
Jamie Lidell,"Just the sound of your voice
Drowning out all my noise
When you call my name mysteriously
All the source to let me see

[Chorus]
Little bit of feel good goes a long way
I need your touch to get me through my day
Watching you sleeping I pray
Please don't make my feel good go away

Just a look of those eyes, cutting through my smokey skies
And the parts of me that grow from you
Cleared my vision so that I could see

[Chorus]

Just the smell of you hair follows me everywhere
Your sweet alchemy turned trouble to gold
Transforming it all to let me know

Little bit of feel good goes a long way
I need your touch to get me through my day
Watching you sleeping I pray

Jamie Lidell,"My doctor told me I was not a machine
She told me that I better let off some steam
But I didn't hear a word she said
There's too much pressure building in my head
When I got to go, I got to go
So I thought I'd let you know

Gotta get this out of my system
Gotta get this out of my system
Gotta get this out of my system

They'll tell you there's nothing nobody knows
But it's getting a little out of hand

Used to be so silent now I'm not so sure
Got so overloaded I can't take it no more

Before you watch your man explode

Tear deep between you and me
All night dynamite can't you see
Just sit back and enjoy the show
Cause I'm a human pressure cooker
And I'm about to blow, yeah

Now there's a lot of talk but I'm not listening
I'm hoping there's a point that we're all missing
And all I really know
Is one day we all got to go
But before it's all over and done
I'm about to have me some fun yeah

So where are you going?
Time to give up, time to give up knowing
Your shoes don't care which way they're going
So who are you following?
Time to give up, time to give up tiredness

So many things I don't understand
But there's one thing that I know
When everything is a rope of sand
We should be learning to let it go

Don't wanna win, don't wanna lose
So where does that lead you?
Trying to give up, trying to give up trying
The games don't care if you see right through them
So who are you fooling?
Time to give up, time to give up playing now

So many things I don't understand
But there's one thing that I know
When everything is a rope of sand

Does it cause a crumbling fold?

It's rolling round the bend

But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry..

They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free

Well if they freed me from this prison,
If that railroad train was mine

And beyond, recognize thug shit
Poundin' out the trunk bitch
Runnin' wit' a mother fuckin' hatchet
You haters, you suck dick was a thug, became a G
B to the L to the A, Z, E, still dead
Still don't give a fuck (give a fuck)
Sportin' all black kahkis with the mother fuckin' cuffs up
Smokin' Hella trees, tryin' to make a couple G's
So a thug can get back on his feet
Mean muggin', steady thuggin'
And I'm tryin' to find the hoodrat's all about fuckin'

All my dawgs from the past, dead or smoked out
Still tryin' to come up on a lick for a phat ass ride

Fuck a style and a status

Mashin' in the bucket, sippin' on formeldahyde
Pockets lookin' sore so you know I gotta go
Pull a 2-11 on the neighborhood sto'
Mash on the gas, then I hit the pavement
Jumped out the bucket, headed straight in
Told the fuckin' clerk, put the money on the table
I'm a lunatic and my mind is unstable
He stuttered like a bitch
Tryin' to stop the hit
Shakin' like a twig
So you know I dumped the clip!
16 shots left his body on the flo'
Break the register, took the money, and I broke
Out the fuckin' back do' straight to the bucket
Put the money in, start the ride, and I punch it
Been from the hood, straight shots in the daylight

Got 200 dollars and I'm lookin' for mo'
'cause I'm greedy and I'm back on the streets
Rollin' through the hood, to another store I creep
Now I'm on my feet 'cause the cops is on my tail
They want to see me go to jail with no bail
But they can't 'cause I'm rockin' a hoodie
A .45 cal. in my waist, so don't push me
Same Saturday, still hittin' licks for cash
Walked into Carlins, demanded all his stash
The sucka talked shit, but filled the bag up
Guess he thought his homie in the back was gonna tag him
Blaze, and he came out from the back room
Runnin' at a dead homie, Blaze, with a broom
I put two slugs in they muthafuckin' chest
Saturday afternoon, I laid them hoes to rest

Walk out the Carlin's, headed 'cross Grashiot
Cops rollin' by, my hoodie up, I'm mashin'
Went to count my cash, got 5 see-notes
Need 5 mo' for some weed to smoke
So I know I gotta rob a suburb store
In the suburbs they keep real cash in they drawer
Not like the ghetto just nickel and dime shit
Tired of walkin' so I car jacked a bitch
At the stoplight, I jumped in, told her get out
Call the cops, I know where you live, I'll put your lights out
Now I'm mashin' down the block
To the liquor spot
Found a purse, went through it in the parkin' lot
Whaddya know, the bitch had $600 dollars
The sun's still out so you know I'm gonna follow
Through with the plan, robbib' suckas for they cheddar
On Saturday, still a G, down to the letter

I get ran down, and I get back up
Chase 'em down like a crack head

Now everytime we roll up a joint
Muthafuckas always be talkin' about Blaze Blaze Blaze
Man fuck Blaze
This muthafucka act like he puttin' it down for the hood
Talkin' bout everybody know Blaze, big baller
I don't give a fuck
Dead muthafucka don't get no special treatment from me
Look at Sarie's son little Eric
You know that muthafucka down to wear a wheelchair
I hate that muthafucka
And I don't show him no special treatment
So Blaze can kiss my ass

I put in work for my hood
So fuck a 9 to 5
You can find me on the corner
Hustlin' on the grind
They call me Mr. Lump Lump
So when their heads hear the thunder and the bump bump
They come out runnin' like the kids to the ice cream man
Children I'm sorry it's Blaze in the loony van
Playin' Atari, and I gotta do a crime to loot and 8 ball
Semi automatic with a clip for the law
All I want to do is make money and smoke
Fuck hella bitches, and slang my dope
The law ain't good for a muthafuckin thang
But eatin' mad donuts, and gettin' all in the way
I been gone for more than a day, and some things changed
Some many died and some faded away
I represent the ghetto from Harlem to Pinewood
I ride for the hood, I put it down for the hood

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

I've been dead to the world for the last 11 years
My body's decomposing, I'm missin' part of my ear
Still gonna rock till the day I die again
Get up back from the dead, and ryde again
Walk again, talk thug shit, right
Empty mack clips, right
Keep it old school, want to see that bitch? Uh huh
When it's thugs in King's coats and Raider's caps
Killers, jerry curls, and baseball bats
Ready to die like everyday
I put it down like a muthafucka, everyday
I drink brew and smoke weed like, everyday
And we all trying to get paid but anyway
Killas don't talk, but this one do
Talk you out your wallet let the 45 blast you
Twice in the chest, once in the face
Plus the extra heater on the safe side in case
Your bitch is wack well she can catch one too
Cause if you're down with your hood
Then your hood down with you

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

Psychopathic just like thugs
We ball, and we fight
And just like the freaks I come out every night
Holdin' down the sidewalk
Standin' amongst muthafuckas that's soon to be outlined in chalk
Sippin' on a cold ass 40 of OE
Live from the DET we OG
Pissy drunk always, we dead bumpin'
Stay thug with the throw away in the trunk
Bitch slapper, fuck a bitch rapper
Bitches were made for fuckin' but that's another chapter
Bitch you don't know me, don't approach me
Thinkin' that you're down with Blaze ya dead homie
G Blood imbedded in street blocks
That's why I put it down, and blast with many shots
Bullet holes in my chest, it's all good
Man I even died for my hood, muthafucka

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good

Jamie Madrox,"I'm the big dog, all you puppies stop barking
Bow down when the homie come around
The underground wicked, support this shit
When you bump this shit out the truck, punk bitch
Get it jumping like I hit the switch, or the Bourbon
Bouncing and swerving, on the black top serving
Riding on them bitches like I'm thrashing on a board
Or hopping on some X-Games, watch me as I soar
Bitches can't ignore when I'm banging on the ave
With that wicked shit bumping, I'mma rep it till my last
I'm the present, I'm the past, thirsty bitches make me laugh
Always searching for their relevance, looking like an ass
So I stay celibate to bullshit, trust no bitch
Don't fuck with them suckas, them whack motherfuckers
Keep your lips smacking, mouth running for weeks
Bullets do the talking when the dead man speaks, motherfucker

(You can't save me, I'm a- )
I'm the living dead pounding out the stereo
Rip the speakers in half, turn it up, here we go
I brought the cemetery with me on the track
And I'm cruising down the strip with dead bodies in the back
Human skeletons, come on, nod your cords
Zombies, vampires, killers and all of y'all

Motherfucker kick rocks, I'll divide you in your sock
Shoes dangle from the wire in the middle of the block
Your blood pours from wounds, bullets had to penetrate
Perforate the skin as they center bones with dance
Street safe silent no snitching
Keep it hungry or you could be the next one missing
Power Man like Luke Cage, with the chains in the case
Not a hero for hire but I'm making the front page
I'm center stage, doing what I love
Music is my drug, hitting harder than Terrell Suggs
Bump this right here till it's rattling your rearview
Pardon on the block, give a fuck, a bottle hits you
Dead man in a dead beef since this week
Taking over motherfucking streets, get geeked
Get down, get laid, get bread, get head
Anyway you want it, get it bitch, get it till you're dead

I keep a small circle
Got a lot of acquaintances, I'm universal
This is a business so don't take it personal
Invisible, I’m an outer space alien in pencil
Vein you draining your blood for real
Tell the officer watching me we just filming a commercial
Dead girls, they don't say no
Best friends are phlebotomus
I'm at the rock bottomless
Mimosas the colleges, psychologists analyze
How to get that Molly in a poly metabolically, Alli
Over your head, peon
Hoping the bed we on
Leaving you glowing neon
You can't fuck with the flow that we on
I would offer you Menaka
It's for all that shit that you talking
I'm a nightmare when I'm walking, bitter really killing me
You can looking into my soul as I'm stalking
Decapicate all of you hoes in a coffin
I soften them first, chop 'em up then hop in the hearse

Basket case, now let's get in your head
I'm a ghost

And let the light back into this empty room?

Climbing out the window
Trying not to make a sound, but
With my first love on my mind

I never said I loved you

Let me tell you about a man I knew 
Yeah, I knew him all too well 

My attitude has always been you can have me for tonight 
But not for tomorrow 
It's gonna cost you plenty, more than you can afford 
More than you can borrow 
Well I can make them fall in love just as easy as I 
Pick their pockets hey 
And when I've done the deed I jump on a freight train 
And make my getaway 

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night 
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight 
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes 
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine 

I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes 
Did something strange to me 
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride 
But there was a fork in the street 
Well I didn't mean to fall in love, didn't practice the rules 
That I've been taught 
You never get involved, never drop your defences 
But this time I got caught 

I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night 
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight 
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes 
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine 
Thief of hearts, paying for my crimes

Over the prairie gold
There's a church bell screaming
On the steeple high
Gather ye children of men

With one hand on the trigger, one hand on the cross
Jesus and his family are two things he's lost

March him to the scaffold and string him up on high

There's blood in their eyes and blood in their hearts
For, the blood turning dry on his hands

With one hand on the trigger, one hand on the cross
Jesus and his family are two things he's lost

He cries Oh Lord what have you done
You wont never see heaven or kingdom come
He cries Oh Lord what have you done
You won't never see heaven or kingdom come

I’m at a loss for words

I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That’s what I call a awful splurge
You drive me bonkers I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops and 'certs
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert

'Cause nobodies body’s awesomer, I lust it, and she loves me 'cause I’m popular, but

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I’m in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
'Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I don’t see nothin' but you
And I’m about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can’t do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can’t, specifically to describe it
I just can’t seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout “I live and breathe you”
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don’t wanna be without you, don’t wanna be with you neither, bitch

What the fuck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it’s time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain’t the same as mine,

Uh, free my soul even if they chain my body
Uh, look to God if ain't nowhere to go

And old photographs that mamas bring
Of daddies with their young boys playin' ball
There's combat boots he used to wear
When he was sent over there
And there's fifty thousand names carved in the wall

There's cigarettes and cans of beer
And notes that say, ""I miss you dear""
And children who don't say anything at all
There's purple hearts and packs of gum
Fatherless daughters and fatherless sons
And there's fifty thousand names carved in the wall

They come from all across this land
In pickup trucks and mini vans
Searchin' for a boy from long ago
They scan the wall and find his name
The teardrops fall like pourin' rain
Then silently they leave a gift and go

There's stars of David and rosary beads
And crucifixion figurines
And flowers of all colors large and small
There's a boy scout badge and a merit pin

But I know all about you.
I've come to talk to you tonight,
About the things I've seen you do.
I've come to set the record straight,
I've come to shine the light on you.
Let me introduce myself,
I am the cold hard truth.

There is a woman we both know,
I think you know the one I mean.
She gave her heart and soul to you,
You gave her only broken dreams.
You say you're not the one to blame,
For all the heartache she's been through.
I say you're nothin' but a liar,
I am the cold hard truth.

All of your life, that's how it's been;
Lookin' out for number one.
Takin' more than you give,
Movin' on when you're done.
With her you could've had it all,
Family and love to last.
If you had any sense at all,
You'd go and beg her to come back.

You think that you're a real man,
But you are nothin' but a fool.
The way you run away from love,
The way you try to play it cool.
I'm gonna say this just one time,
Time is running out on you.
You best remember me my friend,
I am the cold hard truth.

More friends then I can count
Got that job I always wanted
Nothing to complain about

Are the arms that don't hold me
Through the long lonely nights
The only thing wrong in my life
Is you're not in it baby

I ought to simply move on
And shrug off your goodbye
But it's hard to see the future

Make me just tell the truth
Whenever I turn to you I surrender
Fears that I've tried to hide
And every old alibi
Now I see a source of light
Just within my reach

You are my sanctuary
My beacon in the night
You opened up your heart
You let me walk inside

To lay down the load that I carry
You are my sanctuary

Don't know what brought us here
But one thing I know clear
I traveled a trail of tears to find you
Now when I'm on the brink
Down to my weakest link
And the weight makes me sink

You are my everything
So simple you touch me

Jamie O'Neal,"She looks in his eyes
He looks away
She chalks it up as
Another one of those days
If there's a reason
He's coming home late
She hasn't heard it yet
She warms up his dinner
But he can't eat
She makes conversation
When he don't speak
He shakes his head
As the silence screams
'Cause she hasn't heard it yet

If only love could cry out loud
It'd be enough to send
This old house crashing down
Still, she's choose to turn her head
'Cause it's easier to deny
Than to admit he's
Been tellin' her goodbye
And she hasn't heard it yet

He leaves his ring
As a souvenir
Says so long to himself
In the hallway mirror
He's just closed the
Door on eighteen years
And she hasn't heard it yet

If only love could cry out loud
It'd be enough to send
This old house crashing down
Still, she's choose to turn her head
'Cause it's easier to deny
Than to admit he's
Been tellin' her goodbye

Like there's nothing to it
You just look my way
You come a little closer
I lose my composure
Don't know what to say
I'm overwhelmed, you smile, I melt
And somewhere inside, oh baby, I, I

Shiver, tremble, I never
No I never once felt so much
It shakes me how you take me
Deeper than I've ever been
It's to the core, under my skin
I shiver

I love the way your whisper
Slowly, softly lingers
In my ear
You move a little closer
The world starts spinning slower
Then it disappears
You lips so close, we kiss almost
Just barely touch but that's enough
To make me

Shiver, tremble, I never
No I never once felt so much
It shakes me how you take me
Deeper than I've ever been

Underneath the blue neverending sky, swore that he was gonna

Why do I see you when a stranger passes by

Where we belong

I got a glimpse of life without you
All the good was gone
Then I realized you were lying next to me
I knew right then, baby, come whatever
When the going gets tough, we'll face it together

Crossin' that desert they call the unknown
Lost in a valley of shadows and sinking sand
Hopeless was circling over my head
Patiently waiting for my last step

Making up visions out of thin air

With a black and white picture hangin' on the wall
Oh, oh of a stripper
The men are still talkin' 'bout the rainy night she walked in
Took off her shirt like it was nothin' at all
Oh, oh what a picture
Everyone assumed she'd been drinkin'
When she pointed to her shoulders
And said, boys, here's what I'm thinkin'

Put a devil on the left, an angel on the right
I'm already livin' in the middle of the fight
And round and round and round and round it goes
Part of me's in heaven, part of me's in hell
Part of me is strugglin' tryin' to find my way through life
With a devil on the left and an angel on the right

Down in the Delta there's a rundown chapel
With a worn out floor where a preacher used to pray
Oh, oh for the stripper
While right across the street they were packed in tight
Just a-pushin' and a-shovin', sweatin' by the stage
Oh, oh to tip her
She brought a lot of men to their knees
But only one of them was thinkin'
Lord, won't you help her please

With a white picket fence going all the way around

He can't go home 'til he clears his mind
And his supper's cold by now

About a treatment plan and a lot of years

Jamie O'Neal,"She's never pulled anybody from a burning building
She's never rocked central park to a half a million
Fans, screaming out her name, she's never hit a shot to win the game
She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon ride
Around the world, no, she's just your everyday average girl (but)

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned up knee
A little kiss is all she needs
The keeper of the cheerios
The voice that brings snow white to life
Bedtime stories every night
That smile lets her know
She somebody's hero

She didn't get a check every week like a nine to fiver
But she's been a waiter, and a cook and taxi driver
For 20 years, there at home, until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition
But now her baby's movin' on, and she'll soon be missin'
Her, but not today, those are tears of joy runnin' down her face

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in the wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest
It hurts to let her baby go
Down the aisle she walks right by
Looks back into her mother's eyes
That smile lets her know
She somebody's hero

30 years have flown right past
Her daughter's starin' at all the photographs
Of her mother, and she wishes she could be like that
Oh, but she already is

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home
She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her momma with a spoon
That smile lets her know
Her mother's smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero",Somebody's Hero,2005
Jamie O'Neal,"I hear he's out there... somewhere
Been looking for him everywhere
From Rosweld to Timbuktu I thought I found him once at a jiffy lube
But it turned into a dead end so I got my oil changed and I tried again
He was a major in archeology
I was digging on him but he wasn't on me
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis

CHORUS:
It's a mystery like the deep blue sea
You can take it you can leave it but I still believe
So I won't give up and I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis

I met a mystic down in Memphis we stood at the foot of the pyramid
He had me looking east - He had me looking west
Then he showed me a map and said ""I wish you the best""
There was Elvis not the real one
When he told me good bye he called me hun
Just another shot in the dark like Eldorado or Noah's ark
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is like trying to find Atlantis

By that fire in Jackson Hole
That you were gonna let me go

Were you only havin' fun

When did you know
We weren't lookin' at forever
How could we be so close
And still not be together
Every dream I believed
Has now come down to just one question
When did you know it wasn't love
When did you know it wasn't me

How can you make a woman feel that way
While you never feel a thing
Why did you do that to me
And how can you keep your heart set on freeze
While you set my soul on fire
I don't understand it yet
I'm still tryin' to catch my breath

When did you know
We weren't lookin' at forever
How could we be so close

As we lie there close together late at night
In our own special place
It's like I'm driftin' off to heaven when he does that thing that only he
Can do
He moves his lips in little ways that let me know he's in heaven too

He's sorin again and I'm wide awake
It's like a nascar race bein run on his face
And the bed starts to tremble and shake
I try to roll him over I kick him with my feet
Hell I gotta wake him up so I can get sleep
For a moment he's quiet and then
He's snorin' again

In the morning he wakes up so happy
Lookin' all refreshed
While I count the lines and the dark circles
Cause I aint had no rest
Ohh the day seems to drag along and I can't wait to get myself in bed
But soon that old familiar sound
Comes crashin' in my head

He's snorin' again and I'm wide awake
It's like an old buzz saw tearin' up the walls
And I've had more than I can take
I'm glad to hear he's breathin'
I know he needs his rest but that snortin'and that wheezin
Sure puts me to the test
Gonna make him go sleep in the den

He knows that I adore him but when he gets to snorin'
I have to grab his hair and yank",Wide Awake,2014

Will be there.
You can take my love for granted my word is firmly planted

And don't do what I really want to
How can it be you still love me

Soon I'm somebody I don't recognize or want to be

The life for every day

For you and help you walk on through it

With you here. Jesus, I am strong; no sign of weakness.
With you gone, Jesus, I am hanging by a thread.

There's a certain kind of pain that can numb you.
There's a type of freedom that can tie you down.
Sometimes the unexplained can define you,
And sometimes, silence is the only sound.

Something real I cannot explain
A love so beautiful
I cannot turn away

He steps among the twisted lines,
And works them out in his good time,

Unraveling my lines so I can fish again one day
Sometimes I picture God that way

Her tender hands pull tangles loose,
From gum in hair to knots in shoes.
With her quilter's skill and a mother's joy,
She frees the little girls and boys.

Sometimes I picture God that way
Untangling the mess I've made
Unraveling my kite so I can fly again one day

(verse 1)
Everyday's another chance
To live the best I can
Try to see the positive 
Be thankful for what I have

Sometimes it's hard and it takes all I've got
To hold my head high and not just give it up 
So move on up 

Walking this fine line full of stars that shine
But I believe I have to do my part
With all my heart 'cause 

(chorus)
(Somewhere) someone needs a hand to hold
(One touch) can make a difference I know
(That's why) I'm sending out this message with all my heart
All my heart

(Reach down) deep in the soul of the world
(Reach out) from the heart to spread the word
(It's time) to give it all I've got, give it all my heart
All my heart

Won?t waste another tear 
Trying to change the past
I won?t live my life in fear
Hiding behind some mask

It's time to tell the truth
And trust my heart
Life can bring you to your knees 
No matter what, or who you are

Anger's a lonely word
It feeds the dark (hey)
I want to face the light with open arms
With all my heart 'cause

(repeat chorus)

(bridge)
One touch - One smile - One hope - One child
One love - One chain - One world - One day

Jamie Stevens,"You have been hurt
And now you think love's a big cheat
But I know if you allow me I'll prove you wrong
Don't be afraid of the love you have for me
Lay it bare and let things happen
Be aware we need half a chance

If you're restless, I will follow you
If you're weak I'll give you strength
If you can't go on I'll see you through
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

Trust in me baby
I would never let you down
And I swear my love's the cure for your broken heart
(Let me cure your broken heart)
I want you so
I will read the wishes in your eyes
And I will chase the dark clouds away if you give me one more chance

If you're restless, I will follow you
If you're weak I'll give you strength
If you can't go on I'll see you through
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

If the world seems to be down on you, 
If you're badly off for help, 
If you need someone to comfort you, 
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there!

[Repeat: x2]
Let me cure your broken heart, 
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be there.

Jamie Stevens,"There are times
The words your heart would say
Sometimes they fall on ears or lose their way
Does it feel as if you're standing all alone'
Holding on to all that's left to send you home

You try and try no matter what they say
Don't ever give up or let their fences stop your way

Even if times are losing life 
Dreams will never die cause they're unbreakable 
As long as you believe
I'll be right there at your side
Cheering you from a distance unmistakable 
All your dreams were meant to be 

Don't you know if the truth is what you seek
Just listen to yourself and make believe 
Dreams are like rainbows 
Just follow where they end 
That is where you'll find the truth you've searched my friend 

You run and run and no one seems to care 
Running for your dreams can get you anywhere",Unbreakable,2004

I was walking alone
And I was trying to find what I wanted to do with my life
So I know why you need to find a reason inside
For all the arguing and fights

You never want to be living a lie
You don't want to become all the things you despise

You need to believe
And follow your dreams
Follow the path that will lead your heart
Then you can find
The answers inside
They will be told by the voice of your heart

If they don't understand what it means to you
You don?t wanna lose your self-respect
When the shadows are closing in on you
I know that you aren't beaten yet

(Follow the voice, from your heart)
(Follow your dream, from the heart)

You are never alone there's no reason to hide
There are others who see from your eyes
And if you believe, if you stay with your drive
You'll keep your dream alive

(verse 1)
Everyday's another chance
To live the best I can
Try to see the positive 
Be thankful for what I have

Sometimes it's hard and it takes all I've got
To hold my head high and not just give it up 
So move on up 

Walking this fine line full of stars that shine
But I believe I have to do my part
With all my heart 'cause 

(chorus)
(Somewhere) someone needs a hand to hold
(One touch) can make a difference I know
(That's why) I'm sending out this message with all my heart
All my heart

(Reach down) deep in the soul of the world
(Reach out) from the heart to spread the word
(It's time) to give it all I've got, give it all my heart
All my heart

Won?t waste another tear

And I don't get no fights when I get angry drunk 
Sit down in the corner, man, I'll soak my fuckin' socks off
So who the fuck are we just the boys in the city 
It's all been done before and we'll do it again so 
We'll see you later you alligators 
We'll be back I'm sure next week and sit in the bar you know

Nickname like the Kangaroo Valley
From top to the bottom of the under-walk
Where boys fuck girls that they never will marry
You're happy as Larry to dill-dally
Dark alleys, back from the rallies
It's bullshit they say that you got no talent
Well pigs fucking fly and it ain't about oil
And Fox News has always been fair and balanced

Do you ever feel like you want to go home?
Lost in the crowd and you feel alone
Do you ever feel like you want to go home?
Lost in the crowd and you feel alone

Dilly-dally past, you're the last fast man
To charge any money on your mobile phone
And it's all about this, understand man
We'll chat it like Dapper Dan 'cause Dan's always talking
Dan chats black, Buddy Holly ain't half of the money
Of the income that he makes down monthly
Through talking down on your mobile phone
While kiddie paints the town with the shilling, pence and pounds
It's illegal to think that you ain't fucking prone
To all of the bollocks that is chatting all around you
Sometimes it gets in your head and you can't get away from the feeling
That you're breaking on the ground
Breaking up no luck, stop like some fuck
Caught in a right rut, she looks like a right slut
You must lust, touch, 'cause you want so much
You look so shook but you're just man lovestruck

Do you ever feel like you want to go home?

Have two's on a cigarette.

Long livers in the sunset.

So crazy Billy Jay Jones, robs banks just for the shits
Man alone giggling so stoned, pick up the phone
Cause that money I leant you said was just a loan
You're danger prone, with too much gel and a whiff of dad's cologne
Leave me alone, 
Cause now you come down and you just go and lower the tone

But he's back up again.

With a tainted brain of intoxication purple heart smartarse
Got on the transistor, said that you missed her,
Looking for selectors and found no one better than you.
With bother boy blues, take up the old
Tick up the avenues. And talk like you do what you do,
Takin up time, but now it comes down and it?s for who the bell tolls.

Why you never sleep why you're drunk all the time and you're cold in the heat

Is it a time, singing the lines on the old border line

Past is fast and fast is thin and that's why we're witherin'
So good is the bad, the ugly left with your face in the morning
You screamed at the back, told her just jack
About how you lived on the weekend
Killers in mist, told you about it
Years before you answered
The whole of the point, the real the day is passing now you're finished

So you scream like nothings wrong, Sons of silence and in them songs, out loud for the reservation
It's all thriller, no filler
And the beat came out the line, three or four times.
It's the first time that you'll say

Jamie T.,"Juveniles, hide your porno mags
The girl's got problems at her yard so she's packing up her bags full of rags
Her man got done from Pa Na Na
While the Madras still in the kitchen smokes a twenty-deck fags
Body bags come back on planes from war torn Iraq
It's the stark naked truth, a dark aftermath
Baby T, the juice and the dog just barks
Remember man the bully always had the last laugh

It was a blast last night down the old 12 Bar
White socks, black shoes with the ballads in the car
With a lump in the throat she won't understand
Twos on a cigarette and a talk blah blah
Bloody hell die oh bah da glug down liquor
Life goes on for all the day trippers
Starts off small but it's gonna get bigger 
By the end of this letter it may all be better

Well she's always asking with the who, where and how
The girls say ooh la la
Well if I had another chance I'd do it differently now
And the girls say ooh la la la la la la la
From Trafalgar Square where the crack pipe reeking
To in your dark damp flat, the ceiling's leaking
You fell in love when you first started chatting
But got so bored cause she never stopped speaking
Consider this son on the bad behavior
He's keeping all the freebies, delivering the papers
You hate us, shake down fakers
Oh, you'll never get nowhere
Cause I'm the pacemaker

Pretty please me, oh, she's easy on the eye
Some say that today only the good young die
Ipee-oh-kai-yay, it's been right good day
I wanna ask questions but I don't mean to pry
How did you get to where you going to before you came slowly moseying through this bar?
You started your race, Jonny Cockeral wants his money
Give up the man he's a fruit and nut bar

(I'm serious, he's a real nutter)

Oh, I gotta see the GP, coughing up lungs
Doc says stop or you're going die young
I haven't even started to do what I done
You young don't listen, you just carry on
Well, we heard it before when your song got sung
Get a grip son
Why?
Cause you're always drunken
We're not captains just skivvy sunken
Humdrum drum, drum, live fast die young

Mr Skin stumbling, the road rocky
Trespassers on the private property
Remember back then it was the ranter banter
Young sons watched their young Pas get cancer
Vagabond Sandy crying out for he missed her
Missed her so much that he went drank the brewery
So sing-a-long Sam this is a song about you
We all went out and we got pissed-ola

I don't wanna fight he's a right big cunt
But the fellas say go on my son, my son
It's all a bit of fun 'til someone gets done
But the fellas say go on my son, my son
Well, I'm more likely to pick up and run
But the fellas say go on my son, my son
Ah fuck it, well, he's a right big cunt
But I'll knock him one, fuck that

To fill us reckless sons with passions of the heart

I've been round this town for so long, she's been dancing since the first day
I've been all around but I love coming back to see Lucy

She swings me over to pull me out,
Twirls around and I fall about, in giggles and laugher, oh I'm plastered, can't damn help it I'm sorry love

What's to falling feeling feet
Great for bouncing round these streets
They're lonely like you, and you for two
Are for me dance for me

A heart of gold, and a face so pale, with a second hand dress and lips of a temptress

Bar stool banshee, howled out at me, 
The kings and queens at the clubs evolved from pubs
And two much broken heart love
Singing up the blues in locked boxed bedroom,
A wop bop baloo bop ta wop bamboo
Are you going to take the chance
Why do you care no one plays fair
And neither do the lords of the dance

From here to Salvador, the ladies dance, to fill us reckless sons, with passions of the heart

Well it's a bang bang Anglo Saxons at the disco
A tish you all fall down
Hound dogs round on the prowl
For the next young girl, who told her daddy,
I'm going round Gemma's to learn and study, I'm young and so free and I'm kinda sexy, and when I'm on the floor all the boys they feel me, and old dear diary's never been a friend of mine.?

It gets poured all over her fella,
'Cause she's says, ""Man, he ain't no better
Than the next man kicking up fuss""

Screams calling London (London!)
None of us heard her coming,
I guess the carpet weren't rolled out

""Oh when my love, my darling,
You've left me here alone,
I'll walk the streets of London
Which once seemed all our own

The vast suburban churches
Together we have found:
The ones which smelt of gaslight
The ones in incense drown'd""

Her lingo went from the cockney to the gringo
Any time she sing a song, the other girls sing along
And tell all the fellas that that lady is single
Fickle way to tickle on my young mans ting
She's up for doing what she like, any day more like the night
She drowned drunk sorrows that she stole, bought, borrowed
She didn't like fights but at the same time understood
Fellas will be fellas 'til the end of time

""Good heavens, you boys!
Blue blooded murder of the English tongue""

Jack had a gang that he called ""The Many Grams""
He was known as Smack Jack the Cracker Man
In life he was dealt some shit hands
But the boys got the back now
And Jay went the same way as Mickey and Dan
Dependent mans upon the heroin
And man, Lisa had a baby with Sam
And now Jack's on his own man
Well done, Jack, glug down that cider
You're right, she's a slut and you never fucking liked her
Not like what, he stopped, so shocked
'Cause it turned out the last dance killed the pied piper
Tough little big man, friends with your daughters
Only 'cause they drive him to pick up all his quarters
Crawler, lager lout brawlers
Brought them their filth and they're free but they ain't near the border
Too young, gunned down by your hell fire corner
Always did a favour but never took a order
Behave, young scallywag, a fine young Galahad
Glad ragged up, but only ever getting fag hags
Hung on his shoulder, cheap price shop tag
Slag better understand he came for the glamour
But this town's original, superficial the issue
For one dear Jack had thirty-five doppelgängers

So this a short story about the girl Georgina
Never seen a worse, clean young mess
Under stress at best, but she's pleased to see you
With love, God bless, we lay her body to rest
Now it all dear started with Daddy's alcoholic
Light weights chinking down, numbing his brain
And the doctor said he couldn't get the heart dear started
Now beat up, drugged up, she feeling the strain
She says, ""In a rut, what the fuck I supposed to do?""
Suck it up, start, stop, keep running through
True, but you try, it ain't easy to do
She been buckle-belt beaten from the back like a brat
Don't know where she's going, but she know where she at
So Georgie, it's time to chain react
But the truth is, you know, she probably fought back
Tears stream down her face, she screamed away
""When I fall, no-one catch me
Alone lonely, I'll overdose slowly
Get scared, I'll scream and shout""
But you know it won't matter, she'll be passing out
I said gigidy-bigidy-up just another day
Another sad story, that's tragedy

Harmonica Man Sam was so knackered after jives of love
He puts on the glove and then puts on his hat
Then it's home to the missus who sits on his tongue
Selfish sons with their packs of cigarettes
Forking out two, take your girl with the ticket
Sometimes sane, other times not with it
Standing at the picket, man, your hands, they're freezing

Girls with their pearls on the flex of Monroes 
And half gee blow, Marilyn's gone loco, Navajo
Hi-ho Silver, hey-ho, let's go dancing with the average Joes
Who talk with their fists and argue with their friends
Always take the piss but they're loyal in the end
But watch out 'cause they'll steal your girlfriend
Take her round the back, she'll come back limping

And girls singing on the bus, fellas kicking up a fuss
Crying out sighs but they're still looking dangerous
Oh, this is definitely all for you

Give it up when you got no game, oh well, uh
Oh, this is definitely all for you

So remember when you choke there's a reason being
We leaving the town 'cause we ain't been believing
Blowing up smoke from the lungs to the ceiling
Making sure nightmares turn up in your dreaming

On the mic every day, hitting up the country, oh
Good time in the old city
Who's listening and who wants more?

'Cause the girls singing on the bus, fellas kicking up a fuss
Crying out sighs and they're still looking dangerous

After listening to this tape,

Than getting right out of this town on Monday (Monday)

Way back then when Maggie-aggie-aggie
Always made em sad but she never made em happy
I was lost, weak, bleak in the street
Knocked me off of my feet
Hanging round with the people I should never meet
I'll always believe that the air that we breathe
Will choke our lungs and clog up our arteries

Take it down for a man did a call the police

Man next to me said oh, fucking much just throw them cunts
Fore I fell in love with a brunette rough neck
Fits like a glove, kept me back down

When my feet hit the ground man, I started to run

Of a while collar,
Why do I bother
Money love hates honor
Grates if I look, down I'm a goner
I'll end up working for the BBC as a runner,
Burning bills sloughed my fish wonder died of hunger
Friends stopped calling this time last summer.
I sit down sorrows and I start to sigh,
I gotta get there before Castro dies
Plight my guilt with highs
She smuggled with trouble in bubble wrap,
Up the gap strapped between her thighs
So surprised when you meet her
She seemed so shy
Considering she got balls that are twice the size,
Of you plus me plus the give me let me try,
Better buy them all cause they're in short supply,
So here's a conversation we can have when we fly
Got to get there before Castro dies
Ya messin' up my mind
You do it all the time
I just can't take the lies,
Boy ya just going down on a low,
I just can't take the lies,
Ya messin' up my mind
And that's why enemies enemies and loves will be friends of mine
I have a lesson learned
Enemy burned
I'm saving up my bandages
A non believer turned can be the loyalist of advocates
On aggregate I'm smashing it
I'm lacking backing but trashing it
I'm slacking and jacking the chips ya stacking
And spending them all on sandwiches
You ask me how it's done
I just know how to handle it
See me through cynic critic scum who think your branded packages
And if you wanna come, you know what I'll be brandishing,
A speaker full of lyrics beats and loops that I've been sampling

You do it all the time

Crazy Moschino with a pastel base, paid more to gambalino on an accolade
Look pale, set sail man, Livin' La Vida Loca
He's giving her a kiss and then he's giving her coka
You don't know much but he knows how it chokes her
I don't know much but I know he's a joker
In any other case pace matters
Bass at the back with a beat like hammer
Drinks at the bar no glitz and glamour
No hits, just bangers, these kids they're crackers

But I still smell fresh, Bitches' Brew
And I still laugh and you still gasp well I guess what I say is dumbfounding you
Done clowning you, done changing up, it's not my fault that you can't keep up
So I slowed down and I threw it up on the wall like a dub in the train yard shut, but
It still goes overhead like an old football in a barbed wire fence, but

Back to the first ever boy she loved
Who didn't love her back

My Joan of Arc
A martyr in my bed
There's three kind words
She never heard said

I was caravans, bands, cans and backseats
She was more diazepam, trams, tans and spreadsheets
Looking back then we both laugh
Funny how you never give a fuck when you're 20
But she was alone then
And it still makes her mad
How the boys used to lead her on
Just to get in her pants

My Joan of Arc
A martyr in my bed
Her lonely heart
Can find it hard to forgive and forget
The love she once had
Would run as soon as he read
Those three kind words
She never heard said

So from the anagrams to the flat keys
Spend most of our time now counting back from 30
My old mate Terry just got discharged
At her majesty's pleasure he was never that cosy
But these older days we know now
Though they're not all that
They're some of the best ever days
That I'll ever have

If you lay down your shield, 

I won't hurt you. 

Just let me show you how I feel.

Your footprints on my back. 
And the gris gris you sprinkled in my bed,

You brought it way down below the Mason-Dixon line, 
Like your mother, you're a southern bell.

But a son

Catch me in your arms
Like stars in the eyes of telescopes
And once there I rest
Never let me go. No, 
Never let me go

What could I learn
By fighting the fire with matches and gasoline
Oh how cruel
And melodramatic are we
For trying to make sense 
To make sense of all this
Just don't let me fall back through the clouds
(through the clouds) 

Catch me in your arms 
Like stars in the eyes of telescopes
And once there I rest
Never let me go. No,
Never let me go

Catch me in your arms
Like the stars you hold in your hand","A  Slave, A Son",2010
Jamika,"You think that I don't feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected
A hurt, scorned, rejected

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

I started my life in an old, cold run down tenement slum
My father left, he never even married mom
I shared the guilt my momma knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

This love we're contemplating
Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating
The child we may be creating

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, (scorned by) society
Love child, always second best
Love child (different from), different from the rest

Mm, baby (hold on, hold on, just a little bit)
Mm, baby (hold on, hold on, just a little bit)
I started school, in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threwout
I knew the way it felt, to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

Don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't want to please you
But no child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame I've been wearing

Love child, love child, never quite as good
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood

But I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you",Love Child,2011

Jamil Sharif,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,2000
Jamila,"Es war 1999
Ich wollte fett leben
Ich war sechszehn wollt weggehen vom Drecksleben
Ich wollte Geld machen und meinen Eltern sagen
Euer Sohn Kann die finanzielle Last jetzt tragen
Aber so kam es nicht , es kam ganz andere Tage
Ich musste erst selbst erfahren Schmerzen zu ertragen
Mein Vater sagte immer: „Sohn das Leben beißt zu“
Und meine Mutter sagte: „Sohn beiß zurück du
Kriegst niemals was geschenk die Straße gibt dir nur Probleme“
Ich hatte hier früh gelernt mir alles selbst zu nehmen
Die Zeit verging schnell und ich wurd' Älter
Ich lernte wenn ich am Boden lag wurde ich stärker
Mit der Zeit war dann Geld kein Problem mehr
Man konnte sehn,verstehen und Geld verdienen lernen
Meine Jungs und ich haben dann alles weggeballert
Das war damals 2001 war der Hammer

Und wenn ich die Zeit zurückdrehen könnte
Dann würde ich 'n Scheiß dran ändern
Denn es ist meine Zeit, ich hab nichts bereut 
Und mir tut gar nichts Leid

Plötzlich war das Leben bunt, es waren um uns herum
Hunderte und der Grund nur der Rum
2002 die Zeit war so weit
Und ich war bereit um nach den Sternen zu greifen
Ich weiß nicht wie nur viel weiter ging es nie
Scheiße wie kam diese Linkheit ins Spiel
Ich war verliebt in dieses Leben mit Stil 
Und geriet bei ein paar Freunden in Kritik, aber
Nein ich habe an die Strasse geglaubt
Der Strasse vertraut hab mir viel aufgebaut
So kam es dann 2004 in mein Cafe
Seit ihr einmarschiert es ist passiert
An dieser Stelle sage ich besser nicht zu viel
Ich sage nur aus Freunden können Feinde werden und auch Krieg
Egal wer siegt wir waren beide Verlierer
Haben's nicht geschafft Vergangenheit zu respektieren

Und wenn ich die Zeit zurückdrehen könnte
Dann würde ich 'n Scheiß dran ändern
Denn es ist meine Zeit, ich hab nichts bereut 
Und mir tut gar nichts Leid
Mir tut gar nichts Leid

Es war 2005 als alles wieder gut lief
Ich widmete mein Leben nur noch der Musik
Im Deutschen Rap gab es wie immer nur noch Lümmel
Und ich wusste meine Grenze ist der Himmel
Also fing ich an mein Label zu gründen
Alles oder Nix Records wurde ein Bündnis
Aus dem talentiertesten Sängern und Rappern
Produzenten, DJs und Managern
Kanakonda, Samy und Maestro
Ich brauchte keine Demos weil jeder in meiner Ecke wohnte
Große Pläne und ich wollte investieren 
Doch dann passierte es, ich muss von Deutschland fliehen
Haftbefehl doch die Bullen kriegten mich nicht
Außer bis es geklärt wird, außer gerichtlich
Ich kam dann wieder und es war 2007
Ich wusste Alles oder Nix Records würde jetzt siegen

Und wenn ich die Zeit zurückdrehen könnte
Dann würde ich 'n Scheiß dran ändern
Denn es ist meine Zeit, ich hab nichts bereut 
Und mir tut gar nichts Leid
Mir tut gar nichts Leid",Meine Zeit,2008

Jamila Woods,"Pulled into the parking lot, parked it
Zipped up my parka, joined the procession of marchers
In my head like, ""is this awkward?
Should I even be here marching?""
Thinking if they can't, how can I breathe?
Thinking that they chant, what do I sing?
I want to take a stance 'cause we are not free
And then I thought about it, we are not ""we""
Am I in the outside looking in, or am I in the inside looking out?
Is it my place to give my two cents?
Or should I stand on the side and shut my mouth?
""No justice, no peace,"" okay, I'm saying that
They're chanting out, ""black lives matter,"" but I don't say it back
Is it okay for me to say? I don't know, so I watch and stand
In front of a line of police that look the same as me
Only separated by a badge, a baton, a can of Mace, a mask
A shield, a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi
In case somebody dies behind a bullet that flies out of the nine
Takes another child's life on sight

Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free

You've exploited and stolen the music, the moment
The magic, the passion, the fashion, you toy with
The culture was never yours to make better
You're Miley, you're Elvis, you're Iggy Azalea
Fake and so plastic, you've heisted the magic
You've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in
Your brand of hip-hop, it's so fascist and backwards
That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it, you bastard
All the money that you made
All the watered down pop-bullshit version of the culture, pal
Go buy a big-ass lawn, go with your big-ass house
Get a big-ass fence, keep people out
It's all stolen, anyway, can't you see that now?
There's no way for you to even that out
You can join the march, protest, scream and shout
Get on Twitter, hashtag and seem like you're down
But they see through it all, people believe you now?
You said publicly, ""rest in peace, Mike Brown""
You speak about equality, but do you really mean it?
Are you marching for freedom, or when it's convenient?
Want people to like you, want to be accepted?
That's probably why you are out here protesting
Don't think for a second you don't have incentive
Is this about you, well, then what's your intention?
What's the intention?
What's the intention?

""Pssst, I totally get it
You're by yourself and the last thing you want to do is take a picture
But seriously, my little girl loves you

I'm not kidding, my oldest, you even got him to go thrifting
And 'One Love,' oh my God, that song, brilliant
Their aunt is gay, when that song came out
My son told his whole class he was actually proud
That's so cool, look what you're accomplishing
Even the old mom like me likes it, 'cause it's positive
You're the only hip-hop that I let my kids listen to
'Cause you get it, all that negative stuff it isn't cool""
(Yeah?) ""yeah, like, all the guns and the drugs

Damn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment
Some of us scared, some of us defensive
And most of us aren't even paying attention
It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist
Than we actually are with racism
I've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive
What if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue
Actually looked at myself, actually got involved?
If I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don't know
Hip-hop has always been political, yes
It's the reason why this music connects
So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying
Then I'm trying to be politically correct?
I can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets
Rap entrepreneur, built his own business
If I'm only in this for my own self-interest, not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with
Then this isn't authentic, it is just a gimmick
The D.I.Y underdog, so independent
But the one thing the American dream fails to mention
Is I was many steps ahead to begin with
My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image
America feels safe with my music in their systems
And it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it
And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain
White supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho
White supremacy protects the privilege I hold
White supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home
White supremacy is our country's lineage, designed for us to be indifferent
My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson, guilty
We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by

And I had all my life in front of me
Now my darkness days are trouble free

Than this journey of discovery.

And I'm never sad, and I'm always glad
Anything you give me today
I will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
Cos they don't know where they're coming from
There was nothing let to do but hang on
For a stillness in time.

If you find that something's going wrong
Look around at what you're running from
There are so many wondrous things for you to see
If this world is turning too fast for your head

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Jamiroquai,"Have you gone astray?
Or lost your way?
You should have seen me yesterday
Well I knew this kind of love

Was written in the stars
It's only once or twice that you're in line with Mr Moon
Then it was you
Took me on your cloud

Give me flowers for my pain
But with some degree of certainty
My destiny
Seemed to slip away from me
Before I got to know your name.

Just give me a chance
I'll do what you want me to
Everybody wants to dance
So how come I can't dance with you

You really turn me on
You're the one that makes me smile
It's Mr Moon who plays in tune, Mr Moon who knows
And if it's Mr Moon who gives the sign then that's the sign thatgoes
I never know what to do
Till I'm there with you.

Did you lose your mind
For a day
You don't remember anyway
Like the waters of a dream
Encapsulate my mind
A place I haven't seen sits at the end of space and time
So lost in time
Then I think I'm blind
To perchance upon this circumstance is something of a miracle
So spiritual
It's verging on the physical
Searching for a love I cannot find.",Mr Moon,2003

Doing it in the house like this 
Going out to the lost souls 
Doing this for you and yours 
Comin' straight to you from the Guru and the crew

[Chorus]
To the lost souls 
I hope you find your way someday 
That's why I sit, and I pray 
For the lost souls 
I hope you find your way someday 
That's why I sit, and I pray

[Guru]
Sometimes I wonder why 
Some people can't see what's beyond the naked eye 
So therefore I must fortify 
Techniques of communication 
For beyond what is considered to be 
Normal conversation 
So I need some proper 'ticipation 
Am I giving what you need?
Yes, true indeed
As greed grows like weed 
Many bad seeds start to contaminate the crop
I think that needs to stop hops
Brothers are slain over respect and clout
While their mothers are trying to figure out
What's it all about
But when you give up on self, that's when you lost
'Cause you're playing with your life
Like it's a coin toss

[Chorus]

[Guru]
No doubt I release a form of speech 
Relative to urban outreach 
Transmitted messages to each true listener 
Rhymes divine but rough 
Like the skin on blisters 
'Cause the truth hurts 
Plus I got no time for runnin' around, chasin' skirts 
So, see, my sound is a corrector 
A profound lecture 
Quality texture 
That's because of what I see 
A lot of emcees are gassed like hellium 
Word up, G
A lot of people in general are straight up no good 
Makes me want to shoot 'em 
Aiyo, maybe I should 
But instead I parlay 
Maintain self control 
And say a prayer for the lost souls

[Chorus]

[Guru]
Get up, stand up 
Come on, stand up for your right 
One, two
I go to new heights with my insight 
Whipping my mic tight 
With the height of a scholar 
Equipped with the gift to make crazy dollars 
But that ain't the whole 
See my heart is in it 
That's the only way one could even attempt to win it 
Dj spin it while others critique 
But the science makes 'em weak 
Check the words that I speak 
See, it's ridiculous for us 
Not to discuss 
The real issues 
Like all you phonies 
And why I dis you 
Dismiss you as a lost soul

[Chorus]

[Jason Kay of Jamiroquai/Guru]
If you don't watch where you step 
You can become indirect 
And you know that you will lose your soul 
And if you truly want to lose 
Until there's nothing to choose 
Then you know that you will lose your soul 
To the lost soul 
I hope you find your way someday 
So I sit, and I pray 
For the lost soul 
I hope you find your way someday

How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

looking for a brand new start
but little does she know that when she left that day

Jan & Dean,"I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night
When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said ""You're on buddy, my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way to Dead Man's Curve""

Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve

The street was deserted late Friday night
We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You should've heard the whine from my screamin' machine

I flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were at Dead Man's Curve

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play

Where did I lose it? What did I do wrong?

And I noticed there wasn't a chair

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

You'll never know that I still love you

I'll do my crying in the rain

Will never wash away my misery

I'll wait for stormy weather

Heart and soul, the way a fool would do, madly
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night

Heart and soul, I begged to be adored
Lost control, and tumbled overboard, gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist

Oh! but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so strangely willing

But now I see, what one embrace can do
Look at me, it's got me loving you madly

Where the best surfers in the world come to stay
And ride the wild surf they come to try
To conquer those waves some 30 feet high

Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last ride

Surf fever brings them here to meet the test
And hanging round the beach you'll see the best
They're waxed up and ready just waiting for
The surf to build up on the northern shore

Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside
Nothing can stop it cause you've just gotta ride ride ride ride ride
The heavies at the pipeline are OK
But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay
It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown
To catch the last wave and ride it in alone

Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

That we would never see each other again

Wait

To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see

When an XKE pulled up on the right

Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine

And all the Jag could see were my six taillights

Solo yo la paso mejor

No quiero amores
No vengas con tu traición 
Las penas yo las olvido con alcohol 
Solo yo la paso mejor

La vida no te trata bien, duele
Tu juego se acabo, fuiste tú la que apagó la ilusión 
Buscándome ahora, ya no
Periódico de ayer se fue lo último que quedó 
Aunque muera por estar en tus brazos 
Vete lejos que así es mejor 

No quiero nada contigo 
Solo la paso mejor 
Eres amor prohibido y tú lo sabes, bebé 

No quiero nada contigo

No quiero amores 
No vengas con tu traición 
Las penas yo las olvido con alcohol 
Solo yo la paso mejor

Desde que no estás yo estoy mejor 
Sé que por las noches te hace falta mi cariño, mi calor, 
Baby ya no quiero nada contigo 
El tiempo pasado para mi eso fue tiempo perdido
Por estar celando ahora estás sola 
Otra mamasita en la casa controla 
Cuando ves mi foto yo sé que tú te incomodas 
Porque estoy al día y soy el nuevo chamaquito de la moda 

No quiero nada contigo 
Solo la paso mejor 
Eres amor prohibido y tú lo sabes, bebé

No quiero nada contigo 
Solo la paso mejor 
Eres amor prohibido y tú lo sabes, bebé 

No quiero amores

Be tossed and blown
Walk on

For being so untrue

While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me

And traffic jams
And anagrams

Were parted by only a slight thing.

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from

Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Jan Davis,"Make sense of the world when it’s upside down
Spinning so fast, but for some it just ends
Keep moving on quiet as kept
It hasn’t been long, hasn’t sunken in yet

Then I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Fall into pieces
I’ll never see you again
Separate like a puzzle floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life
So lost

There’s so many things we haven’t said
There’s so many places never went
Wish you could visit every now and then
Oh I keep pretending like I understand
Was it something that I could prevent?
Oh I miss you like a piece is gone
So lost

Cause I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Oh I fall into pieces
Never seeing you again
I separate like a puzzle and I’m floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life

So I rise and fall like the tide
And I’m so full and empty inside
All those memories linger in my mind

That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

Jan DeGaetani,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1992

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win

Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Das Label, das Booking, das Management, Kosten der Reise
Die Gage, Mann, guck das was dableibt!

Zu viele Aufgaben, um mich abzulenken
Zu viel im Auftrag, um zu stoppen
Kann nur noch volle Kraft voraus starten, um das Blatt zu wenden

Zu Vernunft sehen gelangt, meine Umwege lang
Kann nicht umdrehen, nicht rum stehen, mich umsehen im Land
Fokussiert, denn auf steinigem Grund geht es lang
Über Berge, durch Täler, ich lerne durch Fehler
Der Schmerz wird zum Lehrer
Der Gefährte zum Gegner, die Fährte unlesbar

Der Hunger, die Fragen, die Hoffnung, die Rage, die Träume, Visionen, die Schulden, die Pläne
Die Stunden, die Tage, die Wochen, die Jahre, Enttäuschung, Belohnung - geduldige Seele
Die Suche, das Quälen, die Opferbereitschaft, im Regen verdursten
Der Fluch und der Segen, die kostbare Heimat, das Fehlen der Wurzeln
Die Ängste, die Krisen, die Hürden, die Wege, die Schritte, die Stufen
Die Zweifel, der Glaube, die Kämpfe, die Ziele, die Bürde, die Tränen, das Schwitzen und Bluten
Ich möchte nur vorankommen, sag mir muss ich’s überdenken oder muss ich über Grenzen?
Will endlich ankommen! Aber muss ich übermenschlich sein, ein Muster für die Menschen?
Beginne mit Fehltritten, aber finde Heilung innerlich, wenn ich die Zweifel flippe
Finde meine Mitte, bringe Sinn in meine Risse und verbinde meine Schritte (los)

Jan Delay,"Ich bin ne Kartoffel und ich bin cool damit
Ich nehm das Thema her und schreibe noch 'n Superhit
Über dieses öde Gemüse und seine Eigenschaft
Stärke zu besitzen, aber leider keinen Geschmack
Ist ne bittere Pille für die Leute, doch selbst Schuld
Sie wählten Archie und der brachte die Fäule

Ja es waren die Kartoffeln, die den Dämon erschufen
Und alle Flasher mussten abhauen, oder kamen in die Duschen
Seitdem ist hierzulande alles finster
Für Stil und Humor herrschten 70 Jahre Winter
Ja, der Flavour ist braun und der Groove, der ist Marsch
Und wir haben keinen Stock, sondern nen Wald im Arsch
(Kartoffeln)

Aber wenn das, was ich gerade
Hier gelabert habe stimmt
Wieso kann ich dann verdammt
Nochmal so cool sein wie ich bin?

Gehts um Entertainment bei unserm Knollengewächs
Sag ich, ""Bonjour Tristesse"" und zwar im vollen Effekt
Nee, wir haben andre Hobbys, andre Vorlieben
Regeln vorschreiben oder auch Riegel vorschieben
Ja, wir scheißen auf Mucke, wollen lieber bausparen

Darum haben andre Bob Marley und wir haben Klaus Lage
Keinen Miles Davis, nicht mal einen Frank Sinatra
Darum sind hier alle so Modebewusst wie Taxifahrer
(Oh Kartoffeln)

Wir tragen die schlimmsten Klamotten
Die Hosen Karotten und Sandalen mit weißen Socken
(Kartoffeln)
Hab ich sie im Ausland getroffen
Hab ich mich stets geschämt
Und sie waren noch nicht mal besoffen

Aber wenn das, was ich gerade
Hier gelabert habe stimmt
Wieso kann ich dann verdammt
Nochmal so cool sein wie ich bin?

Als Kartoffel Da sollte man in ner Stadt leben
Weil hier die Zutaten sind, die einem Geschmack geben
Ja hier in Hamburg, zwischen Sam und Tocotronic
Krieg ich gar nicht so viel mit von den 70 Jahren Grobmotorik
Gib mir: Gutes Radio, gutes Fernsehen, gute Mode

Gutes Essen, gute Clubs
Und ein paar fähige Idole
Gib mir das alles, Digger
Und wir könnten wetten
In 20 Jahren mach ich
Dir aus Bielefeld Manhattan

Hier gelabert habe stimmt
Wieso kann ich dann verdammt
Nochmal so cool sein wie ich bin?

Mit ner kleinen Story, nem kleinem Drama
Es geht um die, die an der ganzen Scheiße verzweifeln
Sich ne Wumme greifen und auf den Kirchturm steigen

Es war ein Fehler, sie zu verarschen
(Ihr habt sie belogen, jetzt stehen sie da oben)
Ihr züchtet Kirchturmkandidaten
(Ihr habt sie belogen, jetzt stehen sie da oben)
Es war ein großer Fehler, sie zu verraten
(Ihr habt sie belogen, jetzt stehen sie da oben)
Jeden Tag züchtet ihr Kirchturmkandidaten

Manche Leute haben Nerven dick wie Drahtseile
Andre wiederum nur Nerven dünn wie Zahnseide
Diese Labilen sind der Grund, wenn ich sag
Behandelt andre immer so, dass ihr das Echo vertragt

Denn da oben auf der Kirche da steht einer und ist sauer
Er ballert in die Luft und schreit, ""Fight the Power""
Ihr habt ihn solang unter Druck gesetzt
Und darum solltet ihr euch alle besser ducken jetzt

Es war ein Fehler, sie zu verarschen

All das Geläster und Gelächter beim Job
Deshalbt hat er jetzt ne Baretta und ne Heckler & Koch
Wegen den Witzen damals über seine Aldi-Klamotten
Sind deine Reifen zerstochen und die Scheiben zerschossen

Auch die Steuerprüfung die hat er nie ganz verdaut
Darum macht ihr Bekanntschaft mit seiner Panzerfaust
Ihr habt ihn alle unter Druck gesetzt
Und darum solltet ihr euch alle lieber ducken jetzt

Es war ein Fehler, sie zu verarschen

(Ihr habt sie belogen, jetzt stehen sie da oben)
Es war ein großer Fehler, sie zu verraten

Schickt sie in überteure Warteschleifen

Will ihn nicht hören, deinen Freestyle-Rap

Also laber kein' Trott und wir machen ein Bild
Denn dann macht's gleich ""Stopp""

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me",Thank You for the Music [From Mamma Mia],2002
Jan Gelberman,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All [From Mamma Mia],2002

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, babe, no babe, oh, oh
Oh babe, all day sitting up
Sitting up thinking about you
 
Myself, I don't wanna see you leave
Please don't go, oh babe, no babe, oh babe
I'd rather be a blind, girl
 
Something told me that it was over, baby
When I saw you, when I saw you and that girl
And y'all was talking
 
Something deep down in my soul said, ""Go on, go on and cry girl""
When I saw you, when I saw you and that girl
And y'all was walking by
 
And I'd rather go blind, I'd rather go blind
I'd rather go blind, babe
Than to see you walk away, walk away
Don't walk away
'Cause I'd rather go blind",I'd Rather Go Blind,2017
