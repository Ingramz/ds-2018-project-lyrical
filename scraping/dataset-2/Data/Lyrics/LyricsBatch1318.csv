Black Lips,"Going on a vision quest, surf the mountain, ride the crest
(I've been looking in a new direction)
Starting down, I'm gettin in store
The world is clear from upper cores
(I've been looking in a new direction)

I want to laugh and I want to cry
I want to spit, but my mouth is dry
I want to run but I can't 'cause my legs don't go!
Where did they go?

Now and then I'm like a black bird
Setting in and giving cracker
(I've been looking in a new direction)
Face the mirror, start to change
I'm paranoid and feeling strange
(I've been looking in a new direction)

I want to laugh and I want to cry
I want to spit, but my mouth is dry
I want to run but I can't 'cause my legs don't go!
Where did they go?

Living like a pharisee, I walk around and lucid dream
(I've been looking in a new direction)
The day has past, the moon's a glow
I've lied awake, my eyes are closed
(I've been looking in a new direction)

I've been looking in a new direction
I've been looking in a new direction
I've been looking at a nude erection",New Direction,2011
Black Lips,"Lonely tipi set in the sky
Dancing circles on a summer night
Children laughing at his expense
Chucking more peanuts at a broken man
He'll keep waving Tomahawk in hand
His headdress is a flower
He ain't no stinking coward
I wish other people can see

Noc-A-Homa
Noc-A-Homa
Noc-A-Homa
Just like you and me

Everybody's leaving and the lights are on
He's got nowhere to lie when the crowd dissolves
He's just trying to root for the team
He's a one man tribe and a dying breed
And if you stab at him, well he'll surely be
His headdress is a flower
He ain't no stinking coward
I wish other people can see

Black Lips,"Raw oysters, Texas Pete
Sea urchin on the reef
Sour cheeseburger bit to eat

Lick butter goes with keef
Into the cocoa leaf
Fresh maggots on my teeth, they're cheap

Oh baby!

Sweet bread's my favorite treat
Fresh lactaid from my teeth
And surely it's right and meat and cheap

Fresh onions on my leaf
Horse radish with horse meat
Sea urchin, ocean skeet to you

Oh baby!",Raw Meat,2011
Black Lips,"Peter Parker's life is so much darker than the book I read
'Cause he was defenseless, so defenseless when he was a kid
It's your body, no one's body, but your's anyways
So Peter Parker don't let him mark ya, it's so much darker
Don't let him touch ya, he don't have to stay!
Don't fill a spider up with dread

Spidey's got powers, he takes all of the cowards
And he kills them dead
But when he was younger, an elder among him messed him in the head
So Peter Parker don't let him mark ya, it's so much darker
Don't let him touch ya, he don't have to stay!

The teacher looked at everyone with a PSA
She saw that our hearts were gone
She saw that in everyone!

Peter Parker's life is so much darker
Better tell him, man
'Cause it's your body, no one's body, but your's anyway

So Peter Parker don't him mark ya, it's so much darker
Don't let him touch ya, he don't have to stay!
Don't fill a spider up with dread
Don't fill a spider up with dread
Don't fill a spider up with dread

(Dude, they are conjuring up those demons 
Basically, they're taking spells out of that book

Black Lips,"Time is moving on
But you keep on crying
Crying oh so long
But I keep on moving, moving, moving right along

When you see me walking by her side
Don't give no dirty looks
You can know you can be my bride
But I'll just remove your hooks
So what your thinking can't be true
So you keep that in mind

Time is moving on
But you keep on crying
Crying oh so long
But I keep on moving, moving, moving right along

When I'm passing down the back of school
The teacher's start to kneel
They try to play me for a fool
But they can go to hell
So what they're saying can't be true,
So you keep that in mind

Time is moving on
But you keep on crying
Crying oh so long
But I keep on moving, moving, moving right along

On the highway going 91 while the cops are catching a snooze
Never thought we'd have so much fun just skipping and sipping the booze
Rocking goes away if you make it
So you keep that in mind

Time is moving on

Crying oh so long

Black Lodge,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time",Good Times,2008
Black Lungs,"No one should have to live in shame
It's this absurdity that clouds your mind
And pushes you away

What lies upon the altar?
Statues and hypocrites keep you in line
And never falter

Beat your kids pray to the holy ghost
All's forgiven Sunday you just wait in line
Accept the host

You're not devoid of faith
You never had it anyway

Will you let me go to hell however I choose?

Don't you pray for me and I won't pray for you
And that's all the both of us can do
Agree to disagree and hope that's enough

If it was there for you to run to
Kept you clinging on after all you've been through
If it was there for you to run to
Kept you clinging on after all you've been through

Will you let me go to hell however I choose?
",Fire and Brimstone,2008
Black Lungs,"When I start thinking, this is only a lust
I must confess I'd be better on my own
Then I start thinking this is really love
And I confess I can't do this alone

Don't look straight ahead, look to the side
Just keep me in the corner of your eye
Until it's time to go again

I keep this with me
It's so bittersweet night after night

Don't take this the wrong way, darling
You mean the world to me
I just never want that and we can keep singing
""Wedding cake and toothache equals love and pain""

I keep this with me
It's so bittersweet night after night
",For Her,2008
Black Lungs,"I hope this feeling never goes away
Never sleep at night, drift in and out all day
Try and get the best of me, living life this way

You gotta push yourself today
Don't just drink and dream
You gotta push yourself today, don't

When tonight is over
And yesterdays are all we got
I hope you made it count

I know I made it count
Hold fast tonight
Don't loosen up your grip
Tomorrow's not that certain
Hold fast tonight

You gotta push yourself today
Don't just drink and dream
You gotta push yourself today, don't

When tonight is over
And yesterday's are all we got
I hope you made it count

I know I made it count
Hold fast

When tonight is over
And yesterdays are all we got
I hope you made it count
I know I made it count
",Hold Fast (Sink or Swim),2008
Black Lungs,"Unnatural skies drift away calmly
Behind the trees right before my eyes
After that it gets dark rather quickly

This changing of the weather brings a lack of hope
As my thoughts drift away
To us sitting in the south end of town
And what you said that day

I've never seen that look in his eyes before
I should have died he said, eyes fixed on the floor
I've never seen that look in his eyes before
I should have died he said thinking of her

Just as soon as the light changed
He was smoking and laughing again
Reminding me of years ago
And telling me to never get old

Slowly the cancer wins
The cigarettes probably let it in
Slowly the cancer wins
Chemo doesn't work radiation was a sin

I've never seen that look in his eyes before
I should have died he said, eyes fixed on the floor
I've never seen that look in his eyes before
I should have died he said thinking of her
",In Memory,2008
Black Lungs,"No need to worry the kids
She kept her lips sealed
Until the test results came in
A mother's burden, that's all

My dear, you probably should have called
Cut up and bruised
It's a long way home
Snow storming and driving alone

You shouldn't have kept this to yourself
But there's no need to worry
You've got your health
So it goes

In some way, however small or secret
We are all a little mad
Well, you gave us a scare
Now you've got our attention
But then again you've always had

So tonight when you lay down to bed
Yeah, this pain, it is fleeting
Just rest your heavy head
The sutures will be out soon
Oh yes, the sutures will be out soon
So it goes
",So It Goes,2008
Black Lungs,"And I'll speak for them
The untimely, the tragic, the should have beens
For our loved ones to hear and our fallen friends
Don't choke up, be eloquent
It's moments like this that define us

Most of my friends, they drink too much
It seems the more they're in tune with the times
The more they drink

I don't know why they're wearing out early
Hard and languid at twenty one
This city is bloated glutted and stupid
The damage done

This goddamn restlessness is approaching hysteria
It doesn't muster much delight all the fucking and the fights
It's awful easy to let go
I know more than I let on or hope to do

So and I'll speak for them
The untimely, the tragic, the should have beens
For our loved ones to hear and our fallen friends
Don't choke up, be eloquent
It's moments like this that define us in the end
",These Moments Define Us,2008
Black Lungs,"This is nothing original, identifiable
Just familiarity to tap your toes to
The soundtrack to wake up something inside of you
You never knew existed

There is nothing prolific here
Nothing hasn't been done before
This is a sense of time and place
And a feeling to hold on to grow old with this
Hold this as tight as you can, make this timeless

I could remember not too long ago
This was all new to me
Back home things had fell to pieces
But you can't pick them up and start again

Oh no, would have never met you and you
Could have done without me and you
Things change but I wish some stayed the same
This is the spirit of something we never knew
But we all fell hard for it

I'm gonna hold this tight as I can
I'm gonna hold this tight as I can

We will keep singing along
Because when it mattered most
You touched our souls

Every single one of you
What the hell are you doing here?
If all this is and all we are
Are strangers to each other

We will keep singing along
Because when it mattered the most
You touched our souls
",Timeless,2008
Black Lyrics,"Joe le taxi 
Y va pas partout 
Y marche pas au soda

Tous les petits bars

Black M,"Je suis pas le le sheitan empoigné
Invicta sur le poignée
Wati-B sur le côté
Pète les cartilages comme un boucher
T'en as marre de me voir kiker, tout niquer
Ça se tape, et les gars, on va pas se piquer
Coup de coude dans les dents (Coup de coude dans les dents)
Quad raptor, raffalé
Ratatatata, c'est le 7-5
Venez bandes de bâtards
Je suis d'attaque pour mon bled
Sors mes soss du placard
Pour la tess, les k-SOS et (?)
Faire du lourd, du sale, j'en suis capable
Sortez-nous des hits bandes d'incapables
Comme le Qatar (comme le Qatar)
Je gère la capitale, laisse les cadavres
Plus qu'un phénomène
Au mic, je veux sortir de la pénombre
Pour les frères, les bad boys sous pilon
Les colosses qui poussent plus de 100 kilos
Comme Pirlo
Touche ma cible à 100 mètres au stylo
Du son ghetto comme t'aimes
Tout comme à Compton
Cousin il y a pas de thème

Moi, je fais l'effet d'un putain de tour de magie
Parle peu mais agis
Moi, j'ai fait le tour du monde sur ma 'sique
Quel parigot, c'est magique
Je kick, car au fond ma rage m'étouffe
Pendant que mon cœur me dit ""Tue les tous""
Que la place pour les faits divers
C'est la hass l'hiver et l'été ça shoote
Violent le 9-4 phénoménal
Surclassé rend mesure pénale
(?) conseille qu'elle soit radicale
Dans les ons où la rue fait cracher mes balles
Pour l'honneur et le biff je les ai amassé
Fini les rediff', ils sont dépassés
Pour effacer les ligues, pas de polémique
Je vais les Famas-er puis les dépecer

Ton col en V, faut l'enlever
C'est du meurtre dirty va y avoir des gueules enflées
J'ai mis du spliff dans un coffre, verrouillé
Je t'enverrais me les chercher quand, je serais rouillé

Quitte à vivre au Mississippi, si, si
Le cœur est froid comme un putain d'hooligan
Faut que je me tire de là, vite, vite, vite

Ils veulent tirer sur le Wa
Parce qu'on a toujours été là
Ils veulent tirer sur le Wa
Mais c'est moi le garde du corps chez moi
Ils veulent tirer sur le Wa
je leur ai donné un faux schéma
Ils veulent tirer sur le Wa
Mais ils mettront pas le pied chez moi

Toi, tu veux tirer sur le Wa (Wa)
Poto, tu tires à blanc (blanc)
Je regarde la concurrence, je me dis
""Putain, que des merdes"", attend
Ils m'en veulent parce que j'ai vendu
Ces bâtards veulent me voir pendu
Je regarde la concurrence, je me dis, crâne fendu
Je me fous de savoir qu'est ce t'en dis
Le son, je le prends, je l'incendie
Comme ils ont fait dans le son des bandits
Et notre putain d'empire, il grandit
Tout façon, ici on sait
D'où vient ce putain de rap français

Ouais, Black M te dira ""Faut l'enlever""

Qui kickent avec l'humeur d'un tchétchène

Attend, le bum-al', c'est le chantier

Que, dehors, j'ai un proche qui m'attend
Depuis qu'on a terminé le concert, et je me demande c'est qui
Parce qu'ici je connais personne, bref, j'y vais et comme toujours

Yes, merci la famille, vous êtes les meilleurs supporters

Je ne me prends pas pour une star, mon histoire, c'est pas Stan
Oui, j’ai ma petite vie sur Bériz avec la mif et je prie
Pour ne pas tomber sur ce genre de type hystérique
Mais ce week-end fut délicat, digne d'un drame américain
J’me dis que, dans la suite, tout le monde va penser que j’suis dingue
Cette fille qui me revient chaque fois en tête
On dirait qu'elle m'observe et, ça, ça m'embête
Depuis le début de la tournée, la nuit comme la journée
L’impression d'être manipulé comme si j'étais un jouet
Ce numéro privé qui m'appelle tous les deux jours
Et ces messages interminables qui défilent sur Facebook
""Black M, je t'admire, tu es ma seule famille
Tous les week-end, pour toi, j’descends sur Paris
Je sais que tu es marié et que tu as un fils
Oui, je suis folle de toi au point de prendre des risques""

J’me sens chelou comme si le danger
Était à mes pieds, comme si elle m'épiait
Et, là, dans le salon, une scène plutôt paro
Ma femme en train de gigoter, complètement ligotée
J’me jette sur elle, ah, défais son bandage, hum
Dis-moi ce qu'il se passe, où est le tit-pe?
Et, dans mon angoisse, j'la laisse, je fonce dans sa chambre
La porte est comme bloquée, j’entends des pleurs, ah
J’mets un gros chassé et la porte se casse
Une silhouette de dos, soudain, se retourne
Mon fils dans ses bras, oui, elle était là

Et la mer reste salée même si dedans tu viens cracher

Certains seront sûrement sauvés, mais, moi, j'sais ap'
Trop d'péchés exposés, ouais rien qu'j'dérape
Tu veux qu'j'te raconte ma story, ces moments maudits
Où l'Sheïtan est l'seul spectateur qui applaudit?
Eh bah non, j'peux pas m'plaindre, mon compte, il est blindé
Mon savoir est une arme qui ne cesse de tout flinguer
Mais la vie c'est pas l'rap, même si je rappe ma vie
Un mal fou à être présent parce que le monde va vite
Les petits reufrés sont timbrés, ne cessent de s'flinguer
Les commissaires, eux, prennent un plaisir à les épingler
Et quant à nos sistas, rien qu'on assiste à
Des auto-destructions, des femmes tristes
Pimpées, bimbos, pour séduire les gringos
Akhi, les gens sont prêts à tout pour remplir le frigo

Où la paix a signé un contrat d'intérim
Où devenir un homme saint, c'est puéril
J'ai cherché la tranquillité, putain, c'est un périple
Témoin de leurs débats, ils nous trouvent incultes
Khouya, je suis venu, j'ai vu, j'ai été vaincu
On a tous vu des choses qui traumatisent
Les soirs d'hiver glacial, j'peux dire qu'le métro m'attriste
Des fois, les larmes coulent, c'est automatique
C'est peut-être la saison, ou alors c'est trop la crise
J'ai vu cet homme seul, sale qui pue la tise
Seul, saoul, ça l'saoule plus, y'a plus son fils qui l'soutient
J'ai vu la solitude de cet homme qui jadis était un leader fort et dur

Le feu de l'action qui brûle peu importe ta décision 
J'aurais pas dû faire de ma réalité une fiction 
Peut-être que foncer tête baissée, telle est la vraie définition de l'amour

You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.

Black Market Militia,"My lord, hear thy prayer
As we sit amongst our fathers

From black Israelites to a liberal life, young guy from prison
Fight the system, Muslim, Jews and Christian
The hoodlum serving food in kitchens, politician, lawyer
Judges, destroy the brothers, amongst the youngsters
Dumpster, project hallways, equal more graves
Add it up, since the fourth grade, minus that, from the gun claps
Now divide that from the cats who ever slung crack, whoever done that
To all races, faces and man, with holes in his hand
He will even bracelets, or race our soul where we stand
My eyes, have seen hell, between jail, and bullet shells
Heard some words from the both Bushes yell
It ain't kill Saddam, we build the 'Nam
Close both palms, shut my eyes, then reply
Old Jerusalem, we criminals, Subliminal's click
Two Eilan live on, we toast to biblical scripts, come on

I want you to ride it (for the shadow of death)
I feel nobody (there's no one else)
I read for my one's
I want you to ride it (for the shadow of death)

I rise like the sun, and shine

And I ain't cryin', and I ain't layin' down to dyin'
If I'm lyin', you can throw me off the Mountain of Xian
The law be like fuck this, trap 'em in a chair and fry 'em
I write doctrines, everything I spit is a psalm
Walk the hood, with holes in my feet and palms
Throw on crown made of ice, millennium Christ
I bled with Malcolm, til the struggle gave my life
I walk through the valley of death, scorched through hell's fire
Cell 33's a lot, in Elmira, grew wiser
Learned my culture, from old timers
Dark conscious, made in an image, doing the knowledge
Like, extraterrestrial beings, the all seeing
Out the sun roof screamin', clappin' the mack demon
My success is a journey, not a destination of faces
Snakes layin' in waiting, congrogatin' with Satan
Days of Gamora, need more, some water, I'm shakin'
My ancestors is cryin', I'm feelin' tears of the rain
Baptized in the Nile, and I'm trapped in pain

The Black Market (tact!)
The Black Market (tact!)

As it was in the beginning
So shall it be in the end
As we walk through the shadows of death
We'll find a way to win
This is the last will and testament
Of a light that's been dimmed
Of a heart that's lost it's rhythm
And attacks it's own reflection
Eyes of a blind, to the beauty of themselves
And souls of the so sacred, books were written
Temples were built, Jesus was born
In the womb of our love, for mankind
And this is the last sacrament, this is the last offering
The last jester, to spark the fire, to lift the spirit
Before the light turns back to black
Before the waves become a tidal, before the moon bleeds rivers of despair
And the stars become black holes in the sky

Black Menace,"First Verse (Threat + Insane):
(Threat)
For my doggs, Southside, Westside I ride,
Eastside, Northside, the Menace back Worldwide,
With plans of takin' over, soldiers be deep in the street,
Slangin' heat, nothin' sweet, playin' games for keeps,
Many thugs out in the blood, six deep in the mud,
Worldwide, I'm ready to ride and show my niggas some love,
I'm still in it to win it, every single second in a minute,
Black Menace to the finish, heart dark like windows tinted,
Finished Menace Entertainment, steppin' I represent it,
Government it for life, so let, that be the sentence,
Strap provin' relentless in battle with camoflauge,
Still at large, takin' charge, dogg I'm holdin' bars

(Insane)
Down with my rounds, Lil' Insane breakin' bitches off,
Still that same nigga that bought the liquor to set the party off,
Got some weed, smoke it nigga, don't get busted with that shit,
If you smoke it hard and claim you loaded boy you need to quit,
Make it happen Captain I ain't come here for no conversation,
Came to get some pussy, smoke some weed and do some paper chasin',
Weather bakin', if you hate me, oh fa sho I'm whoopin' ass,
Chase you out the parkin' lot and have you mashin' on the gas,
Kinda fast, gotta get the fuck from round these real niggas,
You the type of cat that pull your gat and never kill niggas,
Foreal nigga, saw you once before with all that fake hatin',
Beatin' on your girl 'cause she was on my dick, booty-shakin',
Talkin' all that shit, 'cause you knew the fuckin' club was crowded,
Got you outside, looked in your eyes and knew you wasn't bout it,
So uh...

[Chorus (All):]
Don't talk about it, if you bout it, be bout it,
Don't talk about it, if you bout it, be bout it,
Don't talk about it, if you bout it, be bout it,
Don't talk about it, if you bout it, be bout it,
Don't talk about it, if you bout it, be bout it,
Don't talk about it, if you bout it, be bout it,
Don't talk about it, if you bout it, be bout it,
Don't talk about it, if you bout it, be bout it,
Don't talk about it, if you bout it, be bout it,

Second Verse (Tim Smooth + Geronimoe):
(Tim Smooth)
Never, ever, ever, ever,
I never leave my gun on the seat,
Bitch I come with my heat,
I'm a wild muthafucka, just one nigga deep,
Fuck a crew, nobody loves Tim, times is hard,
You get, one true friend, minus God,
And then they wind up tall runnin' off at the trap,
Act a ass, guardin' the cross and that's a wrap,
Matter of fact, when niggas can't tap your hat,
We react by shankin' everybody at'cha shack,
>From Algiers on back, to the heights of the Terror-Town,
Movin' your lips and you gettin' flipped every round,
Pound for pound was back in the days,
Not actin' your age, 'cause back in the days,
You afraid, ain't no nigga gone murder Tim,
He got noise I'm servin' him,
He got boys I'm servin' them,
Swervin' in with my grip, and intent to hit,
Any nigga disrespect and they feel this shit

(Geronimoe)
Now niggas with the slick beefin' be the reason,
Bitch niggas wind up with they shit leakin' from bitch speakin',
My niggas gat totin', smokin' niggas on contact,
Fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with niggas bout combat,
I'm that, that nigga cock it or pop it,
I spark it the dark, and bitch I walk it like I talk it,
Dawg it's that muthafucka fa sho, nigga its me,
Geronimoe, Pigeon-Town, baby Seventeenth,
Where these gangsta, gangsta niggas, doin' they thang,
Hoes shank them, sank a nigga, now let 'em hang,
Seventeenth hoes about theirs,
Look Uptown and Downtown, get out that nigga get out the way,
Man these G-Hounds from G-town,
Come through, better be down,
Then you see now how we clown,
This U.P.T. Bound,
Them G-rounds make a sweet sound,
Fuck around up in P-Town,
I creep round where you be found,
Bitch come back, look at me now,
Nigga what?

[Chorus (.5x)]
Third Verse (J-Dawg):
Now from the East bank to the other side of the water,
Look at the side of the club and see the other side of your daughter,
Like when this beat come on, she came on the floor and get buck,
Like the verse on the truck, watch her back that ass up,
I can't pass up, the opportunity to get with it,
Then I'ma watch her while she pop it, like she want me to hit it,
So now I'm dancin' with her, askin' her to jet when I leave,
Crankin' up a session in the corner, blessin' the weed,
I'm all in, ain't got to spend, 'cause the Hen on the house,
Do me a favor Baby, dump your boyfriend and we out,
Don't talk about it, be about it, now is you rollin' or what?
And tell that nigga to get the fuck on 'cause he holdin' us up,
Now open the side door, jump in the ride, holdin' the weed,
She don't smoke, but she like Georgia so I'm blowin' her jeep,
You on next, you know what come next, removin' our clothes,
Her eyes red, from the smoke, I done blew through her nose,
Struck up a pose, with her leg cocked, foot on the dash,
I got a hand full of red cock, foot on the gas,
Now while I'm drivin' catch my zipper girl and handle yo biz,
Don't talk about it, if you bout it, be about it, ya dig?
Now what?

The way I see it, look the two of us could mash as a team,
Can't let you pass, look, what'cha doin' with all that ass in them jeans?
I made ya smile, but'cha still walkin',
You in a rush? I like ya style, that's why I'm still talkin',
Plus I'm tryin' to cut, wouldn't be a man if I ain't tell ya that,
Fuck who you with you need to get with this instead of that,
Now holla back,
You need a man, who could put a lot of money in your purse,
It ain't no thang and if I got it, look I'm comin' to church,
And praise the Lord wit'cha,
Raise your lil' boy wit'cha,
Introducin' you to the softer side, of a hard nigga,
Gaze at the stars wit'cha while we're sexin' under the moon,
What'cha want? Candy? Flowers? Or a couple balloons?
I'll tell ya what Baby let's take a ride,
I gotta woman, but I'm selfish I'ma make you mine,
I'ma take my time and do it right until you're spoiled rotten,
Or bring your Baby by your Mama and then we gone shoppin',
I got'cha rockin' knickerbockers in the summertime,
I'm lovin' how you smell in Chanel number nine,
Seek and you find what you been missin' Boo I'm all you need,
I'm kinda tired if you want to ride then you can take the keys

[Chorus]
(Insane)
I'm lil' Frankie gotta get my bankie, smoke a stankie with Mitch,
And you need to know with a fifth of dope, we'll stick our dick in a bitch,
And she be lovin' the shit confessin' how lil' Frankie done done her,
Her Mama bust in the room and I'm fuckin' her right in front her,
Bust a nut right in front her, I lit up a blunt right in front her,
Looked at my bitch and told her ""You want some more?"" right in front her,
She lovin' the way I done her, reppin' in front her friends,
Talkin' bout how I fucked and how I could fuck her again,
Waitin' to spin the bin with a thug nigga from the South,
Soon as she see the dick she start doin' tricks with her mouth,
You know what I'm talkin' bout, yeah I spent some lil' change on her,
I ain't no fuckin' stunter I ain't puttin' no rings on her,
Puttin' no chain on her, buyin' a car or nothin',
Get her some tennis shoes and a skirt and I'm fuckin' somethin',
Lil' Frankie bout pluckin' somethin' anytime I get the chance,
Started off in the club with a dance, now I'm in the pants,
Boo what'cha bout?

[Chorus]
(Mr. Terror)
I ain't no major-made nigga, but I'm top of the line,
Sharp as a razor blade nigga, I'm blockin' your shine?
Boo I've been watchin' from the line and saw you talkin' to him,
But how you plan on gettin' home? What? You walkin' with him?
I'm stalkin' ya slim, and down to spend a few G's wit'cha,
She said ""You five oh bitch, you lyin', you ran that shit on my sister"",
I need a place where I can whisper, let's go holla outside,
Take this fifth and get two drinks, and follow to the ride,
Caught her walkin' out the door, but shot my piece for the rum,
Here's a deposit on that pussy, get the other G when you're done,
Got another G for my big son, and drove in his cutlass,
With no A/C and one front seat, and told lil' Wootay I'm thuggin',
She ain't buggin', sat on the crate, and then we mashed to the 'tele,
Fucked her face, beat up the pussy, then I splashed on her belly,
Scored my loot, backed up the place goin' ten dollars a cut,
And found another bitch to holler before you ever wake up,
Boo what'cha bout?

Things always change that's a fact of life
You can never wake up to the same day twice
Every way I see, something new feels good to me
I could stay, I could go, I could just take flight
You'll never wake up to the same day twice

Trying to find myself today, sometimes life gets in the way
All I'm looking for is some peace of mind
Was quiet, now it's too loud, suns up, then storms a cloud
Sometimes I wish things would stay the same
In this world that's always changing

Every day I see, there's something new to me
Things always change that's a fact of life
You can never wake up to the same day twice
Every way I see, something new feels good to me
I could stay, I could go, I could just take flight
You'll never wake up to the same day twice

I'm getting sick of this old scene
You and me it's the same routine
'Cause forever is only a state of mind
'Cause you're preoccupied, I think it's justified
That I can't help think about someone new
We were scared to open our eyes

Every day I see, there's something new to me

You can never wake up to the same day twice
Every way I see, something new feels good to me
I could stay, I could go, I could just take flight
You'll never wake up to the same day twice

If yesterday was repeated today
Would the choices you made still have been okay
Would the grass be just as green
Would you say what you said although it was mean

And tell me, would you have tried a little harder
So I could have been with someone smarter?
If you ran in that race, would you still come in last?
Would you let time have past you by so fast?

Every day I see, there's something new to me
Things always change that's a fact of life
You can never wake up to the same day twice
Every way I see, something new feels good to me

Never on the Isle, bucked shots as a juvenile
A little freestyle fanatic, I shot the rap addict
With an automatic, now I got static
See back in the days, I was a stone cold hood
Now I'm a paid hood, still up to no good
With my crew from the Heights and the Island

Blowing up the spot, I leave my name engraved

You can't fuck with the nigga that's live

Giving niggaz the raw deal, with the mad appeal
This time around, I flex the tec with ease
And if you really want it, I give an extra squeeze
'Cause I'll cut out your heart, and leave it pumping in my hand
Spit on your grave, and let you know who's the man
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide

Wiz, Tec and Stelle, niggaz, you know the deal
I'm for real no joke, so on the gun smoke
Provoke, your dusty style, makes me choke
Never bite, but I write, when I grab mics
Boot your pretty bitch ass boy, and take flight
With my razor, the infra-red lazer, blaze ya
Like cane, I raise your little shorter's bad behavior
Niggaz better know that when I flow, I'm drinkin gin and cinnomin
And when I flaunt it, ACK LIKE YOU WANT IT

Ack like you want it, what, bring the drama

From the town where niggaz always get bucked down
Kicked in the door, keep my finger on the pound
Word is around, that you're looking for the 5
Surprise, real niggaz always survive
Don't be amazed, I'm alive from the flames
No need to scream now your calling out my name
You little bitch ass nigga, you tried to take my life
Now I'm taking all you own, plus I'm fucking your wife
After that my man's, gonna hit your only daughter
And leave her body floating in some bloddy bath water
Just like a snake, sl-sl-slitters on the ground
Nobody hears me move, even know that I'm around
You acting like you want it, now you're gonna have to get it

Verse One: Steele 
Here we go, break of day, with a mad live session 
Down in Bucktown it's Black Moon, and Smif-N-Wessun 
Pick up the pace 'cause we're right behind ya black 
The punk got X-amount of shots, take one to your back 
BOO-YAA-KAA!!! Mr. Ripper did the shooting 
Cops heard the shots, shit's hot 'cause they're pursuing 
But it's my stomping groung where herds get blown down 
Think I'm gettin caught by beasts youse a damn clown 
Check the drums of death as I break what's left 
of your face, 'cause you're sellin out the rap race 
Your family cried as your body lies in it's casket 
I keep a black Smith-and-Wessun in my polo jacket 
Sixteen shots, for all you hardrocks 
And if your bitch is a dime she can get the cock 
Straight up and down, we two terrible toughies 
The Vickster hit your pockets then I made your eyes puffy 
What pussy? Better drop your mic and get to steppin 
Before you're face to face with a black Smith-and-Wessun 
Chorus: repeat 4X 
Load the clip, bust lead to the head 
The nappy head dread, Buckshot and Baldhead 
Verse Two: Buckshot 
Real niggaz represent and don't die 
Never dead like I said all we fuckin do is multiply

Niggaz be like ""Yo who the shorty?"" 
I'm bustin niggaz with my six-shooter 
I get so much pussy my dick be in stitches 
Red-boned or even fucked-up black Zulu bitches 
What? This lil nigga is a mad stalker 
Brooklyn, New York will grab the leash around your neck and then I

If youse a bigger nigga bigger niggaz get bucked 
'cause I'm the Buck and I don't give a fuck my dick you can suck 
Buck is a killer, thrill a nigga like Manilla

A crazy-ass nigga puttin Brooklyn on the map

I even blew your bitch 'cause your man tried to stick me 
Chorus 
Verse Three: Tek 
Ahh shit, a personality split 
And I'm bout to flip with my nigga pull the trigger let the Glock spit

Another boom blew up the scene 
throughout the planet, get green, now I got sticky mean with my tag 
team 
G want a clip thinkin I'm takin this the underground moves 
There ain't no more fakin if you're fakin I'm bakin it 
Straight up and down, nuff respect to Bucktown 
Home of the chrome, where I roam, not givin a FUCK now 
Damn, just when you thought it was safe

Boom, hooked up with Black Moon, now it's on for real

No comma, straight through your mama like acid
I fucked her, then I jetted, that's why you's a little bastard
You talk mad shit with no back up, what's up, act up
You punk niggas get smacked up, word life
You fuckin' with the wrong nigga
I fuck too many on the mic, they call me daddy long trigger
Mister Buckshot, makin' the gun hot
From niggas who fiend to see my little ass rot
Peep my style, check my level
I'm so hot, I shot a fuckin' fair one with the devil

Some pack a mac, I choose to pack a black 22
By my waistline, buckin' your whole crew
I step through, and represent Black Moon
First, before I kick a verse, I puff a bag of boom
Lyrically I freak your funk you never heard
My shit is so fly, when I kick it, it's absurd
Damn, how I wrecked your life with one record
Made your crew break up and your girl get naked
Respected, because I work hard for my cash
Shakin' more flavor then Mrs. Dash
Look out below, my flow will hit your brain
I got dough, but I still hop the train
I'm bustin' niggas open, Attica style
Yo, straight to the jugular, brother you're mad foul
Gimme dap, because I rock with the best
Yo, peace to the hardcore niggas, fuck the rest

I pop junk and keep the pump in the trunk
Puff the skunk and get high, Oh lord
Get on my skateboard and do a motherfuckin' driveby
You little crab ass flea
Biting my style, you know the original rudeboy is me
Buckshot, no joke, smoke a nigga like buddha
Who the fuck you think you playin' wit
Yeah, I'm sayin' it
Cause I want beef, for you can hang here right
Yo, sometimes I wonder how the fuck you get a mic
But I don't sweat that, cause I 'm still paid
Niggas get bucked down, bitches get sprayed
I do what I must, just so I can make loot
If it's illegal, pack the gat son
You know how we do, true

Black Moon,"Check how I kick it, when I was wicked, around the way
Hold my Tec, 'cause my niggaz pump by day
Drugs and thieves hit the eve of the night
Niggaz who fake real, come on a real flight
Six feet deep in the creep
Mic technique got a nigga locked down for a week
Word is bond, shit is on like this
Gotta move, 'cause I'm on a nigga hitlist
You know the kid with the rock from up the block
Hit him up with the glock now his pops on my rooftop
Ridiculous to think you're hittin me
You're not hittin me you're gettin me upset with the threat
But I'm a little nigga from the heart of Bucktown
My stomping ground is Brooklyn bound
Fuck what you heard, it's about what you hit
And if that's your girl, then your bitch ain't shit
Fuckin all my niggaz 'cause they know Black Moon
Shit iz real yo, pass that boom

Never parlay without a L
Inhale the first hit for all my niggaz locked in jail
Then go for dolo on a coup, laundry
Shoot the wack in the back and I'm aight all day
It's hot, shit is on ask the cops
Tell the dreadlock that I rule the block
Ease back, nuff man ah die like that
Eyah pussy all de X-amount of shot in your back
Word to my hardrocks on Franklin Ave
Feel the bloodbath of the aftermath
The wrath of Duck Down, Bucktown is real
Word to my nigga Five Ft on the steel
on a nigga who faked the jack, yo lift it back
Fuck where you're from, it's about where you're at
Where your gat?  Whenever you in Bucktown
Shit iz real, all you hear is the sound

I'm real, shit iz real, fuck the raw deal
Pick up the bitch in the back by the field
on the word, shit is heard in two-third
Pump herb to my niggaz from a nickel bag of absurd
On-The-Real is locked down, what?
Beast can't step one foot in Bucktown
Mr. Ripper hit your back up with holes
All my niggaz on G mad lows knows
all about the breaker of the cash
Nigga nasty-ass, hittin all on my Bill Blass
I got a vibe in site, hmmm
Maybe 'cause I had to get it on last night
With a nigga from up the block, who walked the rock
Drill him, but in another game I'ma head swell him
And when it comes to loading clips
Niggaz talk shit get hit with the Tec at the hip
Straight from Bucktown, U.S.A.
All my niggaz must represent eryday
on the steel, shit iz real word to Feel
Shit iz real, yo shit is mad real",Shit Iz Real [Buckshot's New Vocal],1993

Whatever type of shit the nigga Buckshot makes
The incredible lyrical and original
You can kill it, bull, if you wanna take a pull
Whatever I see I attack(tack)
Fuck off my back black, nigga fuck that
The devil lurks and my heart irks for the Hell

Pick up the pace 'cause we're right behind ya black
The punk got X-amount of shots, take one to your back
BOO-YAA-KAA! Mr. Ripper did the shooting
Cops heard the shots, shit's hot 'cause they're pursuing
But it's my stomping ground where herds get blown down
Think I'm getting caught by beasts you's a damn clown
Check the drums of death as I break what's left
Of your face, 'cause you're sellin' out the rap race
Your family cried as your body lies in its casket
I keep a black Smith-and-Wessun in my Polo jacket
Sixteen shots, for all you hardrocks
And if your bitch is a dime she can get the cock
Straight up and down, we two terrible toughies
The Vickster hit your pockets then I made your eyes puffy
What pussy? Better drop your mic and get to steppin

Knapsack strapped on my back cause everything got bagged
In sight, when I got put out put up a fight
Then I took flight, all you seen was a streak of light
Ghost, you didn't catch me if you wanted to
I'm broke, it's time to catch some wreck, where's my crew?
Hit up the mall, then fill up the bag with ease
Pump shit on the block and make at least two g's
Sometimes I even hit the pocket, I got knocked
One time, two times, shit, they couldn't stop it
I had to make my loot, I had to make my dough
So I took my 'Lo and Guess, then bumped the rest

Turn around slowly, bitch, you know the deal

But if I puff a daydream, damn, I'm gettin played
Word to my meals, no frills, gotta go
And if you wanna bump makin dough let me know

Hold my Tec, 'cause my niggaz pump by day

Niggaz who fake real, come on a real flight
Six feet deep in the creep
Mic technique got a nigga locked down for a week
Word is bond, shit is on like this
Gotta move, 'cause I'm on a nigga hitlist
You know the kid with the rock from up the block
Hit him up with the glock now his pops on my rooftop
Ridiculous to think you're hittin me
You're not hittin me you're gettin me upset with the threat
But I'm a little nigga from the heart of Bucktown
My stomping ground is Brooklyn bound
Fuck what you heard, it's about what you hit
And if that's your girl, then your bitch ain't shit
Fuckin all my niggaz 'cause they know Black Moon
Shit iz real yo, pass that boom

Never parlay without a L
Inhale the first hit for all my niggaz locked in jail
Then go for dolo on a coup, laundry
Shoot the wack in the back and I'm aight all day
It's hot, shit is on ask the cops
Tell the dreadlock that I rule the block
Ease back, nuff man ah die like that
Eyah pussy all de X-amount of shot in your back
Word to my hardrocks on Franklin Ave
Feel the bloodbath of the aftermath
The wrath of Duck Down, Bucktown is real
Word to my nigga Five Ft on the steel
On a nigga who faked the jack, yo lift it back
Fuck where you're from, it's about where you're at
Where your gat? Whenever you in Bucktown
Shit iz real, all you hear is the sound

I'm real, shit iz real, fuck the raw deal
Pick up the bitch in the back by the field
On the word, shit is heard in two-third
Pump herb to my niggaz from a nickel bag of absurd
On-the-real is locked down, what?
Beast can't step one foot in Bucktown
Mr. Ripper hit your back up with holes
All my niggaz on G mad lows knows
All about the breaker of the cash
Nigga nasty-ass, hittin all on my Bill Blass
I got a vibe in site, hmmm
Maybe 'cause I had to get it on last night
With a nigga from up the block, who walked the rock
Drill him, but in another game I'ma head swell him
And when it comes to loading clips
Niggaz talk shit get hit with the Tec at the hip
Straight from Bucktown, U.S.A.
All my niggaz must represent eryday

Black Moon,"I woke up in the night
Grabbed my forehead
Wipe my forehead with the sweat on to the bed
Deep inside thought
Thinking of a way to get trapped 
And walk the streets without getting clapped
Just because I'm tieing the fuzz growing in my buzz
I'm doing my justice, bust this slug to the ignorant
Who said I didn't have knowledge of self
So come and feel the wrath
So listen
First of all let me explain
That sometimes when I drop this see I'm bound to make it rain

Guaranteed to move feets and I go on for weeks
Maybe years if my peers give me ears to fill
Lick off a shot and act ill, parlay and chill
See I paid my dues, now you can't tell me nothing

Chorus 4X: Buckshot
Why the Devil keep fuckin with me
Why the Devil keep fuckin with me

[Buckshot]
Listen up yo, ah
Feel like the Devil got a personal grudge against Buck
What the fuck
Walkin through the streets, mindin my biz
Fearin like the Devil know what time it is
Rollin my leaf, just bought a dime
Everything is spinnin in my goddamn mind
Hold up, wait a minute, speak a one time
It's too many voices in my head, I hear the flatline
Could of sworn I heard the voice whisper from behind
Kinda deep though, made a nigga creep slow and breath slow
Cautious, nautious I could feel it in my stomach
The Devil want to blow the trumpet
Look at every step I take, I could feel it every breath I take
If I sniff up one time, I feel the earthquake
Damn the takes, so much to hold it all inside my chest
Feel like I'm bout to jest
Blow up, but before I do, I'mma take to them demoms
Schemin on whole crew

Chorus 4X

[Buckshot]
I used to want a Beemer, I used to want a Benz
One thing that I never wanted was fake friends in the end
I knew that ones that stuck by me be, was the ones that see me
On the streets, not TV
It's an everyday, it's an all day
Devils and the cops will get me in the hallway
Hopes drop me in the for slay
Around the third, because I'm about to blow
And be the shit, my word
I don't give a fuck, I ain't trying to quit at all
Even if my back is up against the wall, I brawl
It's a struggle in life, and it struggles the game
But whatever you gain when you at your worst at you feel the pain inside
That's when I'm near my goal
I could taste success, gotta stay in control
See the world's cold, momma told me from day one
""Prepare to blaze dumb, play the game son""
As a juvenile, I always got into shit
Even If I didn't start, I was bound to flip
Gettin to me in the worst way
Shot my little nigga on his birthday
Rest in piece to my nigga Ray
I know the Demon want me next
I see you schemin on me next
But I'm about to flex, Devil you can check

Chorus 3X

[Buckshot]
I'm livin in the world, where nothin is free
Gotta pay the Devil even if I smoke trees
Oh come on now, is it on now?
Smoke my weed and the public put me on foul
When the judge lock me up I see the jury smile
Gigglin, finger wigglin, he gone for a while
Hit a nigga, what? your shoes don't fit a nigga
You just want to get a nigga, I figure
I'mma be the livin proof
Hit them niggas, blow up like koof
Put your smoke inside your face like poof
What now muthafucka? 98 Duck Down nigga
Straight to ya chest like arrow nigga

A lot of niggas are jealous of Buckshot [say what?]
I hear it everyday on my block
I heard you did a album with 2Pac
Yeah muthafucka, thugadon till I drop
And what not, watch the spot get blown
Two heads flown, can't stop me now muthafucka
I'm in the zone
Baby you ready to go home, 'cause I'm ready to bone
The don king of rap sittin on the throne
Juice truck, who's that? that's Buck
Representin N.Y.C., nigga, it got to be
Ben Frank, small but I got tall money in the bank
Strong arm them niggas with shanks
You better thank God, muthafucka, times is hard
Real niggas know shit stink

[Buckshot]
All my jewels cost a arm and a leg
Smoke shit right to the head
Nuff said, I'mma speak this
Loud voice, no choice muthafucka
I'mma break a meter, even if the sound don't come through
I give it to you in a form a liquid you can drink too, think too
Got a mink too, platinum too
Buck is like a tank, and I'mma flat them too
Get that bitch talk, I put a cap in her too
Put the gat inside her mouth and put a gap in her too
What the dilly yo? I'm in it for the women and the profit
I just can't stop it
Don't knock it, I'm addicted to the Freestyle
Just like a drug, Buck the B.D. Thug bust slugs
Nigga what?
You get two to your dove, fuckin wit this nigga
I ain't no joke

Buck's no joke, I'm like smoke
Here I come creepin through the door
Seepin through ya pore, make you do your chores
Buck Buck smoke the spliff, dumb the ash muthafucka
Get ya clean the floor
See I gotta explore the mic, can't ignore the mic
Gotta be on tour with the mic
Rollin up the black from dust to dust
Buck is like a burner, cock back and bust
Four clip, ready for the bullshit
As soon as the target's on sight, nigga pull shit
Don't wait, aim straight, point it at his plate
If he die it's fates, if it don't wait
Nigga's don't know, Buckshot rock don status nigga
I'm a C.E.O. with the mickey flow and yo

I'm just the type to stay original
Fuck biting off the next man, it's pitiful

But peep them fake niggaz by the flocks 
They never bust glocks 
They front first 

Before my niggaz ask you what you want first we bust first 
Too many niggaz thirst 
Streets aim at me 
Bitches throw game at me its a war inside my head but I stay nappy 

And my mind-set said to blow 
'Cause if the streets is watching, Ima let the streets know 
I live by the rule 
The rule-a regulate the street survival 

Live by the street bible 
Guerilla tactics move swiftly through the trees 
Fuckin up the head of my enemies 

We got adeen thugs runnin wit us 
Either run wit us or run into us 
Claimin its beef but its love when we at your door 
Boy you asked for it, you wanted beef well here's waar 

We got my MFC wit us 
Either run wit we or run into us 
Claimin its beef but its love when we at your door 
Boy you asked for it, you want beef well here's waar",War Zone,1999

Chorus
Holding the weight of the world, holding the weight of the world
Weight of the world on my shoulders (rock, rock, rock, rock)

[Verse 1 Buckshot]
Yeah, I know you can relate to this shit right here, 
feelin like you got a lot of weight
Sometimes you want to bomb never hesitate, bomb first, 
hold ya head up yo, get up yo

Got all these stressed out niggas with firearms
Prepare, get ready they about to bomb
First one hit usually an innocent civilian
Shot by the elevator dead up in the building
I'm illin' of the chill I got
Through my spine last night when I heard the shot
Took flight, 'cause I know that the Gods is right
Telling me you gonna make it when there's hard in life
And the stripes that you gain through the streets is pain
No matter how many motherfuckers is slain
Hold your head son, maintain
Fuck getting the tumour in your brain
Mutherfuck the rumour that you on came(?)
Simple and plain, like piece of the pie
It's the hustle to get yours, Nigga I can't lie
I'm addicted to the high life, the wild life
Make the stress go by easy, when the bomb right

Chorus

[Verse 2  5 ft]
The weight of the world is on my shoulder
But, everyday I wake I find myself I'm getting bolder
As I annihilate, plus dominate
Thinking of ways to rise up, like a republican prominent
In the bomb state of thinking
Sometimes, life is like quicksand, if not watching your step
You end up sinkin
So pay close attention, don't be blinkin'
'cause you might miss the entire point of the words that we speakin'

Chorus x 1
Holding the weight of the world (bomb first)
Holdin the weight on my shoulder (booya!)

[Verse 3 Buckshot]
The weight o' the world's on my shoulder
I'm never gettin younger, only gettin older
As I, walk the streets with stress
Hold my head, 'cause the more I finesse
Tap the plate on my bullet proof vest, YES!
I'm strapped in tight,
'cause I feel like some shit gonna happen tonight
I been eyein' a lot of niggas, closin' up
Eye on my jewellery, they frozen up (rock rock rock rock)
want to stick me why? How come?
Jealous 'cause my shit is sophis, I don't fuck wit' none of them
Commercial rap get the Originno gunn clapp
Believe me, stress on my brain, roll a sack of that
Shit that'd make the devil dissolve
Holdin the world spinning on my shoulders wit' no prob

Chorus

[Verse 4   5 ft]
5 o' cock on the dot.
I, I'm up performing callisthenics
While the muslims are making salot (?)
And the Devil plots
The pressures of life got me rock
Plus my ambitions fired up, I just can't stop
Been singing broke too long, time for a new song
Rest in peace to 2strong(?), 'cause reddaman is still new born
The world's been warned
You get tooken out like a pawn in this game
Or get caught flashin' and flossin' at fame
But, trials and tribulations force me, to claim what's mine
Plus blow mine, (mine!) meaning!
What I work and struggle hard for
To the end of my existence, yes I'll die for
The rules and regulations, all God's laws
Laying it down, under the ground
Until the surface hardcore
Pushin' to become a rich man once poor
Tell you to your face, you ain't ready for the war

I've been back
So now I'm on the map
And all I want is my bread, send that

Rolling my tank
Roll a dank
Don't go to play

Chicks love how I grip niggaz zip grab my dick and spit right

Everyday hustlers
Professional boofin
Slide your dame like greets in the vacant lot
Bust two shots make it hot
Chicks get naked a lot
You love that
When they take it a lot
You love that
Get the buzz back
I pray that you never get in my way
My guns slay motherfuckers when you get in my way
I'm Billy the kid
Shit, I really the kid
Shoot you in front of your kids
And been slid to the next state
Me and Beatminers on the way up
Quick to slay up the next tape
Fix your face
Don't miss the date

Running through

How we kick down your door and your jaw hit the floor too
Back up a little bit
Give me some room

Black Moon,"Dear Lord, can you hear me?
Do I want them to respect or fear me?
Nightmares got me sleepin' with the little shotty
Though I know I can't put the barrel to everybody

Pray for me now, what makes a soldier?
I know it's no breaths 'til beef is over
Keep your guns warm, my heart goes out to you Seth
And my cousin baby just died from crib death

Stay with me, just hit me on the celly cell
I know sufferin' and pain really well
If it don't kill you, it makes you strong
I think of the song, ""What's going on""
When it's going wrong

When I act like it's love and I know it ain't
If it was up to you, y'all niggaz would be throwin' paint
On my outfit, like he ain't about shit
Before you talk about shit, take your mitts of my mini fountain

See I had geeks and all y'all really had was feet
And you ain't never had a beef, so why you had to speak
Fasten your seat and I'ma take ya on a mission, nigga
I teach my own how to keep my own, listen nigga

Get the check, pay ya dues or pay ya respect
Or pay attention, 'cause I already paid the rest
To just focus on the God, as the God speak
Never waste a line like I'm sniffin' on the hard street

And as far as we go, you know how the squad see it
If it's love, it's love, if it's not, so be it

I put my love for boxing, into everything
I know the ropes, how to read the scale and work the ring
I'm military in the mind, hood in the streets
Good nigga in the hearts, nothing 'bout me weak

I open shop, rent the blocks and call the shots
You get popped, get knocked, co-operate with cops
I get live, survive at one sixty five
You nothin' like the God, I'm out raw 'til I die

Smile for me, kiss ya little child for me
I know the story, going to bed, feeling hungry
Wakin' up dirty, all eyes on me
Blinded thug angel 'til my God call me

I brought you up, from the ground up
Now you wanna run and say my sound suck
Tellin' niggaz Duck Down butt
But ain't no buts when I come around

All you hear is the crowd yell ""Buck""
Get it right or get it wrong
What's my name? Buckshot, What ya name?
Not in this song, heh, sorry no props today
Hard on the stretch, fiends won no rocks today

Shame, could of been in the game, but now what
You shine for an hour, nobody dug ya style, butt
The niggaz that be [unverified] you up
Hopin' you hand them a piece of the cut

Jesus, it sucks, your reason is what?
You don't got one, big deal, you got guns
I got guns, be for real, we can get it on right now

Cause I'm too nice to do bids or ever hit skid
Fronts in the bottom of my teeth like whatever shit
On the real, gettin played, what, I never did
Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real niggas
The field niggas get the muthafuckin ill triggers
Word to Herb, lick shot with my verb
And keep my hand on my grip when I play the curb
I never got caught by a undercover DT
( ? ) can't see me
You grab mics from the ones I left broken
Kid, don't front, you know I got you open

[ VERSE 3: Buckshot Shorty ]
Late at night I catch a buzz, then I write
The type of ill shit to make the mind feel tight
And be wantin to battle like every five minutes
But I'm in this like Guinness so that ass get finished
Straight from the floors of hell, feel the flame
You faggot ass, I heard your nickname's Blaine
I hit your brain and you felt the pain, maintain
When it comes to a battle you know the Buck reigns
I vocal-throw the flow, niggas be like, ""Yo, how'd you do that?""
Bitches be like ""Yo who that, you're all that, yo, true that""
Never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
I used to make money, now I just take it
I do what I gotta do to bring you to the concrete
Buckin niggas down cause they think shit is sweet
I keep a Tec whenever I'm in the projects
Ease out, then flex, in effect like Wreckx
Buck to your head, now die is my slogan
Don't front, you know I got you open",I Gotcha Opin,2005
Black Moon,"Verse 1
Buckshot:

I woke up in the night
grabbed my forehead
wipe my forehead with the sweat on to the bed
Deep inside thought
thinking of a way to strapped
and walk the streets without getting clapped
Just because I'm tieing the fuzz growing in my buzz
I'm doing my justice, bust this slug to the ignorant
Who said I didn't have knowledge of self
So come and feel the wrath
So listen
First of all let me explain
That when i drop a rhyme I I make it hard enough to gain
The god is heavy
I blow you up like dynamite
Into my dome I let the L ignite
Fight, I take you on flight here
The war starts here.

BCC:
See we murder MC's every day,
motherfuckers don't play,
straight from the Bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, That's when all the madness stops

Verse 2
Buckshot:
To all the Godz who know who's the coloured man
the colored man is the obvious, you understand?
I kill him, and drill 'I'm in my bootcamp
Who can't survive in the creek?
You can't
Champion, bootcampian click
stick and move
I bust your shit
Move and stick
It's the original crook
Stomping through your army, what!
Gortex to your head
Keep your eyes shut
But, I'll take you in consideration
My occupation is to bust your federation
with my ammunition
Flipping precision, being precise
He's right, I'm nice
You can check my status and my apparatus
See the baddest Buckshot shot the boodah
Murder hero to clean your pipe like Ruger
Smoke a bag of charm then I drop the bomb,
Buckshot I represent the Arm Leg Leg Arm
Head, natty dread, boy big him up
Roll thick like syrup
cause chaos and terror

Chorus

I had a vision
It appeared to me in the form of a devil
but the rebel wasn't there to see
for me this is the year to be
the son of the seven, representing the sea
the heatseeker
the cypher maker
quick to take a
sec to re-a-lize, I burn right through you
Double gauge
I'm pointing the rage at your culu
....
We blew the motherfucker
Now we outta here.

Lock you away

To make records with a mobile

Were at the best place around

They burned down the gambling house

Pulling kids out the ground

But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Black Oak Arkansas,"I've walked through the Halls of Karma
I shook hands with both the Devil and God
They turned my eyes to the inside to see
Where my energies have gone
Yes I've run with both all through my life
I've respected and reflected them both
Yes the sympathy of God as he looked at my life
The excitement of the Devil as we talked.

So Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy on my soul.

The Devil said, ""Scratch my back and I'll scratch your back for sure""
So you have done all these sins for him
My heart could not be pure
I found out what means more to me
Than anything on this earth
To be ready for the judgment day
Ready to face the truth.

So Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy n my soul.

I hope I've done th right things
For both your sake and mine
I preach in what I live for
My only fear is fear of time
I wanted to look logical
To both my ""Maker"" and his host
But this trip of life must be complete
Or my cards will be lost.

Black Oak Arkansas,"If you believe, I mean really believe
Follow me and find your way back through
Time
From the power I possess I can see through
The maze
I can see man's progress cause earth's
Dyin days
But if we go back to nature and live in 
The wilderness
Just another animal pure, earth'id live
Longer and we'd live less

Why do we need to live to be so old
When we could live free to die young and
Bold
Man is an animal gone mad
Yes he's turned into a monster
Our generation is his offspring
Yes mutants of the monster

My power is magic
From a wish on a star
Yea earning the wish is karmic
To help what good spirits there still are

But when you've been granted the
Privilege of bein heard
Yea take great care with this power and
Watch every word
For when you know someone's listenin
Your words can mean a great deal yea
They can be the key to magic thoughts
Havin never been revealed

Why do we need to live to be so old
When we could live free to die young and
Bold

Yes he's turned into a monster
Our generation is his offspring

Yes he sore he could
And he dared him to come to

To rest his weary gamblin' head

He heard his words
And up he stood
Even tho it hurt he knew he should

Outside he heard the rattle of chains
And he ran from someone

Black Papa,"Der Asphaltboden zitterte es wummerte im Ohr
Als ich an einen dicken Beat mein junges Herz verlor
Seit damals gefällt mir die Stadt besser als zuvor
Wenn ich durch Berlin-City cruise is Reggae mein Motor

Ich singe auf dem Fahrrad, mal Bass und mal Tenor
Zuhause dreh ich Sound auf, die Nachbarn ham Humor
Die stehn auf frische Downbeats aus meinem Recordstore
Concrete Jungle, Supersonic - Soundsystemkultur

Wenn Party is, dann sind wir on the dance floor
Der Deejay macht den Vers und die Jarvis den Chor
Du versinkst im Bass wie´ne Moorleiche im Moor
Es zwingt dich in die Knie, denn der Riddim is Hardcore

Wir shaken, was wir haben bis morgens 7 Uhr
Woanders gibt´s 'ne Sperrstunde, bei uns die Müllabfuhr
Dann baun wir´n dickes Rohr, kommt dann schon mal vor
Und blasen dicken Smoke durchs Brandenburger Tor

Die Berliner Luft im Vergleich zu anderen Städten
Bietet leckersten Geschmack, allerbeste Qualitäten
Um Paraden zu feiern und exklusive Feten
Die Massen sind jetzt da, es hat sie niemand drum gebeten!

Früher ging's in Berlin nur um Panzer und Raketen
Heute lebe ich im Osten zwischen Blümchentapeten
Kümmer mich nicht allzu sehr um Taler und Moneten
Baue hier und da´n Track, aber dafür´n konkreten!

Coolness-mäßig platzt die Stadt aus allen Nähten
Aber wo sind jetzt die Typen, die auch ernsthaft antreten
Um ihr Potential, ihre Styles heiß zu kneten
Zuviel Kraft in der Lunge für zu wenige Trompeten

Make we take a check up pan the crew dem way promote it
Cause a reggae well it come fe run the city

Coming from near me say you coming from far
Every tuesday night you now say dat a tanzbar
Everybody go dey want fe look like a star
Every wensday night you can go check out subground

Took some shots with Miley
Bought a boat and took it all and that's why you feelin smiley

Deny me
Individuality of my peers
Control me
Until I'm lost in the years
Guide me
Right into my deepest fears
I don't wanna think, I wanna dance and party
I want deep bass so you can hear me hardly
I wanna get drunk, high, thizzled, zoned, gnarly
Stuck, fucked up, heaping up wheat and barley
Scar me
Direct me to your ego bubble
Harm me
Tell me that I cause no trouble
Make me give ya

Bite your style and say that it's original
Rap about money, we live in poverty
But who cares, lets throw out all the honesty

Black Riot,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on",A Day in the Life,1993
Black Rob,"I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had twenty four hours to live, what would you do?  
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it?
Mase, what would you do?

Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my Beretta, too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request

Yo, yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket
Then go get a jar from Branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldy, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gon' play lotto, for what?
Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow, so what

You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bare spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one a them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Fours, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, git them cats I wanted to git
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in eighty-six
Went home took a shower in nice cold water
And spent my last hours wit my son and my daughter

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

What hey yo, if I had twenty four nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papi's spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty an he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a bookbag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller wit the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to twenty three, I'm a be strapped wit TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges wit me

If I had twenty four hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles' on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the twenty four I make it out the precinct
Shootin niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds

Twenty four left until my death
So I'm gon' waste alot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but I'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

Did it with the Glocks, spit it witcha pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher, mad you can't be like us

Recruited these snipers, alumni do it just like us

Shredders in a riot pump leave you quadriplegic
When I squeeze don't breathe keep it lined and even
So when niggas get hit, they be cryin' screamin'
Lyin' bleedin', from that iron steamin'

And we can't lose 'cause Puff set us up properly
Just won't settle for lesser, who wanna test us
We be in the 5 with the goose headrests
LOX put niggas under pressure
You shoulda knew that, it's always them new cats that'll get ya
Better start looking at things from my angle
I'm trying to be up on the board with a triangle
Next to my name with a ten or a twenty
Now that's when you really can say you getting money
But right now all I do is sit back and listen
To a wise young man that quickly became a rich one
Put me up on the fact that it ain't hard to get some
Chips if I just keep writing with ambition
Then I get an advance from the five to the six and
House with two kitchens, diamonds, plenty women
Built-in pool to swim in
But the plan is to start from the floor and raise it up
Then you hit em in the head 'til your days is up
You blazing what, playboy you frail and butt
You know when Bad Boy drops, all your sales is cut

22 feeling like I've wasted every hour
Of my life, shoulda been had a million in ice
High as a kite, feeling the flight, turbulence
Once in a blue moon I had a dream of fly shit
Hanglide to the Alps with this fly chick
Condo in Fresno with the lesbo
And the honey that she hit know how to stretch blow
They know that I'm Styles they respect the flow
Why don't y'all let a nigga live and help him make a decimal
Truth will set you free what will a lie do
Niggas say I'm God but I be gettin' high too
Can't love the money like the niggas beside you
Cause when the paper gone, you gon' slide too
Niggas wanna ball, but got to fall to rise
While the world spins around they wanna stall they eyes
Close they ears my nose makes me oppose my fear
'Cause I can smell hell
Before I sell rat I'll catch a shell farewell

Their man that I was pussy

To let my whole team be straight, mansion no Section 8
Putting pressure so that I can make this bed
Got two mattresses now all I need is the spread
With like four pillows so my seeds can rest their heads
You think platinum is enough, nah Sheek want more
Trying to sell more than Tickle me Elmo in the store
Italian cuisine, Linguin while my diamonds like-shing
So when I move at night-time you might think it's light-ning
Just throw me the ball once and I'll tell you no lie
Shiek gonna show you money, like Jerry McGuire
It's a thug thing, LOX product thing, conducting
Anything for chips while you sit and blab your lips
In the restaurant taking tips while Sheek on trips
Logos on our ships bustin' at the eclipse
While I'm pissy, spittin' up Crissy in the water
But you can do that for money, when 100's like a quarter

Don't mean I'm gonna stop climbin, 9-9, it's good timin

Seein' honey at the club e'ry week and I speak
I'ma rock that ass to sleep before I strike
I ain't know the real deal until last night
How, one of them brothers was locked with bankroll
Used to call my crib to see seventy-four
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the jack
Babe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black
When you get home', we never had chance to get up
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin' honey
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money
Funny how it's a small world, baby girl
You's about to get, fucked with no jail
I'ma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin'
And plan your extermination, word

I love you baby
No you don't
You drive me crazy      
That's right
I'll never betray thee      
Uh
I love you baby         
C'mon

I love you baby
No you don't
You drive me crazy 
That's right
I'll never betray thee      
Uh
I love you baby         

It took a while to peep your style, Miss I-be-in-workin'
Low profile single, house in Staten Island
And Manhattan while, them same cats
You sent to get me boo, is on they way to get you
Fuckin' witchu, that small time crack dealin' nigga
He a bitch too, they gon' bust his shit too
Shit's real, you think you gonna set me up
And get away Scot free without some type of injury
Nah kill it, I'ma flip the script on you
Same thing you did to me, I'ma do it to you
Who knew she was the female Rambo
Fill one of they chests with four soon as he came in the door
Life is out, snuffed all they mans in
In the end, she had to be the last bitch standin'
Not for long the buck the forty-four strong
Just like that she was gone, now it's over
Assumin' I'll go back to my everyday life
Of a rich millionaire just rockin' the mic
Gotta pause, and think about honey, no doubt
And admire how the chick went out, yeah

I love you baby
No you don't
You drive me crazy      
That's right
I'll never betray thee      
Uh
I love you baby         
C'mon

I love you baby
No you don't
You drive me crazy

Yo, aiyyo, yo, yo
It's kill or be killed
My skills leavin' them chilled on ice 
Like twice when I flash my steel
They can't touch
Won't touch 
Never touch
Driving around with the toasty whip; never bust
Puffin' dust like fiends
I mean I want green; ya shifty
Cop the big eight fifty with the gleam
My team full of cut throats with enough notes to write a f***in' book
Take a good f***ing look at these bad guys
Stay mad fly, mad high 
In the Ford Expidie, and I don't expect to die 
On some humble s***
I am on some rumble s***
When it's on, you should see the s*** I come through with
If you scared, by dog, release the four by fours 
I heard the fagot-a** Don died, and he s*** in his drawers
On the streets, black; good like Allstate 
Y'all fake
Just got paid, but f*** it, I want some more cake
Ya faith in my hand
Now ya nervous, man, and drive my brains quick fast at ya service 
My brother Curtis squeeze gats to celliums 
I make it where you can't escape the para bedlams 
I tell some live ya life like Puff did
I did enough biz; ask any body

When I shake, they feel earthquakes in eight states
Oh, trait, off the Richter
Drunk off the liquor
Shot towards you, mister
Off course, it hit you hard
It gets hard
I pick the card
Any card, any problem I'm a hit your squad
Eyes on the shaper when I twisted God
You think you got it all together
Get it ripped apart
Man, you can't stand the heat
Stay up outta the street
N**** turn po-lice 'cause they shot up his jeep
I subtract like mad
Don't make me bad
So I want it all; f*** had
Don't make me laugh
By all means
Get this money; it's all green
It's all good
And I wished that y'all would
Man, f*** that, security told ya to tuck that
Now up that, now that you see where 'lux at
I got the game by the balls
And I get all calls
So if you play to much, I put the s*** on pause

When night falls - that's when it all begins
Be prepared; we can allow no loose ends
I highly recommend y'all bring your arms
This is no false alarm
They want to do us harm like I'm nervous
Live inside a glass house
They want to bring us down
Then drag us out
It's all about niggas that doubt our reputation
Start'n conflict and don't know what they facing
Want twist us all in their black magic
Suggest paper of wars and break havoc
Are you ready?  Don't sleep on them
Ain't petty, you get that ass thrown like confetti
Meet me at the getaway spot in a jiffy
Leave all the does behind that act iffy
We got maneuvers that's hard to beat
Till the other side retreats
Under six feet beneath

I told you that is a saw I wore
I'm a kill 
When the rebel yells song that don't stop till it's done
See, I got guns, and I'm sick
See how you said meet me here, and I came quick?
Them same cats on the most wanted list
We can hit them, then straight disappear in the mist
...Won't cease to exist
I shoot to kill, and I'll be damned if I miss
A warrior waiting for Armageddon
I get serious as hell when I'm threatened
Intent to get hostile; break into a rage of fury
Send them back their apostle's fossils and crazed right
A rude awakening, and, but now I'm alert
And that's right down my line of work

Gutless cowards with no back
And watch how they all fall flat

I want y'all dues
Shit hit the fan
We going to be eatin' your food
Time up in the new, then torture
I rip a niggas toe nails off
What, I didn't hear the news? 
Five slayin' the law
Man, how I don't want do these cats
I lay mousetraps for those mice-house niggas that house gats
They want to out me
I know killers from down south, B
Who know and understand there ain't a thing sweet about me
I earn my respect, and I was born to wreck
Spit techs by your rockets threw jets
Who's next to get hit by firepower that's so raw?
Go play; 4-4's ready for war

Black Rob,"(Verse One)

Yo had me in the LQ
Yo shit was mad bumpin 
Rappers on the mic was like settin off somethin
Now parties like this yo god 
I like lougin observin everything inside my surrounding
Jasmine dancin wit this non-descrip sucka
Okay cool as long as the sucka don't touch her 
Nigga
Get the urge and can't control his hand
Get a body bag cause ""mauh"" he's a dead man
She was coolin sportin my table 
When the dance was done she like walked back to money's table
I sat there like shit I can't believe this
I wish you was there big fella so you could see this bitch
Sittin there boo legs wide open laughin gigglin smilin and jokin wit homes
Like they use to hang out real real tough
He musta had a strong rap cause Jasmine looked gased up
Sittin there played the role of a slouch
Just watchin to see how Jasmine played herself out
They sat there just talkin to each other 
I thought this kid was alone he had five more brothas wit him
Wit out girl's night ain't this some shit 
If she don't recognize the game they can kiss this shit
They introduced theyselves one at a time
Saw 'em say how you doin so Jasmine say ""fine""
I was laughin but there was more in store
I saw her get up and start walkin towards the front door
I rolls too god and walked right behind em
So where ever they go it won't be hard to find em
I keep a guard you now I thought I better
Plus I keep the stash deep inside the 8 pound leather
Open doors vale was on the ready 
At the end Jasmine is gonna wish she never met me
We're off two cars speedin deep in the night
I'm doin 30 on the straight away 60 on the turnpike
For Jasmine

(Chorus)
Know that i've got Jasmine on my mind
Ohhhhh
Playa freeze while I pull out my nine
Know that i've got Jasmine on my mind
Ohhhhh

(Verse Two)

Word up ain't nothin changed but the weather
Still chasin them suckas in the '86 Jetta
Thinkin different thoughts still not understandin 
How 7 people got in that fuckin Volkswagen
Enough of that god yo back to the chase
Yo man you should've seen the ruckus look on my face
Slowin down cruisin on the cool out mode
Then parked in front of his house on Gunhill road
Man I started to get out
Grabbed the rope and try to hang her
Before I let this posse drop shots gang bang her
They went inside man but I kept goin
Parked across the street wit out them even knowin
Got out the car still schemin the house
Tip toed around the back quiet like a church mouse
If the neighbors looked out the window 
They would surely get leerly and scream like ""BAHANDO""
Police they would hold my fate
But they didn't so I creeped up the fire escape
I saw shadow's inside a bright lit room
Which appear to be two bodies dancin to a slow song nigga
I got closer decided I should check it
I saw Jasmine and one of them kids dancin buck naked
So I got the gat so I have no interference 
When I make my grand appearance
For Jasmine

(Chorus)


(Verse Three)

I seen a red dot tryna lock on me
I can't believe these niggas tryna pull a pac on me
I admit they had the drop on me 
Probably turned the burner around 20 degrees 
So I could see 
Who bust me 
Who knocked me out 
Who tried to choak 
Who tied the rope
Who left  me this bitch ass note
I'm disgusted the murder she wrote
Money she oaked all of my coke all of dope
Up in smoke
Made you follow me probably so mad you want to hollow me
But you won't be so lucky today so swallow me
Got your GS4 and your Bently rose took all of your clothes
And 99 bottles of Mo's 
What she didn't know is about the dynamite in the rose
And if I get close I'll blow her cause I got the controls
At the toll on the phone wit this bitch Nicole
Said she left you in some  hotel out in the road
Room 112 penthouse sweet alumni
On the 12th floor in front of her door was one guy
On some Brandon Lee shit he wasn't handin me shit
Understand me he flipped bust the 9 and he split
Had my heat cocked busted right through the sheet rock
How'd he drop he ain't the nigga I just shot
Whas goin on all of a sudden it was nothin no jokin son 
Jasmine holdin the smokin gun
By the time I realized I caught two in the chest had the vest
As I fell I'm not thinkin of death
Still fallin to a place wit more conscience though
Long enough to see her aim and put one in her throat
So I got up all shot up grabbed the Prada
Faggots probably towed my truck
You know how my luck 
Hoped in bleedin to death turned left 
Thought of Jasmine and how she went out to the death
For Jasmine

Never had a dime 
My life a crime 
Had be when I was nine 
Mom drunk off of wine 
Ran with all kind her mind stayed wit the stooper 
Till a point she paid no mind to the supper 
Stay mad but stay fronting with smiles 
Stayed on the groung once and a while 
First day of school 
Never had nutin to style 
Mister colondre stressin I ain't comin in a while 
It was a bummber 
Rocking the shit I rocked all summer 
On the first day I was feeling some kind of way 
And she wasn't trying to do nutin 
You would think for the sake of the kids she would enroll in school or 
Something 
Now I kno then was even harder 
Especially for a single mother 
Raising me with no father 
Shit living up in this tentament 
Eating stale m and m's 
Talking wild shit to spanish imigrants 
I speak in codes 
Man to sivrence 
Always quiet then ben dichon to my madre 
Even thought she did nutin for me 
Acknowledge me as I run down my life story 

You don't know how crazy it is outside 
I die inside 
Oh I've cried oh I've cried 
Do you forgive me?? do you forgive me?? 

Check the skit 
No body never gave me shit 
If anything a nigga frame me and make me get 
3 to 6 my first bid 
No doubt up in sparfard 
Had to be 12 son had to make a profit 
Remembering robbed my moms wit no guilt 
Eating pork and beans or corn flakes wit no milk 
In school I smacked cats in a hurry 
Moms didn't care she was getting drunk wit misses berray 
On the first floor 
I used to thrist for greenary 
Picking pockets wit seth and jay from hundred and sixth street 
Yo fuck home 
I'm tired of geting punched in my dome 
Tired of this faggot ass nigga moan 
That's when I started roaming 
My hustling game is deep 
Cats ya heard 
Ran from san fran to manhat tan to newburg 
Notorious tell ya friends spread the word 
Glorious my life story is obsurd 



Chorus repeat 2x 



Home from elmira 

Got a little writer 

I'm gonna keep it real still a scheme man coniver 

Recognize the struggle live it like a thug do 

Hatred in my heart but inside I love you 

See no matter what I will extend my arms to hug you 

Knowing I am just like you, I am like the double 

All I want to kno is how you pound me down 

Yo this shit is real and you really jerked me around 

But any way I am geting paid wit puff now 

I can cop you a house I can send you some stuff now 

So many levels jail take you 

I appreciate jail because it made me appreciate you 

I've been through fire and birth stone 

Used to be ???? not I cop the gem stone 

I remembered when you rushed me 

The time you said you should of flushed me 

I forgive you ma trust me

This ain't the time, baby boy, this is about to blow up
Syncronize ya Rol' up, we got one minute to rock it
Murder's a hard job, but somebodies gotta stop it

Aiyyo, I seen how them niggas be lookin' at us
Actin? like they wanna do som'thin? to us
Cee-Lo, Black Rob just can't be touched
I'll negotiate the matter, in gats he trust
In the club one night, war spittin? at us
In the corner sippin? drinks on some real hush hush
Yeah, I seen how them niggas be lookin' at us
Aiyyo, I seen how them niggas be lookin' at us

Just off the plane on a New York vacation 'ang
Come on, let's get gone, nigga it?s on a gang
Swervin? in the rain and workin? the woodgrain
We did about two [unverified]
Now feel the pain

And if its affectin? you, it involves me in it
And it?s all great 'cause I get on a niggas ass in a minute
We've established innocence, this Benz ain't rigged
Its easy, accelerate and make those twenties rotate
Even the corner cowboy [unverified] hennesy straight

Satisfaction, in the midst of all the interaction
I sense tension here
And some nigga over there's givin? us his undivided attention
Aiyyo Rob, yo, is that this nigga
(Who?)
Is that this nigga that been 'round here fuckin' with choo?
Want you want me to do?
Who you want me to run over, and run through?

With my gun drew, and unleash my wrath upon you
We can battle, but nigga, but pay for the bad news is true
This nigga done did somethin? that he can't undo
And anybody who came here with him deserves one too
Is it true fuckin? up my good clothes on you, scandalous hoes

I suppose these bullet holes make ya widow
Keep the casket closed
How you kids gonna get gay back to you, that's how it goes
Cee-Lo, Black Rob, Goodie Mob, Bad Boy, down south
Up top it gon' stop

[Black Rob]
Yo, who these cats think they is takin' they biz that's round here? 
Yo, dog, don't even go there
This is ours; we built this from the ground on up
Now it's flowers; I think you best a round on up
Your entourage - slim chance of y'all gettin' large
It's non-cipher; that's because B.R.'s in charge
It's set here; cats is known for gettin' wet here
And left here, till the cops come pick us up

[Mark Curry]
Step in a territory that's corrupt, pushin' your luck
Intrudin' wishes is already sowed up; n**** fold up
You and your crew and peoples will get slain
This ain't the place to try and gain fame from
You gets burnt in the streets a n**** worked hard to make
And I'll be damned if I let another brother take it
Alive for his own sake; they better vacate
Promptly, 'fore they get they a** stomped
Listen, take heed to what we sayin', n****s

[Chorus]
We won't lie; sometimes we stick 'em up
Last time, it was enough, though word life some hos did 'em up
And nine glocks set 'em up
I know it was your dough 'cause I was right there when they split it up
I could tell you where to find the corpse
But that cheddar - I'm afraid, dog, that's gone forever

[Mark Curry]
Greed for wealth got us stingy
We got a spot that's hot
N****s envy the fact that we clock mad dough
They want to see us shut down, but, no
I don't think so; the crew is still rakin' the cash flow
For every dime bag sold on this block, we want in
One slug behind the back; it's under the skin
When n****s try to step to the block and Bogard
We can't see it happenin'
Warn them first; get the f*** out of dodge
Better believe that; test it
See if we won't put you on your back, n****s

[Chorus]

Now bein' that it's all out war
I'm bringin' more than that four-by-four
Watch me dispose of all y'all
Y'all fraud a** n****s
Tape me reboard a** n****s
Gun bigger than sword a** n****s
Now enter in the ring, gun drawn, makin' moves like pawns
Two at a time, comin' for mine
Like a song, n****, CBS, he can't be serious finesse
He don't believe I keep a gun in the vest

[Mark Curry]
You think you can disgrace this empire we built from scratch?
You stupid; I wouldn't care how ruthless your crew is
We got defense on this area; try to attack
Mad n****s on the barriers that's dyin' of blast back
There be no givin' and no takin', definitely no breakin'
Laws we lay down; here's the situation
Severe torture is what those who don't feel us face
I show no love for a punk-a** n**** we hate
Try to pay me no bribe, then come up missin'
Happens to hard-headed n****s when they don't listen
I gave you fair warnin' 'bout the danger you're messin' with
A stranger invadin' the street corners are goners
Try me, if you think it's a lie, the attitude many n****s had
But in the process many die
Thinkin' they can step to the block and Bogard
And couldn't see it happenin'
Warned 'em first: get the f*** outta dodge

I figure I'm the best thing since ham and grits
That s*** flip it; it's off the hook; it's unlisted
The wizard like Juwan Howard
I drop the bomb when you want test the Don power
It's on dude; I warned you before the wildin'
My team: some sick cats, fresh from Ward's Island
I'm sayin' I try to tell 'em how I do due to the fact you
Was duckin' my debut, duckin' the Ginsu
B.R., natural born threat
He got his tech, and I ain't even put it on yet
Just imagine me and you toe to toe, back of the paddy wagon
To the death till one of us got no breath left
Protect that neck

[Chorus]

[Black Rob]
I roll with soldiers, quick to run pa** and snuff you
Regulate the streets of BK with bra** knuckles
At last stuck you and your so called team
Them so called men; cats sound like Ben Vareen
Caught me diggin' in the scene, one fifteen, Lex minivan light green
Watching my cream, stopping my cream
S***'s been tried before; my s***'s stress with no lactose at all
I mean I'm just limpin', 'cause right now I see the profit
Show me some grams; I chop it
Show me some land; I cop it
Show me some ho somewhere in the tropics
And I'm a suck the p**** till she beg me to stop it
That's real; I'm a tell you how the black man feel
Pack toast but still catch him with the backhand steel
Pimp status, while you run around with shrimp status
Got a gat and decided to clap at least twenty right at us
We ain't mad though; we got the bulletproof dough
And that's the way my n****s roll
If you was seein' his dough, you'd be the same baby

Yo, when I walk up in the place, all eyes is on me
Is it me or the hundred grand worth of icy?
Can't underestimate me; I beg your pardon
If y'all ain't had guns, I probably wouldn't have brought my squadron
But unfortunately it's that war outside
And I still roll with bulletproof doors on my ride
They call me PD, holy like Koran
Rockin' Sean John, poppin' Sean Don
F***ing ghetto Don Juan
Top of the world - watch me snatch your hood treasure
Might have to check a few cats for good measure
Playboy, you know the drilly
Y'all cats is real silly
What I gotta do sell another ten milly?
It's crazy how they all fall down; all balls down
It's hectic so I send Black to come and check it
Ain't s*** changed; same s*** stains in the business
Approach me; play me closely; hopin' hopefully (keep hopin')
Before I slip I let you know that I'm on to ya
Your hands'll never touch my Bad Boy formula
And this year, I'm gonna hit 'em severe

Keep thinkin' that you hard; take a look around
I got soldiers stationed up to bring pain
And when it go down, my hos do the same thing
We all in the same game; we all willin' to bang
Ain't nobody going against the grain, so take aim

You rather bet 'cha life than face me
I mean, I got this rap game locked with more cake than Tastee

And this type s*** you should distinguish
And one phone call, and I'll extinquish
I mean this; you seen this

I'm a destroy my next challenger

Quick to spray Raid on the roach emcee
So don't be apporachin' me without the cross and rosary

Some crystal, sixty thousand, and ten dimes of 'dro

Too late now
Guess I'll finish what I started, baby

Long as you know my pants don't fit chu
Money good look; understand why he shook
S***, I'm rich; face all up in the Guinness Book
Check all the records I set; it's major
Check that the sets I wreck with flavor
F*** that Cajun; guns stay bond c***
Boiling hot; hold s*** down like Fort Knox
Man, knock the rhyme unorthodox
What'cha barely understand, s***, I did with the L.O.X.
Give me the props; I'm tryin' set a mark this year
And bring the equipment out to the parks this year
So y'all could see how it used to be
I'm lookin' towards the future, see
Black here to stay
It's time y'all got used to me

Up and down the coast; can't count the spots I've been in
Put'cha bid in

Hot beats and hot rhymes tossed in a blenda'

Uh-uh, y'all must be stupid
If I owe Sean Combs any money, then I recouped it
I looped it; this fly s*** from Nebodaga
Me, and Yogi, and Hard Pierre from You don't Know Me
I dare you to come against me, run against me
Use your gun against me
You finito, finished
I've seen wild cats diminished, foldin' for
Bad Boy's known to ball

I have to be the next cat to go and sell a million records casually
So, prepare yourself for the storm

Black Rob,"Heeeeeeerrrreeee we go... 
Once upon a time not long ago 
when I was outta town movin work with Zo 
I used to bring my nigga B.R. 
and niggas with the burna's holdin' down B-R 
There lived a jealous kid that was mislead 
by anotha jealous kid who wanted me dead 
(He said) Me and you are gonna push this rock 
Once we kill Rob we takin over the block 
They did the job, but didnt suceed 
When I got up off the ground niggas couldnt believe 
They started bustin and'a bustin filled my ribs like crusting 
had the vest on so it didnt mean nothin 
One kid grabbed a tech and started sprayin erratic 
But he fell, two slugs from my semi-automatic 
Ran two blocks there was cops all over 
Then I dipped into the building ??? 
Banged on the door of apartment 83 
Some lady start screamin like she was afraid of me 
Ran to the roof like ""Fuck that sista"" 
Ask an old man ""Can you help me mista?"" 
Got to the roof clutchin my four-four 
open up the door, yo guess who I saw (Who?) 
Black and Deaf now, ain't this proper 
Guns drawn full of tef toward the helicopter 
Escaped alive but my ribs was shattered 
Body all battered, and clothes all tattered 
Deep in my heart I wanted revenge 
but I let the shit slide til I saw 'em again 
Pulled out my guns and released a clip (And) 
Thats the way I gotta end this shit 
He was only one fiend, tryin to live a thugs dream 
Slugs to the chest, shoulda heard him scream 
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
'Cuz anyone of us could catch the blood bath 
Straight an' narrow is how niggas should live...live 

Good night...good night 

Knock 'em out the box Black 

I just woke up in pain, my ribs broke up 
Wifey on the side like Justin, shes kept the hope up 
All thats on my mind is revenge revenge 
Justin and a few dogs kicked the door of the hinge 
Go with the drawers on, man its cold as shit 
Had the mag by the table, nigga hold this shit 
He was one stupid nigga tryin roll for 'Delph 
Not knowin that he might get killed himself 
Now wifey being trained by the F.O.I. 
It was horrible, stabbed the otha cat in his eye 
he was screamin tryin grab her actin like he had to have her 
Swept him off his feet but got sliced with the dagger 
Well in these times, well atleast to me 
No true niggas rollin come in sets of three 
And they won't stop rollin til you let them see 
All the permanent scars that the tech nine leaves 
Barely out the crib caught one in the leg 
Couldn't even get my boys had to leave 'em for dead (Damn) 
That's cold, yeah I know, but the cold in the streets 
the one who escaped is the one holdin the heat 
Before I breeze grab coke out the freeze 
By the time y'all hear this I'll be somewhere in Belize 
With some bad asian chick layin between my knees 
While I'm blowin off some trees, pumpin B.I.G.'s 
Greastest hits, this was my latest shit 
Watch how niggas act when they play this shit 
This a lesson, shits for real no dressing 
No ?lip? infestin, crab cats I'm addressin 
Bad Boy, the 44 Mag, fresh off the rack 
All you cowards and nasty ass hoes step the fuck back 
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
'Cuz anyone of us could catch the blood bath 
Straight an' narrow is how niggas should live...live 

Good night...good night

Come here, know one thing nigga

[Verse 1: G-Dep]
I think you need to know I'm holdin it down
Wit a hole in this town
It's a hole in da ground, where I stomp
Got these niggaz steady on the watch
Like it's Teddy on da block
If your ready or your not here I come
Nigga you can run you can hide
You can dip you can slide
You can duck you can ride you can flee
I give a nigga, one test now it's one less
That's how easily you can be eliminated
Program to scan rock jams
Get down from where I stand to Scotland
Dustin like Hothman
If that'll stop what you got planned the shot's ?
Ask your man, ask your girl, ask your crew
I'm hittin high, I'm hittin low what a nigga have to do
You want drama I'm a have to act a fool
Had to laugh at the aftermath now I'm after you and

And I'm a getch ya, getch ya, getch ya, getch ya
One day maybe next week, I'm gonna find ya

Been grabbin niggaz up by they coat ?
Coke rhyme but It's dope as hell
Nigga four tooth the ?
Still had to broke in jail
Wit a parole hold just the systems so cold
Had me thinkin under pressure that this kid won't fold
When the feds came in extremely vocal, ain't stutta
Shoutin out my ? name and my social
Wasn't to hard to find I stay local
If I would of known you was sinkin I would of bin by coastals
See I'm a do what I'm supposed to
Even if I gotta dress up and knock on your door like I'm the postal
Your ass is grass and that's that
Better strap up your vest and that's that
Come through wit ski masks and black ?
With the boomshack with the crack crack fuckin rat nigga

But that ain't the code of a soldier look over your shoulder
Came through low in the rover knowin ya nova

Double your speed, punch through metal fa sure
I got the metal in store, whatch you medallin for
I used to boost pedals ?
NowI'm ? vocal peddal the four let this settle the score
Now check it
Won't have to rest to switch hands and
Six mill-e-on ree-sons you should switch plans

Thinking it would all sink in like quicksand

Go ahead dog, sleeping I'm a steal ya plate
Brought Ray and Made Men out to seal ya fate
More ya ta none, beef, might borrow ya guns
I borrow ya funds, dog we'll spoil your fun
 
Eastside I lay at, I'm like whoa! when ya play that

Won't see me at the Grammy's

Doors flying open, my team start thumping
Leave your boys crawling
Who got your back, call em'
Problems resolve them, there not that important
The last one standing, you the first one leaving
The first one bleeding, now who the one breathing?

Hey , back on the scene
Ain't nuthin' changed
Still doin' wild things
Whippin' something mean
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off
For sure, bouncin' the bar on my next world tour
When we hit the sick, I'm the cure
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor
Ain't nobody botherin' you
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few
Illegal aliens
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans
The top story, evening news
I'm the shit, they been deceiving you
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville
Shoot to kill
Ask niggas, Duke is real
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal
He determined
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'
I want my glory
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs
That's cause my dogs ain't there

The more fame we get, niggas get concerned

Watchin' DVDs on 5O inch screens
So cut it out, you ain't now Don Juan, please
I stay spillin' Dom on my Sean John jeans
I hit the bar, yo, it's all on me
Pop bottles, models, be all on me
You all goin' see how it's all gon' be
Front on me and see where you all gon' be

See this is the part I like right here
I like when I see everybody on the dance floor
Yeah, I see why y'all, just shakin' your asses
See man, hold on, I need to break it down
Yeah
One time like this

Now would you clap your hands
Your hands you clap
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that
But you never see me standing on the corner like that
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting
I rock Sean John everyday
Boutiques from France to the USA
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent
Cause, I'm droppin' hits
Daily
You burn me?
Really?
Think Bad Boy been played a million times
And I don't care if niggas write a billion rhymes
Damn, we still payed!

We still payed!
Yeah, we got it made!

Hey yo, this game ain't stoppin'
We champagne poppin'
Girl, I got shit that your man ain't coppin'
You could hop in when your man ain't watchin'
Give you one option, temperature's droppin'
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him
Your man got a lot to learn
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned
One day you goin' actually learn
But not now cause, girl, I got tracks to burn
I stay on my J-O-be

Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?
What you have is a portion
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and
So you better use caution, knowing I'm the boss and
I'm sitting on pyramids, flossing
I don't really gotta talk son
I can get lost and sit back living off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you acting like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, making my mark on Harlem like Poe did

I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV

You ain't really got a crew son
You giving them amusement, fuck what your Comic Views meant
You's a smoke head
I've been doing this since this Pro-Ked
Broke breads with the cokeheads
Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped

Niggaz get fried like that
And you don't want to die like that
Have your momma crying like that
Besides all that, I'm in to get it frying like that
Still on the block and move pies like that
Never my life dealt with guys that rap
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad
Swoll up, why y'all niggas better hold up
Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up
Body get ripped up, and then sewed up
Every nigga I fucked with, niggas is growed up
We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names
All we do is cock back, and spray planes
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang
Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang

Keep fronting, I'ma put a crease in your jaw
Might catch me squeezing the four
My nigga I go to war
And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store
why'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw
Predicate assassin, smashin
Open shit, rig scope, focus it
Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit)
Oppose the clique, I send five close to six
Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit
Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists
Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off
Fix your face, we back on the paper chase
Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place
Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that ain't notice

One thought I loved her
Seas debate the storm pull him the the surface
That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of
This shits big, the first thing to catch to where PD is

We had a fullproof plan, all we need was the fam
Ammunition, a van, two chicks and one extra man
Two lincoln LS Sedans
Fifteen hundred yards of saran
And after the scam, we be out in Amsterdam
Yo, call Sean in Milan
Call Sean tell Sean we gone
We'll meet him in Hong Kong
With two chicks both they thongs on
Mabe Ling and Kim Long
Both of them dead wrong
Two rich bitches the feds on

Downstairs with a bag of money and two clips
Talkin' to Loons chicks wit' sombreros and toothpicks
Sayin' they commit homicides for two bits
And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing
I just got the same page from Bris
He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks
It's a set up
Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in NY
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops
Hit both the hot locks

I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine

I'm living in a room without any view
I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonyms of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head

Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
Window in time, through it I fly

I've seen the stars disappear in the sun
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars
I don't believe there's any future in cause

Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
Window in time, through it I fly
Yeah

I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
I've seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
But now I'm living on the profits of pride",Hole in the Sky,

Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
You never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now I've got to know ya
Tell me who am I to blame?
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Now the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone

Fighting going on between the human race

She's the richest bitch in town

Her big fat daddy was a money machine
He made a fortune from computers
She's got more money than I've ever seen
But she's a greedy emotional looter

Keep away from the digital bitch
She's so rich the digital bitch

She's got five rollers and a fine estate
A big house upon hill
She throws parties just to celebrate
Her life is just one ginormous thrill

She buys poor people just to have around
She has a trophy for each lover
The bitch is rich but baby pound for pound
She's got a lot more to discover

Maybe she could please me if I saw beneath her veil
But she's just imitation woman up for sale

She got so famous that she's on TV
She's got a professional smile
But I switch over 'cause she ain't for me
She disturbs me all the while

She looks so happy but she's got it wrong
She's always going faster
She sings her life to such a different song
She needs a loving and dominant master",Digital Bitch,1983
Black Sabbath,"Let's try getting to the sky
Hang on or you're going to die
Sour life can turn sweet
It's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile
Watched closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries
Keep looking at the eyes

Good life is contradiction
Because of the crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I will take your soul and plant my seed

You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers fan electric lies

We're disturbing the priest
Won't you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest
Not at all not at all not in the least

The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set a light
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside
The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away
It's just like the battle of the sun and the moon and the night and day
The force of the devil that we're all told to fear
Watched out for religion when he gets too near too near",Disturbing the Priest,1983
Black Sabbath,"Take me to the river baby drink my wine
When I'm going down won't you throw me a line
Lead me to religion take me up them stairs

When will you show me a sign
When will you throw me a line

Help me to the answer baby set me free
I'm torn between the devil and the deep blue sea
Maybe if you wanted you could save my face
Keep me out of trouble and I'm living disgrace

Standing in a line with the shadows of fame
Lead me to a legend take me up them stairs
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers",Hot Line,1983

What was it that you did last night
You made me crazy you made me fly

I'm just a runner I was born free
But since I met you I can't leave you alone
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home

Keep it warm rat the place by your side
Nobody's gonna take away our magical ride
Keep it warm for when we talk on the phone
Don't forget will you pretty one that your man is coming home

D'you hear the rumour that is going around
Say I'm ruined 'cause I've settled down
It's not true well maybe half and half
You know I love you but I still like a laugh
Ooh I'm feeling fine I got it right for the first time
Sweet woman I can't stay for long but everybody will be prove wrong

I'm like a gypsy I need to roam
But don't worry I'll be coming home
I need the danger I need the thrill

Black Sabbath,"It really was a meeting
The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and
I was going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stop-watch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went of exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
I was turning tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an only patch
Inebriation

Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can you hear my lies
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes

So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains
'Cause there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we get trashed we were laughing still
Well bless my soul",Trashed,1983

Don't you want to be brother - Zero the hero
When you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Impossibility impissibolity mother really a hero

You sit there watch it all burn down
It's easy and breezy for you
You play your life to a different sound
No edge no edge you got no knife have you
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there
Where the heroes sit by the river
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver

You stand there captain we all look
You really are mediocre
You are the champion in the Acme form book
But I think you're just a joker
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity

Truth or thunder, life or blame

Do you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?

There are people laughing, they're all laughing at you
If only they could see what you're saying was true, ooh yeah
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know, don't they know? No, no, no

As the wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
Anno Mundi, yeah

Do you follow the path that so many tread?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join in the war, do you fight for the 'cause?
Depend on another to fight it alone

As the wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old, no, no, no

Can you see me now, oh, can you hear me now? Oh, no
Can you tell me where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer, running in the rain
Truth or thunder, life or blame

There's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts now reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?
No longer the fool, the vision is done

Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
Your eyes are burning

As the wind in the night blows cold

And the sands of our time grow old

Now I wonder, can others see the system that I see
Or do they see and say they don't and blame it on society?
The days of smart enough come to over, just say thousands
And as I live and learn because there's always someone mouthing
Speaking on an issue, praise you or they diss you
Long as I am strong, the words fly by me like Scott tissue
My people, from nigger to negro to man of color
Killed my father and my brother so that you could rape my mother
Now you wonder, why is it through instinct you fear
Wouldn't dare me to stare, one for yourself, you're out of here
Not to worry, to harm you not intention of my creed
But to stop your greed and give me what I need
Opportunity, for a life for me

Listen, stay open not dismissing
Lack of vision makes division product no ambition
Wishes which you wish upon which for more you wishes
If I wish not to record steady now then I wash dishes
Wish while I wash, the water hot gets colder
Black I'm saying that in fact the dish gets clean and I get older

If dumb and pumping jump, then get no ovation
But only restriction, boom penes a lot of friction
I then wash a dish with out pay? Boom! N.W.A
Think I'm lying? Black I'm crying, salted tear would turn to crystal
Crystals forming on my dishes so I wash them 'til dismissal
Wash until my prints are wrinkled then they let me go
I know not where I'm going so I know not where I go
My people give me money, but the money much too low
For me to meet the match of present day so I still need more dough
Conjure up a suit, I wish that it were cute
Borrow a token and a smoking I begin a wish less hope
Intervening, application leads me on into frustration
And duration of my time is spent with lack of occupation
Time to go for what I know. I know not of what I wish

Don't tell me I'm color blind
I'm seeing system is hard to believe in
Underneath the underside I'm underachieving
Bust my ass in school, to be a certified fool
Now intellect of curb is my only tool
But street game is so uncouth
I took the SAT and that's the sad-ass truth
I'm not gliding but I'm striving hanging on by a thread and it's called surviving
Hang on, hang on, hang y'all
Walk the street and keep you head so tall
For time is short, no time is bought

Bust it, bust it, Friday night swingin you know what I'm sayin
With Mista Lawnge and my man Jermaine, and Jack whose names is Joe
Check it check it check it yo c'mon

Lyrics

I been around, I been around
I been around town
Sounds you know I'm down
That many cannot get down
But not me, we kick it all day and night see
Although you know in a minute
Right now you know not who I be
So I kick it for a second
Yes I kick it for a sec
Get wreck, and double check
Got to play with your select
Name is Dres, D-are-E-S
Yes I guess that it is
Ya gotta bag of buddha well smoke a sess
I'm the type of brother that the girls always select
It's not because they're out to come
It's cause they're out to come correct
I talk about a ho, because a ho I know
And if you do the honey Tea
then I guess too you would talk so
Play me not, if my phone book is bigger
Don't get hot cause I clock the fat figure
Told ya I'm a singa got my finga on the trigga
Cause everybody hates the fly nigga
Play me not close if your jean is made of plastic
If your best to play it down
Then you should walk faster
Don't give me a pound if you bust that in your hand
Play me out never cause I came to understand
Do it to, for a minute
I do for me too
Push me up and I'll pull myself through
Watch my back and I'll watch my front
Got what I want, see-ya hate to be ya
Got a nie, got a shot, got a catch twenty-two
Damned  if I don't and I'm damned if I do
Fightin over cities how they're fightin on my block
Over there is liberation over here is for a rock
No not pop rock, no not pop rock
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-after shock
Some will part fly gear, while others are suckin
I game I use to play until I learned to keep steppin
But one thring I learned, yo roll and take it
Life is what you make it",Blunted 10,1991
Black Sheep,"Verse One

It's times like this that I've gotta crack a smile
If about anything, than it's gotta be style
What happens now? A better man can hold the mike and do the proving,
Dres, of the Black Sheep Yo, let's get the Sheep moving
I'd like to pay a tribute, to what, to knocking boots
I'm single and I mingle if ya jingle I play roots
But there's another, the other
The brother on the cover
I brought along, I brought along
I brought along, Lawnge
I do a not a trio move your bootie cause I say so
Be outlasting or not busting Black Sheep not your average Joe
Now I hold a microphone, but this is what I wanted
A pocket full of panonie, better me than those that front it
Dropping bombs, lovely, make 'em jet without their Jetta
Keep fronting if you're wanting but I bet ya the Beretta
Punctuates and exclamates, the lingo I let go
Not that it's my style 'cause I let go my ego
Be it just us, just you or just me or just who
Never am I full, gotta to get residuals
Pronto, Tonto
Was engine number nine
I'm out to get the nickels, quarters, pennies and the dimes

Chorus

Butt in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one, in the meantime
Now in the meantime, I try to hawk one
I try to hawk one in the meantime

Verse Two

At last, Black Sheep on wax
And finally, it's for himself that Mista Lawnge is laying tracks
Now I won't dally your fiddle
Give ya more than bits and kibble
Or is it kibbles and bits that became hits, now there's a riddle
Believe me, 'cause you see, I do understand
Heard a jam that was flam
Bought the album, Van Damme, it's weak
But for the moment, I won't speak
Upon this, I mean that, I mean those, I mean them
I mean there, I mean here, damn
Yo, whatcha trying say Dres?
Yo let me try this again
Ya see, this is rather funky, the style that I'm displaying
Somewhat bona fide, on the side of okay and
Finally, your hunger for dopeness is full
Hmmm, please excuse me, Yo, turn it up a decibel
For I am about to rip a style
That will make heads bop awhile
So please step to the right, if ya suck
Should I do 'em Violators  ""Ahh, what the fuck?""
Moving, yes I'm moving, am I moving?  ""Goony gu-gu""
Say la say la what, say la say la say la ""pu-pu""
Say it in a second, after Dres is finished wrecking
As I'm wrecking, gotcha checking
Step to this and Dres will deck

Chorus


Verse Three

Surprising you, I'm rising,
Dresmerizing and subliminalizing
Black Sheep are here, we're breaking all ties
And making songs that are prolific
Specific as terrific
Move a body in the city to both sides of the Pacific
I'm Dres and you are not
You're cold, I'm hot which means I'm soon to boil bootie
Your bootie, your bootie, the butt, but still you think your royal
Are you mad, are you jealous
Overjoyed or over zealous?
Hold your glass and sip
For when you held the mike you couldn't rip
Before your mike went hush
Keep sipping stupid lush
I know I'll be all right tonight
I took my time, I didn't rush
I didn't blush, I didn't frown
Got up to get down
Henceforth, I'm getting down and dirty, G
You thought that I would not be
Stupid, Cupid, or elupid
I sting ya like a bumble
Where's the bee, here I be
Can'tcha see, can'tcha peep?
If you're sleeping then wake up
If you're stinking then wash up
If you're creeping, then catch up
You're rolling with the Black Sheep

Chorus

Chorus",Butt in the Meantime,1991
Black Sheep,"Who's the Black Sheep, what's the Black Sheep?
Don't know who I am, or when I'm coming so you sleep
Wasn't in my room, wasn't in my sphere
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-are-E-S, yes I get suckers start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here one apart
Back, Middle, to the front, don't front
Want to a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey?
Now get a yo!
You gotta hay?
It's for the hoes
The styling is creative, Black Sheep of the Native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the Quest
Deaf retarded uncles, in parties were they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam NOW
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, cause this is where it's at

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, cause this is where it's at

Where's the Black Sheep, here's the Black Sheep
Even if we wanted to the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that
Because in fact, on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Ya know what I'm saying, yo Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this, or go with that with no delaying
See, in actuality, one be can it be,
I made it look easy, because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled, try to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat, and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls, and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, cause this is where it's at

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, cause this is kinda phat

Engine, Engine, Number Nine
On the New York transit line
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!

Back on the scene, crispy n' clean
You can try, but then why, cause you can't intervene
We be the outcast, down for the settle
Won't play the rock, won't play the pebble
Open the door, you best believe, we're sliding through it swiftly
Niftily, we can make it hip to be what we are
Cause what we be, be the epitome, Doo, Dah, Dipitty
So now I dwell just to say you're plainer
Hold your cup, cause I got the container
Pass a plater, cross the fader
Black Sheep get play like the Sony Innovator
Never the traitor, party inflater
And you can get a scoop later

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, cause this is kinda phat

You can get with this, or you can get with that

Black Sheep,"Second Verse
 
So you got the fever for the flavor of the other
Chocolate, sasspirilla, or is it you like another
Flavor in my socks
To the curly locks
Black Sheep rollin hard
and kncokin peons out the box
Never have I ever never
ever felt much better
Did the whole nine
on the tenth I was no wetter
Ready and I'm eager
Eager as a beaver
On the radio and good to go
says your receiver
Not to be the baddest
or the oldest nor the wackest
Neither am I needest
or the newest or the blackest
Just a brown fellow
Who's not afraid of Jello
To the people of the world
I would like to say G'day
Had to wait a while
But the while has been waited
Never gave up hope
in myself, nor debated
Didn't shed a tear when I wasn't picked
Cause I got a cone now, want a lick?
 
Chorus


 
Third Verse
 
Now I catch a number
when before I caught a glare
Now I give a pound
when before I got a stare
Now I guess I kinda got it goin on
I get a wake-up call on the lawn
I used to try and push a demo
Now I have a Coupe
That's a bit more than a little
But then not quite a few
Funny how they find you
when they told you get lost
Tell me why you're grittin
when you have no dental floss
Wasn't my loss
Thought you were the boss?
You never knew how much the Sherbert cost
Forget it, I never sweat it
Your girl will give me play I'll wet it
It only happens just because you let it
Now everybody wants to play my phone
I see em with a spoon
I see em with a cone
You never knew I knew it
but I knew you would pursue it
Hurry up and get a scoop before it's gone

When we get dressed 
The hand gets brushed, but whiskers they get clipped
Over to the mirror, yeah we look okay

Third Verse

Not that I like talking of the things that I possess
I know that some have more, while others do have less
It's just that I want to say, I live a life in a day
Didntt have to wait till I was lonely old and gray
I simply put my foot forward in a direction
That's called a step then I follow with the next one
Kept on 3teppin, no matter what happened
Kept my eyes open, and kept hands clappin
Did what I had to do when I had to do it
Didn't want to say (B) ho when I surely knew it
So, I persevered from the beginning
Now that I'm in Black Sheep out to win
So when you see me, stick it up G
No it's not a diss, it's makin me happy
Lettin me know that you did what you heard
Daring to say that societyts absurd
Let it be known that you gotta go for the
gusto be ahead of hoes to the head ho
Don't let nobody tell you what you cannot be
Don't let nobody tell you what you cannot do
Enough of the tours, itis time to get yours
Otherwise I guess I have to give the finga, to you

Black Sheep,"Intro (by Chi Ali)

Dag, I wish I was like Jordan
So I could just fly through the air no one could ever stop me
Or, or like Mike Mike Tyson
So I could just knock people's heads off
Naaw, more like Prince
So I could pull all the honeys
Well a brother like Chi Ali is pullin all the honeys anyway
But still, it would be nice

First Verse

What's goin on kid?
At times I dress to be in
I see you grinnin I'm beginnin to think that we're friends
And if we are friends, then we are far from fools
So I will then kiss and
let you into my sphere cool
Now listen I'm known, as a Black Sheep
And if you try to pull the cover
and attempt to sleep
You won't get rest naaaah
You can not sleep on this
For I make noise... see
But anyway, I 
It's where I live and though 
I live on nonetheless
Someime 
I've got my body and my intellect
I'm buddha blessed
Now my chalantness
Or rather lack of this
You call the spade a spade
well I will call the spade a kiss

You try to 
And if the source 
I get a verbal bat

What's goin on black?
You want a hand to smack
Well I can never be all that
So I will give you daps
I do the 'Hey yo'
Your girl is on the strobe?
Oh no that's kind of trip
But gee I gotta go
You see it's not the style of me
So I'm not mending
And I won't pull you leg
Nor start pretending
to be a fair weather
with a plea to come
Cause you never let me hold your 
You see it's like this I'll start explaining
Dres is down with self maintaining
Don't say I can't, I know that I can

so you could never know me now

Third verse

What's goin on hon?
You say you're out for fun
I got a pocket full of posies
You say I got a fun
Then take a step back
Away from Flipper
I'd rather shoot you with the joint
inside my zipper
But not to be fresh
For then I lose the groove
I'd rather see you smile
And move your booty smooth
Then I get to know ya
Got things to show ya
Is there the chance
of me gettin over
And over and over and over and over again
Now tell me
Are you gonna let me in
For it's gettin hot
what I have have not
Give me a second though
I have a mansion and a yacht
A caddy for my daddy
somethin new for mom too
A coat for Mista Lawnge
and some hook-ers for the crew

You know my love is greater

Black Sheep,"[Talking]
Listen, hon, I mean, ah, as slamming as you are and all that good stuff; 
It ain't doing me no good out here cause you got too many clothes on. 
So why don't we just take this cab and uh, slide on uptown and uh, 
slip out of this comfortablenesses of the world around us. Do you know 
what, you know what I am saying babes? Matter of fact uhhhhh 
 
Listen to me honey, 
Ah, honey listen here please. 
If sexy were a virus, 
Then you have a disease. 
Slamming is your styling 
Let me speak for a while and 
Tell you all about the grand slamming. 

Why are you smiling? 

Let's do the uptown slide, 
Don't need a transfer or auto ride. 
We only need a cab with us inside. 
Finally finally we got uptown, 
And when we got uptown, 
Honey's drawers came down. 

Did the audio visual, 
She had the residual. 
Bah bah Dress, now tell me have you any pull. 
I said honey uhh, again I said it slow. 
Coming out the boxers and my joint will surely grow. 

Then she started feeling, 
Yes it was appealing. 
I thought of slamming girlfriend from the floor to the ceiling. 
We started five play, 
She said that she would come. 
I said it wasn't four play, 
Because I used my thumb. 

Nibbled on her neck, 
Oh, what the heck, 
She said, 'one two, one two' and went down for a mic check. 

Her mike sounds nice check one. 
Her mike sounds nice check two. 
She did this 'till it was all gone. 
I told her to slow down. 
But she kept on. 

[Chorus] 
And on, and on, and on, she kept on [Repeat: x 4] 
You gotta do something about those wisdom teeth baby. (added during second line) 
Though your sounding as good as a CD. 

Everything was Dolby, or rather was okay. 
She was playing Frito and I play the Lay. 
Then I heard a knock only to hear a voice say. 

Yo, you can't have a show without the DJ. 

I entered in my drawers, to show that I was live. 
The hoe didn't believe that I was nine point five. 
She said, 'Let me see it Long, may I see it please?' 
I said, 'Yeah, get a good look. Drop to your knees.' 
I was erectified. I gave her the proof. 
And then I suggested a little roof roof. 

She was uptight, I said, 'Hon, there's nothing wrong, 
I'm the sugar dick daddy Mister Long.' 
Don't get offended by the position I recommended. 
Doggy style is my shit. 
The bottom is what I hit. 
I didn't eat her, 
Or Rita, just beat her, 
Bonita, Bonita, Bonita 
Uhh! 

Tip and Sugar Dick, blazing trails of evil. 
Long you got the felt cause I sure enough got the needle. 
Now put them on the arm that pertrudes like a stick. 
And live up to your name, 
Mister Long Sugar Dick. 
As the dookie hits the fan, 
Here comes the horny man 
To finish up the task. 
So I'm scoping out that ass. 
Long, she wants it, 
Her hands spread the butt cheeks. 
Tip plus Long plus the hoe equals wet sheets. 

[Talking]
God damn. 
Yo, somebody give me, 
A horny time. 
Somebody give me a ho. 
Spread the ass. 
Just give me a ho. 
No man. 
Somebody give me a ho. 
I'm gonna come in your face. 
Somebody give me a ho. 
I'm coming, in your face. 
Somebody give me a ho. 
I'm gonna come in your face. 
Somebody give me a ho. 
Bitch just let me pee on you. 
Let me pee on you. 
Let me pee on you. 
Somebody give me a ho. 
I've got the anal sun god. 
I've got the anal sun god. 
Let me pee on you. 
Somebody give me a ho. 
Ahh! 
I can't hold it no more.

Black Sheep,"[Dres]
When I first saw ya, I thought that I knew ya
Now I know I don't just wish that I did
Honey made a right, stepped off, took flight
Upstairs, up more, made a left, and hid
Looked down at my shoes and the cuff in my slacks
Hand inside my pocket, came out with somethin stickin
Doublemint goes in my mouth, jaws are breakin North and South
Look around to see who's lookin, figure that my breath was kickin so
In the bathroom I go; and fixing his 'fro..
.. you guessed it, the Lawnge one
'What's up Black?' goes the hand smack
I get the feeling that it's time for some Black Sheep fun
The club is on the bourgeois, urinal holding a cigar
Then you never know, probably a Phillie
Lawnge cracks a smile, oh no, here it comes, then says
""Yo Dres, honey made you look silly""
Step back in the joint, and yeah it's kinda funky
My breath no longer kickin so now it has pep
Strobelite hoe that I don't know
walks up, asks Lawnge's sign, we quickly do the step

	Where you at, hon? Where you at?
	Where you at, hon? Where you at?
	Where you at, hon? Where you at?

[Dres]
Then I change my style
Movin through the crowd, the smoke has got me chokin
Funny that I'm chokin, could it be that I am smokin
Pounds are goin round, but this is nothing new
Hoping that eloping with a dip is what I'll do
System's kinda boomin like a drive-in called the Sonic
Find the bar kid, my state of mind would like a tonic
There she goes, ""Where?"" Take my thoughts out of the dumps
Lawnge, over there, over there, look at bumps
From the time that she was born, she was raised to be all that,
Gave her no food (what?) Strictly Similak
Felt like a punk on Dick Street, a coupon in the ghetto
I said, 'Hon, whacha drinkin?' She said, 'Milk and amaretto'
I took a seat beside her, I would not be denied
I ordered L.I.I.T. and fill 'er up, she's got a rider
She showed her dental work, and said I looked familiar
I touched her on the hand, I had to feel her!

[Chorus]
Similak child, drivin me wild
Simi-limi-lak child - you're definitely winnin
Similak child, drivin me wild
Simi-limi-lak child - you're the woman

[Dres]
I said, 'Hey', she said, 'Hi'
I said, 'Us', she said, 'Try'
'And if you're thinkin strictly boots then I'll say baby, bye bye'
She said, 'I know you got at least a dozen that you're seeing
You think you own the world, at least New York because you're G'ing
You claim to be the man. you want me for a lover
So you can do my girlfriends and my sister and my mother'
I said, 'You're very blunt, with quickness to the cue
So whassup with your mother does she look as good as you?
I'm playin, but let me not delay in what I'm sayin
Initially attraction found your way before the weigh-in
I'm single so I've got at least a dozen on my door step
Doesn't boost my ego, it doesn't mean we've slept
I'm in the public eye, so I try to be an eyeful
Do not own the world, but yes I have some pull'
My chorus rose a brow, she's curious of me
'Please give me more iced tea, and her vitamin D'
She said, 'Me?'  Yes.  'Why?'  Guess.
Sweetheart you've got ten cushions, besides I like your dress
I'm playin but let me not be weak and let me speak
Your mind is brighter than your booty it's the courtin' that I seek

Simi-limi-lak child - you're definitely winning

Simi-limi-lak child -  you're the woman",Similak Child,1991
Black Sheep,"Verse One: Dres

I skipped the line, I paid my dime
I hung my coat, and now it's time
To move to the forefront take my rounds
Say peace and give a pound have a drink, get down
I'm on the floor, besides the door
The sound is rich, and I ain't poor
I'm looking for Susie or Wendy or Judy
But look at her [repeat 3X] ""Who me?""
Yes, you sweetie, although it's hard to see thee
I see your silhouette and what I see has got me needy
I need you for a second of your time
But then I reckon that a second is too short let me try
""You're slammin!""
But anyway, I'd like to say
I'm Dres of the Black Sheep givin you play
Step out in the light, come show off yourself
Yo, I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else.

Chorus: Dres, Strobelite Hoe

I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go  ""Don't go"" [repeat line 3X]
Just don't know  ""Why?""  Hon, I just don't know
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go  ""Don't go"" [repeat line 3X]
See something ain't right  ""Why?""  It's the strobelite

Insert - Mista Lawnge, Dres, Strobelite Hoe

[Mista Lawnge]
Van Damne, Oh man, now you look out
I can not dig it, I can not dig it
No, yo Black, I can not dig it

[Dres, Strobelite Hoe]
Listen Hon, I mean aaaaaah
It's nice looking at you, I just have to go
My man is right over there ""Where you going?""
I have to go  ""Huhhhhh?""
[to his 'man' who doesn't exist] I'm on my way Black, I'm on my way
""Don't you have a number or something?""
Listen it's ahhhhhhh, 765-4321
""What area code is that?""
One, nine-hundred


Verse Two: Dres

Listen here dear, step to the rear
Find yourself a seat, buy yourself a beer
Eat some pretzels, go play some videos
Thank you for your time honey, but hoe, I gotta go
I think I lost my coat, and plus I'm double parked
I thought you was my girl, see I can't see in the dark
Anyway I'm out, out is where I be
I've got to step, ""With the viscosity""
When you see a honey by the strobelite
Black I hope you got good sight
For honey that you see, like a Shakespeare soliloquy
May or may not be, all that
In fact, quite wacked
With the girl that makes you stop tracks
But neither here nor there fear
Unless, of course, you don't care
Listen baby girl, let me say it slow
I-have-to-go
Not to dis, but lets disperse
Yo, I'll see you later, unless I see you first

Chorus

Outro: Dres

Can't swing tonight, so ahhhhhhh
Honey take a hike, go fly a kite
And I don't mean to be impolite
But yo, I'm outta here aight?",Strobelite Honey,1991

Black Sheep

No further ado
I give introduction
Of Dres and Mista Lawnge
A newfound baby sound production
I'm not out to [vick?] you
To strip or evict you
But merely do the things you wanted to but weren't able
Like move a party side to side
Sway for sway
And stride for stride
First fine tune
Then hit volume
Aw sheep, hit the bass and got the boom
So move to a rhythm that's quite uplifting
Just when you thought that nothing would rise, I'm drifting
Higher (higher)
Yeah, higher
I'm not a king, a prince, a ruler or a squire
I'm not a prophet and I'm not a messiah
I'm not a wolf or another flat tire...
Listen
I'm the Black Sheep man, oh yeah, I'm here
And even if you turn, I bet your girlfriend stares at me
And with me
You step, she just might come get me
Not slow but with a bounding leap
She'll be pulling my wool... (and what else?)
Count Black Sheep

One sheep
Two sheep
Three sheep
Black Sheep

It's a Black Sheep ""La Cosa Nostra"", or ""Thing Of Ours""
A family affair that overflows the reservoir
Of dollar short and daily sports who don't know what to do
Because I'm rocking you, rocking you, rocking you
Now listen because in a unit or family
A poppa, a momma
And brothers or sisters, see
An atmosphere of love in the air
Can give a clue or hunch
To the way we all became black Brady Bunch (okay)
To continue
There's a sister who is bright
A brother who's a wiz
Another that's not right
Stays out all damn night
You wake him up too early, cursing ready to fight
You say left and he says right-o
You want to see E.T. but brother there puts on porno
Love the family pet, I bet you even feed him Rave
Brother cooks your tabby in the microwave (meow)
He'd probably swipe your wallet if the light got dim
Now you have your doubts
But you never put it past him
And in the end, on that one you never sleep (never sleep)
Cause he's a Black Sheep

One sheep
Two sheep
Three sheep
Black Sheep

What's up party people
Party people, how ya doing
Black Sheep coming through
And then I guess that we're pursuing
A bit of your time
We'll skip over my sign
And get into a beat and a bass line
Stepping to the fellas
Fellas, peace and how you be
Keep the party orderly
We all can get booty
So before you rift, go play the bar again
Chill, count to ten
And bring me back a Heineken
Cuties, cuties, cuties, where's the hoes?
I knows and you knows and I know you know
No jam complete without a flock of bo peeps
Am I right?
Am I, am I, am I right?
Quite
Focus that I see tonight be
The epitome of sexy
Then again, it's just me
Honey next to you might look like doodoo
But don't nap, a cutie might be in her crew
In any event
I see the movement
And wonder where it is that the time went
But I'm out
See ya when the sun goes down
And the Black Sheep are in your town
Throwing down
Be there in a second so don't sleep
And if you do
Count the Sheep

Black Sheep,"Yo motherfucker
What the fuck you lookin at?
Yo, get out my motherfuckin face right now

Yo man, trip this
I was out on the ave man
This nigga lookin at me wrong
So I pulled out my motherfuckin nine
And I SMOKED HIS ASS

Woke up, didn't choke up
Saw my AK, it was broke up
Put it together like a jigsaw
Got my nine, and my Rambo knife off the floor
Went to the bathroom, and beat the rush
Yo, who the fuck used my toothbrush?
Went to my sister's room, yo bitch, wake up
You stupid ass, dirty ass, nasty ass slut
Shot her in the leg, shot her in the thigh
Kick her in the pussy and punched her in the eye
Slapped her in the head, stepped on her corns
Don't fuck with mine bitch, word is born
Went downstairs to eat wit my folks
Ma, you broke my fuckin egg yoke!
Punch her in the chest, cut on her cheek
Then I did a sweep, knocked the bitch off her feet
Knee to the pussy, kick to the skull
AK yo I shot the bitch in the temple
Pops got mad cause mom got licked
I didn't give a fuck so I shot him in the dick
Hungry as fuck, said my grace
Pop kept screamin so I shot him in the face
Ate my food, found my coat
Mailman came so I cut his motherfuckin throat
Waitin for the motherfuckin school bus!!

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo Dres, yo Dres
Wake up man, wake up 
What's wrong with you man
Yo, I had a horrible, fuckin dream man
What the fuck was the dream about G?
I dreamed that I was.. hard",U Mean I'm Not,1991
Black Sheep,"Yo! The Black Sheep has arisen here, oh dear
The cat's out the bag and it's the end of your career
Don't spit it out, let it persevere
I like to see my dick snot disappear
I got inch out the edge, Lawnge Don can't compare
So, ho, come here!
Now some say they get live but the Sugar Dick is live-er
In and out of any situation like MacGuyver
If it's not Boopie's then it's Lady Godiva's
When it comes to hitting ass I'm a striver
I'll use my dick to fight a war so there won't be no survivor
Call me the Nine Point Fiver!
Cause I'm the sugar dick, the Sugar Dick Daddy Mr Lawnge
Of the Black Sheep here to point out what's wrong
With emcees like these popping that bullshit, please!?
Hang it up, black
If it's a God-given talent then take that shit back
Analyze the style, go home and re-write
I know you want to be down, I know you want to be like
ME! The Sugar Dick Daddy Lawnge
If you think that you can play me, nah, you're dead wrong
Cause I write lines and wreck minds
Being that I'm the DJ I can flip at any time
I'll diss you on the rhyme, diss you on the cut
Have you on the dick so much there's no room for my nuts
Forget rapping, you nerds are herbs
Just get a job and ride my dick to work
Respect the Lawnge one cause fly shit I mail out
Yo, you got the wrong one if you think I'll sell out
Used to have a ho and I'm damn glad we fell out
I would keep on rapping but it's time to break the hell out

Yo bust it, I be a fly nigga as far as niggas go
I be a choice brother but only a brother would know
Chilling Eskimo as the general rule
If you can't say Dres, you can call me cool
Styles unlimited, you can't get with it
But you can get this if you straddled and it fitted
I wondered and I pondered if your family were Roman
Cause you're snuggly and you're cuddly, play me closely like a Trojan
Ah-ah, it busted, aww shit, don't act dumb
You opened your mouth, black, so yo here I come
It's a catastrophic state but let it begin
If my dick's on your minds then my balls are on your chin
Now here it's kind rough, so kids stay on your toes
If my balls or on your chin then pubic hair is up your nose
If pubic hair is up your nose then I suppose
I'm the nigga that gets and you're the nigga that blows
My style is immeasurable so put away your ruler
Think of the coolest kid you know, Dres is cooler
Smoother, slicker, quicker roll-flicker
Honey came bloody so I hit her in the shitter
Went to a first stone caster cum a master blaster
Tell you cause I know, black, get off the slim faster
I know you want to emcee and be down with the rest
But stay on the head now cause that's what you do best
Your duck down sound compound no interest
Get down with the flock, motherfucker, invest
In the rhyming you're designing, I can see your shit climbing
To the bottom from the mid where it hid, bad timing?
What do you want to know, I still gotta go
You're a tic out of tac but I'm busy getting doe
Move over just a bit for the sight taking flight
Still eager as the Beaver and I'm leading with my right
I'll coin one more then step, daggonit
Our dicks are the planet and where are you?",Yes [*],1991
Black Sheep,"Verse One: Dres

Who's the Black Sheep, what's the Black Sheep?
Don't know who I am, or when I'm coming so you sleep
Wasn't in my room, wasn't in my sphere
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-are-E-S, yes I get suckers start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here one apart
Back, Middle, to the front, don't front
want to a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? [Hey!]
Now get a yo! [Yo!]
You gotta hay? [Huh!]
It's for the hoes [Oh!]
The styling is creative, Black Sheep of the Native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the Quest
Deaf retarded uncles, in parties were they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam NOW
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours

Chorus

You can get with this, or you can get with that [repeat 3X]
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
[repeat both lines 2X]


Verse Two

Where's the Black Sheep, here's the Black Sheep
Even if we wanted to the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that,
Because in fact, on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Ya know what I'm saying, yo Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this, or go with that with no delaying
See, in actuality, one be can it be,
I made it look easy, because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled, try to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat, and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls, and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat

Chorus

Verse Three

Now you can get this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this yes, for this is kinda fat
If you get with that, then you will surly miss,
Because that is so wack, I think you'll get with this
For in the day in my life, or rather the life of my days
Never sweat the chaos, for Black Sheep has ways
Although, how shall I say it, take a point, convey it
Styling is quite Dolby, yes I know those for you play it
Not to be all that though all that is my goal
Stumble and fell, brother, like Dres would roll
Need a sexy honey for a twilight stroll
Gave up on sushi, give me an egg roll
At A & W, get to the Root, with a boot or sneaker
Get near a speaker, demo to a single
To the kind with a fly hoe, damned the scenario
And, pass the paper, cross the fader
Black Sheep getting played, like a Sony in a Beta
Dres the creator, of a style that is much greater

Chorus",The Choice Is Yours,1991
Black Sheep,"Yo, huh, what, yo huh, what, yo, yo, yo, huh, what, yo, huh, what

I'm in a state of yo
So if I go to the spliff that I passed
Mix it back with the slack from my man
With a tan sitting by the fan
In a heavy, heavy band
The beat, huh, feels warm, and cool
Won't fall
Just move it, groove it, soothe it, shmooth it
Ah, shit and I won't quit
Keep on, and on and on
Filling up the gap from eve to dawn
Gotta be the Sheep
Under your nose, above your head
Honey said '69', I thought of boots
And gave her pro-Keds
D for action, just like Jackson
'Cause the Jacksons are not imagined
I don't really want to give a foot, you know
I'm in a state of yo, so what if I go

Yo, huh, what, yo huh, what, yo, yo, yo, huh, what, yo, huh, what
Yo, huh, what, yo huh, what, yo, yo, yo, huh, what, yo, check it

Yo, days go by, we just get flyer
Swinging harder 'cause we got desire
Extra effort because we're tryers
Got more heat than a dollar in the dryer
Got more flavour than Fruity Pebbles
Check the format, clock the levels
Yo,­ do what you gotta do
'Cause I got more style than store that's dapper
Got more sweet than a candy wrapper
Got more, balls than a pimp who slaps
And got heart like a thug that maps
Make more sense than childhood freaks
Got more support than high-top kicks
So what's happens in the mix
I'm weak and pure like a heroin fix
So, yo, don't you know that the flow
That I just move on, just like so
It's got me in a, state of

What, yo, huh, what, yo huh, what, yo, yo, yo, huh, what, yo, huh, what
Yo, huh, what, yo huh, what, yo, yo, yo, huh, what, yo, huh, what

yo, no aggression
Let your mind make connection
Ain't no need for correction
Yo, huh? Oh, on with the session
Heavies got some weight, you can't debate
Elate the fate, 'cause style is great
For life is hectic and all that there
For people, you care but, yo, beware
For one knows not what gets one shot
I think I used to know but I forgot
'Cause it ain't nothing, nothing at all
I'm telling you it's a small
Without the faith for things that work
To spite my life is to spite your birth
We share the earth, yo, but who was first, yo?
Well, who's here now, yo? Well, where's my hearse, yo
'Cause I gotta go, I gotta go
But where I don't, I don't, I don't know
I guess I'll just hang out in a state of yo",State of Yo,1992
Black Sheep,"Verse One: 
Black-Sheep 
Spell it to the letter 
I'm out of the ghetto 
Some could tell my story 
But who could tell it better 
Nobody slinuner 
Thinkin he's a winner 
Pullin on the wool-er 
Finger on the trigger 
Scramb-a-lin, ramb-a-lin 
Thinks he la right gamb-a-lin 
Ambul-ance head crack 
Cause he took a chance 
That you didn't rip, the one he didn't think a flip 
But if I'm shakin ya down, believe you're losing your grip 
Money I'm rollin I'm rollin I'm rollin I'm rollin again 
Honeys I know 
That want to know me adapt 
Let me tell a joke 
Cause a funny'll get 
Slept onna step I'm gettin money again 
Yo flim to the flam to the D to the poise 
separate the men from the boys, those are the toys 
Negroes'll front, that's if they got what you want 
But yo they freeze on a stunt 
I'm feelin more than a blunt 
Never was a gangster even at a street pix 
But swingin on a swinger you'll be strollin with a limp 
So get up easy cause it's simple as this 
Give us a shot how could you think that I miss 
Yesterday's a memo, the demo sold a bundle 
No I'm not conceited though for y0u I won't be humble 
Been around the block and it ain't our first day out 
Crazy with a stick and yo I throws a blow a-way out 
Kids who use to stay out till I roll needed the gray out 
Hobbies we attackin now we're skelly and knockin clay out 
Papas on the hurough, in every burough 
Nobody could front, ya see my family's crazy thorough 
Two quince sure 
And yo the others are done 
No fables at the table 
We'llerit the no that's in my blood 
So I, stand tall 
And lay for the call 
To counter-react 
Because we're real I tell ya who's gonna pack 
Chorus 
Verse Two: 
Yo it's not easy at the top 
Which is why we play the back 
Not to say that we don't strive 
In fact, to be exact 
It's a one-sided coin 
Gotta know how to flip it 
And I say lucky in the flip 
If you ask me for a tip 
Now we're back on 
Word to the life build receipt 
Me thinks this things are broken 
Lings how can we be complete 
Heads always collided 
with the brain we could be glidin 
While we stab him in the back 
When I see Isrob beside him 
So Lawnge/long (huh), we waited 
So Lawnge/long (what), we hated 
Play it to this day it doesn't have to be debated 
If I played it as an ego 
With a final life and group ins 
On Lawnge (Never party poopin 
Scoopin while my loopin went in 
Rhymin I'm climbin check it out 
It's like this all the time) 
And I know (and I know) 
And I know (and I know) 
Black Sheep freak sweet styles 
Just like we're supposed ta 
Cause Dres will pull the wool 
Cause before Black Sheep made a poster 
Always liftin skirts 
Fore we ever made a t-shirt 
And we been leapin obstacles 
Before the game of Q-Bert 
Take this or that, both of that 
Lookin past the cat 
If she was playin possum 
Then they pull a rabbit from the hat 
Chorus 
Verse Three: 
Now rich man poor man 
Beggar-man thief 
If I were an engine 
I wouldn't be the chief 
You can play the chief 
But we be tipper tee-pees 
Cause money he don't owe me 
And honey she don't see me 
Chuckle at your belt buckle 
Whether or not I'm on the DL 
Expedition with permission 
If the mission were impossible 
Wouldn't be here dear 
Black Sheep droppin songs 
That last as long as Frigidaires 
Call me un-Dres Dres go Dre go 
Not to run it in the ground 
I gave the recipe to Prego 
Have to sell a million pounds 
The ya-yo, from Play-Doh 
Party the we started 
Runnin charted some 
Where? Over the rainbow 
Guess I suffer from see-are-S 
Cause I forgot em 
Lyrics I got em you need em you need em I got em 
Can't stand the fall 
My beeperis out of reach 
I mean the stakes are too high 
So I got to get each 
And every single solitary 
Ligit digit on my leg 
You're buggin cause we did ya 
You come and we get ya 
Clearin my eyes

Layin on ya I'm gonna I'm gonna lay it on ya 
Chorus",On the Wall,1992
Black Sheep,"It's the brown child, better version of the story
Sees Conji, a sister, mother played by Tori
In Astoria, kid named Tiki took the cake
The greens and the steak and the potatoes and the plate
Never a dummy, rejections are funny
First years of my life I thought that food stamps were money
So by ten I was the mess, got a men and then I had friend
So now I'm snatching pocket books with Sean Wilkinson
?Get that money, lil nigga' that's what they told me
I never sweated props cause like my pops they couldn't hold me
Until he found shorty's got it going on, rolling on
Who told? Damn, bendecion..
The Bland man, and my pop don't give a damn
The day I played with matches, took the stove to my hand
Hot temperature! He told me the players' version
The ego in submersion for the end of week excursion
Until I'm back, back on the scene
Like a ball on the green, giving strokes with my team
And despite the commentary pop told me, I'm lowly
And moms change-bank can't hold me, so
She don't scold me, she just grabs the belt
Knuckle the buckle, tells me all about the pain she felt
At the precinct when a pre-teen was spotted at the scene
Came up with the green, not a cop could intervene

[Mother]
Listen here, you little motherfucker
You ain't going to fuck with me
Got me coming to this damn precinct
Dammit, I'm a kick your motherfucking ass
Shit! You ain't going to drive me crazy

Now, happens Tori met Tom not too long ago
He was a nigga,, yo, he said  he had the flow though
He loved a bro, I know I didn't see you grow
To a TV show cause the nigga said we all could go
So I'm up and out of the ghetto, son of a gold miner
City-slicking Carolinian standing out like Ming china
A golden bull at heart though I moved around
The balls bounced to the bottom, settled at a small town
?Hey, boy! What's your name?!' First day, first fight
I'm out of New York and, boy, it don't sit right if you're white
Light were my steps from there
Did my dirt on the low, a Southern town nightmare
Cause the next year it was me and Ef on the furlough
We were the only Queens kids but there were other boroughs
With Rockwell, D-Ski, Ron Duke and Freddie
New York was represented like we danced for Rock Steady
Stan had tables and mics, every brother nice
Not only could we rip and rhyme but backspin and slice
With Paris and Foxy and Christina P's bust
You know them loud, raunchy, trouble-making niggas? That was us
A menace yet still I played tennis, ain't that cruddy
Advanced with the Reeboks, they called them ?cut buddies'
I hung with one, only one younger brother
Shorty Doo-Wop could cut and scratch up any other
Bigger than his size, was barely five feet
In ?83 broke beats that today rock streets
With no one to grade it, still never debated
Some saw and hated but they never contemplated
It was the wild child with foul styles, pal but not foul
A dis was never okay unless it came before corral
Pals of mine, peoples though were down
I graduate next week and, yo, next week I'm NY bound
Seven days from that one I'm leaving love that weighs a ton
I'm going to miss you niggas, yo, that rapping shit was crazy fun
But I'm leaving on the next bus
I've got your numbers and we'll keep in touch, I trust
Gliding, riding back to my domain
For love and money, fuck fame, my life will never be the same
As the next man's words, can you dig it?
I say I got a scheme, a-yo, I gots you figured

[Corner]
Yo, wassup, wassup. Is money out here?
Yo, I just got a call from that nigga Tiki
Remember that nigga Tiki?
He on his way from down South

My real pops was a pusher, when we left he had a section
So I keep it in the family, or at least I make connection
With the prime figures for affiliated support
In my purchase of cargo in the import and export
Flushing, Queens: back when junkies was the fiends
My childhood friends held buddha, had babies in dreams
I took pops off my shit list cause he had the fitness
To help Tiki get his, what the fuck, pop? Jehovah witness
What the fuck, pop? What's with the fizz-plop
I'm like, I can't put him down but the shit don't stop
Worked at a law firm, for lack of fear
I wrote a resume, spending words like a millionaire
>From there to the bank, see the bank's down the block
So now I'm close to home, I clock, I plot
With Popote, he's my cousin and a wily one
Though the kid was younger, quick like thunder
With the heart to put you under
Props even, the shit can't fail
I saw Reese, bagged with Pote and made a sale

[Co-Dee]
Go ahead, get that money
Get that money!
I ain't going to let nobody see you
I got your back, baby, I got your back
You want five? You only got two

On one late night, I had made a nice amount
More than two weeks pay, playing with the new accounts
So I rose like a petal, fuck pops, I run with thugs
Levis, Tims, hoodie, coat, skully, drugs
Fatigues before they were the fashion
Pockets with work and others with cash in
Thought I was cool with tools and mad trap
My pops was like ?read this? but I was like fuck that
So I jingle-jangled, clocked at every angle
Tiki's getting paid and his crew's star-spangled
And everyday, all day/night, yo, whatever
Niggas on the strip in sub-zero weather
Back before the first generation of fiends
My team was sheer cream, keeping dollar bills green
Fashion, Calvin cooler, playing Rick the Ruler
And I can't front on nobody cause I pulled on a woolah
Back in '86 ­ first, foremost and final
Rhyming on the corner, all I want to be's on vinyl
I bum rush and boom bash, not even for merit
Bounce out to see Reg and Joe down on Merrick
But mostly it's the strip that I played like a cock
On the block until the day I got knocked

[ VERSE 1: A.G. ]
I drop facts over tracks that go ratatatat
Fuck the red, white & blue, I'm with the black-black-black
You diss the brother Show, it makes me wonder
You put him to the test and watch the brother molest the SP-1200
Used to rhyme on calls and acapella
Now I'm doin shows forever, but I was always a 'goodfella'
You feel the wrath of the seven and a half
In that ass if you don't pass the microphone quick fast
Brothers been tryin to diss for years
As long as I'm respected by my peers
And get cheers - who the fuck cares?
Yeah, I'm weeded, but I'm undefeated
Niggas is heated because I'm makin a buck, yup, I succeeded
And ain't no time for no ego-trippin
Me and my homies are all for one, one for all, so let's see who's flippin
And I'm still with the brother Show
Whoever said that we broke up, they get the dick, and you can tell it's so
Showbiz & A.G. and Black Sheep

But they all end up r.i.p.
So nigga, pause, slow down, baby
Back the fuck up, nigga, you must be crazy

Black Sheep, ready to nova, I gotta get up and get over
Yo, Lisle, Lisle put a, put a little
Little bit of, bit of the layer on my voice, please?
Lawnge, what's up, we gonna do these drops or what
Yeah, and it goes a little something like..

[Dres]
The freelance designer, yo, yo come on let's get this shit going
Dres, the impeccable nigga's on the mic and flowing
For those who made the purchase or came out on the streets
Black Sheep, bow your heads cause we're about to break beats
City lights shining with the ill timing
My glare everywhere, don't stare cause my shit's blinding
I think, I think niggas best not blink
Cause they stink and I'm looking at 'em pretty in pink
With a passion, I want to put a gash in your ego
Your flavour's artificial, a goddamn placebo
Black, you can't believe it, you gotta dry heave it
Fake niggas can't achieve it, fake bitches can't be-weave it
From the streets of New York to where I be on the ladder
Fatter, got your bitch saying ""Baby, what's the matter?""
As a matter of fact, it's Dres the knuckle-dragger
With a fresh manicure so I got my cloak and dagger
I roam with the grifters, my game's ever true
My style's old skool like the new school review
I gets biz, on and on for days
And amaze with plays for non-gays, queens
Nah, fuck that! Queens, I ain't hushing
I'm crushing mafucks with a bumrush from Flushing
A member me, getting busy with GMC
Back when Rick was fresh and slick the nigga Doug E
Yeah, Tiki doing the freak, be	
Backtrack a bit before the baby beat me
Got more peoples than any seen in the video clip
And we was getting life's desires from a strip
Hand-to-handler, and the gambler
Give me the eggs, black, I'm the scrambler
You too, a mafucking lyric in a song
Helping that philly blunt shit catch on
Popote light the bat, pass the shit to AZ
Pass the shit to Lord, yo, Lord give the shit to me
Yo, Wild pass the shit to Skip, Skip roll another
The brother light's about to flip
It's buckwild Bland with the horrifying team:
Homicide, Cess, Doctor Sharjean
My nigga Black Ron, Steve O, Val, Amar, JR, Reese
Popo ­ peace!
Born to KE and all my peoples that be
But foremost, the whole fucking Vargas family
We wrote the scripts and the times were fit
Original New York, New Jack City type shit
Now we still we make moves only to different grooves, black
Sheep, in fact get back, it's simple as that this

[Chorus: Black Sheep]
Gotta get up, get up, gotta get over
I gotta get mine, yo, it's time to prevail
Gotta get up, get up, gotta get over
I paid my respect, the cheque's in the mail
Gotta get up, get up, gotta get over
I gotta come krill, yo, my skills won't fail
Gotta get up, get up, gotta get over
Been holding my breath, yo, it's time to exhale

[Mr Lawnge]
Back in the days of bullshit when I was a small guy
Taking the train home as I roamed but still I
Never had a clue of what I was going to do
To you, to you, and you, and you, and you too
Make the world jump, the girls hump, collect a lump
And make your speakers pump 'back on the scene
Crispy and clean' Yo, the rap title's redeemed
So you can save it for your next dream
Black Sheep is taking rap to the extreme
We got you coming back for more like a crack fiend
But now I stick with nothing but my own clique
I'm getting paid for what? Talking about my dick
It's my prerogative, sucker
Now you can tell your father that I'm the motherfucker
On the TV, no, you can't see me
Cause I'm on the DL, hiding from the industry
Niggas that be getting on my nerves
Trying to find the fucking beats that we preserve
See, I've been digging in the crates for a minute
Even my grandma's, believe I was up in it
Taking it, breaking it, trying it, flying it
I didn't have the money so, shit, I wasn't buying it
I had to take what I could get and be happy with
Not only records but clothes and food and shit
Niggas trying to get over on, niggas trying to get over on
Niggas trying to get over
That's why I stay refined, and never think about the other kind
Fake niggas trying to get mine
I had to hold my head despite what was being said
I used to wish that I had some lead
That I could buck off, but then I got my luck off
Away from Carolina, yo, I had to step the fuck off

It's cool .. that we create .. our mission

[Mista Lawnge]
Now, relax your body, your soul, let your mind be free
You know Mr Lawnge is hanging so come swing with me
Honey, I'll take you for a ride or better yet ride you
I love to be inside you, so peep the shit that I do
First I'll lick you from your pimples to your corns
Cause ain't no hoe perfect, that's only in the porns
Come with me and then watch me come
My tip's the only thing that'll make you say humm
Seven, six, five, four, three, twenty-one
Come on, big pussy, come and get some
Without haste, your time I won't waste
But if you want a taste bring your neck brace
I'm extremely long ­ slow down, you'll choke fast
Tip so big the Heimlich manoeuvre couldn't save your ass
Not to be bragging, your tonsils I'll be tagging
Yes, I'm going to use a bag and guaranteed to keep you gagging
So what's up, honey? No, you don't get no money
But I can tempt your tummy with the taste of nut and honey
The Sugar Dick Daddy can
If you do for me I'll do for you, a one-night stand
I'll hit you off, baby, shit I'm not selfish
But I brought a can of FDS in case I smell fish
With a flick of the tongue I can trim your hedge
I lick so much clit you'd think my name was Big Reg
Of course, I'll take you out and wine and dine you first
But, hold up! No drinks, I want to quench your thirst
Now why you blushing, baby, I see you coughing
Itching and scratching at your neck so very often
Tell Mr Lawnge your every need and I'll devote
No, you don't need a Luden or a Halls, I'll coat your throat
You can't deny so don't try to get fly
Or I'll just say bye-bye, you know why?

[Chorus x3: Slick Rick sample]
Cause it's cool when ya cause a cosy condition
That we create, cause that's our mission

[Dres]
Aww shit, girl, don't get me starting
I'll put you on your knees and grab your ears like you was Martin
Wet from Moet, she played the piper like a pal
What a great gal with a mouthful of Cristal
Cause honey saw me romping with the Legion
She wants to feel the pressure on her lower pelvic region
I'll do the things you wouldn't believe, I won't leave you falling
Like niggas that 'get it and come' like their mother's calling
Check it, I'll knee it, I'll feel it, I'll give it crazy joy
Cause I've been fantasising 'bout you since Ola Ray was in Playboy
No shit, I'm serious and I want to get physical
And leave you making noises like the sound of a busy call
On the phone, I'm nasty, be sure you wash your hands
Live, I'm playing condoms like it was a rubber band
Inside you, me, inside the plastic
You'll like it when I finish and your legs is acting spastic
Slow down, babes, I'll get a towel for a clean scene
And your uniform ­ honey, you made the team
Hip hip hooray to you, and all the same
Exercise and maintain for our next home game
Here's to all the bona fide with style
With lipstick on my boxers, I just think of you and smile
You buck wild child, thanks for the love, it's on
The sweaty steam roll, and thanks for not trying to touch my butthole
Now tell your girls I want them to meet my 'lil fren'

Black Sheep,"Yo, yo, yo, yo the Sheep are back, black
On the attack that fattens your format
And suckers have to backtrack, regroup, resign
As me and mine recline in shade

'Cause now we're getting paid like crime Krill
With the skill to kill while I'm on your will I'll
With the feel for what's real in my appeal
Why play me chummy if you really think

I'm crummy I caught your words and prep so long ago it isn't funny
Now I'm ready to riot until the state is in gas
If I wanted to dis you I'd play your shit and laugh
Huh, first mistake, choice when we gave it

Now put your plea on a deposit slip and save it
Second was the mic checking that you couldn't do
We step through just to get respect from your crew Third
I heard you're tense with the gat

All I got to say to that is, um
It's fat be the fourth parallel to your ism
Know the diff of disrespect and criticism
Five, I plead the fifth, I'm just plain live

I won't riff with the jive that the Sheep'll take a dive
We've arrived just in time and you'll discover
Only my mother, sister and son
Could come between me and my brother

Hey, yo It took a long time although niggas thought
We came out of the blue
A lot of punks slept but we always knew
That's why you pursue the two-man crew

To do the motherfucking job that you know a boy can't do
Like every aspect we cover: beats, rhymes and other
Nobody else down, yo, it's just me and my brother
Sheeit, back when the shit began, before there was a fan

We had the skills so we ran with my man Stan

It doesn't matter, boo, I'll make you scatter

Don't flatter 'cause I don't want your bitch nigga chit-chatter
I got stacks and stacks of fat tracks and wax
But you played yourself so don't even ask
And I won't remind you of the stupid shit you did and said

Out the side of your head when you were sleeping dead
And now I'm charging like a bull and you're red
That's why I'm pulling fucking files like a fed
Checking pros, doing shows wherever they goes

Getting hoes and foes but don't sleep on those bros

Because you're only as large as your last hit
We intimidate, niggas try to retaliate

Go on, guess your fate, cause it's your fucking guts

Cleaner no picture, clearly the victor, nigga, you seen me
With my man, no other mother could pull my brother
No way is it gay when I say we love one another
Uh, huh, run for cover cause you're coming on the block

We're the best in the flock, was you born a fucking cock?
Fuck your grade, our record play, man
It's like Jordan Rock it better than NASA
Or lock it tighter than the warden

Huh, according to some emcees, hating and to end all their jel
We selling now, fuck like 'Mister Wendal' Bendable plates
Expendable tapes we ain't Whitewash the Sheep
When you're wack, save your paint

No haps, chaps, you might as well shut your traps
The gap's too big, dig, dapple over the maps
Doing curls with girls and blowing like Reg Peep the slim slick
No hammer, smack 'em sledge grammar

Now, if you got it going on make some noise
Peace to all the real grimy ghetto girls and boys
In my neighbourhood , whether black or hispanic
Yo, this is some positive shit but please don't panic
You can still rock to it so flock to it
Just open your mind, unwind, recline or pop and lock to it
Come and rock with us, all night like Michael Jackson
Leave your guns and knives at home, black, that's all I'm asking
I'd like to go to jams and not see bullet sparks
So we can do some hip hop shows in public parks
A lot of the voters and promoters are scared of rap
But we can all come together clever and say bullcrap
Gotta get up, get up, gotta get over
I gotta wake niggas up like I'm down with Jehovah
Knock on a few heads and beg for some common sense
As I commence to convince, yo, I'm kind of tense
Cause niggas still want to buck wild and profile
They're fronting hard but ain't go no style
Steadily teaching my younger brothers to kill each other
I hate to have to break out my glock and teach another
Young soul about a bullet hole
For trying to play and sway me, acting hard like the videos

Now, To all the shorties in the world.
Listen up, That shit is just TV.
Far from reality.
And half the niggas you see on TV.
Are fronting, They ain't saying nothing.
So take your little ass, Somewhere.
And watch Barney or something.

Joy to the world, girls and boys, there comes a choice
To advocate bad ass, bet I did it before
My POs name is Jord, he let me go on tour
Where I'm from, yo, you might see a finger in the gutter
In the ghetto with toast, best believe my shit is butter
Got to have it long before this rap shit, get back, bitch
If I'm stuck up much like a bandit I crank shit
Niggas get reprimanded, remanded and then branded
I delve into myself to draw the strength to overstand it
So ill as I roll up on the block theory yot (??)
Keeping it real with ShowB-I, yeah, we build a lot
Yo, move your be	-you-t, the B/QE gets strong on the low
Giving a pound to Shorty Long, hop in the ride I gotta go
Gotta hit Queens, flying American, yo, Sammy, where's Troy?
Cleaning up on the streets, I goes there with my motherfucking boys
Shit's wrecked like grands in no time Astoria expands
Peace Russ, Jock, Tonto, but let me not forget Shamgod
My man since Holland Cove, making moves like Rucker
Live since one-oh-five, yo, it's Tiki motherfuckers
Jets to 'jects, I flex them cheques, my fam in the plan
And kick it to my cousins with some weed in my hand
Original bumrush was getting money on the hush, be	
Keeping it real forever with my peoples working OT
Back in the seven, pick up the celly now I'm dialling F in
Put the volume up on BringIt, Legion getting in a session
>From there to a Brucie tape, I'm almost on the fifth
An Uzi for my birthday, you know I shoot the gift
To a chickadee talking about she's wanting to get with me
Hey, I look up the block and see Lord kicking it with E
Hon's like ?I want you?, better believe me, baby's gonna got checked
I said ?My memory's bad, honey, I just fucking forget
Plus I've found my one love now, hon, I'm going to jet
And if we ain't playing Shaka we're catching power wrecks
Fucking it up in the BX, I see Chi flexing his dome
Good vibrations, rocking the nation as I represent my home

We like blowing up the spot
(Summa the time)
We're known for fronting, not
(Summa the time)
We give our shows all we got
Wreck the stage and lots play us
Like the sun because were hot, hot

[Dres]
It's Black Sheep, beep-beep, everybody on your feet
Catch the beat, sweet sweet, got you bopping down the street
Shorts to short-sets, shorties for short sex
Forties, my forte: butter fill and four Becks
That defines Dres, d-are-e-s, no further ado
I charcoal, broil and foil more than any barbecue
In the breeze like Lenin, listen when IÆm beginning
In Nueva York, better known as kings' dominion
We're back again, smacking beats across your head and back
And when you front I'l make you stand out like a fat African
Peace to all down South, I know it's hot as Hades
Love to all the fam-a-lam I scrambled in the Eighties
Now we're in the Nineties, as months go where the hour went
I stack mint and think of what? Black empowerment
I think wife, and black child to raise together
I think about the winter knowing nothing last forever
In this world things happen at the drop of a dime
Some things never happen at all, and yes yÆall

I'm slamming it in your court

I'm holding the for'ps, child please

[Mr Lawnge]
Some of the time I'm with my crew, some of the time I'm not
Bouncing down the block, blowing up the spot
But only when it's hot do I see nuff niggas looking at me
Displaying signs of jealousy, it means they're still Black With NV
I go by the name of the Sugar Dick Daddy Lawnge, ripping the song
Suckers see me, want to be me, but IÆm creamy and theyÆre dead wrong
To whom it may concern: yo, donÆt even try, kid
Because you couldn't see me even if I was your eyelid
 
When I rhyme for the summertime, believe I can
Bring more relief from grief than the Icy man
Be it your front yard, your stoop or porch
Like the Kackalackan sun, I'm guaranteed to scorch
I know it was about time we dropped the now, oh gosh
We got more niggas rolling up than even at the car wash
Yeah, we're here to tan that ass like the summer sun
For the nigga that tried to dis us, we know he's the dumber one
When you hear the Sheep are rocking be on the lookout
Cause we gather more hungry crowds than a cookout

For summer heat's sake
Listen to the fat beats we make
And chill on a summer break

[Dres]
It's the summer blitz, dips with pretty lips
Bros with or without doe flip for hits
Yo, microphone check one, be no other heap-topping
I rock a flock and mock, Sheep-Sheep rocking
Sonny, can you feel me? Honey, I be fly
Money making, really there's a ribbon in the sky
For One Love, I'm kicking my diction less the fiction
Non-believers thought me hiking and fishing
Now I spike them like a Viking
Wildstyle, like summer in Astoria
Way back my peoples made Ajax join the Warriors
Back when park jams found me trying to see the band
Until parties in the centre saw DJs as the man
A bird, a plane, feel the breeze changing lanes
I put a chill in your veins, even on a crowded train
IÆm cool, more cool than Morris dropping Time
-Less legit hits for some ones in ninety-nine
Since a long time ago, IÆm getting mine
Put the 'genuine' in genuine, son, I shine

I'm taking respect, do you copy?

Black Sheep,"[Mr Lawnge]
Ahh, shit! Get ready for the lyrical beat down
Go for your gat, nigga, you can catch a smack, clown
You think you get props, nope, you're in the wrong biz
Because the Sugar Dick Daddy Mr Lawnge is
Far from diesel but running shit like Eagle Beagle
I swing fast and kick ass like I was Steven Seagal
Sometimes I carry a glock and other times an eagle
And my dick's so damn big that shit should be illegal
Went from a fade to a 'fro to my bald cut
I run with real niggas now and the rest are butt
Your reign is over and you feel it deep within your gut
Now is the boogie down Bronx in the house or what?
When I strike I strike hard and you won't like that
And if I strike out my empire strikes back
My niggas who knock you, so I won't dock 'em, yo
I run deep as if my name was Jacque Cousteau
You're a petty punk, pussy nigga from PC
I'll pull your file, I'm buckwild like I'm from DC
You wanted a sequel not equal so here it comes
Now sit back as we run a train on your eardrums

[Chorus]
We boys! x3
We like here, yeah

[Molecules]
If it ain't rough it ain't nothing
Big man Cules raise up and then I start thumping
A nigga always into something, now back in the days
I used to sell the woolie-whoos when I was pumping
But now I'm bending mic stands and gripping mics
On some physical type of shit, the type of shit I like
The type of shit I like is this shit that my peoples' on
Molecules, Cee-Low, Smash, Dres and my nigga Lawnge
Now I kick the titles Black Sheep, the Legion
Yeah, you bitch ass niggas, we're coming to your precinct
I'm from the Bronx, I'm a gangster from the projects
Is where I live, peace to AG and Showbiz
Bounce around with G, Show, Dres and Lawnge
And the seven-thirty-five Is, yeah, we got it going on
We grown men, we're not fucking with toys
Like I said before, yo, we boys

[Chucky Smash]
Down with the Sheep, roll out the black carpet as we spark it
One, two, check it out, uh, right on target
Aim for the heart, yo, get ill cause we're real
(THE LEGION'S IN THE HOUSE!) You know the deal
You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't
No matter what you want, you better not front
Cause I'm the nigga that's chilling, I seem kind of quiet
And if you even try it then get ready for a riot
One love, one land, how you win?
I owe you nothing because I'm down to the end
The Bronx is the borough, niggas crazy thorough
I'm looking at the Sheep and it's like looking in the mirror
 
Reflection, twenty-four/seven, representing
Hardcore connection, now listen, now listen
Chucky, I feel lucky, got shit caught in the smash
Peace to Barkley, Pinell and Boombash, aight?
Posse with the thickness as we kick this
Can I get a witness, down with Showbiz-ness
Whatever, take it the way it should be taken
Faking backs breaking, but makes no mistake

[Chorus]
[Cee-Low]
Round up, round up, round up, 1,2,3
On the down low it's only see double E
L-O, I flow, I flow, I'll let you know
When it's time to catch wreck I catch wreck like an old pro
You might have seen me in a video, heard it on the radio
Rolling with the Sheep, now here we go
One of us bigger, the other small, we never fall
A zigga-zigga, like I said before I love them all
Family affair, by the Legion I swear
To rip up mic stands and tracks to shreds and show no fear
One love with the bang, riding with the zootie
Watch your cutie cause I rap just like a doobie
You know the time and you don't need a watch
Just take a view so we can rock it on your block
It's shocking and tick-tocking all around with my flock
Even if the beat drops me and my crew will never stop
You don't know you better just come on and get with it
Hanging with my boys and we're kicking it

[Dres]
With no tricks the fix comes with dope fiend precision
I exercise and extinguish an emcee exhibition
I explode and expose, extreme my extent
I exist to expand, not excess but excellent
Strength to be the solo representative for the scene
I be the booming bashing, clocking crazy cash yet come from Queens
Fly like Marvel, addictive like Genesis
And if it was a comic, kid, I'd be your arch-nemesis
Blowing up the spot every time that I show up
Grow up before you get toe from the flo' up
Old skool like elementary, Watson
I rocks on, I mocks none and you can't take my spot, son
The one hands above all the shit stains
So hit yourself in the ass, bitch, and give yourself some brains
Here for the record, for the log, for the scope
You can keep your props cause I don't want 'em no mo'
You can't kill my flow, now you know, no denying
That nigga Dres is def, ah hell, he's death-defying
No lying, been dummy since I well a fed me goya
Yo, I'm just nice like Just Ice rocked Latoya
Here to drop a hammer, make you hop to hip grammar
Hot damn, I rock a rugged rhyme from the corner of the slammer
Black Sheep, fab where fam be
Cause I love you and you love me, yeah

Black Sheep,"I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

Really doe, really doe, you's a really silly ho
To think that you could fuck with me then step to my bro
No, I don't think so, nor do I drink, so
That seems to me to be the reaction of a stank ho

How could you play yourself when I thought so much about you?
So now the sugar dick daddy's got to do without you
I guess I'll proceed to the next
I'm going to miss your eyes, your smile and, of course, the sex

From the very first day I met you, I didn't think I'd get you
That's why I didn't sweat you
I knew there was another because I saw you with him
Still you turned around, winked your eye and gave me rhythm

I said, ""Oh shit, it's time to get with it""
Pulled out my blade and your man's neck split
I grabbed you by the hand, he didn't understand
But I stepped off the scene just knowing I was the man

We enjoyed the date, also the night
Then I said to myself, ""Self, something ain't right""
Excuse me, miss, can you tell me what's the twist
It seems to be you're too promiscuous

She was wookin' pa nub in all the wrong faces
Wookin' pa nub in all the wrong places
Man, I didn't know what to think of you
When I found out you ran through my whole damn crew

Molecules, Cee-Low and Chucky Smash
Showbiz, AG and the whole Boombash
You hit them all off, it wasn't just me
And then I heard you boned Chi-Ali, damn

I said, ""Oh no, ho, you gots to go
But take my number though 'cause, yo, you never know""
See the way Mr Lawnge likes to play them
I only like to lay them around five a.m

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

Now, when I first saw ya I tried to ignore ya
'Cause niggas was playing you closer than rice and goya
Face like Halle, ass like Angina
Feet like Pebbles and cook like Aunt Jemima

Plus I hear that she's quick to bring a nigga to the brink
Beaver? Nah, believe her shit's all mink
She played the party scene like she had a death wish
And niggas crazy sweated her like she wrote the guest list

Out of sight, me and my peeps are getting solar
She walked by, I reached out and said, ""Yo, nola""
""That's not my name"", I said, ""I know, but anyway
Honey, take this number you can call me any day""

Quicksand, I didn't understand that she's a fan
Rather that honey wants more props than a kickstand
She'd told her friends what I told mine here
""I'mma knock that ass in due time, hear?""

She called the next day and I'm like, ""What's your occupation?""
The method in my madness was the same of operation
She was a po' ho, a hobo, a part-time boho so
Yo, for the ring, she's giving low blows

Schematic peeped, she came by to let me hammer her
She's looking right, damn, I should've hid the camera
She hit me off but, yo, it's my word
She got dropped by the first, picked up by the third

I lay down sleepy, that shit was crazy creepy
Rrring! I pick it up, this nigga's like, ""Somebody beep me?""
I'm feeling cheated, the shit shall never be repeated
Before I get defeated, yo, I'll beat it
'Cause I use steel-plated latex lately

And when they say 'downtown', yo, I stop at 42nd Street
'Cause to get laid many prices are paid
And I'm so 'noid I don't want a band-aid
I try to stay aware of the drama, it's crazy
Plus, see I got to tell your mama that I'm swayze

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
(Oh, it seems that you're a ho)
I had her, you had her, we had her
He had her, she had her, they had her
I don't want you no mo'

Cheers to the gigolos and the hoes
About to open up your nose 'cause that's the way my love flows
To every man that said he'll never get up in it
If I said that you could win it you'd be at my house in five minutes

The sugar's so sweet and if I let you get me in between the sheets
It's my beat, I'm telling you again and again
I don't get nasty with the men like I get nasty with the pen
People like to call girls that like men with money trash
But you's an ass if you don't like a nigga with cash

I don't really care, I like the big bucks
So if I gotta be trash, yo, fucking call a garbage truck
Love don't have a price but you gotta know the deal
I'm a tell it like it is 'cause I like to keep it real

When a man's broke he's got his hand on the trigger
But if his pockets got figures he ain't sweating the next nigga
I like a nigga that rolls strong, when I'm in the studio
Making songs, he's out making the pockets long

So peace to the niggas with wealth, niggas that go for self
'Cause I ain't fucking with nothing else

Black Sheep,"Verse One:

Dres --

Black Sheep, in your house, party people you remember
The two that served your whole crew like the bartender
It's dynamic D, don't you panic cause we won't stop
until hip-hop, is all it could be, now
You can't checks it when I flex it yo I wreck shhhh
You're turning me off like a naked anorexic
I gets, jazzy baby if you're blastin maybe you can
see me and Mista Lawnge to drop the flavor loops like Toucan

Lawnge --

It's the genuine, nine and then some
Rolling with the Sheep but yo we all can't come
Because the part be on that old strict clientele
Dissing more people at the door than Jessica and Miguel
Now if you're peeps of the Sheep then we'll let you in
But if you didn't buy my album then you're not my friend
I recommend you step back to the end
And watch me catch wreck like fat people breakin wind

Dres --

Black Sheep, we're mighty like Isis
My man, I slam nice, yes more fly than Shazam I am
Dres, D-are-E-S, roar without a floor
I pound clowns who walk on sound for encores
Me and my man since eighty-three, makin this fast buck
Act up and get broken when I'm open like a Mack truck
Slammin ya on camera like Gamera it's iller
Cause you never knew the Sheep could catch wreck like Godzilla

Chrous: Dres, Lawnge (repeat 2X)

Yo I can do it [can you do it can you turn the party out]
Ain't nuttin to it [can you make the people want to scream and shout]
Yeah I can do it [can you do it can you turn the party out]
Yo we can turn this party out [yeahhh, without a doubt]

Verse Two:

Lawnge --

Black Sheep, the definition, by now you should've known
It means wherever we rock the spot gets blown
So when you see is on a flyer, it should be your desire
To witness more wreck than a West coast fire
So be prepared to bounce jump around and all that
You don't have to ask Jack, you know where the party's at
It's uptown in the Boogie Down so don't sleep
On that Non Fiction hit by Black Sheep

Dres --

Be the be	-be	, L-L-L, L-A-see-K
S-H, double-E-P, and comin your way with A
dope styles be	 you can't compare
see-D, come move your ass like you're sittin in my chair
We glow like incense intense like suspense
Commence to rip the party people love nonsense, I
put the art in party with my padre, word to madre
I love deeper than that lady Sade

Lawnge --

Black Sheep, rips and represents, believe we do
Have more crews than in the days of L.Q.
Now let me tell you, what other suckers failed to
We open more doors than a carpenter puts nails through
I wish your style was copywritten, to have fake suckers quittin
because the Sheep style you're not gettin
Ya see we know, yo, we gotta stay original
Keep the Black Sheep flow and party til it's time to go

Chorus

Outro:

D - Now to the peeps in the back, if you're not the wack, say
[don't stop with the body rock]
L - Now all the people in the front, if you're ready to bump, say
[don't stop with the body rock]
D - Now in the middle we jangle jingle it ain't no riddle, say
[don't stop with the body rock]
L - Now to the people on the side, if you're black with pride, say

Where's the Black Sheep, here's the Black Sheep
Even if we wanted to the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that,
Because in fact, on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Ya know what I'm saying, yo Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this, or go with that with no delaying
See, in actuality, one be can it be,
I made it look easy, because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled, try to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat, and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls, and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat

Now you can get this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this yes, for this is kinda fat
If you get with that, then you will surly miss,
Because that is so wack, I think you'll get with this
For in the day in my life, or rather the life of my days
Never sweat the chaos, for Black Sheep has ways
Although, how shall I say it, take a point, convey it
Styling is quite Dolby, yes I know those for you play it
Not to be all that though all that is my goal
Stumble and fell, brother, like Dres would roll
Need a sexy honey for a twilight stroll
Gave up on sushi, give me an egg roll
At A & W, get to the Root, with a boot or sneaker
Get near a speaker, demo to a single
To the kind with a fly hoe, damned the scenario
And, pass the paper, cross the fader
Black Sheep getting played, like a Sony in a Beta
Dres the creator, of a style that is much greater

A long happy dream,
That kind of dream you don't wanna wake up from.

I had a dream,
I thought you were with me,
Let's move away where nothing can touch us.

I had a dream,
And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,
All the houses,
We have passed,
They follow us,
But nobody can catch us.

Here's my number call me direct, get no feedback 
No interviews, channel four, see me on the news 
Erase your message walk streets with my cellular phone 
Address you wonder, don't try to catch me home alone 
Up seven o'clock, while you trying to find me on my block 
I'm at the airport, you think I'm strange, boardin' the plane 
Turn off my pager, then quickly, relax my feet 
Hotel Onion drinkin' brew watchin' Sesame Street 
You thought you saw me with a wig on, at 7/11 
Disguised like Shakespeare with blue chrome behind your ear 
My George Washington robe, I still travel the globe 
On Pan-Am air flights, I roll in cities after midnight 
Stand in your lobby unsuspected, you get neglected

Order room service, transfer quick to Holiday Inn 
Check out time nine o'clock, coat on, I'm on again 
You comin' so wack you sound like the Bulworth soundtrack 
I'm in the mall steady shoppin' while you tryin' to call

You scratch your brain askin' neighbors what, now you wonder 

While you search lookin' deep in your Rolodex, I flex, I tell the truth 
When I'm serious you think I'm mysterious, drop rap in minutes 
Become your problem like Dennis the Menace 
Hold up your meetings papi, let's ? to the paparazzi 
Unseen heard of your magazine got the nerve of a two-year old crayon writing 
Talkin' to y'all I'm decidin' 
Communication leads one step to aggravation 
I got my ears closed, back to bookin' my own shoes

Black Sorrows,"I heard how all the lights went out in Memphis
On the death night anniversary of the king
The pretenders talking dirty in the palace
But it doesn't have that old familiar ring

I see there's been some changes in the valley
All the renegades have finally settled down
Now they worship in the temples of their rivals
And desecrate the holy heart of town

Can't you hear all those sweet voices singing
Takin' care of the chosen ones
Can't you hear all those mission bells ringin'
Say a prayer for the chosen ones

I read they're pourin' oil on troubled waters
Yet they cast a giant shadow on the land
Let's spend another night across the border
And bury all our secrets in the sand

They swear there is no master and his slave
But the future's lookin' dim for the lonesome cowboy

Is it the cat with the black shades, the black car?
Is it shining from very far, to where you are?
It is commonplace and different
Intimate and distant
Fresher than an infant

Star, on the rise, in the eyes of the masses
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Star's are bright, shining, hot balls of air

Black like my baby girl's stare
Black like the veil that the muslimina wear
Black like the planet that they fear, why they scared?
Black like the slave ship that later brought us here
Black like the cheeks that are roadways for tears
That leave black faces well traveled with years
Black like assassin cross hairs
Blacker than my granddaddy armchair
He never really got no time to chill there
Cause this life is warfare, warfare

Deep on the front lines, and blacks is all there

Black like faces at the bottom of the well

Like the prophet love Khadeja
Like I love my baby features
Like the creator love all creatures

Who acknowledge truth and peace seekers
We on point like heat seekers
Targeting the black marketing strategists
Run up on em with the heaters
Everybody following with no leaders
Feeling like we killing ourselves
Because I know they can't defeat us
It don't stop til we complete this, keep this fly
There's so much to life when you just stay Black and God

Blacker than the nighttime sky of Bed-Stuy in July
Blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie
Blacker than the middle of my eye
Black like feh-lah man cry
Some man wan ask ""Who am I?""
I simply reply, ""The U.N.I., V.E.R.S.A.L. Magnetic""
Work to respect the angelic, climb the mountaintop
And tell it til the valley's enveloped
You're full of big chat but you nah know me
I'm dark like the side of the moon you don't see
When the moon shine newly

You know who else is a Black Star?  (Who?)  Me
You know who else is a Black Star?  (Who?)  Me
You know who else is a Black Star, who we?  (And we)
Be shining and shining, when we rhyming and rhyming
We be shining and shining, when we rhyming and rhyming

Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It's the third eye vision, five side dimension
The 8th Light, is gonna shine bright tonight
It's the third eye vision, five side dimension

You know the light
Go from the dark
The other way is ass-backwards
It's absurd
Make you want to crow like a blackbird
That's right
You living from your first day to your last night
Sometimes you show your ass like
Lint on your clothes
When you froze in
The black light
Dead that
Before you get your head wrapped
Like Badu
We see through your voodoo
Just like Eve's Bayou, you dealing with that black magic
Try to civilize you
Not walk on by you
Like civil-(lies do get you black listed) it'll
Be unlucky for you like a black cat
A panther
Revolution is the answer
That's what we need
Greed plague my people like the cancer
True indeed

Now black people unite, and let's all get down
Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two

Black Star,"Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore Adidas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people was behaving like hip-hop was good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By a little Sha-tan and this is what he said
""Me and you kid we gonna make some cash
Jacking old beats and making the dash""
They jacked the beats, money came with ease
But son, he couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He jacked another and another, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder
Set some R&B over the track for ""Deep Cover"" (187!)
The kid got wild, started acting erratic
He said ""Yo, that presidential I got to have it""
With liquor in his belly son, he made up the track
But little did he know that his joints was wack
The shiny A&R said ""Great new hit, G!""
""Whenever you need a loop, yo come get me""
The kid got amped and he starts to figure
""I'mma get dough like all of these other niggas!""
So, he's in the studio working round the clock
For pop radio, jacked the beat to 'Planet Rock'
Was out in the street when he met this sister
Who couldn't sing for shh but the mix would assist her
Hooked up the track and in excitation
He decided he'd head for the radio station
But (What?) he was running and he made a left
Was skeezing at top speed and ran into Mos Def
I slowed the young man down and I started: ""Yo money
Yo, why you selling lies to our wives and children?""
He ran upstairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door then guess who he saw? (Who?)
Jane the chickenhead radio host
Who be yapping 'bout beef between east and west coast
He said ""This one's a bullet, you got to give it run!""
The chicken said ""Thanks"" and spanked it #1
He went outside, was getting props all over
Then he dipped into his ride, the 4-point Rover
Raced up the block doing 83
Some cats with Hennessey saw him at a R-E-D
He winked his eye like his star status mattered
They rat-a-tat-tatted to make his blood splatter
""You rocking crazy ice and all you do is cling static
And rolling out in Brooklyn late night is problematic""
His eyes was bloody red, he hung on every word they said
They told the kid ""Back down, that player shit is dead""
Deep in his heart, he knew he was gone
But he grabbed his .45 and decide to blaze on
With shades on founded had him astounded and
Before long the young man got surrounded
Those grabbed the guns, so goes the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
He was out chasing cream and the American dream
Trying to pretend the ends justify the means
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
It's just what comes to pass when you sell your ass
Life is more than what your hands can grasp
Good night!",Children's Story,1998

Say Black Star come to rock it non

Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
The whole and not the half of it, vocab and not the math of it
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
Me and Kweli close like, Bethlehem and Nazareth
After this you be pressing rewind on top your master disk
Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gatherin'
Connectin' like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenements
Cause all my Brooklyn residents, heavy regiments
Don't believe, here the evidence, where Brooklyn whoa
See that?  Bound to take it all kid, believe that
From where they sellin' tree at, to where the police be at
Talib Kweli e-Kweli-ty yo tell them where we be at

Brooklyn, New York City where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash we trust cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty
What a pity. Blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
Tree scents is dominant can't be covered with incense
My presence felt my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
People thinkin' MC is short hand for Mis Conception
Let me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion
That most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate
Walkin' the streets is like battlin', be careful with your body
You must know karate or think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituary
Third rate teacher readin' and talkin' about
""I knew he'd amount to nothin'""
Neighbors like, ""He was the quiet type
Who'd have thought they was frontin'?""
Talkin' and loud like you in RCA, get carted away
With body parts and treys, what a way to start your day
Yo it's like

One, two, three
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop, Y-O
I said one two three
It's kind of dangerous to be a emcee
They shot Tupac and Biggie
Too much violence in hip-hop, Y-O

I said Manhattan keep on makin' it (Bo!), Brooklyn keep on takin' it (Bo!)
So relax we're takin' it back, Redhook where we're livin' at
Plenty cats be strugglin' not hustlin' and bubblin'
It ain't about production and, what else we discussin'?
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
Strivin' for perfection ever since I was a snot-nosed
Colossal, true original B-boy apostle
Standin' on the rooftop with the, Zulu gestapo

You think you the shit
Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or click
Or some random kid you smoked Buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry without a history
Of spittin' the epitome, of stupidity, livin' my life
Expressin' my liberty, it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of e-Kweli-ty
People follow me and other cats they hear him flow
And assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano

Still sippin' wishin' well water, imported, from Pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all our believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot proceed us
In the jungle with the leaders we the lions you the cheaters
A cypher, will complete us if we come through your receivers
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
(Line for line) Good Jesus, Mos Def and Kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up, thinkin' we will ease up

One, two, three

YaknowwhatI'm sayin?
Really, to me

It's a Small Wonder, like Vicki, why I'm picky
These niggas suck like hickies
And still get to slip they shit in like Mickies
I'm sick of the hater-players, bring on the regulators
With the flavors like a farm team fucking with the majors
Like a river how I run through it, I do it so cold
Freezin up your bodily fluids, your style is old
You runnin your mouth, but don't really know what you be talkin about
You should retire, get that complimentary watch, be out!
Yo, with the quickness, so swift you miss this lyrical fitness
Now get this, these emcees wanna test me like litmus, bear witness
I'm like shot clocks, interstate cops, and blood clots
My point is, your flow gets stoped!
By all means, you need more practice, take that ass home
Everybody lookin at you, fish tank syndrome
In full effect, I stay catchin lyrical rep
And keep it blacker than the back of your neck
What you expect, emcees hollerin
Cause we developin the followin
Gettin played like stone love tapes and dollar vans
Order reverse your universe so your demise is first
Before your rise it gets worse
You need a night nurse like Gregory
Beggin me - stop it hurts! - is what you say to me
Like that's supposed to mean somethin?
You the one I seen frontin in the club
Your act I don't buy it, I got the dub
Come on everybody, come on just show your love

Visions occupy my synaptic space
Command and shape, to illustrate my mind's landscape
The tall grass, the low plains, the mountanous ridges
Thickets among the forests, rivers beneath the bridges
Presence of hilltops, lit up with tree tops
Eavesdrop; and hear the incline of sunshine, nine
Stones in orbit, refuse to forfeit
They all form a cipher, and they came to absorb it
I follow suit, and face it, embrace it
Shinin bright, but still I'm careful not to waste it
Destined to rise, because I'm basement adjacent
Spirit is still so just chill and be patient
Some heads approach like I'm the one to base with
Clowns about to scream and shout but don't say shh...
I ain't your student so I ain't to be tested
I'm majestic, I represent my strength without effort
My, method is unorthodox, but of course it rocks
My serious synopsis will drop kick, my topics
Run the gauntlets and galvanize the audience
I must represent, I don't come off with no corniness
It's all luminary, despite commentary
Some people say, Mos how you get so?
My sign will make you jump around like calypso
And, murmur to yourself like a schizo
There ain't no bottom on the ???

Come on
Here we go, Blackstar, hop on the Blackstar line
We bout to take y'all home
YaknowwhatImean? Here we go

We got all markets on lock
From meat to stock
Black Star, what? Throwin like Kid Rock in bars
Men flock to where we are, cause its the place to be
I grab my paint, jump on stage and deface emcees
We sell our souls like Spawn and come for the throne I sit upon
Freestyle or written songs, shit we can get it on!
Going back and forth, forth and back, all across the track
Passin the mic's like quarterbacks
Of course its phat, get off of that!
Reverse psychology got em scared to say when shit is whack
Out of fear of being called a hater, imagine that!
We ain't havin that reachin past the star status that you grabbin at
My battle raps blast your ass back to your natural habitat
So floss, cause what it costs ain't worth it to me
Cause I'm the one these Spice Girl emcees Wannabe
But they can't, ain't no points for effort, so why bother?
Cause your girl calls my name out like Clarence Carter
Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter!
(I be strokin, that's what I be doin)
Aiyyo, as we rock harder
And always drop the bona-fide head nodders

We keep it balanced with that knowledge of self, determination
It's hot, we be blowin the spots, with conversations
Come on let's smooth it out like Soul Sensation

We in the house like Japanese in Japan, or Koreans in Korea
Head to Philly and free Mumia with the Kujichagulia TRUE
Singin is swingin and writin is fightin, but what
They writin got us clashin like titans it's not excitin
No question, bein a black man is demandin
The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin

With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

Yes yes come on, yes yes
Knowledge Of Self is like life after death
With that you never worry about your last breath
Death comes, that's how I'm livin, it's the next days
The flesh goes underground, the book of life, flip the page
Yo they askin me how old, we livin the same age
I feel the rage of a million niggas locked inside a cage
At exactly which point do you start to realize
That life without knowledge is, death in disguise?
That's why, Knowledge Of Self is like life after death
Apply it, to your life, let destiny manifest
Different day, same confusion, we're gonna take this
Hip-hop shit and keep it movin, shed a little light
Now y'all bloomin like a flower with the power of the evident
Voices and drums original instruments
In the flesh presently presentin my representation

With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

The most important time in history is, NOW, the present
So count your blessings cause time can't define the essence
But you stressin over time and you follow the Roman calendar
These people into cloning like Gattaca, you can bet
They tryin to lock you down like Attica, the African diaspora
Represents strength in numbers, a giant can't slumber forever
I know you gotta get that cheddar whatever
Aiyyo I heard you twice the first time money, get it together
You must be History, you repeatin yourself out of the pages
You keepin yourself depleatin your spiritual wealth
That quick cash'll get your ass quick fast in houses of detention
Inner-city concentration camps where no one pays attention
Or mentions the ascension of death, til nothing's left
The young, gifted and Black are sprung addicted to crack
All my people where y'all at cause, y'all ain't here
And your hero's using your mind as a canvas to paint fear
With, broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration
You get out of jail with that Knowledge of Self determination
Stand in ovation, cause you put the Hue in Human
Cause and effect, effect everything you do
And that's why I got love in the face of hate
Hands steady so the lines in the mental illustration is straight
The thought you had don't even contemplate
Infinite like figure eight there's no escape..

From that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

Who think imitation is the highest form of flattery, actually
Don't be mad at me, I had to be the one to break it to you

Sinking they ship, like Moby Dick, did Ahab
Son I'm way past the minimum, enter a millennium
Where cats will hold a gat to your back, like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinian, try to ? the ?
Official b-boy gentlemen won't turn off at the interim
Born inside the winter one, day after December 10
These simpletons they mentioning the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon or danish rings by entammen
Rush up on adrenaline, and get they asses sent to them
(Gentlemen) you got tenement, well then assemble it!
Leave your unit trembling like herds of moving elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, SKIN possess melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddlin, making 'em woop
Like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me
The hot oppression rent who burn down your chief tepee

The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shining, like who on top of this?
People was tussling, arguing and bustling
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustling
I'm wrestling with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seeking what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript, yo
This ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living is preposterous
Stay alive, you play or die, no options, no Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless
With no conscience, back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing
You either make a way or stay sobbing
The shiny Apple is bruised but sweet and if you choose to eat
You could lose your teeth, many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative rose to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

Breathin in deep city breaths, sittin on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept
The beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin with one another
And ghetto birds where waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin visibly shaken
Taken them plungers, plungin to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure, cats is playin God
By havin children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets, swearin you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like, Mickey and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose, cause New York niggas
Actin spoiled at shows, to the winners the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife the Roman Empire state

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

Yo, on The Amen, Corner I stood lookin at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to heaven
In hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold war It's Chica-I-go for
What I know or, what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome listenin to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they bust strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord, but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin down the 'jects creatin plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my guy how he thought travellin the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
A reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
A reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
How the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Kiss the eyes goodbye I'm on the last train leaving",Respiration,1998
Black Star,"""Give me the fortune, keep the fame,"" said my man Louis
I agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie
I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye
He looked at me, he thought about it, was like, ""I'm clueless, why?""
The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so tomorrow coming later than usual
Waiting on someone to pity us while we finding beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil but I can't tell
You know what I mean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells, dollar bills
Or is it the mindstate that's ill?
Creating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal, what's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal they be reciting my quotes
While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought
That my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up, in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up, through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means, busting gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son, no vindication of manhood necessary

Not strong (Only aggressive)
Not free (We only licensed)
Not compassionate, only polite (Now who the nicest?)
Not good but well behaved

Illusions of oasis making you look twice

Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listening agree
That everything you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out running in place, chasing the style
Be a lot going on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be loving the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America, land of opportunity, mirages and camouflages
More than usually, speaking loudly
Saying nothing, you confusing me, you losing me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass
Walking the street, wondering who they be looking past
Looking gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on
Same song, just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht but they won't call it a slave ship
Strangeness, you don't control this, you barely hold this
Screaming ""brand new"", when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's, just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been running across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressing, there's never no in-between
We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens
The deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers, and short skirts
Long barrel automatics released in short bursts
The length of black life is treated with short worth
Get yours first, them other niggas secondary
That type of illing that be filling up the cemetery
This life is temporary but the soul is eternal
Separate the real from the lie, let me learn you
Not strong, only aggressive cause the power ain't directed
That's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
Not free, we only licensed, not live, we just exciting
Cause the captors own the masters to what we writing
Not compassionate, only polite, we well trained
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game
Not good, but well behaved cause the camera survey
Most of the things that we think, do or say
We chasing after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, next man meet with the grave/Great
I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy
I'm trying to live life in the sight of God's memory like that y'all

A lot of people don't understand the true criteria of things
Can't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence

My vocab expand like a rubber band
Walkin' naked through the motherland, give the finger to my brotherman
Niggas just don't understand my reasons, I transcend like season
And scar these rappers like Legion
It's treason, my suspension attract attention
I'm ventin', givin' these chickenheads detention
Did I mention my name, yo, go by the Jane Doe
Drenched in Polo, chill downtown in Soho
You don't know, this is just half my potential
Check my credentials, come harder than sequential
It's essential, you listen, I drive, you a pedestrian
They bless me on the track cuz I attack wit' the estrogen
Rhyme against the best a men, Jane burn it up
When you hear it in the whip, tell your man to turn it up!

Yo, we fortified live, supportin' allies
The wack is tryin' to shorten our lives, it sorta waters my eyes

The verse on that cassette you and cousin fought about
That led to God and Satan's fallin' out
Encourage the liquor for those who ain't here that you pourin' out
On 3-way, your parents, preacher and spouse called my house
Revive or ruin, my theories of mics
Sony or Aiwa, black or white, I fit in all stereotypes
Search for a cast to plot, I make you a laughin' stock
So shook, I could walk a half a block and feel the aftershocks
Rain of acid drops, seek some help
Now don't rewind, get it the first time
Shouldn't have to repeat myself
Eternally verbally, I have numbers, succumb to time outs
In rhyme bouts you'll dial 9, just to get a line out
Known fact or factors and non-rappers fractured
Results in more cast appearances than a hundred actors
Emcees I'm testin' like diseases injected in gerbils
Wordsworth, Kweli, Hi-Tek, Reflection Eternal what

My style highlights like fonts when I burn heads like a conk
Cause niggas front, when their chances get slim like Pharoahe Monch
Thinkin' they shits is heavy when they light like illumination
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
I'm comin' cleaner than vaccinations
My fascination with character assassination
Got these niggas burnin' like sensation
We keep it hot like matches and on lock like latches
Wack emcees get they microphones snatched like Lee patches
So YOU GO! To every wack muthafucka that you know (Scram)
My lyrics they get up in your jeans like Parasucos
So there's no mystery about the father, niggas is hot and bothered
Like the bitches that they are, takin' pictures with stars
And got 'em open, but after they little hopes and dreams get broken
Me and Hi-Tek, we live long and prosper like Vulcans
Think I'm jokin'? We both got sons, we make cream and break dreams
See through the fake schemes, wipin' your slate clean
Like a squeegee, we be lightin' shit up like phosphorus
Turnin' flamboyant niggas anonymous, depressin' to optimist
You stoppin' us is preposterous, like an androgynous misogynist
You pickin' the wrong time, steppin' to me when I'm in my prime like Optimus
Transformin', from rookie of the year to veteran
Hip-hop is big business like Con Edison or medicine
But fuck it, they gonna let us in, or else we rush the door
I got too many reasons, save your 'whys' and 'what fors'

This is twice inna lifetime so I'm lettin' you know (let 'em know yo!)

Lyrical com-pete and WE emcee
We got the fortified five, exhibit level degree

Check it
I keep dough in my pocket while you follow the false prophet
Get deep like Islamics wrapped in a white garment
I touch topics that try to open up your optics
Vacate in the Tropics, you dodgin' bullets in the projects
Cut the nonsense, I'm hotter than a lot of men
Start honorin', got more wifeys than Solomon
Fuck the squad you in, a-yo we be the biddomb
Regardless what I spit on, you worse with the tracks I shit on
Once you get on, it's fair you can't trust (Yes!)
Words & Punch, make rappers march like the third month
I build with friends, lyrically spit gems
Call me diamond, cuz I'm your girl's best friend
Emcees are born losers, alcoholic abusers
I'll go on the radio and start a gay rumor
And then I'll talk about how the crowd tried to boo ya
Label shoot ya, stressed out with brain tumors

Take it back to real rap, Krylons wit' the fat cap
Get robbed for your ASCAP, leave you inside
Fortified live, reppin' NY 'til I die!

The purpose is, make you go and purchase this, no nervousness

Superlative, you fabricated like the word absurditive
I'm rockin' this from here to where the Persians live
To Brooklyn where the merchants live
Next door to the murderers
And bourbon is a elder man's medicinal alternative
My memory is furnished with, back streets to back seats to fat Jeeps
Legendary athletes who play by the trash heap
My crew wasn't that deep, but beef we didn't act sweet
Treadin' on these stompin' grounds you better catch some black feet
Flashy, it was between DeKalb and Pulasky
Off the meter like an out of borough taxi
They run your pockets fastly, black and nasty, nappy and crafty
That's why they're either sittin' in Clinton or Coxsackie
Mayor Rudolph can screw off! You too soft to stop us
You and your coppers should see some foot doctors
Got your bird chest popped up, but keep your guns cocked up
Cuz all them cats that you knocked up ain't always gon' be locked up

And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
And in these times I need a saving grace
'Cause time is running out and I'm starting to lose my faith

But if I told you I loved you would it make you wanna stay
I'm sorry for the way I make you feel day after day
And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home to stay
Would it make you, make you wanna stay

My hearts on my sleeve but it's turning black
And without your touch I'm not gonna last
It feels like my walls are cavin' in
And I'll do anything to have you here again

But if I told you I loved you would it make you wanna stay
I'm sorry for the way I make you feel day after day
And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home to stay
Would it make you, make you wanna stay

The days are cold the nights are long
And I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want is to tell you I love you

And make you wanna stay
I'm sorry for the way I make you feel day after day
And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home to stay

The way you say, we'd always be together 
No matter what the weather

Knock three times on your coffin if you want my love
Twice on the pipe is the answer, answer is no

She'd smile and pretend to ignore them but she stored it all away

But we had fun
We danced a lot if you don't count all that stumbling.

Black Thought,"It's a frantic situation

Extra salty cause whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me
Out of snapping, my guy tried to talk me
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song
The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone
But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around
Day before I broke out, niggas was over my crib getting smoked out
No telling who had the place scoped out
Dot had brought over some niggas I didn't know
I'm asking who are you, they said I'm here with the Mo
If it was them, soon I'mma collide with them
And they better not be rocking no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car he would know
Now it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib?
They had a set of keys, but that I wasn't trying to believe
But I couldn't put it past him or them other bastards
It'd be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it
Cause whoever did ain't gon' admit it
The blunt and dirty dishes is my only exhibit
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind it might surface
Cause telling the law, Joe, is worthless

Fuck waiting under my skin, the situation is scraping
Somewhat like the girl X-rating
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacing
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breaking in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smoking weed
Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch, she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegetarian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story, she was sticking
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike
Chances of him breaking in, chilling and eating
Are about as slim as he is
Though I knew where he lived
In his house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we roll, I told the guy, turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck

Just tell me why. 
Don't lie to me man, just tell me why
It's the money, alright?
Just tell me why
It's the fucking money, alright?

Throw 'em in the yoke, BOOM!, then I knock 'em out
No doubt, Freddie Foxxx files 20-shot auto glock, blaow!

Sleep with' the fish-dips for yappin' too loud

Pickin' on the smallest victim gives 'em heart to kill

Besides of the largest, we polish the floor

I'm the epitome of catchin' wreck, catch you when you cash your check
Smash you when you pass then jack you for your fuckin' Lex

Hard-headed niggas better beware and fear like God said it

I gave you fair warning, beware

Ay-yo I warned you, now all niggas could do is mourn you
I'm born to kill and still thrilled, I put it on you
There's no regrets, remorse, only results and loneliness
Only the strong survivors strive through life as warriors
All of us die, some of us kill, even massacred
Who want to try? Punisher will if you ask for it
I'm hazardous for your health and hell's your next stop
For real my shit's cocked the world has just stopped

I'm not the one you should be underestimatin'
Come test your fate an' I guarantee I'll be under investigation
You can't handle the whole, I'll slam you on your skull
Or we can go blow for blow like Evander and Bowe, ya never know
However tho' I still hold the title
When all my rivals the chance to dance who missed the homicidal
Hand on the bible I swear to defend my crown
I've been around since forever and never let it touch the ground
Don't fuck around and catch a rude awakenin'
My crew's basically waitin' patiently for you to move your patrons in
Then we'll surround you, form Desert Storm and pound you

Bring yuh gal to de show mi posse may tek her
Then cake her, how we're flipping thoughts skipping
Ready for the sabotage while the entourage
Take her somewhere remote, got her open like a cargo pod
Our lyrics blend like camouflage
You be wondering what's happened like Rog

Yeah, son zoom like the moon
You and your whole cartoon platoon
Gets eradicated, y'all barely made it
Listen to the words of the man, now I'm hella faded
Now I'm elevated, and now I'm here to state it
Your entire empire is tired, why'all need to retire
Like an old player cause your flavor is now expired!

Come on, I rap wise and lyrically baptize, respect
Resurrect em like they're holy, holding blessed communion
Redesign laws of union in a revolution
Connect the eyes to energize cause evil lurks in lies
Steals your breath and then you die, no one heard you cry
Now he's off to the next man's urging eye

Like virgin we be conquering, reconstruct with surgery

Cover your ears, your clothes, your eyes then look alive

And kick emcees in they teeth with steel cleats

Have you screaming yelling, crew bail in

Blow like chemical contents, I exercise this convent
Who done this cause we did this, booked and fingerprinted
Unlimited turn, early bird catches the worm
My penicillin heals, taking turns we trying to burn
Rub me down like lubriderm, we the cure and you're the germ
Embalm you with the fluid, make you do it like sherm
Keep you up until the end of the term

Niggas green with envy like they had gamma treatment
Find it hard to compete with, I'm on some steep shit
Climbing, you're on it like Carlich Hymen (?)
My skills I always polish it up till it's shining
Like a brother with a brand new Lex
Rhymes on it like sporting two tecs
With laser lights make the red dot
Bring it your face while you're blinking

[Imani/Citizen Strange]
White white hot, thermal
Burn your shit down like a towering inferno
Selecting and connecting them peckish grooves
To make you move, move you all like you fall

Black Thought,"Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price
Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve 
Trapped in a belly of hell

Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo, anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him

They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll split your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it

They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, [yo]
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted [or what]

Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught
When you scream at it and do it
With sweat leaking from the outline of your solid
Don't understand the point that you at

Or how the hell you came to it?
Flashback to images of that night, out in Patterson
They pulled him over heading home from a gathering
And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him
Murder in the first for the champ, we on that again?

[Chorus]
Hurricane
Accuse a Hurricane
Ain't change a damned shame
It's life for Hurricane, Hurricane

Forever, imagine your locked down forever 
Could y'all stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
You tell me that you know the pain

Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine your locked down forever
Could ya'll stand the weather?
You built for that weather?

Yo, know what'm saying?
Know what'm saying?

You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
'What can become of kings and young kids?'

Summer dream deferred, incident occurred, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from

Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight,
Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising,
Developing his knack to write

Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world, detached himself
You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions

This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you

This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
Peace are you

[Chorus]

Yo, yo, forever, imagine your locked down forever 
Could y'all stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
You tell me that you know the pain

Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever and ever yo, locked down forever
Could you stand the weather?
Yo, yo I can't even explain the pain
Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

Yes, I am the inescapable, the irresistible,
The unnegotiable, the unchallenged [who dat?]
I am time
I scroll in measurements, control the elements,

I hold the evidence, I tell the story [say what?]
I am time
I know no prejudice, I bare no sentiments
For wealth or settlement, I move forward [who you?]

I am time
You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me,
Retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me,
You can't do much for me besides serve

Me well and have good dividends returned to you
Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me,
Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully

Plaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be,
Who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me
Angel's scribe the page for me,
Keep a full account of all the names for me
And make a special mark for Hurricane who (?) patiently

[Chorus]

Yo, yo, a Hurricane forever,
Imagine your locked down forever 
Could you stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?

I can't even explain the pain
Imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine your locked down forever and ever, ever
Could you hold it together?

Yo, can't explain the pain with words, know'm saying?
Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising

From out the south water, like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You can't believe the world we live in's injust
All I see is more proof, there's no place for us

They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control 
It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul

Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
There's no where to run, no where to hide
In a six-by-six a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

[Chorus]

Your locked down forever 
Could you stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
I can't even explain the pain, know'm saying?

Your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine behind bars forever
Could you stand the weather?
You built for that? Is you cut for that?

Don't be telling me that you know the pain
Your life was like a hurricane, yo

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind

Black Thought,"Two months prior you said you had a dire emergency
It was 1:30, my face was all dirty trying to get some sleep
Head still whirling, throw on my shearing leave my man home
Two dots yes I'm coming, yes my car is running, hang up my cell phone

By the time I arrived you was deep about five like you had beef
And then you tried to step and told me that I slept like you was cock deez
It was all about some niggaz that you thought was jigga
Who was digging me and I told you after that day we ain't cool baby, so

Whatcha think this a game ain't no bo dy playing
Thought I told you before, don't knock on my door
I was trying to be nice for your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

I was kinda thrown head was kinda blown but I'm not blue
Lost a couple friends once or twice before, I'm still cool
Then you tried to flex like you were the next bitch who you trying to fool
You just another girl from the avenue who graduated school

Now you wanna be down after you tried to clown me baby doll
But ain't no future in fronting and frontiers
Don't hang around with me at all
And now I make my music got me some new dick and I'm doing fine
And I'm still real ghetto and I still kick your black behind

Whatcha think this a game ain't nobody playing
Thought I told you before, don't knock on my door

Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

Yo, I'm ringing the phone two in the a.m. rudely awaken
Dreaming deep concentration hazy
She really couldn't peep what they was saying
At first all I know was Jag really wasn't playing at all

She left calming to speak to the John
Got the Jaguar double parked, blinkers is on
Head pulled back sneakers is on
Yo I don't know what sis told her
But she bout' to get a beatin' performed

She grabbing all up on her shirt tugging on her slacks
Jag tried to go in the grill I had to hold her back
Cool her out try to tell her to chill, lower the thermostat
You a star no need for you to stoop as low as that boy

Scrapping over men is best avoided
And a real lady would never confess to doing it
She said I'm ganstar don't let the dress confuse you
The only things sweet is the music, it's really not a game

Whatcha think this a game ain't no bo dy playing
Thought I told you before, don't knock on my door
I was trying to be nice for your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

Why I can't throw your clothes out the window
Every time I try to be strong and let you go
You start talking sweet to me like I was you ho

Tell me baby what you want with me, doing this to just embarrass me
Tell me who think you pimping boy when I'm the only one who brings you joy 
And I'm the one who keeps you stash, never make you spend the money you flash
Never ask you for a fucking thing, and you gave that bitch my diamond ring

I don't know why I try, to believe all your lies
Every time using me, why I act like you playing big deez
Why I still understand, you got more kids than you said you had man
Every time a new girl pops up, I guess I don't give enough

Every time you hurt me I don't know
Why I can't throw your clothes out the window
Every time I try to be strong and let you go
You start talking sweet to me like I was you ho

Tell me baby what you want from me, do you just want to embarrass me
Tell me why I let you steal my 
You don't know how bad it hurts me, when my niggaz laugh at me
I don't know what's keeping me but the sex ain't as good as it use to be so
I don't know why I still pay your bail and you deserve to be there
And every time that your?re broke, I pay you money just to leave me alone
Why I don't understand that you ain't no kind of man
Giving me grabbing my clothes, I guess I don't get enough

Every time you hurt me I don't know

And I build one of the sickest holding this still

Kweli, sittin' back in the cut like Reese
In a constant peace, call me fantastic like I cut the grease
Baracudas movin' and canoein sippin' amaretto
I'm a ruler of my temple, what I do to instrumentals
Instrumentals is the development of these niggas mentals
Tears in your eyes like this moment is sentimental
Your fundamentally floored, philosophically bored
Disturbed like the eighth floor of your hospital ward
You've GOT to appoint niggas to raise the bar
Muslims praise Allah, Christians praise the God
Rastas, they say Jah
They find a way to rhyme with the pallet like fine wine
And make you say ah
Guess who's back?
The game needed improvement
Can't fit the bullshit no more, you sound stupid
I'm a shark in the water with constant movement
Influenced by music since a truant yo

Black Thought,"Lyrically versatile
My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grased in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbred for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin' through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin' over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jasz shit I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin' up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin' Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetratin is void

Ya leave niggas missin' in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
[he heh ha ha ha] I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice
Nigga de Raw, never take a bad fall
Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin' handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin' on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin' a train honey dip and I'ma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin'
If you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?
Cause he know the time like I know the time
When I grab the microphone
It's like, summertime, laid back, to recline
In my La-Z-Boy chair

Black Thought,"Someone right now is leaving their apartment
Looking down at the street and wondering where their car went
Someone in a car is sitting at a signal
In front of a restaurant staring through the window at
Someone right now with their finger in their teeth
Who could use a little floss, right across the street
There's somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
But spent half the rent at a bar getting plastered
Now he's gotta walk fourteen blocks
Just to work at a shop where he's about to get fired
Someone right now is looking pretty tired 
Staring at a laptop trying to get inspired
As somebody living right across the street
Just wrote the best thing that she's written all week
But her best friend's coughing up blood in the sink
He can't even think what happened, feeling so confused
And he knows it looks bad but nothing he can do 
I wonder what it's like to be right there in his shoes but...

Yo, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom again
Tomorrow I'll be gone, I don't know when I'll be back
But in this world everything can change just like that...

Somebody right now is dropping his vote
Inside a box trying to not get shot in his throat
For the act of freedom, right now somebody's stuck in Iraq
Hoping that he gets shipped back breathing
In a war but he's not really sure the reasons
So we show our support when the press mislead him
Though we mourn, remain proud, salute the troops
Get some, I know you boys got some work to do

Meanwhile, right now someone's 25-to-life-ing
Standing on a corner with their thumb up hitchhiking
Scratching off a lotto ticket hoping for a real winner
Sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner
Right now someone wishes they were you and I
Instead of second-guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
But right now I'm staring out the window at a fiend
With holes in his arm and holes in his jeans
He pulled out a cigarette and sparked a light 
And walked right around the corner just out of my sight but...

I'm just taking it in
From a second storey hotel window again
The TV's on and my bags are packed
But in this world everything can change just like that

Yeah, right now somebody's sittin' in the darkness
Tryin' to figure how to put some heat in their apartment
But they got a little mattress, little carpet
And they appreciate it 'cause some people on a park bench
You see 'em rushing to get to the office
Wife ride by 'em when she up from the market
Right now somebody comin' out the pocket
Tryin' to dump that rock they runnin' round the block with
Same time the cops is raisin' the glock
With aim to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
Right now somebody's struggling to stop this man
That's kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors
Down the hall a child is takin' its first breath
The doctors ain't even passed him to the nurse yet
Yo, I wonder of he understand what it's worth yet
Life, the time spent while we here on the earth yet
The answers to the questions we all seek
Can be found, it depend on how free y'all think
Right now, it's somebody who ain't eat all week
That would kill for the shit you throw away in the street
I guess one man's trash is a next man's treasure
One man's pain is a next man's pleasure
One says infinity the next say forever
Right now everybody got to get it together man

I'm just taking it in
In another strange hotel lobby again
With my luggage on my back, I don't know where I'm at
I'm in a world where it all changes just like that
Like that 

Yo, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom again
Tomorrow I'll be gone, I don't know when I'll be back
But in this world everything can change just like that",Right Now,2005
Black Thought,"And yes y'all, you now rocking with the best
Black Thought from the legendary Roots crew in the flesh
I split up in here with the brothers from the Marley family
Creston--we gon' say it for y'all

She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke
Hey, she'd be laughing when there ain't no joke

Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was

Cause coke was a thing that once she first try
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
Now she's wondering who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar,
Like born to be wild but she sillier
Not quite the same, but she similar
A waste of my sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos, now she look hideous

Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Walks the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels than my tour suitcases
More male customers than Old Navy's
She love lime light more than John Swaby's
Seen more miles than a Rent-A-Avis
She don't slow down then someday maybe
She lost and can't find her way to safety

Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was

Check it out
She keep her head up in the space like a satellite
Because she got an insatiable appetite
For staying out late nights with all the parasites
Plotting on a way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she'd be back in line
Five minutes she stay on the move,
She'd done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up alone, she ain't even in tune
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use

She was pretty girl
Cleaner than the Board of Health
Studied and enjoyed herself, I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay'
And now she on the track, working while she wasting away
It's safe to say, she looking for a someplace to stay
Who ever got a little paper to play
Can get a slice of this

Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was

For no reason a seasoned splif was the first thing
One spring season while she's out flirting
Now she season in and don't need rehearsing
Esteem get a beating, life is uncertain
Ego need feeding, now the wants worsen
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiending, swearing and cursing
Behind the curtains, she's really hurting
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer dem grin and cook the rocks down
And she without sin will spark the first stone
The feeling kicks in she's in the dark zone
Old friends walk pass going 'bout their own
As if she is someone that they don't know
Then the King of Kings lift her off the floor
Saying, ""Life is a thing when you learn you grow.""

Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was

She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
I doubt she a-go mek it too far

She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
Mi wonder how she mek it so far",Pimpa's Paradise,2005
