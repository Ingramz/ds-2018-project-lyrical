Alana Davis,"I've seen suckers loose themselves in the games they learn to play, 
Children love to sing but then their voices slowly fade away. 
People always take a step away from what is true, 
That's why I like you around, 
I want you. 
Yeah you do... you make me want you. 
An open invitation to the dance, 
Happenstance set the vibe that we are in, 
No apology because my urge is genuine, 
And the mystery of your rhythm is so feminine. 
Here I am and I want to take a hit, 
Of your scent and it bit, 
So deep into my soul, 
I want you. 
You do you do, you make me want you. 
Send me all your vampires, 
And I can't get enough, 
And I can't get enough, 
The village church yard is filled with bones weeping in the grave, 
The silver lining of clouds shines on people Jesus couldn't save, 
You want to know how deeply my soul goes, Deeper than bones, 
I want you, 
And I can't get enough. 
After we did it by the window sill, 
Smoke rings drift into the midnight sky, 
presently in the quilt that your mother made, 
And a candle burns to fight off the gloom, 
I said to live in this way is not for the meek, 
but you talk real soft and kiss me on the cheek. 
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep, 
There will be no regrets when the worms come, 
And they will surely come. 
You do you do, I want you, 
Send me all your vampires, 
I want you 

",I Want You,2001
Alana Davis,"I've lived my life beside an ocean
And every day I drown emotions with the tide
And no one's ever asked me why
Guess I'm silly to waste my time

I reach and stretch too far to measure
And I break myself to keep together all the time
It's a struggle to be kind
In a world that seems so blind

Before I grow too old to seize the day
Before I spread my wings and fly away
I'd like to get to see my heart at play
And see if love can't save the day
What if it's the only way
Can we save the day

Aside from my faith there is no glory
And aside from the truth there is no story anymore
We're all soldiers in the war
But tell me what are we fighting for

Feels like we've been here forever
As I break myself to keep together and apart
From a way that eats my heart
I don't know how it got so hard

Before I grow too old to seize the day
Before I spread my wings and fly away
I'd like to get to feel my heart at play
See if love can't save the day
What if it's the only way
Can we save the day?

",Save the Day,2001
Alana Davis,"Hey brother, tell me what it is 
Do you think you might forget yourself if you forgive 
You don't answer, so long since you did 
Am I wasting time just waiting to find out 
The answers behind how you live 

Hey sister, do you like this place 
Don't it seem it all revolves around a pretty face 
Don't lose your amazing grace 
And keep in control of you heart and your soul 
Which no one will ever replace 

Somewhere under the rainbow 
There's sunlight maybe a sprinkle of gold... 

Hey genius, tell me what you see 
Is it everyone around this girl or is it just me 
Your martyr, I will never be 
Because I'm willing to fight for all of the rights 
You've wrongfully taken from me 

And somewhere under the rainbow 
There's sunlight maybe a sprinkle of gold 
I've been waiting, seems like a lifetime 
For someone to take all this rain off my mind 

Mmm hmm... 

Hey Jesus, do you hear my prayer 
I've been waiting forever for you to tell me that you care 
I'm lonely and it don't seem fair 
I was hoping that you would tell me you do 
Have a way out of all this despair...",Under the Rainbow,2001
Alana Davis,"I don't know when you became king of my dreams
I only know when you go that everything around me
falls apart at the seams
I've never known someone so much like me
Yet you're your own and parts of you
remain a sweet mystery
And I am falling
Falling into a dream
And you you are calling
Calling to be your queen
All the world is a stage when you're around
Everyone's acting their parts but nothing is real like
this love that I've found
With you my baby
And when you lift me up there's no coming down
I get so high I could float on a feather like a fairy crown
And I am falling...
The willows howls as the lazy sleep
And the lucky stars fall away as they weep",When You Became King,2001

Wanna hear it pumping, the beat is on fire
Burn it up
It's hot up in this party tonight
You're so fly, that's why they call us all the way up
Get your hands up, all the way up
Turn it up

Your nails and toes are painted (Fly)
Hair's done, just right, ain't it
It's the third outfit and counting (Come on)
The beat is pumping, we're bouncing our heads
Clothes piled in a mountain beside the bed (Why)
'Cause we don't wanna clean them up
We wanna dance instead (You're cool)

I see white and yellow lights (stars)
That are flashing behind my girls (Come on)
Who see earth is blue and green, 'cause they're out of this world
My lipstick is red, I'm rocking black jeans (Come on)
And we're all superstars when we roll up on the scene (Come on)

Going crazy through the bags, that we got when we was shopping (You're right)
My lip gloss is poppin', the party is non-stoppin' (Come on)
Blowing kisses to the boys, everybody making noise (Ow!)
It's the party of the year happening right here (Come on)

I see white and yellow lights (stars)
That are flashing behind a fellow (stars)
And my girl in green tights that he wants to say hello to (Hello)
His face was all red, her mascara is blue
He said, ""Aren't you the prettiest girl in the room?""

Head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure

Alana Grace,"Can I ask you a question please
Promise you won't laugh at me
Honestly I'm standing here
Afraid I'll be betrayed.
As twisted as it seems, I only fear love when it's in my dreams
So let in the morning light and let the darkness fade away

Can you turn my black roses red?
Can you turn my black roses red?

Drowning in my loneliness
How long must I hold my breath
So much emptiness inside I could fill the deepest sea
I reach to the sky as the moon looks on
My one last year has come and gone
Time to let your love rain down on me

Can you turn my black roses red? (x3)
'Cause
I'm feelin like I'll blame it on love (x6)

Alana Watson,"Sometimes I don't know where we're going,
Sometimes I feel you should be crawling back to me,
Time is ticking by without us knowing
Before you know it, it will be too late to see

You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all

Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while

Here can you handle this?
Did you think about your bills, you ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're going to die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?

A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying

Best friend with benefits

I've never wanted something rational

Party boy, you're just a party boy
Ain't no time for sleepin' 'cause you're misbehavin'
Party boy, you're just a party boy
Wake up soon and open your eyes
The time has come to see the light

This world of yours turning upside down
Goin' up and down like a merry-go-round
A rumor goin' on right across the town
Why can't you see it?

I gave you love like you never knew
And you're givin' me nothing but an attitude
And now I'm gonna give a bit of solitude
I'll miss you, baby, oh
Misbehavin' now I'll miss ya

Ow, you're just a party, party, party boy
Yeah, oh baby
You're just a party, party, party boy
I've got to say to you so you listen
Hey boy a goodbye

Party boy, you're just a party boy
Ain't no time for sleepin' 'cause you're misbehavin'
Party boy, you're just a party boy
Wake up soon and open your eyes

Alanis Morissette,"You got a plastic name and a plastic heart
You can play the game or you'll never start
I'm talkin' to you
You got a plastic house and a plastic fence
Gotta look around or you'll lose your friends
Am I gettin' through?

You got a plastic girl in a plastic bed
And she's in your house made of gingerbread
And you're in there too
Got a plastic smile on a plastic face
But it's underneath that you can't erase
But what can you do-do-do?

CHORUS:
Say Love-it's not that hard after all
(tell me what I want, what I wanna hear)
When everybody does
Say Love-it's gonna tear down the walls
(tell me what I want, what I wanna hear)
If everybody loves

You live in a plastic dream through a plastic card
But reality you don't disregard
You know that it's true
You got a plastic goal in a plastic life
Gotta search your soul gotta make it right
And here's what you do-do-do

CHORUS

Wake up in the morin'
Some are not sleepin' tight
A matter you've been ignorin'
Why can't you just say it?
Will not wait forever
Can't you see I'm right
I want you to endeavor
To tell me again and again!

Alanis Morissette,"Standing there on a road that leads to anywhere
Like a child left in the wilderness, standing there penniless
Wanting to be the best

Here's a place where life runs at a different pace
Where love is just convenient, none are obedient
And we are subservient

Look at me, I'm a girl that some may preconceive
Why do they try and generalize, why are they antagonizing me
But something I can't control that...

CHORUS:
I WANTCHA
You know I'll never stop 'til I've GOTCHA
You'll never be quite the same when I ROCK YA
I'm not the kind of girl that you thought I was
You'll have a good time 'cause I WANTCHA
I'm breaking down the walls 'till I have you, feel you
Show you the time of your life

Here we are and I wonder how we've come this far
In a world that does not recognize women are victimized
What does that symbolize

Why do I want the things I usually criticize
It may be self destructiveness, or maybe it's emptiness inside
But something I can't control that...

CHORUS

You'll have a good time...
It's a lonely road, and no one knows the way that I feel
I'm not giving up now... I'll never try to justify
They'll never understand, you'll be a happy man
You'll have the time of your life

It's something, it's something, it's something that I can't control
The time of your life...

So you were banished and you wonder why you're so hypersensitive

How can you just throw words around like grieve and heal and mourn

I've got a loving supportive wife who doesn't know how involved she should get
You say his interjecting was him just calling me on my shit?

Just the other day my sweet daughter I was driving past 203 I walked up the stars in my minds eyes
I remember how they would creak loudly
She was only responsive with a drink he was only responsive by photo
I was only trying to be the best big brother I could

I've walked sometimes confused sometimes ready to crack open wide
Sometimes indignant sometimes raw
Can you imagine I pay him 75 dollars an hour sometimes
It feels like highway robbery
And sometimes it's peanuts
I wish it could last a couple more hours

So here we both are battling similar demons (not coincidentally)
You see in getting beyond knowing it solely intellectually you're not relinquishing your majestry
You are wise you are warm you are courageous you are big
And I love you more now than I ever have in my whole life",The Couch,1998
Alanis Morissette,"(I know he's blood but you can still turn him away you
Don't owe him anything)

Do you go to the dungeon?
To find out how to make peace with your days in the dungeon
Writing a letter to you didn't make me feel any more peaceful than how I felt when we weren't speaking
Because I didn't cop to what I did
I can't love you because we're supposed to have professional boundaries.
I'd like you to be schooled and in awe
As though you were kissed by god full on the lips

[Chorus]
I'm in the front row
The front row with popcorn
I get to see you
See you, close up

(I'm too tired to recount the
Unpleasantries one by one
Minute I want to banish you
The next I want to be on
A deserted island with you along with my three favorite CDs
Ambivalent yet in your
Bed we've yet to acknowledge what really happened)

Slid into the ditch
I have this overwhelming loss of ambition
We said let's name thirty good reasons
Why we shouldn't be together
I started by saying things like ""you smoke"" ""you live in new jersey""
You started saying things like ""you belong to the world""
All of which could have been easily refuted
But the conversation was hypothetical
I am totally short of breath for you
Why can't you shut your stuff off

[Chorus]

(and I laughed until my lungs hurt
I love how you bust my chops
You don't always feel seen sometimes you feel erasable
Unfortunately I cannot reciprocate in my current state
I think we should be careful of how much time we spend together)

For a while while I'm speaking
To you know how much you hate to be interrupted, maybe spend some time alone
Fill up your proverbial cup so that it doesn't always have to be about you
I've been wanting your undivided attention
I like the fact that you're nothing like me
Are you not burdened by the lack of perspective people have of your charmed life seemingly

[Chorus]

(you never meant to be ungrateful
Nor held up to be whipped or wept for certainly not analyzed
Prodded at more ways than one
Apparently you've been misrepresented
Dealing with the concept of arrows being
Slung towards your outrageous fortune)

Hey I'm not mad at you guardian
I'm mad at myself for spending so much time with you and your Jekyll and Hydeness
I'm glad I figuratively slapped you on the wrist
You laughed a wicked laugh and said ""come here let me clip your wings!""
(I know he's blood but you can still turn him away you
Don't owe him anything)
""raise the roof"" he yelled ""yeah raise the roof!"" I yelled back
(unfortunately you needed a health scare to reprioritize.)
No thanks to the soap box
Having me rile against them
Won't make an ounce of difference

[Chorus]

(oh the things I've done for you
Many a stitch a friend
A man's been left for you
Oh the books I've read for you
The tongues I've bitten for you
Many a new city for you
Many a risk taken for you
Not a single regret)",Front Row,1998

You are the original exemplary 
How seen were you actually? 
How revered were you (honestly) at the time?

Where was your ally your partner in feminine crime? 

Oh mother who'd your buddy? 
Oh mother who'd got your back?

The heart of the house 
All hail the goddess! 

You were ""good o!"" 
You were ""count on 'er 'til four am""

It was cold,
We were shivering, yet warmed by the subject matter.

My wife is in the next room,
We've been having troubles you know,
Please don't tell her or anyone,
But I need to talk to somebody.

You said, wouldn't it be a shame if I knew how great I was
Five minutes before I died? Id be filled with such regret
Before I took my last breath.
And I said, you're willing to tell me this now, and you're not going to die
Anytime soon.
And I said I haven't been eating chicken,
Or meat,
Or anything.

And you said yes, but you've been wearing leather and laughed and said
Were at the top of the food chain.
And yes you're still a fine woman,
And I cringed.

I was hoping,
I was hoping we could heal each other.
I was hoping,
I was hoping we could be raw together.

We left the restaurant where the head waiter (in his 60s), said
good bye, sir. thank you for your business sir. you're successful and
Established, sir, and we like the frequency with which you dine here sir. and
Your money.
And when I walked by, they said thank you too dear.
I was all pigtails and cords.
And there was a day when I would've said something like,
hey dude, I could buy and sell this place, so kiss it.
I too once thought I was owed something.

I was hoping,
I was hoping we could challenge each other.
I was hoping,
I was hoping we could crack each other up.

I too thought that when proved wrong, I lost somehow.
I too thought life was cruel.
Its a cycle, really.
You think I'm withdrawing and guilt tripping you.
I think you're insensitive and I don't feel heard.

And I said do you believe we are fundamentally judgmental?
Fundamentally evil?
And you said yes.
And I said do you believe in revenge, in right or wrong, good or bad?
And you said well, what about the man that I saw handcuffed in the emergency
Room,
Bleeding after beating his kid, and she threw a shoe at his head.
I think what he did was wrong, and I wouldn't have had a hard time feeling
Compassion for him.
I had to watch my tone for fear of having you feel judged.

I was hoping we could dance together.
I was hoping,
I was hoping we could be creamy together.",I Was Hoping,1998

Your mom, my friend
Left a message on my machine

Saying you were talking crazy.

That you wanted to do away with yourself.

They are panicked

If we were our culture,
If we were our leaders,
If we were our denials,

I remember vividly a day years ago,
We were camping.
You knew more than you thought you should know.
You said I don't want ever to be brainwashed
And you were mind boggling, you were intense.
You were uncomfortable in your own skin.
You were thirsty,
But mostly you were beautiful.

If we were our name tags,
If we were our rejections,
If we were our outcomes,
Id be joining you.

If we were our indignities,
If we were our successes,
If we were our emotions,
Id be joining you.

You and I, were like four year olds.
We want to know why, and how come about everything.
We want to reveal ourselves at will, and speak our minds.
And never talk small talk and be intuitive,
And question mightily, and find God my tortured beacon.

We need to find like-minded companions.

If we were their condemnations,
If we were their projections,
If we were our paranoia's, Id be joining you.

If we were our incomes,
If we were our obsessions,
If we were our afflictions, Id be joining you.

We need a really good memory.

I'm sorry to myself
For treating me worse than I would anybody else

Well, I wonder which crime is the biggest?
Forgetting you or forgetting myself
Had I heeded the wisdom of the latter
I would've naturally loved the former

For ignoring you: my highest voices
For smiling when my strife was all too obvious
For being so disassociated from my body
And for not letting go when it would've been the kindest thing

To whom do I owe the biggest apology?
No one's been crueler than I've been to me

And
I'm sorry to myself
My apologies begin here before everybody else

Alanis Morissette,"How to stay paralyzed by fear of abandonment
How to defer to men in solvable predicaments 
How to control someone to be a carbon copy of you
How to have that not work and have them run away from you

How to keep people at arms-length and never get too close
How to mistrust the ones you supposedly love the most
How to pretend you're fine and don't need help from anyone
How to feel worthless unless you're serving or helping someone

In the course of a lifetime, you'll never forget
I'll show you how to in 8 easy steps
I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best

How to hate women when you're supposed to be a feminist
How to play all biased when you're really a hypocrite
How to hate God when you're a prayer and a spiritualist
How to sabotage your fantasies by fear of success

I've been practicing my ass off
I've been training my whole life for this moment, I swear to you
Culminating just to be this well-versed leader before you

How to lie to yourself and thereby to everyone else
How to keep smiling when you're thinking of killing yourself

Oh, thank you, much thanks for this birds eye view
Oh, thank you for your most generous triggers

It'd have to give up knowing
And give up being right
You inadvertent hero
You angel in disguise

Now I see the madness in me
It's brought out in the presence of you
And now I know the madness lives on
When you're not in the room

Though I'd love to blame you for all I wish
I miss these moments of opportune
You simply brought this madness to light
And I should thank you

Oh, thank you, much thanks for this birds eye view
Oh, thank you for your most generous triggers",Madness,2008
Alanis Morissette,"I've never been this accountable-less and within
I've never known focuslessness on any form

I've never had this lack of ache for dalliance
To let go and let God in ways I have never even imagined

[Chorus]
I declare a moratorium on things relationship
I declare a respite from the toils of liaison
I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement
I declare a full time out from all things commitment

I've never let my grasp soften fingers like this
I've never been careless other-less like autonomy's twin

[Chorus]

Stop looking outside
Stop searching in corners of rooms

For now I'm faking it

On fire on tequila, oh

My friends and I meet hours before
We make some home made pizza
We do some funny bits back and forth
My knees buckle I laugh so hard

We might end three sheets to wind
And who knows where we'll wind up
All I know is there's a car waiting
And we'll figure that out after

I have to keep my eye
On my old friend from high school
We've known each other for the longest time
She has trouble with her dance so to speak

In the butt when she's excited

Then there's my other pretty friend from high school
The predator in me is put to shame by the predator in her
And now I've reeled it in
It'll be interesting to see how much she's done as well

Then there's my friend from Chicago
God do I love all people from Chicago
All ready to light up the barbecue
And be harping on debauchery

Bring on the tequila, oh
On fire on tequila, oh
Mostest most on tequila, oh
Bestest friends on tequila, oh

Then there's my Canadian friend
What a fabulous mom she's become
She's been tortured in this sense
For the last many of months for obvious reasons

She was like ""Hey, where was this part of you
When I wasn't pregnant""
I laughed and did a shot in her honor
As I conversed with her belly

Bring on the tequila, oh
On fire on tequila, oh
Mostest most on tequila, oh
Bestest friends on tequila, oh

Then there's my Cupid friend
She sure knows how to dress that one
She's a wise and worldly girl
But you gotta watch that medication

My favorite beverage is taken
To a whole other level on it
I'm not worried about it
Or I'll coast around the room
While I trust she'll temper

My brother came to visit me
And now he's used to hanging with me and cracking up
But he had no idea about my built up tolerance
No idea about how manipulative I've become

I would surreptitiously put it in front of him
Without him asking
In a pretty little shot glass
His smirk and cackle would only egg me on

Would steely forge ahead

And me so much better for trusting you

Keep hindrances at bay

How I'm moved to meet you
Untouched I do remain

To some it seems foreign why I
Would steely forge ahead
This land entrusted to me knows
Not of hallowed secrets

Your charm can not distract me from
The path I'm born to tread

How I'm thrilled to know you
Unaffected I remain
How I've learned to like you
Undeterred I do remain

Less daunting as team
You unlikely king by my side
And me so much better for trusting you

Keep hindrances at bay

I don't like to dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart you see

Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while

All around, all around

Why are you so petrified of silence?
Here can you handle this?
Did you think about your bills, you ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're going to die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?

And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer

And all I really want is some peace man

And all I really want is a wavelength, ah
And all I really want is some comfort

It's better to let the feelings die, when they're holding you down

Comin' from the same place, two of a kind
Brought up on the wrong side of a one track mind
Whenever we're together baby,
We're as bad as we can be
Lookin' at you baby, is the dark side of me

There's two sides to every story
For every shame there's a glory
And I've tried to keep a balance
Between the dark and the light
But something don't add up
When I'm with you, how can two wrongs feel so right
Feel so right

Well it's a one way conversation between you and I
You ask all the right questions and need no reply

It keeps on getting harder to connect
If this is not a war between the sexes
Well then some kind of hex is in effect

The ones we used to call the happy couple
Have given up on romance altogether
How that perfect one could come undone
Looks like love's in for a run of nasty weather

Lines are down, streets are redded
Pipes cracked, apartments gutted
The tough are gettin' goin', 'cause the goin's gettin' tough
Everybody's breakin' up

It seems we've come upon some kind of impasse
An ending to this fractured fairy tale
What once upon a time were little home sweet homes
Are now just houses up for sale

Streets ahush, a grim reminder
No lovers laughter, no organ grinder
He's out of work, the monkey run off with the cup
Seems like everybody's breakin' up

He vanished, like July.

Hush now, we'll make it alright.
She's framed by the front porch light.
Uh huh, suspicion, raising up like dragonflies.
They say there's a story to tell,
Buried in the family well.

Now the congregation prays.
Save us from our evil ways.

Fed up with the landlord comin' down my door 
With his poison gaze 
I've stared out his window and I've walked the floor

Verse III: 
The last of the ramblin' boys has lost his way 
In these broken times 
They sold off your story and they stole your rage 
With this heart of mine 

They pulled you from your sleep and they covered up your name 
Now on Sundays they pray to see you again

Of all my weaknesses

Buried deep inside your eyes

And when the winds of change have broken baby
Every battle, every bough
Will your anger be unspoken
On the twilight of this vow

Alannah Myles,"It seems we're headed for a total breakdown
It keeps on getting harder to connect
If this is not a war between the sexes
Well then some kind of hex is in effect

The ones we used to call the happy couple
Have given up on romance altogether
How that perfect one could come undone
Looks like love's in for a run of nasty weather

Lines are down, streets are redded
Pipes cracked, apartments gutted
The tough are gettin' goin', 'cause the goin's gettin' tough
Everybody's breakin' up

It seems we've come upon some kind of impasse
An ending to this fractured fairy tale
What once upon a time were little home sweet homes
Are now just houses up for sale

Streets ahush, a grim reminder
No lovers laughter, no organ grinder
He's out of work, the monkey run off with the cup
Seems like everybody's breakin' up

Seven year itch, or mid-life crisis
We're comin' unhitched, goin' back to old vices

Alannah Myles,"Love will abide, taking things in stride
Sounds like good advice, but there's no one at my side
And time washes clean, love's wound unseen
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means

Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make him mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time

Caught in my fears, blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me, when you never let me near
And I never drew, one response from you
All the while you failed all of the girls you never knew

Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make him mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me
For a long, long time

Wait for the day, you'll go away
Not that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of loss, who knows the cost
Living in the memory of a love that never was

Cause I've done everything I know
To try and change your mind
And I think I'm gonna miss you
For a long, long time

Yes I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you

Alannah Myles,"See the tramp coming up the strip with the a hundred dollar smile
Sparks flying off her finger tips, driving a young cunt wild
Some nights, I'm wound so tight, like a storm about to break
Better stand in a doorway when everything starts to shake
You get restless, like a cat waking up at midnight
Hungry, never quite satisfied
This is our world, and these are our times
This is our world, and these are our times
Layer other like a street god, with a drop-dead attitude
Scenes looking like a shadow now, and I know I'm being fooled
Sometimes I'm wound so tight like a wave about crash
Hard times seem to multiply, but the joy runs out so fast
You get restless, like a kid crawling out of a bad dream
Hungry, never quite satisfied
This is our world, and these are our times
This is our world, and these are our times

This is our world, and these are our times

He's got two black eyes, and a bitter heart
And a bone hanging on a chain
These times, like dynamite
A head on history
Some fools gonna bed it all down
And don't care about you and me
You get desperate, like a child in the eye of a nightmare
Hungry, never quite satisfied

You make me feel like I'm a star on your sleeve
The way you hold me it's so wild and sweet
And Sonny say we will, go walking down by the ocean
Cause the night can get so still, and lovers they can get the notion
The street is crazy with the summer heat

Would you be the mystery in my eyes
I'll consent to marry you if you never lie
And I wonder what would happen if I smiled
Looking for a sign in the eyes of love

Waiting for an answer from the stars above
Would you be my story when there's nothing left to tell
I wonder what would happen if I fell
Would you be the rocking horse I ride

Listens at the wall, for a sign of life
Closing her eyes as the room fades away
Counting the chimes in the church of our savior ringing out

To faces in the crowd

Simon drives this town, works a graveyard Sunday
Esther flags him down, doesn't speak a word
He hums to himself as the streets disappear
He catches himself looking back in the mirror filled with doubt

Two faces in the crowd

On the ferry from Dover to Calais
Arm in arm on a windswept day
I've got a photo of them sailing away

Mother's so pretty, father's so proud

I stop to count the chimes, an orphan in the shadows
So little left behind, so much I'll never know

There's no secrets I must hide

If I bare my soul, can you accept it all?
My darkest corner's safe behind a wall

Trying to keep my heart on track
The embers turned to flame and I want you back

Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where,

And the dew wets me still

Lord Gregory, let me in!

Lord Gregory's not here and
Henceforth can't be seen
For he's gone to bonny Scotland
For to bring home his new queen
So leave now these windows
And likewise this hall
For it's deep in the sea
You should hide your downfall

Who'll shoe my babe's little feet?
Who'll put gloves on her hand?
Who will tie my babe's middle
With a long linen band?
Who'll comb my babe's yellow hair
With an ivory comb?
Who will be my babe's father
Till Lord Gregory comes home?

Do you remember, love Gregory
That night in Callander
Where we changed pocket handkerchiefs
And me against my will?
For yours was pure linen, love
And mine but coarse cloth
For yours cost a guinea, love
And mine but one groat

Do you remember, love Gregory
That night in Callander
Where we changed rings on our fingers
And me against my will?
For yours was pure silver, love
And mine was but tin
For yours cost a guinea, love
And mine but one cent

And my curse on you, Mother
My curse being sore!
Sure, I dreamed the girl I love
Came a-knocking at my door

Sleep down you foolish son
Sleep down and sleep on
For it's long ago that weary girl
Lies drownin' in the sea

Well go saddle me the black horse
The brown, and the gray
Go saddle me the best horse
In my stable to-day!
And I'll range over mountains
Over valleys so wide
Till I find the girl I love
And I'll lay by her side",Lord Gregory,2001

Alaska Thunderfuck,"My name is Alaska Thunderfuck and I have something to say

I like black tea, I like black D
I never touched Tina, and that's the T
I know I'm what's the T, I said that I don't drink
So you bitches probably don't even know what to think
When you see me in the club gettin' crunk
Acting stupid, getting drunk
I got a hundred problems, drinkin' ain't one
I tried to quit drinking but it's too much fun
I keep it cute and I act my age
And you're never ever gonna see me drunk on stage
It's a new dawn, it's a new age
Metallica, turn the page
Turn the page, turn the page
Chun Li; Streets of Rage
I smashed some pumpkins, rat in a cage
Let's pay women an equal wage
No seriously
What the fuck

Now let's talk about my exes
I cheated on Sharon with a guy in Texas
I'm just kidding he was really in Florida
But what the fuck fucking rhymes with Florida?
We were good together but we're better apart
And I learned a lot from that broken heart
Sharon and Chad, I'm happy for you
Cerrone the Cat I fucking miss you boo
Now every breakup turned out so well
I put a lot of really nice guys through some fucked up hell
But then there was this one guy
Girl
And if you have Reddit, you probably know all about this already
Uh

This psycho ex got heavy handed
Tried to Death Star my whole fucking planet
Talkin' shit, droppin' names
Screen cappin', playin' games
I've had it, officially!
The bitch tried to really really come for me!
He crossed me like the River Styx
But the sex was good 'cause I like small dicks

I'm not mad, I'm not pressed
The money's on the dresser, get dressed
To the twunk ass messes in the meet and greet
Tryna treat a Ru Girl like a piece of meat, ow!
You're spillin' my dress bitch!
You think you're a fan, but you're only a mess, bitch!
Real fans? I fucking love you
I'd lay myself down on the train tracks for you
In fact, I made this fucking record for you
Call me Delano, 'cause I Adore you (Oh)

Yeah, you (yeah)
Specifically (oh)

The AAA Girls went bankrupt morally
Willam met some models and serviced them orally
He's probably on his way to replace us quick
Just like he fucking did to Detox and Vic
Michelle always told me not to fuck with cliques
Michelle always told me not to fuck with cliques!
Oh, yeah, that reminds me about that thing
The secret I've been hiding like a ding-a-ling
I did some challenges, I won a few
Oh, yeah, that's a thing called All Stars 2
I can't blame you Adore
They went in really harsh that first day
And if it had been me in your position, who knows?
I might've done the same thing

I'm just lucky, I guess, I feel blessed, but I'm stressed
I wanna be the best, I just wanna be the best
A hundred thousand dollars, it ain't that much
To fuck up your mind and all your friends that you trust
I'm sorry Coco, I'm sorry Tatianna
I'm sorry mom, I wanna smoke some marijuana

Down by the Green River where Paradise lay

To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

May the windows be wide open
To let the breezes blow through
May that wind be the very spirit
That lifts my prayers to You

May I always love You
Always love You
May I always love You
Always

May my faith remain a mystery
Something so real that I cannot touch
May patience be as strong as silence
Praying ,You'll give me, give me this much

Let trust be a wild beast
The lion beside which I'll lie down
And He comes to me so gently
A broken king with a royal crown

May I always love You
Always love You
May I always love You
Always

May our weeping turn to fits of laughter
May His pleasure be the treasure we're after
May hope take root like a mighty oak
Bracing itself in the snow
Knowing spring will come the Promised Son
Warming the earth and letting us grow

May I always love You
Always love You
May I always love You
Always

May I always love You
Always love You
May I always love You
Always

Tu ronca maldición maleva
Tu lágrima de ron me lleva
Hacia el hondo bajo fondo
Donde el barro se subleva
Ya sé, no me digas tenes razón
La vida es una herida absurda
Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más

Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido
Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Ma perchè questa notte
Alle ore più lunghe
Che non passano mai

Ma perchè ogni minuto
Dura un'eternità

Quando il sole tornerà 
E nel sole io verrò da te
Un'altro uomo troverai in me
E che non può più fare a meno di te

Quando il sole tornerà 
E nel sole io verrò da te
Amore amore corri incontro a me
E la notte non verrà mai più

Ma perchè
Ma perchè I miei pensieri
Sono sempre gli stessi 
E non cambiano mai

Ma perchè anche il silenzio
Sta parlandomi di te

Quando il sole tornerà 
E nel sole io verrò da te
Amore amore corri incontro a me
E la notte non verrà mai più

I had forty-five dollars when I enter
When I left I had one dime

Wasn't she a beer drinkin' woman?
Don't ya know, man don't ya know?

She said, darlin' I know you're not through
I said, yes, baby doll
And the trophy belongs to you

Wasn't she a beer drinkin' woman?
Don't you know, man don't you know?

Pick up on me a Collins mix
Went to the bar an' ordered me a drink
Tried to relax myself

Looked around and saw two soul sisters
They were sippin' sodas
And the other look caught their companions
On the dance floor
They were doin' the Collin's shuffle

Pretty soon a cute little number
Came and asked me to do the stomp polka
I told her I couldn't do the stomp polka
I could show her how to do the Sissy1

We were on the dance floor
And I was doin' my thing
After a while out of nowhere
Up walks her boyfriend
While she's standin' there doin' the shivers and shake

He gave me a look that was very icy blue
And believe me, he made me thaw out!
I said to myself, ""Albert, don't lose your cool""

By that time I'd gotten hungry
'Cause I smelled someone cookin' catfish
Oughta be something along, with some greens
Told him definitely, I didn't want no leftovers!

The cook took so long about fixin' my grub
I had to go see what was takin' him so long
He was back there jivin'
I had to tell him to get it together

Made me mad, I said, ""No man, I ain't got time,
I've got to keep on pushin',
I got to make it down the soul road,
Got to go, do some turnin' on""

And believe me, he made me thaw out!

Oughta be something along, with some greens
Told him definitely, I didn't want no leftovers!

I tossed and I turned
That old feeling's still the same
It was so real, I woke up cold and sweating
I wonder did I call her name?

In the dream she was right there with me
Right there with me in the bed
She said, ""Bobby, come and kiss me""
""Never leave me"" is what she said
But when I reached out to hold her
Oh, I woke my wife instead

Once again, once again, I had the dream
Six years since I've seen her
Ain't no doubt about what it means, no, no
I tried hard not to think about her
But all she left me was this dream

All she left me was the dream
All she left me was a dream

All she left me was the dream

I dreamed I called her name

I dreamed I held my baby in my arms

Oh, what a dream

Albert Collins,"Last night once again I had the dream
I tossed and I turned
That old feeling's still the same
It was so real, I woke up cold and sweating
I wonder did I call her name?

In the dream she was right there with me
Right there with me in the bed
She said, ""Bobby, come and kiss me""
""Never leave me"" is what she said
But when I reached out to hold her
Oh, I woke my wife instead

Once again, once again, I had the dream
Six years since I've seen her
Ain't no doubt about what it means, no, no
I tried hard not to think about her
But all she left me was this dream

All she left me was the dream
All she left me was a dream

A dream

All she left me was the dream

I dreamed I called her name

I dreamed I held my baby in my arms

Oh, what a dream

Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of the law

Albert Hague,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,1959

I wonder how it died?

Because they're dying gradually
From the waste from the factories

And in time the riverbanks will die
The reeds will wilt and the ducks won't fly
There'll be a tear in the otter's eye down by the river
The banks will soon be black and dead
And where the otter raised his head
Will be a clean
White skull instead

My mother works for charity whenever she can,
They're both good clean Americans who abide by the law,
They both stick up for liberty, they both support the law,
My happiness was paid for when they laid their money down,
For Summers in a Summer camp, and Winters in the town,
My future in the system was talked about and planned,
But I gave it up for music and the free electric band

The school was big and newly built and filled with light and air,
And the teacher taught his values that we had to learn to keep,
And he clipped the ear of many idle kid who went to sleep,
My father organized for me a college in the East, 
But I went to California, the sun-shine and the beach,
My parents and my lecturers could never understand,
Why I gave it up for music and the free electric band

Well, they used to sit and speculate upon their son's career,
A lawyer or a doctor or a civil engineer,
Just give me bread and water, put a guitar in my hand,
'Cause all I need is music and the free electric band

Yes, and we learned about her body, but her mind we didn't know,
Until the brutal attitudes and morals began to show,
She wanted to get married, even thopugh she never said,
But I knew her well enough by now to see inside her head,

I'm tryin' to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team dies
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky

While the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies
It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up

Il y a des villes tristes
Où les pauvres touristes
Font des nez longs comme ça
D'vant les monuments.
Ils s'ennuient en visite
Et désirent vite vite
Partir pour des lieux plus charmants.
Mais moi qui ne trouve pas les musées amusants
Mais moi qui fus toujours enn'mi des monuments
J'connais une ville charmante, féodale, familière
Qui joint la jeune gaieté au goût des vieilles pierres.

Refrain

Joyeuse cité
Celle de Carcassonne
Hiver comme été
Enfants et grandes personnes
Ils vont danser l'be-bop
Et c'est gentil comme tout
Devant ces vieux murs
Mon cœur en frissonne,
Au lieu des armures
Des airs de jazz résonnent
Ils vont danser l'be-bop et c'est un succès fou.
Dans les donjons, y a des trombones heureux
Qui soufflent des chansons pour les cœurs amoureux
Et jusqu'au fond des vieux mâchicoulis

On entend, jour et nuit,
Des cris, des cris…
Joyeuse cité

Enfants et grandes personnes,

Parfois une valse tendre
Le soir se fait entendre
On la danse à trois temps pas pour longtemps.
Le style de cette danse
Malgré son élégance
Déplaît à tous les habitants
Mais moi qui suis comme eux, qui n'aime pas les trois temps
Qui préfère c'est curieux les airs de notre temps
Je trouve à Carcassonne la joie de tout mon être
Et quand je suis là-bas je sens mon cœur renaître.

Et pour les garçons

Y joue des chansons d'amour
Et pour vingt cents on peut entendre
Un baryton à voix tendre

	Coda

Les oiseaux sont couchés dans leur nid
Et moi je suis couché dans mon lit
Il fait froid ce soir il fait nuit
Alors tendrement je dis :
Bonne nuit bonne nuit Suzy
Bonne nuit bonne nuit Suzy
Suzy oh oui bien sûr
Certainement oui bonne nuit
Bonne nuit
Suzy jolie… euh…
Bonne nuit

(C'est une chanson qui s'appelle
« Bonne nuit Suzy »)

Albert Lasry,"Dans les rues de Québec

Depuis l'automne que de villes parcourues
Que de boulevards et de rues
New York ô régularité
Chicago si joli l'été
Mais au cœur du joyeux hiver
C'est les rues de Québec que je préfère

Dans les rues de Québec
Par temps gris par temps sec
J'aime aller nez au vent
Cœur joyeux en rêvant
Bien des gens me sourient
En pensant à Paris
Moi j'ouvre un large bec
Pour sourire à Québec
Au loin le Saint-Laurent roule ses flots d'argent
Et les bateaux vont doucement sur l'onde à la ronde
Les fumées du matin sont fantômes de satin
Dans les rues de Québec.

Sur la lande chemine
Une gamine
C'est la fille du facteur
Elle a mon cœur
On voit courir près d'elle
Son chien fidèle
Qu'il est beau qu'il est bon !
Il fait des bonds
Et tout ça je le vois
De la fenêtre d'en haut
De la fenêtre du grenier
Où je vais étudier
Pour observer la vie
Et ses folies
C'est très intéressant
De voir les passants

On voit la salle des fêtes
La sous-préfète
Y donne un bal paré
Paré masqué
Oui mais à la sortie
Tombe la pluie
On voit courir les masques
Dans la bourrasque
Et tout ça je le vois
De la fenêtre d'en haut
De la fenêtre du grenier
Où je vais étudier
Le soleil qui s'attarde
Dans la mansarde
Allume ce vieux bandit
Des incendies

C'est l'heure du potage
Les enfants sages
En mangent à satiété
Des assiettées
C'est l'heure des familles
Et des charmilles
C'est l'heure du fricot

Dure depuis longtemps
Depuis tant tant d'étés
Depuis tant de printemps
Que jamais rien n'y change

Albert Lasry,"Coiffé d'un large sombrero
Vêtu d'une veste à carreaux
Et chaussé de bottes légères
Hier dans une boîte de nuit
On vit arriver seul sans bruit
Un homme d'allure étrangère
Ses yeux avaient des reflets verts
C'était le reflet des pelouses
Sa voix avait un timbre clair
Il avait un accent de Toulouse
Un peu plus tard quand il sortit
En donnant son ticket d'vestiaire
La dame du vestiaire lui dit
Cette phrase très singulière

Monsieur, Monsieur
Vous oubliez votre cheval
Ne laissez pas ici cet animal

Il y serait vraiment trop mal
Monsieur, Monsieur, pour un pur-sang dans un vestiaire
C'est triste de passer la nuit entière
Sans même coucher dans un' litière
Comme il s'ennuyait
Et comme il bâillait
Je chantais pour qu'il soit sage
Comme il avait faim
Qu'j'n'avais plus d'pain
J'y ai donné un peu d'potage
Monsieur, Monsieur
Chose pareille est anormale
Ne laissez pas ici cet animal
Vous oubliez votre cheval

Cinquante ans plus tard le jockey
À ses p'tits enfants expliquait
Des aventures invraisemblables
Il avait un sourire amer
Et comme il se croyait loup d'mer
Il jurait et crachait à table
Tout en mâchonnant un mégot
Il y allait de son bavardage
Il ne parlait que de cargos
De tempêtes et d'abordages
Mais les p'tits enfants pas dupés
Montrant un tableau qui s'effrite
S'écriaient ""Grand-père, ce beau pré""
""C'est-y la mer ou Maisons-Laffitte!""

Stands to reason I've got to leave you alone.
What are you taking me for?

Tryin'a do?
I told him 'bout my baby and he let me go, thanks a lot
I got invited to a party at a high class hollywood pool
There were women all around me, man I began to drool

Down in the Tennessee Hills
Ain’t no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain’t no telephone bills

Half bear, the other half cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that

Rocky top, you’ll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top

Once two strangers climbed on Rocky Top
Lookin’ for a moonshine still
Strangers ain’t come down from Rocky Top
Reckon they never will

Corn won’t grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt’s too rocky by far
That’s why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

Trapped like a duck in a pen

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide and with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed but I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide

I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around I will always be around

And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper

There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five but I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide and with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed but I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around I will always be around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide and when I reach the other side
I will find a place to rest my spirit if I can perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain but I will remain and I will be back again",Highwayman,2007

Have you come to raise the dead

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

Albert Mangelsdorff,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Albert Mangelsdorff,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2006

Albert Moraleda,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Parece una eternidad

1. Y'a des gens qui font des chansons,
Sur l'milieu
Ah ! quel' rigolade !
Y sav'nt pas, comment nous vivons,
Et balanc'nt sur nous des salades.
J'en ai fait, une à ma façon,
Et j'vous l'dis sans fanfaronnade
Ça n'casse rien.
Mais l'air est très bien.
Et vous chant'rez tous au refrain
La valse à Dédé de Montmartre
Au son d'l'accordéon.
Vous donn' le grand frisson.
La valse à Dédé de Montmartre
On la fait deux à deux
Et les yeux dans les yeux
La valse à Déde de Montmartre
C'est la danse d'amour qui nous grise toujours.
Dans tous les musett's on la tourne sans frais.
C'est la vraie,
Mais la vraie,
Vraie de vraie.

2. Entre nous on est d'bons bourgeois
Notre rêv' c'est d'pouvoir sur terre.
En planquer, un peu chaque mois,
Pour s'tirer viv'ment des affaires !
Dans un bled, avoir son chez soi,
Vivre enfin comm' des millionnaires
Entre poteaux.
Boir' son apéro,
Et l'soir, chanter au bord de l'eau.",Dédé de Montmartre,1995
Albert Préjean,"Voici, contée sur une valse musette,
L'histoire en quelques mots
Du beau roman d'une jeune midinette,
Et d'un petit Parigot
Tous les refrains d'amour sont un peu bêtes,
Celui là l'est aussi
Mais si vous reprenez en chœur ma chansonnette,
Je vous dirai: Merci!

Elle était jeune et belle,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il eut le béguin pour elle
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle était demoiselle,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il se débrouilla pour qu'elle ne le soit plus!
Comme de bien entendu !

Ils se mirent en ménage
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle avait du courage
Comme de bien entendu !
Il était au chômage,
Comme de bien entendu !
Ça lui faisait déjà un gentil petit revenu...
Comme de bien entendu !

Voulant faire une folie,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il offrit à sa mie,
Comme de bien entendu !
Un billet de la loterie,
Comme de bien entendu !
Ça ne lui fit jamais que cent balles de perdues...
Comme de bien entendu !

Mais il se mit à boire
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle ne fit pas d'histoires,
Comme de bien entendu !
Mais pour ne pas être une poire,
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle se consola en le faisant cocu.
Comme de bien entendu !

Il la trouva mauvaise
Comme de bien entendu !
Mais elle ramenait du pèze,
Comme de bien entendu !
Au lieu de ramener sa fraise,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il se contenta de lui foutre son pied au cul,
Comme de bien entendu !

Et, depuis, l'on raconte
Comme de bien entendu !
Qu'il y trouve son compte,
Comme de bien entendu !
Et, quand chez lui, on monte,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il s'en va faire un p’tit tour au P.M.U.
Comme de bien entendu !",Comme de Bien Entendu,1998
Albert Raisner,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering

In one second you stole his grace
And I'm still waiting for what you have promised

Alberta Hunter,"I know a triflin' man, 
They call him Triflin' Sam, 
He lives in Birmingham, 
'Way down in Alabam, 
Now, the other night, 
He had a fight 
With a gal called Mandy Brim, 
She sadly stated, she was aggravated, 
And she yelled these words to him: 

Aggravatin' Papa, don't try to two-time me! 
Aggravatin' Papa, treat me kind or let me be; 
Listen while I get you told, 
Stop messin' round with my jellyroll, 

If I catch you out with your high-brown baby, 
I'll smack you down, and I don't mean maybe! 
Aggravatin' Papa, I'll do anything you say, 
But when you start to running, don't you run around my way; 

Now, Papa, treat me pretty, nice and sweet, 
'Cause I possess a forty-four that don't repeat, 
So, Aggravatin' Papa, don't try to two-time me! 

Aggravatin' Papa, don't try to two-time me! 
Aggravatin' Papa, treat me kind or let me be; 
Listen while I get you told, 
Stop messin' round with my jellyroll, 

If I catch you out with your high-brown baby, 
I'll smack you down, and I don't mean maybe! 
Aggravatin' Papa, I'll do anything you say, 
But when you start to running, don't you run around my way; 

Got one hand on my razor, one arm around my gun, 
If I catch you foolin' round, I'll tear your doghouse down, 
So, Aggravatin' Papa, don't try to two-time me!",Aggravatin' Papa [Take 1],1997
Alberta Hunter,"Most folks now days say old fashioned ways
Should give place to things that are new
But somehow I hold, to things that are old
Perhaps it’s an old fashioned view

I love my old books, the corners and nooks
Of my old home and the old friends
Old memories too, one love that is true
Lasting all through life until it ends

I’ve got that old fashioned love in my heart
Oh, play it for me, yes
And there it will always remain
My love is like an ivy vine
Clingin’ a little closer all the time
Through the years, joy and tears
Just the same

I’ve got that old fashioned faith in my heart, oh yes
No changes can’t tear it apart
If the dry land changed to sea
That would never make any change in me
'Cause I’ve got that old, old fashioned love in my heart

Yes I’ve got that old, old fashioned faith in my heart 
No changes can tear it apart
If the dry land changed to sea
That would never make any change in me
'Cause I’ve got that old, old fashioned love in my heart

Yes, I’ve got that old, old fashioned love in my heart",Old Fashioned Love [Take 1],1997
Alberta Hunter,"I've seen the lights of gay Broadway,
Old Market Street down by the Frisco Bay,
I've strolled the Prado, I've gambled on the Bourse;
The seven wonders of the world I've seen,
And many are the places I have been,
Take my advice, folks, and see Beale Street first!

You'll see pretty browns in beautiful gowns,
You'll see tailor-mades and hand-me-downs,
You'll meet honest men, and pick-pockets skilled,
You'll find that business never ceases 'til somebody gets killed!

If Beale Street could talk, if Beale Street could talk,

Married men would have to take their beds and walk,
Except one or two who never drink booze,
And the blind man on the corner singing ""Beale Street Blues!""

I'd rather be there than any place I know,

Alberta Hunter,"I'll be down to get you in a taxi, honey
Better be ready about half past eight
Now honey, don't be late
I want to be there when the band starts playing
Remember when we get there, honey
The two-steps, I'm goin' to have 'em all
Goin' to dance out both my shoes
When they play the ""Jelly Roll Blues""

I wonder who he can be
Somebody loves me, I wish I knew
Who can he be worries me

For every boy who passes me, I shout 'Hey, maybe'

Somebody loves me, I wonder who
Maybe it's you

Alberti,"The blind inspiration, total disillusion
Instant consecration, mind and body fusion
Frontal assault on the seven senses
Orgasmic waste, eccentric and pretentious

KMFDM, doing it again
A treat for the freaks, truth or dare
Are you ready for this? we don't care
Deify data, hard but true

Godlike nonsense being thrown at you
We keep simple, tough and outright
Easy to swallow, KMFDM light
KMFDM, doing it again

A treat for the freaks, truth or dare
How low can you go? we don't care
In a world of deceit, open your eyes
What we do for you, so good for you

Don't be afraid and you'll realize
What you do for me, so good for me
One way or another, now or later
Bow down and worship the true creator

Musik ist macht, eine ausgesprocheneVerbindung von Schlau und Dunn.
Geruschschtigen wird unter immensemDruck und Leidenschaft grossteFreude und Vertrauen abgesaugt.
Der Heldenriff ist der Froschfresser.
Der Rhythmus ein schoner Schwan.

Nur die Worte ein Blutegel an deinem gehirn.
Keiner macht fur dich mehr.
Take a good plunge and out from the masses
Bend over backwards and kick some asses

Call 1-800, accept no imitation
