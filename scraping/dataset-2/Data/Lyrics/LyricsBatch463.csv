JL B. Hood,"Let ye cast no judgement upon thy neighbor
Before the beam of thy own eyes have been cleansed
In the wicked ways of the world
God gives the remission for all of our sins

When I was a young one the preacher put oil on my sixth chakra (sixth chakra)
He knew when I was older I'd wanna follow 2Pac and Big Papa (Big Papa)
They thought I was so devilish in the dark I would listen to sick opera
But this choppa' will be reppin' the city where RDV's Young Rich and Slick's got ya
Well in peace
I don't know why they wanna call me up every Easter Sunday to the altar
Maybe the music I am doin' is never gospel, sinner is what they call ya
I know we look a little strange and we the gang my lane is what I offer
3 dimensional altar with a ego on top of the rock of Gibraltar

I see-e, it's not the way the Bible people want me to be-e
Flippin' the fire for the family focused and free-e
Listen to me-e doing it for T.V-e
With the rebel yell, came out of my shell
Preacher said tell your people let go of your coat-tail
With a tremendous fail he never to say my livin' is hell
But even worse said I lead my people to Hell's Bells
Lookin' at me just like my mother and father would breed creatures
Not an evil bone in my body and never known to be naughty in my seeds either
Simple and plain like a cheese pizza
I don't know prayin' on my knees keep us from heat seekers
Lovin' the bleed feature while the people tell me that I need Jesus!

Talk about, judgement
Speakin' to me with the people I'm leadin' em underway
And you read me and see me easy to be shunned away
But you got it all wrong
You seem to tell me I need Jesus! (oh, Jesus! Jesus!)
Every day they wanna condemn me
None of 'em even know me
Anyone ever that sinned cast the stone out
I'm stoned, let's talk about it

I'm askin'
What's happening?
Boy, 'cause they bashing me
Bangin' the Bible, butcher boy don't bother with blasphemy
Call em a crazy critic comin' causin' catastrophes
Aimin' at Aaron a lot of ammo and an angel actually
Ah mane, Amen
You people let the steeples speak in evil and the neezle playing God hymn
My mother was a Christian but I used to go with the wicked for the stick and whats the problem
Questioning the K.O.D.'s grim, anybody talkin hella crazy I'm 'bout to jaw them
You'll be up on a cross whenever you step to me so take precautions
Y'all false actors, callin' me a demon when I talk backwards siht pot
Tecca Nina gonna be sought after this drop by the people that go toss rappers hip hop
So you thinking you religious?
When you condemn another man you never lead us
Telling me whats under me is gonna heat us
Never believe ya cause really you need Jesus
Leave us

Talk about, judgement
Speakin' to me with the people I'm leadin' em underway
And you read me see me easy to be shunned away
But you got it all wrong
Let's talk about it

Mama never really talked about God
All that I was ever taught was I'm odd
Heard he knew 'bout every thought that I hide
Dirty mind I'd see a cross and I'd hide
Lost without God, salty 'bout that
But I was captivated by the bosses outside
I plotted every way to getting draws by my squad
Ask round why every man goes bad
Happens to pass down like second hand clothes man
Salvage a blouse gown and manicured toes had
Half of us ground bound for hell and Lord knows
Need a savior they say slain for your behavior
Raised in three days grace be what he gave ya
The sun that'll make ya want to gravitate ta
Pain temperate son, 'cause sins you didn't pay for
Bow to a name insane fast they told her
Vows to a dame, the tame Casanova
Wild, didn't change and came crash imposer
Doused in the flames and bank chapter closure
Spiritually drained, crashed and vulgar
Needed somewhere to go until rain passes over
Seeking a miracle from a stained-glass Jehovah
But I don't know if the ordained pastor's sober
Dang in disdain, prayed in vain
Care to sling dough, explain, do anything
Lay hands, borough plain, you entertained
Dealt pain, process ain't growing the brains
Confusing, now my fangs out, protruding
Rebuking, from mouth full of Communion
Scorned by lukewarm kind it's time you've been
Warned the storm formed now find refusing",Need Jesus,2016

Riding like a Lost Boy, feeling like a Kennedy
Repping west hemisphere, my med is amphetamine
My mellow my Benzedrine, my ghetto celebrity

Ain't no time to fuck around
It sound like we got a hit
If you call yourself a rapper, that just mean you gotta spit
All I hear is bars about these bitches and Bugatti shit
Everybody hating, ain't enough to get new Godi lit

John C. Holmes in the kitchen, fuck him and beat him
Y'all are ass backwards like if you can't join 'em then beat 'em

See me finger fuck the world while you fuckers fighting for freedom
They be trying to put the scope on the demon but never see him
Believe what you see and what they can add at a pair a diem
Now gates make a marinate, light the grill up and fucking eat 'em

So what's the reason for jealousy, envious lust and treason
You feel like we're Justin Bieber, I feel like you must be dreaming
For real

We been scheming up and in the pop offs
Everybody got my side guns
We the definition of a squad goes hard
Line 'em up, that's what the blindfold's for
Strange bro, that's happening
Gang flow, that's gassing
Kill in cold blood fashion

We gotta be paid, we made it
We don't want my name in faces
But that doesn't make me famous
They said that we Boujee, they basic
Committee come get it straightened
And killer, the city where ghetto celebrity stat was generated

The levels were penetrated
Incredibles demonstrated
Play to pay them keeping them sedated
Slated get 'em keeping them persuaded

Ultra uno, CES
You're listening to killer city's best
I ain't playing, players the only button you should press
Do we hustle, yes, muscle chest midwest
Specialists'll catchin' wreck
You catching up, we catching checks

Place your bet, better put respect on it
And I reckon no enemies want it
I'm reppin' KCC on it
And it seems we see no opponents

You know what I swing for the fences
It ain't no suspense and I beat on my chest like an ape
And I like goin' to the booth while I'm wearing a suit and come out in a cape
And I'm out of your reach but I'm all in your face
While we be in this bitch, we are vain in this space
All you ratatouille rappers stuck in the race
Talking all gas pedal no brakes

This year's that Trayvon and Freddy Gray rap
Rock 'em like Aesop, I mean like A$AP
These pussies name drop but never say jack, they whack

Get down on your lay flat
Careful where you try'na take that
Still picking up lines by the fist
Sixth time, you don't play that

Take 'em back into an ADAT
Stretch 'em out just like a wave cap
Anybody fucking with the committee we chaining 'em up on the train tracks

Take 'em way back where I forged this
Off of forty third street and Warwick
Til the coordinates up at Strangeland
Metamorphosis of a changed man

No coordinates for the game plan
And I'm staring at 'em through the ray bans
Hoping everybody's getting saved then
I'm a leave 'em in peace with an amen

Man it's overkill when they change hands
Altogether, it is monumental
Confident we in the right position
I will tell you bout it but it's confidential
Undeniably it is official
Bout to fuck 'em all and we will not be gentle
Who the hell is hating, we was sent to get you

A lot of my time tryin' to find what to lead the scenes with
Now that them up
When you're workin' get your collateral up
Prestige, esteem, position, my stature is up
Two brackets above them breaking but distracted enough
Don't give half of a fuck, were fragile when the gavel is struck
By your maggot-bashin' too passionate, I'm 'bout to pull up

Thinking of you wherever I go
When I close my eyes you're by my side
A thousand miles can't keep us apart
Your tender words serenade my heart
And you keep me smiling, perfect timing
I wish that you were here with me tonight

See I've traveled around the world now
And I've seen so many beautiful girls now (girls now)
But somehow no one ever comes close to you
You know I've been to many different places
And I've seen so many pretty faces (faces)
But baby no one ever comes close to you
Close to you, close to you

Last night we had a fight
Said some things I wish I'd never
The black marks from last night
The tears you cried still on my sweater
I step over the plate that you broke last night
I pick up your clothes that I threw outside
In the cold light of day we can leave it behind

I guess we get a little bit crazy
I guess we get a little bit cruel
But this is how crazy you make me
Bad enough to think about losing you
But even as I walk away
And I say I'm gonna stay
Only takes a moment or two
Cause you and I both know the truth
I'm crazy for you, whoa
I'm crazy for you

A thousand flowers
The power of saying sorry
So you don't have to call
To find out you know you got me
Even when you hurt me the way you have
Even though you know I can treat you bad
But we're drawn once again
Like a moth to a flame
Yeah it's like that

I guess we get a little bit crazy
I guess we get a little bit cruel
But this is how crazy you make me

Cause you and I both know the truth
I'm crazy for you, whoa
I'm crazy for you

Said all the words I wanted to

Your dubs are cheap like paying subs on the dubs
Hear my voice in the clubs on the dubs
Show 'em like a guy called Pub on the dubs

I can't explain what I think when I drink
Might say ""I love you"" to a link when I drink
Might vomit in the sink when I drink
Chew gum so my breath don't stink when I drink
The ladies think that I ain't stink when I drink
'Cause I move cold like an ice rink when I drink
I spend more than a pink's when I drink
Can't make a big stack of money shrink

It gets peak on the streets
Us man never look weak on the streets
Man say they can't see me on the streets
In the X6, not an X3 on the streets
I keep it G like Prez T on the streets
I'm out for P like OG'z on the streets
Raw like a cat for the P on the streets
Pray that you never see me on the streets

Shorty, my face is bait in the ends
Man move bent, not straight in the ends
Could've been Batman with a cape in the ends
Being the badman is late in your ends
And the ends won't love if you fake in the ends
Everybody wants a slice of the cake in the ends
Careful how you pick your mates in the ends
And we'll bust your head like grapes in the ends

I make dough on the roads
Fully grown like Frisco on the roads
See Jme or Joe on the roads
Shooting, but not a video on the roads
You're nobody, like John Doe on the roads
I run the roads live, I go on the roads
No snitching is the code of the roads
Don't act like you ain't been told on the roads

Frisco, yeah, I'm a beast in a judgement
You don't wanna buck up with me in a judgement
Anytime I might creep in a judgement
Trust me, it could get peak in a judgement
In a judgement, get lost in a judgement
Dun know, it's more than a lot in a judgement
Don't buck up in a judgement war
'Cause you will get more judgement than a judge meant

I get paid in the rave
With Junior and James in the rave
Most of the man dem blaze in the rave
In the crowd or onstage in the rave
I done the rave with 1 8 in the rave
A gun will make it unsafe in the rave
Buss up the mic and cave in the rave
And my Boy Better Know team bait in the rave

Boy Better Know I'm the ting in my life
Always got a big grin in my life
Music is the main thing in my life
Yeah, I'm Charlie Sheen, I win in my life
These youts ain't been where I've been with my life
They try take my life, put a knife in my life
Pain and strife in my life
But God's always on my side

I don't give a damn when I skank
You would've thought that I drank when I skank
I don't even know who I am when I skank
Buss moves that I didn't know I had when I skank

Cut off my nose to spite my face
And I'll cut off your tongue to spite your taste
Man can't break me down on this grind
Take all my secrets to the grave
Keep all my secrets 'till I die

There's no street lights so visibility's low

Laughing, joking, everything's blessed
The right-hand lane's uncharted territory
Everyone's on the left
But man's in a four wheel drive
So I get brave and I stay on the right
The snow gets thick and the car slips
To the left, I smashed the windscreens in bits

Filled up the tank and came straight to my yard
Smiling ear to ear, revving hard
Like he's just got a Dark Charizard
Skepta went round the block three times
Came back, him and Dan went inside
I thought why not? The weather's fine
Fuck it, let me go for a ride
I was riding slow but the weather turned quick
I turned too low in the rain and slipped
I broke the gear shift, got it fixed
But for that whole week I know Dan was pissed
But he didn't say a thing, real bredrin

I never lost the thirst to be first, I will not waste a second and come second

Treat producers like prostitutes
Give them P for a beat

Their life is so shit, so they invent any reason to beef

A simple music lesson, think about it

Everybody thinks to MC tough
Your lyrics must be about negative stuff
Go raving, no-one's skanking
Turn around I bet you some-one's shanking
Jus 'coz we come from the gutter
We know about scraping the bottom of the butter
Don't mean we have to be sinners
Major labels don't want killers
Think
Who's gonna sign a guy with a shank
Or a guy with a nine mil
All you're gonna get is a three figure deal
You'll MC at a rave and get a bill
But that bill ain't gonna last
It will go fast
And it might be the last shubs for a while
So you won't have no dough for a while

To the beat
Jus bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to the beat
Just bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance or Lean Back
Then bop your head to the beat
If you dont wanna dance to beat
Just bop your head to the beat

Don't say serious

Scared their debut album will flop
I'm floggin food like a chip-shop
So I'll fall back on that If this flops
Plus I go uni so if shit pops off with the cops
Trust me I've got it locked
How comes, Every single MC is vexed
It's like the whole point of MC-ing nowadays is to get a reload on the decks
Man will go to radio on Thursday
Even though it's his birthday
He'll spit lyrics like it's the worst day in his life

Looks like he's tryin to grow some breast
Stop that, before you get an arch-back

Keep the crowd hyped up brother party
Red, she wanna say words in my earlobe
Reminds me there’s an hour of the party left
See the fireworks, celebration, team winning the Grey Goose amazing
Send them Jaeger bombs I got a craving
So many women I don’t wanna stop raving
They should know I got tunes for the gyal dem
Once the ladies are there see the man dem reach
They wanna leave there with a number
Check the peng ting she’s gonna hang with me
I’m skanking all round the party I’m skanking
I got girls to the left and girls to the right
When we’re at the bar we ain’t ramping

Wiley called me on the iPhone
He said get my passport told me to come through
Put your sun cream in your suitcase
When I arrive causing a heat wave too
Got my SnapBack and my vest on
Looking at the hot girl with the red dress on
Light skin with a beautiful body like Kim
So I had to get my Kanye West on
She told me she’s feeling my jewellery
She said that she’s in love with my Jesus piece
I told her to look again closely
It’s not Jesus baby it’s JME
And I was like babe come over
I don’t bite girl come a little closer
Come a little closer
I don’t bite girl come a little closer

Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya

You know I don’t usually party
But Skepta and Wiley said its a hype
I can’t find my phone or my car keys
Like Zippy Tafari said on the mic
The vibe is off the richter
And I can’t even tweet a picture
I’m on the dance floor the joke is
I never had a drink but I’m acting the drunkest
She’s staring like I’m a weirdo
Or then again maybe she likes me
I’m not supposed to be here though
Haven’t got a wrist band for the VIP
No triple A pass but I’m partying with the stars
Yep, I can’t complain I just enjoy while it lasts

I go macho on people eat their tunes 'cause really Wiley goes in
I'm torn between catering for me and the fans, (I'm going mad)
I only hear my big hits where people go to get tans, (Beach)
What's that to me is they want easy, I can't show skills
For the wayward music they want brother, I don't want mils (I don't want mils)

Where do I start with this one
I was on the outside trying to get inside
With the tools outside I got inside
In a matter of time I was doing a lot
Might see me with a lighty on the block
Wiley told me to murk this
So I gotta make this worth it
When I spit, spit to kill, not only Fruity Loops that I kill
I'm a lord of the beats fam
Check YouTube, every man knows that it got real
Five bills for a grime beat, that's real
Had 'em scared and shook like I just got signed and dropped, let go from the deal
I'mma stack till I get mils

Got a rave booked at 1
Leave an hour gap then I'm booked til three

I don't know who's approval man's seeking
Or what crowd man's tryna be reaching
Don't wanna make tunes that are bait
I make music for an acquired taste
Started doing this thing 'cause I loved it
Not to make tunes for the general public
Our music is made to measure
Wiley is a national treasure
Not everybody is gonna like it
If they don't like it, fuck 'em
Man really started from the bottom
Walk in to radio, man ain't forgotten
I used to pay 5 pounds a week to get heard
Now I get five bags for spoken word
Personally I think man's winning

Black tints in an all-black Mercedes, getting wavey
A couple man tried play me
I blacked out and went crazy
You can't fade me
Don't wanna hear about black man time
If you owe, you better pay me
You better act like you rate me
Don't wanna be on my blacklist
Don't wanna see the end of my black fist, I preach what I practice
Don't get caught in the blackness, better take note
Of the words coming out of my black lips
Looking for a black chick with the fat hips
To bend over and do backflips
She ain't gotta be an actress
Just know she ain't seeing the Baptist
You're dealing with Raskit, the fact is

I've gotta learn to forgive
Even when they burn through bridge

Rust derided inspires change, and leaves behind exhausted dreams, ignition engaged
So save your wishes for the sky, diluted and disguised, as a perfect fuel that won't ignite
But hope will heal us all
Set to action our forward thought
To allocate and stabilize
The truth for so long can only hide
In shadows of our own design amend and revise
A wish will leave you empty handed (hope will provide)
Shun your responsibilities (and lead an empty life)
A dream alone will bear no seed (hope is alive)

I told her, ""Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent""
I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev in there
And I can't let this girl throw her life away

Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her
Takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah, grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin' on the door H.A.M
Then he bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me

When I wake up every day
Even though she doubted me
I thank the lord that we are safe
Even though she doubted me
Again, yeah
Even though she doubted me
That's why we pray for me
That's my momma and I love her with my heart like I love you
If you strugglin', baby daddy ain't takin' care of the kids girl
You can get a hug too
I'm here whenever you need me

You look even better than you did before
I'm staring at my feet
Wondering if I can do this
It's been a while but I couldn't forget you

Just a little look has got me feeling things
Just a little taste has got me seeing things
Just a little touch has got me off the chains

Jo Ann Kelly,"A clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind.
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine.

Jumpin' slick was my ruin,
'Cause I found out all I was doin'
Was makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, aww, yeah.
Just makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, huh-huh.

I took this man's love and put it on a shelf,
And, like a fool, I thought I had him all to myself.
When he needed love, I was out havin' fun,
But I found out that all I had done
Was made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, huh-huh.
Yeah, that's what I did:
I made it easy for the clean up woman
To steal my baby's love, aw, yeah.

The clean up woman will wipe his blues away.
She'll give him plenty lovin', 24 hours a day.
The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet.
She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street.
So take a tip, you better get hip
To the clean up woman, 'cause she's tough.
I mean, she really cleans up.

Yes, think of what that means

Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again

When the world once more starts making sense
I'll unwind, for a change
Really that'd be strange
Can I help it if I'm tense

Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax, I'll get down to brass tacks and relax

Alert the dust pail and broom

Open the shutters and let in some air
Put these here and put those over there
Sweep up the years, the sadness and tears and throw them away

Cheeks a-blooming again, we're assuming again
We'll resume our long-lost joie de vivre
We'll be playing again, holidaying again
And we're praying it's ASAP
We will push, we will shove

And we'll finally be human again

We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around with such ease

We'll be floating again!
We'll be gliding again!

I can see him
In the flash of the headlights
He's waiting for me on the desert tonight

We'll drive across that great divide

Sounds crazy doesn't it?
Have you ever been up to the panhandle? 
The sky's bigger than God
It's like being dead center of a giant saw blade

I hitchhiked all over that country
The sun's been stuck more places than I care to remember
And my only regret is I only screwed six thousand men
Every single one of them was a chicken shit

Suddenly a little turtle jumps right out of his jacket and

Oh the champagne keeps flowing and everyone is happy happy

Maybe I read you wrong thinkin' you could be my Mr. Right
I was puttin' my heart and soul on the line
Said you needed some time, just a little more time to make up your mind
Well it's been long enough
Time is up

Bye bye love I'll catch you later
Got a left foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
I ain't never lookin' back and that's a fact
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye bye, bye bye my baby, bye bye

Don't think all those tears are gonna hold me here like they've done before
You'll find what's left of us in a cloud of dust on highway 4
Baby what did you expect me to do
Just sit around and wait on you
Well I'm through watchin' you just skate around the truth
And I know it sounds trite
I've seen the light

Bye bye love I'll catch you later
Got a left foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
'Cause I ain't never lookin' back, and that's a fact
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye bye, bye bye my baby, bye bye

I'd lost the game I guess
I did my best to win the part
Now I'm leavin' here with what's left of my heart
Bye bye, I'll catch you later
Got a left foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off

Pick up any morning paper
Turn on the 6 o'clock news
The devil's been so busy lately
That even God must get the blues

A young man lies there in the street
His life gone like it was nothin' to lose
And for the shoes there on his feet
Yes even God must get the blues

When the rain falls down from heaven, it must be the angels cryin'
For all the sorrow in the world tonight

A young girl hides her face in shame
So they can't see it's been battered and bruised
Like she's the one to blame

I knew we'd meet again another time, another place
Can't believe it's been so many years
We better grab a chair and a couple of beers
You're lookin' good in your three piece suit
You know I always knew you'd take the business route
You were always the one who followed the light and
You look like you're doing alright

I've been singing for my rent and singing for my supper
I'm above the below and below the upper
I'm stuck in the middle where the money gets tight
But i guess I'm doing alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
Oh, oh I'm alright
Got a good ole friend here with me tonight
So I guess I'm doing alright

Well we raised a lot of hell when we were younger
They thought we were crazy but we had the hunger
We kept a lot of friends and skipped a lot of class
Been on top of the world and knocked on our ass
Lost touch, we lost in love
And lost our minds when things got tough
But beating time is a losing fight
But I guess I'm doing alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
Oh, oh I'm alright
Got a good ole friend here with me tonight
So I guess I'm doing alright

Well I hate to see this evening end
God only knows when I'll see you again
Send a fax or send me a letter
Or give me a call that will even be better
Give the wife a kiss for me
And say hello to the family
Tell them all my future's looking bright and I miss them

Great big fins and painted steel

With my old man behind the wheel
Well, you could hardly even see him
In all of that chrome
The man with a plan and a pocket comb
But every night it carried him home

He got up every morning
While I was still asleep
I remember the sound
Of him shufflin' around
Right before the crack of dawn
Is when I heard him turn
His motor on
And when I got up they were gone
Down the road in the rain and snow
The man and his machine would go
Oh, the secrets that old car would know

He said he had to find himself out on the road 
I guess when love goes wrong 
You've gotta learn to be strong 

So I worked two jobs 
And I moved three times 
I ended up south of Memphis, workin' down in Riverside 
I may not be so lucky in love 
But the one thing I'm sure of 

I want a man that stands beside me 
Not in front of or behind me 
Give me two arms that want to hold me, not own me 
And I'll give all the love in my heart 
Stand beside me 
Be true, don't tell lies to me 
I'm not lookin' for a fantasy 
I want a man that who stands beside me 

I didn't expect to see him, one hot July morning 
His hair was longer but his eyes were the same old blue 
He said, ""I've missed you for so long. Oh baby, what can I do?"" 
I said, ""I want a man that stands beside me 
Not in front of or behind me 
Give me two arms that want to hold me, not own me 
And I'll give all the love in my heart.""

Ready to face most anything but learn that I was naive 
Ran into things in life that I never planned 
But that's made me who I am 

I've had highs and lows and seen my share of ups and downs 
There's been nights it seemed there wasn't a friend to be found 
I've had to save myself from drowning in a sea of tears. 
But I'm still here

I won't let it get the best of me, I'll try my very best to be that strong 
Oh, oh, oh, I, I'm a survivor 
And I'll never give up, never let out, never give in

Oh 
I was taught that honesty was simply the only way 
I've spoken honestly and had it blow up in my face 
Sometimes I look around and I don't know what I see 
But I gotta believe in God above and what he's made me 

No 
I've witnessed pride and ego destroy the kindest of hearts 
Seen how gread can take the best of friends and tear them apart 
Every corner, every turn, every lesson I have learned 
Has helped me find my way

We all pile in
Downtown, top down, rockin' while we ride around
Let the night begin

I'm just searchin' for a dreamer
Who'll steal my heart away
Strong and shy with I dare you eyes
And a smile that lights the way

It's the night of the week 
When my dreams hit the street
With boots and blue jeans on
Take a shot at romance, do I stand a chance
Will destiny be good to me
It's the thrill of the kiss that on Monday I'll miss
When I look back and say
Oh my lord you should have seen me Saturday
Saturday night

Five days out of seven slavin' 
I need one that's just for me

It's the thrill of the kiss that on Monday I'll miss
When I look back and say
Oh my lord you should have seen me Saturday
Saturday, oh Saturday, Saturday
Oh Saturday, Saturday night

I wake up to the sunshine out my
window and the passin?sound of a homeless man
Singin?an ol?Cole Porter song
The faucet leaks, the TV's on the blink again
But my restless dreams are still intact
Even though it's takin?way too long
Got a hundred dollars in a coke tin on my shelf
And I'm thinkin?to myself, whoa

These are the days you will remember for the rest of your life
These are the memories you'll pack in a box and pull ‘em out sometimes
So pick your flowers, count the seconds, roll the dice
But baby,  don't  wait ‘till its too late
Put a smile on your face
These are the days

Outside the people rush to get ahead for checks, promotions and fancy cars
Happiness is just around the bend
Old Mrs. Jones sits out and suns her face, and as I walk by I hear her say
This is as good as it gets
There goes the business suit who owns this whole damn block
His roller coaster never stops
I want to say to him

Puts my heart in my throat
Puts a light in my eye

A song of all the gifts that peace can bring
Make a joyful noise and let it ring

Gets me thinking of the past
How the child that I was
Grew up so fast
But I still remember getting caught in the thrill
In the magic of the season, and I know I always will

Oh, I know it can get lonely out there
When you feel like nobody cares
Well, you look around thinking
If they only knew
Well I do

[Chorus:]
I've felt the chill of this world cut down to the bone
I've walked many a mile down this road on my own
I've been through hell on my knees
Come face to face with the devil
And I know that it's hard to believe
But it gets better

Time is a healer, but we can't see how
When you're caught in the moment
And the hurting is now
We don't want to see that maybe somethings
Weren't meant to figure out

[Chorus]

This old world can be cruel sometimes
When you're looking for answers
Well, just keep in mind
No, you're not alone
We're all trying to find our way through this life

Said this truck eats fords for lunch so I pulled up beside him my new mustang
I was just getting ready to say boy that trucks seen it's last meal
But I was wanting to climb in that Chevy when I saw what was sitting behind that 
wheel

[Chorus]
Mornin' sun found a new mustang
Abandoned in a Walmart parking lot
Mud on the seats so don't tell me away
Didn't stop the gossip tongues from waggin'
'Til next day somewhere around three o'clock
No tellin' what they're talkin about
What's going 'round
It's too late to worry about that now
Where do men so big and bad learn all them words so sweet and soft
It made my world spin 'round so fast I thought it was gonna sling me off
Red mud on the finders might have gave a clue as to where we'd been
And no one knows just what went on except the moon, me and him

[Chorus]

Now that we come showin' up
Rumors bouncin' off of that truck

Trying to find a way to just keep up some how

A little secret that I finally figured out
We spend so much time climbing up the ladder
And then we're missing all the things that really matter

Breathin' in and breathin' out

Life is good
I'm gonna grab on to today
Live every minute in the way I know I should
Life is good
I like to move, I like to run, I like to get it done
Or I can stay home on the couch and watch tv

Pray to god I didn't care
I wanna turn back time
Turn back time and have you here with me
I want to find someone to blame

And it doesn't care how much we love
Cause sometimes love is just not enough

Oh we took a chance we gave it all we had and couldn't make it
It didn't work for all the times we tried

I gotta face my reflection and say

Though I had to let you know
If I knew the last time that I held you was the last time
I'd have held you and never let go
Oh it's kept me awake night wonderin'
I lie in the dark, just asking why?
I've always been told you won't be called home until it's your time

I guess Heaven was needing a hero
Somebody just like you
Brave enough to stand up for what you believe and follow it through
When I try to make it make sense in my mind
The only conclusion I come to
Is that Heaven was needing a hero like you

I remember the last time I saw you
Oh you held your head up proud
I laughed inside when I saw how you were standing out in the crowd
You're such a part of who I am
Now that part will just be void
No matter how much I need you now
Heaven needed you more

Jo Hamilton,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise,2009

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You,2004
Jo Jones,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade

Jo Lawry,"Ah, me name is Jackie White and I'm foreman of the yard,
And ye don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.
Why I'm as hard as iron plate, woe betide ye if yer late,
When we have to push the boat out on a spring tide.
Now ye could die and hope for Heaven, but ye'd need to work your shift,
And I'd expect ye's all to back us to the hilt.
And if St. Peter at his gate were to ask ye why yer late,
Why you'd tell him that ye had to get a ship built.
We built battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen,
Super tankers for Onassis, and all the classes in between,
We built the greatest shipping tonnage that the world has ever seen,
And the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

All the platers and the welders, and the boiler making crews,
When they see that bugger finished on the slipway,
All the hardship's soon forgot and we'll cheer as like as not,
And the bairns'll wave their Union Jacks all day.
It's a patriotic scene, all that's missing is the Queen,
But she said she couldn't make it of a Tuesday.
Then something wells up here inside, and you could take it in yer stride,
But you wonder if you'll see another payday.

For there's a mixture of emotions, hatred, gratitude and pride,
And you hate yourself for crying but it's difficult to hide,
For there's a sadness in the leavin' and ye worry what's ahead,
And that worry never leaves ye, keeps on nagging in yer head,
And so ye pray to God for orders, but ye'll worry till yer dead…
Until they bury your remains in the blacksmith's shed,
And the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
And I don't know what we'll do if this yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

[Additional lyrics not included on the track]
My name is Adrian Sanderson and riveting's me trade,
But it's intellectual discourse I'm known better for,
And I may forego English grammar when I'm injured with a hammer,
But I've a preference for the deference of a metaphor.

I've read the Odyssey by Homer and the Iliad as well,
I read Tacitus and Pliny and the Scarlet Pimpernel,
I put a night shift in with Dante on his journey into Hell,
And that's what we'll all be facing if the yard's put up to sell,
For the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Now what about those Trojan wars? And the troubles that they caused?
When they sailed off on that summer's afternoon?

[Tommy Thompson]
Aye, the ship they had was crap and they'd lost the effin' map,
When they tried to get their selves back to the toon.

[Adrian Sanderson]
There's a lesson in these tales although they happened ages past,
Just like in ""Spartacus"" that film by Stanley Kubrick.
First it's tragedy then farce then they'll kick you in the arse,
When you tempt the gods with arrogance and hubris.

Well it's obvious I'm gifted with the rhymin' and the meter,
And hereabouts I'm thought of highly as a bard.
If I wasn't shooting rivets I'd be famous in me time,
All those literary circles I could dazzle with me rhyme,
And I never lacked ambition you could say it was a crime,
And rivets may be riveting but sonnets are sublime,
But the only life I've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
But we don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

Ah, me name is Tommy Thompson, I'm shop steward for the Union,
Me dream is proletarian revolution,
Comrades, brothers, fellow travellers and others,
Class struggle is the means of dialectic evolution.

Das Kapital's me bible and the ruling class are liable,
And quoting Marx and Engels, it's entirely justifiable,
If the workers' revolution here is ever to be viable,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

So it's a one-day stoppage, or an overtime ban,
Or a work to rule for the Five Year Plan.
'Til the means of production are safely in our hands,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

I'm not saying it won't be hard if the boss hands us me cards,
When they try to close us down like other shipyards.
And if industrial action only helps the competition,
As I've heard the bosses bleating from their usual position,
And I stand accused of anarchy, disruption and sedition,
Well ye'll never knock us down, you reactionary clowns!
When it's time for occupation of the shipyard.

My name is Peggy White,
And I've nursed ye through your injuries and yer cuts and wounds I've bound.
Busted arms, and busted heads,
Broken backs and broken legs,
I'd sooner put ye in a splint than have them put ye in the ground.
And the fumes from all the welding where the poison air is hung,
And the toxic radiation that's been blackening your tongue,
I could give you's all an aspirin while you're coughing up your lungs,
But it's all you'll ever get here in this shipyard.

[Additional lyrics not included on the track]
My name is Arthur Cook, I'm the Union superintendent,
Where I represent the interests of ye's all.
And I listen to you men as you talk about the future,
But the truth is that we're heading for a God almighty fall.
But it's clear that intervention's not the government's intention,
'Cos they've got no need for ships, now have I got your full attention?
While the closing of the yard may be beyond your comprehension,
I'm the one who sees the writin' on the shipyard wall.

I've begged and I've pleaded at every meeting that we've held,
That we limit our demands to this reality,
It's like two different metals in a join ye cannot weld,
And there's nothing to be gained from this dream of solidarity.
There's nowt for us to bargain with when the industry's at sea,
It must be obvious to you as it's obvious to me,
And my advice to all of you's is to take redundancy,
And accept that there's no future in this shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
But I don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

Ah, me name is Davy Harrison, I like a drink or two,
You could ask me when it started but I haven't got a clue.
I'm never sad or miserable I'm never ever blue,
And I'll still be up tomorrow for the shipyard.

I drink meself into a stupor and I wake up with two heeds,
And then the missus starts complainin' about all me drunken deeds,
Like when I got the train to Sunderland but found meself in Leeds,
And I had to get up early for the shipyard.

I once gave up the drinking, was it 1963?
But it seems as if sobriety was not the thing for me,
It was the worst three hours I ever hope to see…

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
And the ship sets sail and the tale gets told,
And the only life I've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll get the bastard finished, and we'll end up on the dole.
And we don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
The only life we've ever known is in the shipyard.",Shipyard,2013
Jo Mama,"I'll tell you about Machine Gun Kelly 
He rode along the outlaw trail.
Machine Gun Kelly was a simple man 
But the woman was as hard as hell.
Watch out Machine Gun, 
Don't let her run you round.
Don't let the woman put you six feet 
In the ground, Machine Gun.

I'll tell you about Katherine Kelly, 
Tired of being such small time, now.
Figured they'd kidnap a rich man's son, 
Make it in the world of crime.
Watch out Machine Gun, 
Don't let her run you round.
Don't let the woman put you six feet 
In the ground, Machine Gun.

You'd better watch out Machine Gun Kelly, 
Careful of what you do, now.
If you keep listening to your old lady, 
Ain't no telling 
What'll happen to you, now, Machine Gun.

The government boys they came 
For Machine Gun, took the poor boy away.
Stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth prison 
Where he lived until his dying day.

Watch out Machine Gun, 
Don't let her put you down.
Don't let a woman make you 
Out to be a clown, Machine Gun.
Watch out Machine Gun.",Machine Gun Kelly,1970
Jo Marie Panton,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Jo O'Meara,"I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house, that don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry
Every once in a while even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days
Every now and again I pretend I'm OK but that's not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most, was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
Never knowing, what could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doing it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, 
Living with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, 
Give away all the words that I saved in my heart that I left unspoken

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

I keep my distance but you still catch my eye

Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

(Happy Christmas!) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I Love You"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Oh now I've found a real love,
you'll never fool me again

Jo Partridge,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people life alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      And it's going to have to start with me and you... YES!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people left alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      Yes and we will have to be the chosen few...

      Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies,
      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Jo Partridge,"There were a dozen dead bodies in the Euston road, their outlines softened by the black dust. All was still, houses locked and empty, shops closed, but looters had helped themselves to wine and food, and outside a jewelers some gold chains and a watch were scattered on the pavement.

      Martian: Ulla!

I stopped, staring towards the sound. It seemed as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.

      Martian: Ulla!

The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The wailing took possession of me. I was intensely weary, footsore, hungry and thirsty. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead? Why was I alive when London was lying in state in its black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely, drifting from street to empty street, drawn inexorably towards that cry.

      Martian: Ulla!

I saw, over the trees on Primrose Hill, the fighting machine from which the howling came. I crossed Regent's Canal. There stood a second machine, upright, but as still as the first.

      Martian: Ulla!

Abruptly, the sound ceased. Suddenly the desolation, the solitude, became unendurable. While that voice sounded London still seemed alive. now suddenly there was a change, the passing of something, and all that remained was this gaunt quiet.
I looked up, and saw a third machine. It was erect and motionless, like the others. An insane resolve possessed me: I would give my life to the Martians, here and now.
I marched recklessly towards the titan and saw that a multitude of black birds were circling and clustering about the hood. I began running along the road. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation as I ran up the hill towards the monster. Out of the hood hung red shreds, at which the hungry birds now pecked and tore.
I scrambled up to the crest of Primrose hill, the Martian's camp was below me. A mighty space it was, and scattered about it, in their overturned machines, were the Martians, slain after all man's devices had failed by the humblest creatures on the earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. Directly the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies attacked them. From that moment, they were doomed.
The torment was ended. The people scattered over the country, desperate, leaderless, starved, the thousands who had fled by sea including the one most dear to me; all could return, the pulse of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again.
As life returns to normal, the question of another attack from Mars causes universal concern. Is our planet safe, or is this time of peace merely a reprieve? It may be that across the immensity of space, they have learned their lessons , and even now await their opportunity. Perhaps the future belongs not to us, but to the Martians.",Dead London [Early Band Run-Through],1981
Jo Partridge,"For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, the homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. All that was of value to me was in London. By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here.

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here.
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, more and more people joined the painful exodus. Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, and here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, cutting through bridges as though they were paper. Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. At that very moment, it was raised, and I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

But all I see is a silver sky;
For in my fancy I sweep away light,

I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,

Jo Stafford,"All in the merry month of May
When the green buds they were swelling,
William Green on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying ""Love, there is a call for you 
If your name is Barbara Allen.""

She was very slowly getting up
And very slowly going, 
The only words she said to him
Were ""Young man I think you're dying.""

""Don't you remember the other day
When you were in town a-drinking,
You drank a health to the ladies all around
And slighted Barbara Allen?""

""O yes, I remember the other day
When I was in town a-drinking,
I drank a health to the ladies all around,
But my love to Barbara Allen.""

He turned his pale face to the wall
And death was in him dwelling;
""Adieu, adieu, to my friends all,
Be kind to Barbara Allen.""

When she got in two miles of town
She heard the death bells ringing:
They rang so clear, as if to say 
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!""

So she looked east and she looked west
And saw the cold corpse coming,
She says ""Come round you nice young man
And let me look upon you.""

The more she looked the more she grieved
Until she burst out crying
""Perhaps I could have saved that young man's life
Who now is here a-lying.""

""O Mother, O Mother, come make my bed
O make it both soft and narrow,
For sweet William died to-day 
And I will die to-morrow.""

""O Father, O Father, come dig my grave
O dig it deep and narrow,
For sweet William died in love
And I will die in sorrow.""

Sweet William was buried in the old church tomb,
Barbara Allen was buried in the yard;
Out of William's heart grew a red rose,
Out of Barbara Allen's grew a brier.

They grew and grew to the old church tower
And they could not grow any higher;
And at the end tied a true lover's knot
And the rose wrapped around the brier.",Barbara Allen,1950
Jo Stafford,"I once had a gown, it was almost new
Oh, the daintiest thing, it was sweet Alice blue
With little forget-me-nots placed here and there
When I had it on, I walked on the air
And it wore, and it wore, and it wore
'Til it went, and it wasn't no more

In my sweet little Alice blue gown
When I first wandered down into town
I was both proud and shy, as I felt every eye
And in every shop window I primped passing by
Then in manner of fashion, I'd frown
And the world seemed to smile all around
'Til it wilted, I wore it, I'll always adore it
My sweet little Alice blue gown

The little silk worms that made silk for that gown
Just made that much silk and then crawled in the ground
For there never was anything like it before
And I don't dare to hope there will be any more
But it's gone, 'cause it just had to be
Still it wears in my memory

In my sweet little Alice blue gown
When I first wandered down into town
I was both proud and so shy, as I felt every eye
And in every shop window I primped passing by
Then in manner of fashion, I'd frown
And the world seemed to smile all around

They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Just as it always will
And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game

Really worth while, after all

Jo Stafford,"In the sleepy town of San Juanita,
There's a story that a padre tells,
Of a gay senor and senorita,
And the serenade of the bells.
Seems they asked the padre for permission
To be married early in the spring,
But their folks had made just one condition
That the mission bells had to ring.
Ev'ry one knew the bells were broken,
And hadn't sounded for a long, long time.
Then one night the village was astounded
For the bells began to chime!
Still the bells are broken, goes the story
But if in your heart a true love dwells
They will ring for you in all their glory,
That's the serenade of the bells.",Serenade of the Bells,1953

Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song.
Nights underneath the prairie moon,
I ride along and sing this tune.

See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

I know when night has gone
That a new world's born at dawn.

I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.",Tumbling Tumbleweeds,1953
Jo Stafford,"T'was the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there 

The children were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.
Mom in her kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap. 

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
Away to the window I flew with a flash
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash 

The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
Gave a luster of mid-day to objects below.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer 

With a little old driver so lively and quick
Well I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came
And he whistled and he shouted and he called them by name 

""On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer and Vixen
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!"" 

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet to an obstacle mount to the sky
So up to the rooftop the coursers they flew
With a sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too. 

And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing, the pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound 

He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just op'ning his pack 

His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow 

The stump of a pipe, he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when laughed (ho, ho, ho, ho) like a bowl full of jelly 
(ho, ho, ho, ho) 

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread 

He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings and turned with a jerk
And laying a finger to the side of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose 

He sprang to his sleigh, and to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight
""Merry Christmas to all and to all..goodnight 

Goodnight.""",'Twas the Night Before Christmas,1955

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

All the way home I'll be warm

O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

Again the heart with rapture glows to greet the holy night
that gave the world it's Christmas Rose, It's king of Love and Light
Let every voice acclaim His name, The grateful chorus swell
From paradise to earth He came that we with Him might dwell

O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him,

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jo Stafford,"Some say that love is sweet as a rose,
Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
""Candy""
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine

Lock your dreams at night,
It could happen to you.

Someone drops a sigh

Get your favorite one to sit by your side
Cuddle up in a sleigh

And away we go.

While you listen to the sleigh bells ring
You're yodeling to your baby
You'll feel nice and warm
no matter how cold it may be

Take a look at little Jack and Jill
They ski down a hill that's a snowplow turn
And look there's a spill
There's a spill on the hill 
When you're down it's a thrill to go up again.

Ev'rybody ought to learn to ski for that is how we first met
We were that Jack and Jill that came down a hill,
When I looked at you my hearttook a spill
Took a spill on a hill
It's a thrill that I can't forget

It Happened In Sun Valley not so very long ago
There were sunbeams in the snow
and a twinkle in your eye
I remember oh so clearly
that you nearly passed me by

Then It Happened In Sun Valley
when you slipped and fell and so did I
Now ev'ry year we go back
and then we recall that fall and that moment
When we were there on a hill
So we both take a spill and we're Jack and Jill again.

Jo Stafford,"I walked on London Bridge last night
I saw you by the lamppost light
Then bells rang out in sleepy London town
And London Bridge came tumbling down

The sky was hidden by a mist
But just like magic when we kissed
The moon and stars were shining all around
When London Bridge came tumbling down

Just you and I over the river
Two hearts suspended in space
And there so high over the river
A miracle took place

Two empty arms found love to hold
Two smoke rings turned to rings of gold
I bless the night we met in London town
When London Bridge came tumbling down

Just you and I over the river
Two hearts suspended in space
And there so high over the river
A miracle took place

I bow my head in silent prayer
And thank Him for the love we share

When London bridge came tumbling down",On London Bridge,1995

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

Jo Stafford,"After one whole quart of brandy,
Like a daisy I'm awake.
With no Bromo Seltzer handy,
I don't even shake.

Men are not a new sensation,
I've done pretty well I think,
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink.

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

I lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree
He might laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me.

I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I. 

He's a fool and don't I know it,
But a fool can have his charms,
I'm in love and don't I know it,
Like a babe in arms.

Love's the same old sad sensation,
Lately I've not slept a wink,
Since this half pint imitation,
Put me on the blink.

I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot,
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

I'll sing to him, each spring to him,
And worship the trousers that cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

When he talks, he is seeking,
Words to get,.off his chest.
Horizontally speaking
He's at his very best.

Vexed again, perplexed again,
Thank god I can be oversexed again.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Burned a lot but learned a lot,
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic,
Life was so hard to bear,
Now my heart's antiseptic,
Since you moved out of there.

Romance finis.
Your chance finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",1996
Jo Stafford,"Come all you rounders if you want to hear
The story of a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the rounder's name
On the ""six-eight"" wheeler, boys, he won his fame
The caller called Casey at half past four
He kissed his wife at the station door
He mounted to the cabin with the orders in his hand
And he took his farewell trip to that promis'd land

Casey Jones, mounted to his cabin
Casey Jones, with his orders in his hand
Casey Jones, mounted to his cabin
And he took his land (last line of each verse)

He looked at his water and his water was low
He looked at his watch and his watch was slow
He turned to his fireman and this is what he said
""Boy, we're going to reach Frisco, but we'll all be dead""
He turned to the fireman, said ""Shovel on your coal
Stick your head out the window, see the drivers roll
I'm gonna drive her til she leaves the rail
For I'm eight hours late by that Western Mail""

Casey Jones, I'm gonna drive her
Casey Jones, til she leaves the rail
Casey Jones, I'm gonna drive her
For I'm eight

When he pulled up that Reno hill
He whistled for the crossing with an awful shrill
The switchman knew by the engine's moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
When he was within six miles of the place
There No. 4 stared him straight in the face
He turned to his fireman, sai ""Jim, you'd better jump
For there're two locomotives that are going to bump.

Casey Jones, two locomotives
Casey Jones, going to bump

Casey said just before he died
""There're two more roads I would like to ride""
The fireman said ""Which ones can they be?""
""O the Northern Pacific and the Santa Fe""

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

Every road has a turning

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

Then I met you

How sublime it was too!

I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

Finding in its gleams, dear

Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love

A lucky star's above, but not for me.
With love to lead the way, I've seen more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee.
I was a fool to fall and get that way.
Heigh ho, alas, and also lackaday.
Although I can't dismiss, the memory of her kiss.
I guess she's not for me.

She's knocking on the door, but not for me.
She'll plan a two by four, but not for me.
I know that love's a game, I'm puzzled just the same.

Out of town were the people I knew

The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day,1999
Jo Stafford,"Is she looking straight at me or is it my imagination
Some kind of illusion or prestidigitation
I cross the room to a standing ovation
A hesitation at my sudden invitation
I'll be an engine tug your caboose, two legs hypotenuse
Come on baby put me to use, don't vamoose

Away, don't say the good times are over
Away, don't tell me the summer's over

The smell of the lawn makes you flop down on it
The summertime car has the top down on it
Damn genuine girl pulling sinister tricks
She's American as 3.1416, hand on my throttle
Leave the city behind, there's not a lot in the bottle
Not a lot on my mind

Away, don't say the good times are over
Away, don't tell me the summer's over, away

You are my personal miracle, I fell for all of your charms
I worship you like an eastern goddess, the one with all the arms
Little problems in this world but none of them are mine
Whisper me your life story, baby yes, yes we're killing time

Away, don't say the good times are over
Away, don't tell me the summer's over, away
Away, don't say the good times are over
Away, don't tell me the summer's over

Jo Stafford,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

Jo Stafford,"The beggar man and his mighty king are only diff'rent in name,
For they are treated just the same by fate.
Today a smile and tomorrow tears,
We're never sure what's in store,
So learn your lesson before too late, so

Be like I, hold your head up high,
Till you find a bluebird of happiness.
You will find greater peace of mind
Knowing there's a bluebird of happiness.
And when he sings to you,
Though you're deep in blue,
You will see a ray of light creep through,
And so remember this, life is no abyss,
Somewhere there's a bluebird of happiness.

Life is sweet, tender and complete
When you find the bluebird of happiness.
You will find perfect peace of mind
When you find the bluebird of happiness.
Two hearts that beat as one,
'Neath a new found sun,
We are in a world that's just begun,
And you must sing his song, as you go along,
When you find the bluebird of happiness.",Bluebird of Happiness,2001
Jo Stafford,"Dearie, do you remember when we

Waltzed to the Sousa band
My wasn't the music grand

Chowder parties down by the seashore
Every Fourth of July, test your memory
My Dearie

Do you recall when Henry Ford couldn't even fix
The running board under a Chandler six

Dearie, life was cheery
In the good old days gone by

Do you remember?

Uh huh!

Well if you remember

Wonderful!

Well Dearie, you're much older than I

What? Hey, wait a minute, Honey, I just got a long memory that's all.

Dearie, do you remember when we

Stayed up all night to get
Pittsburgh on a crystal set

Keystone movies, Coogan and Chaplin
Made you laugh and then cry

Test your memory, my Dearie
Do you recall when Orville Wright flew at Kittyhawk
But take it from me I would rather walk

Dearie, life was cheery
In the good old days gone by
Do you remember

Uh huh!

Well if you remember

Well?

Well, Dearie, you're much older than I

Ha Ha! I'll kill you

Dearie, do you remember how they

Loved Harry Lauder's act

My wasn't the Palace packed

Jenny Lind presented by Barnum
Sang her sweet lullaby
Test your memory my Dearie,

Chicago all in flames
Sure caused a terrific row

They blamed it on Mrs. O'Leary's cow

Jo Stafford,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,2002

Or is it my heart dear, beating this way
There's work to be done, done with a gun

That was started by a native down in Waikiki

Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

Hows about cooking something up for me

Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game

Jo Stafford & Chorus,"In the sleepy town of San Juanita,
There's a story that a padre tells,
Of a gay senor and senorita,
And the serenade of the bells.
Seems they asked the padre for permission
To be married early in the spring,
But their folks had made just one condition
That the mission bells had to ring.
Ev'ry one knew the bells were broken,
And hadn't sounded for a long, long time.
Then one night the village was astounded
For the bells began to chime!
Still the bells are broken, goes the story
But if in your heart a true love dwells
They will ring for you in all their glory,
That's the serenade of the bells.",Serenade of the Bells,2000

Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods
And in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green
And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there 
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause thats about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A mean vicious woman)

Everyday ?for supper time, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman
Lord have Mercy, pick a mess of it)

Her daddy was lazy and no count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons 
Out of my truck patch
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(Sock a little polk salad to me, you know I need me a mess of it)",Polk Salad Annie,1998
Jo-El Sonnier,"There are things about you that make me want to scream and shout
There are things about you that make me want to lock you out
But there's a little thing that drives me wild
Something that happens every time you smile
I can't get over the lines around your eyes
Lines around your eyes everytime you smile

And the way you touch me darlin' just drives me wild
Sometimes I don't know what we're fightin' about
But that don't mean we can't work things out
Cause I love you darlin' and the lines around your eyes

I put my car in gear and I headed down Highway 10
I was leavin' here, I was never comin' back again
I got about as far as the Texas line
I still couldn't get you off of my mind
Cause I can't get over the lines around your eyes
Lines around your eyes everytime you smile
And the way you touch me darlin' just drives me wild

When you heard that highway call your name
But girl I'm hopin' you'll think of me
If your heart should ever roll this way again

You may find yourself weary
From ridin' that restless wind
Darlin' I will be your shelter
If your heart should ever roll this way again

Everybody has a road to follow
Tryin' to find a place where they fit in
I'm here today, I'll be here tomorrow
If your heart should ever roll this way again

Jo-Jo,"I never thought the sun would shine my way
All I've known is empty promises and pain
I need a way out or some type of escape
So I take refuge in this place

Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream, cause a dream's unstoppable

I could've gave up a long time ago
Though the door I need to get through will always close

Storms and Rain everywhere I go
But I don't give up cause I know

Even if they say you just can't win
Believe you can go where you've never been
And you can fly high with the strength of all your friends

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream,
cause a dream's unstoppable

Dream
That you can fly,
Dream
That you can climb
Dream
A mountain, all you gotta do is just
Dream
That you can win,
Dream
With Confidence
Dream
To the very end cause dreamers become champions
Dream
Until it's real,
Dream,
Don't let them kill your
Dream
The fight still is in you, all you gotta do is
Dream,
Just keep the faith,
Dream,
Don't ever break
Don't let it slip away cause all you gotta do

If we keep dividing
Tell me where will the children play?

From Japan and even you Paris
You can have it and you can do what you want to do
It's alright, yes it's alright
It's alright and it's OK

You know, sometimes you go through such trouble

You think that nobody nobody cares
It's gonna be alright and it's gonna be OK honey
Because the universe, yes, well, let's go do what too much
You know that you can feel good about yourself 
'cause nobody else is gonna do it for you
So you got to make up in your mind that you are gonna get there

And do what you got to do
Make, what you want to happen, happen
And that's all I'm saying
There is a winner in you
There is a greatness in you
There is somebody in you 
That wants to come out and let you know that you are somebody

You know what?
You are gonna go higher 
And you are gonna go higher 
And you are gonna go higher
And it's alright you know
There is somebody in you 
That wants to come out and let you know that you are somebody

No man can take it away from you because
That's your gift that was given from god
So you know what? It's gonna be OK
Because you know what?
