The Wildhearts,"I like your big decisions
But I love the way you change your mind
I like your strength of vision
But I love the way that love is blind
I like that you've got bigger balls that almost all of
The Special Forces
And I need you leaving me like UFO's need horses

So into you

I like when you've got opinions
But I love that you never take a side
I like that you ain't into millions
But I love that you expect me to provide

I like the way you make me feel
And if this ain't real, then I ain't breathing
And I love that you've given me exactly what
I was needing

So into you

I like your calm dependence
And I like your way with patience
I like your understanding
But I love what you're demanding
I like your taste in outfits
But I love your taste in misfits
And I know that when the shit fits
The toughest teeth grit: 'cause this is it

So into you",So into You,2003
The Wildhearts,IÆve got a feeling of an afterglow  And the second that the sorrow goes  Will breed a new career    And I wanna open up my eyes and see  æCos the agony and ecstacy  Look all the same from here    You donÆt get no view like you do on the top of the world  The top of the world  Where the skyÆs so blue and the girls are so beautiful    And times where the heaven is a mile away  And itÆs looking like itÆs there to stay  Unlikely to remain    And I got a list of things IÆm working on  IÆll be working on number one  I hope you do the same    You donÆt get no view like you do on the top of the world  The top of the world  Where the skyÆs so blue and the girls are so beautiful,Top of the World,2003
The Wildhearts,"[Chorus]
If I go on my way without you
Woooahh where would I go
If I go on my way without you
Woooahh where would I go

I'm having flashbacks
Let me relax my dome
My whole joints blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva

Ties will never sever
You died tryin to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin in peace don't even stress that beef

Go head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
Everytime I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
Its all over bearing witness like jehovah
ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover

Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his bodys underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol

Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue

[Chorus: x2]

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table BLAOW
It happened all alone in his house

Not a creature was stirrin, not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin Sega
And buggin on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone

I'm speakin on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
 
He used to talk about the box in the closet
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street

I can't explain it, its ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin wit that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin

[Chorus: x2]

Ah-yo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin nearer
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes its gettin clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brothers bad scratch

Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin no crap

Another rugrat, somebody tell me where the loves at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something

But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

[Chorus: x4]",Move On,2004
The Wildhearts,"Top to tail with good advice
To get to know me, if I could only be
A little bit more like Jesus Christ
Is that so easy? you know the lady likes
Passion wisdom wealth and wonder, custom made at retail price
It all sounds good to me, and it'll happen naturally

If ya...
Show a little love, show a little emotion, it ain't a sin to be crying
Show a little pain, show a little emotion, babe
(Maybe) ('n you can) show a little love for (me)

Take one chance you could be right
So what's your problem? you're only softening at the
Pressures of one more lonely night
But that's so easy, we know the lady likes
Pleasures found in downtown places, whisky straight and drugs for free
Where the folks don't really care, but there's a sense of style you share

If ya...
Show a little love, show a little emotion, it ain't a sin to be crying
Show a little pain, show a little emotion, babe
(Maybe) ('n you can) show a little love for (me)

You say you're mine, but you don't show it
You say I'm blind, and man I know it
But I can show my feelings aloud without the fear of splitting with the crowd
So baby, don't say you love me

Because you're scared of giving friendship 'case you never get it back
Mistaking independence for the courage that you lack
And you're terrified of missing out on changes in your scene
So you cling on to your status like some life-support machine
Because weakness is too feminine, you dress up like a boy
'til you get so fucking down, you forget what girls enjoy
You'll realise a compromise was not what they said it would be
So why don't you show me...

Come on
Show a little love, show a little emotion, it ain't a sin to be crying
Show a little pain, show a little emotion, babe
You can show a little love, show a little love for...",Show a Little Emotion,2008

Now your baby ain't nowhere around

And you were so proud of it

Someone you can't rely on
No matter what you say

The Wildweeds,"I can't stand the pain of love
When you get all the love
I can't stand the pain of life
I can't even stand the shock. 
But when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand itI can't stand it
I can't stand itI can't stand it
When you stand close to me
You makes me kind of weak

She sat alone on a bus out of Beaumont
The courage of just 18 years
A penny and quarter were taped to a letter
And momma's goodbye in her ears

She watched as her high school faded behind her
And the house with the white picket fence
Then she read the note that her momma had wrote
Wrapped up with 26 cents

When you get lonely, call me
Anytime at all and I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give
And money is never enough
Here's a penny for your thoughts
A quarter for the call
And all of your momma's love

A penny and a quarter buys a whole lot of nothing
Taped to an old wrinkled note
And when she didn't have much she had all momma's love
Inside that old envelope

When you get lonely, call me
Anytime at all and I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give
And money is never enough
Here's a penny for your thoughts
A quarter for the call
And all of your momma's love

Oh its been years since momma's been gone
But when she holds the coins she feels her love just as strong

I've been lyin' in the shadows
In the corner of my room
Turned off the lights
Gave up the fight
There was nothing I could do

Then I just woke up on morning
And I put on my walkin' shoes, and

I'm back on my feet again
Had all the heartache one woman can stand
Got through the night
Took back my life
I'm back on my feet again

I wasn't sure if I could make it
Had to crawl across the floor
Through the broken glass
Of my shattered past
Pushed myself on through the door

I took a step out of the darkness
I don't need it anymore, no
I just woke up one morning
And I put on my walkin' shoes, now",Back on My Feet,1998

Boy oh boy looked at me
Boy oh boy smiled that way
Boy oh boy this heart of mine stood still
Thought my world was unaffected
'Til the moment I least expect it
Boy oh boy love's moving in for the kill

And I'm fallin' this spell I'm under
I don't know what's up or down
I'm fallin it makes me wonder
Why I've spent time foolin' 'round with boys
Boy oh boy this must be love

Boy oh boy I feel so shaken
Boy oh boy can't be mistaken
This is more than passion at first sight
His brown eyes tell the truth
I'm sure he feels the way I do
'Cause boy oh boy I'm certain
That it's right, right, right

Hey Mrs. Smith is your daughter home
Is she off the phone, I've been trying to call her
Mrs. Smith I can't explain
We were at the game
And something happened

I took her hand and I stole a kiss
I guess you know that I'm new at this

(Momma) Don't I have a heart
Don't I have two arms
This can't all be imagination
Tell me how you know
When true love really starts
I don't have a clue
But don't I have a heart

Mrs. Smith do you really mean it
I can't believe it, she said that too
You both stayed up until way past one
No homework done and she said to you
He stole a kiss and I looked at him
But he didn't even try again

(Momma) Don't I have a heart
Don't I have two arms
This can't all be imagination
Tell me how you know

Hey Mrs. Smith I hope I'm not out of place
Please go get her gotta tell her face to face

The Wilkinsons,"Sometimes I swear I live with an angel
Sent from above to watch over me
He wears his love like a halo
If he's not an angel, what else can he be
He wouldn't say he's anything special
Betcha that's how all those angels are
But when he comes around miracles happen
I felt the first one when he touched my heart

Though I've never seen him fly
On the wings of love he carries me
Heaven bound I'm mystified
How with just one kiss he made me
Believe in angels
Though I've never seen him fly

This mornin' he walked up
Smiled and I kissed him
I never let on that he's not foolin' me
But I think it's so cute how he says
He's from Houston
I swear there's wings tucked up his sleeves

Though I've never seen him fly
On the wings of love he carries me
Heaven bound I'm mystified
How with just one kiss he made me
Believe in angels

You'll never know how close we came
The word goodbye was almost spoken
Just one more thoughtless word
And I was ready to leave

Then the thought of how I'd feel
Waking up one day without you
I closed the door and turned around
You wouldn't believe it if you had seen it

There I was the note was even written
Seven pages it took all day
Where I was I'd made my decision
With nothing but love standing in the way

This is worth the empty cab
This is worth the bag unpacking
If only the lesson learned
I'm glad the go through this
Moment of truth, yeah

Nothing but the touch of your hand
Nothing but your kiss, I know
Didn't even have to think twice 
Baby, how could I go",Nothing But Love,1998
The Wilkinsons,"Time, it goes so fast
Like a river running past
And you're lucky if you find at last
Just one faithful heart

So I watch her as she sleeps
All curled up in her dreams
And somewhere beneath quilt and sheets
Gently beats one faithful heart

Constant as the northern star
And as sure as gravity
Her love makes me complete
And makes this life sweet

This night will slip on by
Soon she'll open up her eyes
And I will see the light that shines
From one faithful heart

I live to see the light that shines
From her faithful heart

Another Monday morning
Gotta clear my head
No more time for dreaming
Traffic was a nightmare
Boss is on my back
If I hear one more cross word
I think I'm gonna crack

Then there's you
Coming in right on cue
When I say no can do
You give me strength to fight
To see that there's shades of blue
Everything's black and white
And then there's you

The sky is clear this morning
Looks like a brighter day
And I don't need to worry
When it fades away

('Cause) Then there's you
Someone to hold on to
When all of my plans fall through
You give me strength to fight
To see that there's shades of blue
Everything's black and white

You keep me warm when nights are cold
You, you light a fire in my soul",Then There's You,1998

My momma always told me
Don't you hang around those
Williamstown boys
And don't be blind girl they're not our kind
But she never met Willy McCoy

The sun comes up at his house
The same as it does at mine
And why the two of us should never touch
Is something I just can't get through my mind

In a passing car I saw him through the window
I could swear I caught him looking back
If there's a chance for love to grow 
I might never know
'Cause I'm stuck here
On the right side of the tracks

Funny how a set of rusty rails
Built a wall that we can't break down
I know my baby's just a stone's throw away
But it's a million miles from here
To Williamstown 

And if that train still stopped here at the station
We could hop on board, and never look back
Until love can cross the line
Between his world and mine
I'm stuck here on the right side of the tracks",Williamstown,1998

I don't recognize this face
Even the mirror is showin' me a different face
What's that grin, where'd it come from
I can't seem to make it stop

But I'm afraid to say the word...Love
I don't think I've ever been in...Love
Symptomatically this is possibly
(You say it)...Love

Well, I've heard friends talk about it
I've seen them get that look in their eyes
They go all melancholy and start to testify
They say oh you'll know, when it hits you
It'll knock you off your feet
It breaks the rules of logic
And the laws of gravity

But it's too soon to say the word...Love

Parenthetically this is probably
(Could be)...Love

You say I'm actin' crazy
I say this ain't no act
I'm just as serious as a heart attack
I give up I surrender, now that I know it's true
I wanna tell the world
My heart belongs to you

Now it's time to say the word...Love
I just wanna shout...Love
It automatically leaps right out of me

Just in case I haven't said it enough
Let me repeat it, I'm in love...

Billy was a rocker down in Baton Rouge
Liked to sing country in his tennis shoes
He grew up in the sixities on rock and roll
But he got him a gig in a country show
He travelled with them all across the USA
But one night in the middle of the set they say
He got his rockin' rhythm roots
And country confused
He sang the yodelin' blues

(Yodel)

Well the band thought Billy was a crazy fool
But that yodelin' thing he did was powerful cool
So they worked all week
And they got it just right
To play down at the club again Saturday night
And the crowd went screamin'
Crazy plum unglued
All the girls thought Billy was a happenin' dude
They said hey hey Billy
Do whatever you choose
Just sing the yodelin' blues

So they got a big bus and a semi too

Need to drag a brush
Across that head
The crack of noon
And you're still in bed
Straighten up, wake up
Put on your make up

Cut his head
Out of every picture
Burn the letters
Where he said his missed ya
All those memories
You can kiss 'em

Is for sure enough

And shake it up

I'm not pretending, it's easy mending
Love that shattered almost in two
People we give in to hasty decision
Pray there's a still a way to hold onto all that we're gonna lose

If we can't get through this one blue day
If we can just borrow
Some from hope, from tomorrow
Or steal some sweet memories from the past

We might find the healing
We're so desperately needing
Or get back the love we once had
Times that we slept in on Sunday morning

Under the covers holding each other
Side by side like two dinner spoons
That's what we're gonna lose
If we can't get through this one blue day

So tell me forgiveness is somewhere within us
Even though I know our souls are black and blue
There's still hope for me and you
If we can make it through this one blue day

There's hope for me and you
If we can just get through this one blue day",One Blue Day,2005
The Wilkinsons,"You used to think I was invisible
So small that I was indivisible

You always treated me like just one of the guys
But lately you've been acting so confused
Playing it cool, but now it's me that sees through you
It's clear to everyone so don't act so surprised

c'mon, c'mon, you know you want me
You think I'm sexy, don't you?
You think I'm beautiful

c'mon, c'mon, you know you want me
C'mon and say it, you gotta face it
You know you want me

You act so tough with all your friends around
But all alone with your defenses down

What you're feeling now is way too strong to fight
You fumble every opportunity
Slow advance and then quick retrieve
Oh, you see the bait but you're afraid to bite

c'mon, c'mon, you know you want me
You think I'm sexy, don't you?
You think I'm beautiful

c'mon, c'mon you know you want me

You want me to be here when you see your way clear
To carry on, that's where you're wrong

I'm rolling away the stone

I'm gonna resurrect my smile

I'm tire of staying home alone

Tonight I'm going out in style


Chorus:

I've been dying to start living again

Tired of trying to get through nights that never end

No more waiting, wasting time on a heart that's slow to mend

I've been dying to start living again


I'm sorry if it hurts your pride

When you see me with somebody new

Acting like I'm born again

Acting like I'm over you


Chorus:

I've been dying to start living again

Tired of trying to get through nights that never end

No more waiting, wasting time on a heart that's slow to mend

I've been dying to start living again


Somewhere in the heart of this town

That's where you will find me now

These days I wake up in some place new

Where my old guitar's the only familiar face in this room

And if I close my eyes I don't have to think real hard

I can almost see me standing in my old backyard


Chorus:

There's no place like home

It holds you like a warm soft kiss

Home, it's the one place that you know you're missed

I could travel around this world

No matter where I go

A part of me will always be at home


There's a world of things that money just can't buy

Like the smell of momma's coffee, the sound of crickets in July

Sometimes I dream I'm back there once again

In a town you can't pass through without shaking someone's hand


Chorus:

There's no place like home

It holds you like a warm soft kiss

Home, it's the one place that you know you're missed

I could travel around this world

No matter where I go

A part of me will always be at home


Miles and dreams may come between us

But no one's gonna steal the feeling

Of the place where you grew up


Chorus:

Home, it holds you like a warm soft kiss

Home, it's the one place that you know you're missed

I could travel around this world

No matter where I go

A part of me will always be at home


The heart of me will always be at home

Tomorrow can wait right now I just

Want to fall asleep in your arms tonight


If I should die before I wake

The last I'll prayer I'll pray

Oh, the last wish I'll make

In an office on the 22nd floor

He never sees how Jenny's eyes light up each day

When he walks through that door

While she's wishin' she could be the one

To fill his every need

He's looking back at love he lost

Somewhere in Tennessee

Becky slams the bedroom door

Her mama says tonight she's stayin' in

What gives her the right to make up

All the rules and try to pick her friends

Becky doesn't understand a single mother's job is tough

And all her rules are just reflections of a mama's love

'Til we never even notice

If we read between the lines

There's so much waitin' for us

If we only look behind

Under the Rainbow


Got my head up in the clouds

And my feet on Main Street

We got one flashing traffic light,

A Dairy Dip, and a decent Football team

We got a stop sign on each corner

That old factory down the road

I got an 86 Toyota,

Gassed up and waitin' for my chance to go


Somehow, Someway, Somewhere, Someday

I'll find my way down that yellow brick road

Before my dreams disappear somewhere,

Under the rainbow


Last year at county highschool,

Graduated twenty kids

Now five or six are havin' babies

All the rest are working first, or second shift

I don't put myself above em'

I'm no better that's for sure

Part of me will always love em'

But, a bigger part is wantin' so much more


Somehow, Someway, Somewhere, Someday

I'll find my way down that yellow brick road

Before my dreams disappear

Somewhere, Under the rainbow


I wish all I had to do

Was click some ruby shoes

Gotta get outta here

Before my dream's disappear

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

The Williams Sisters,"Now on the day of Pentecost, when it was fully Come, they were all in one place, they were all with one accord. And sound came down from Heaven, as rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house, the Spirit came on in. Now you don't have to wonder, Who was in the House, it was the power of the Holy Ghost, that's what we're singing about. We need.

Chorus1: Power in the house, We need Power in the house, Nothing but Power in the house, Holy Ghost Power, in the house! 

Now when all this took place, they began to Speak with tongues. Tongues like fire that filled everyone! But if you look at churches today, so many have gone a stray, not much singing, not much shouting, they don't even want to pray. But you don't have to wonder, what's going on inside, the devil just stepped right in, and took them all for a ride. We need....

Chorus 2: Power in the house, We need Power in the house, Nothing but Power in the house, Santified Power in the house! 

Now the Lord told his people, come on in the Upper room, the Apostles were there, the disciples were there, and the mother of Jesus too, and if they had to be endowed, with power from on high, what about you? What about me? We cannot, get by! But listen; You don't have to wonder, what's being said to you. Clap your hands and stomp your feet and let the Power come on through...We need. Chorus 2

We need Power! Power! Come on in!

Bridge: I said Come on in (if you are a liar), Come on in (if you are a back biter) Come on in (turn around and walk on in here) Come on in (if you are a drug addict), Come on in, (Need to get on in here) Come on in, (Need to get on in here).Come on in, (Let me tell you who is in the House, y'all,) Come on in, (Let me tell you who is in the House, y'all!)

The Willis Brothers,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

And lay my heart at the foot of your dress?""

Always have a happy ending?""

And on his stallion they rode away

On a Monday mornin' you see 'em all there
Little children they're marching along
On a sunny mountain without any cares
Little children they're marching along

Marching along, siging a song
Making rhythm and rhyme
It used to be somthing to see
They don't keep track of the time

If the rain comes down
They put on their coats
Little children they're marching along
If it gets too floody
They get in their boats
Little children they're marching along

Marching along, siging a song
Making rhythm and rhyme
It used to be somthing to see
They don't keep track of the time

Poor little wendy she's too scared to speak
Little children they're marching along
And look at little carnie with dirt on her cheek
Little children they're marching along
It's three fifteen it's time to go home
Little children they're marching along
You can't kiss no one until you get home
Little children they're marching along
Marching along
Marching along
Marching along
Marching along

I'd have to be stupid to go on wi' this,
I wasn't born yesterday, or even last week,
It's someone with sailing experience ye seek?
I wouldn't sail with you's on the last ship aground,
In a biblical flood, I'd be better off drowned,
So drink up yr bevies and have a good sup,
I'll no part o' this fancy O' Brian's dreamed up,
Find some other idiot to pilot your craft,
And tomorrow ye'll be sober.

I had a friend on the ships his name was Joe Dorsey,
He'd get into port he'd be straight to the horsies,
He begged and he pleaded, he was some operator,
600 to one, and he'd pay me back later,
He claimed it was certain that we'd be in clover,
And the next time we sailed past the White Cliffs of Dover,
We'd be sailing a yacht of our own to the Med,
I lent him the money, I was out of me head,
I didn't see hide of him for nine months, maybe ten,
And didn't the bastard just ask me again?
For the loan of a tenner he'd pay me back soon,
All the money he owed me, I answered the loon,

A passionate courtship albeit brief,
But what happened next, it just beggared belief,
If I tell ye, ye'll be sober.
The second night in she claims she's with child,
Afore yesterday night she'd been pure, undefiled,
I must be the father, court papers she'd filed,
So what did I tell her me rovers?

And ye don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.
Why I'm as hard as iron plate, woe betide ye if yer late,
When we have to push the boat out on a spring tide.
Now ye could die and hope for Heaven, but ye'd need to work your shift,
And I'd expect ye's all to back us to the hilt.
And if St. Peter at his gate were to ask ye why yer late,
Why you'd tell him that ye had to get a ship built.
We built battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen,
Super tankers for Onassis, and all the classes in between,
We built the greatest shipping tonnage that the world has ever seen,
And the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

All the platers and the welders, and the boiler making crews,
When they see that bugger finished on the slipway,
All the hardship's soon forgot and we'll cheer as like as not,
And the bairns'll wave their Union Jacks all day.
It's a patriotic scene, all that's missing is the Queen,
But she said she couldn't make it of a Tuesday.
Then something wells up here inside, and you could take it in yer stride,
But you wonder if you'll see another payday.

For there's a mixture of emotions, hatred, gratitude and pride,
And you hate yourself for crying but it's difficult to hide,
For there's a sadness in the leavin' and ye worry what's ahead,
And that worry never leaves ye, keeps on nagging in yer head,
And so ye pray to God for orders, but ye'll worry till yer dead…
Until they bury your remains in the blacksmith's shed,
And the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
And I don't know what we'll do if this yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

[Additional lyrics not included on the track]
My name is Adrian Sanderson and riveting's me trade,
But it's intellectual discourse I'm known better for,
And I may forego English grammar when I'm injured with a hammer,
But I've a preference for the deference of a metaphor.

I've read the Odyssey by Homer and the Iliad as well,
I read Tacitus and Pliny and the Scarlet Pimpernel,
I put a night shift in with Dante on his journey into Hell,
And that's what we'll all be facing if the yard's put up to sell,
For the only life ye've known is in the shipyard.

Now what about those Trojan wars? And the troubles that they caused?
When they sailed off on that summer's afternoon?

[Tommy Thompson]
Aye, the ship they had was crap and they'd lost the effin' map,
When they tried to get their selves back to the toon.

[Adrian Sanderson]
There's a lesson in these tales although they happened ages past,
Just like in ""Spartacus"" that film by Stanley Kubrick.
First it's tragedy then farce then they'll kick you in the arse,
When you tempt the gods with arrogance and hubris.

Well it's obvious I'm gifted with the rhymin' and the meter,
And hereabouts I'm thought of highly as a bard.
If I wasn't shooting rivets I'd be famous in me time,
All those literary circles I could dazzle with me rhyme,
And I never lacked ambition you could say it was a crime,
And rivets may be riveting but sonnets are sublime,
But the only life I've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,

Ah, me name is Tommy Thompson, I'm shop steward for the Union,
Me dream is proletarian revolution,
Comrades, brothers, fellow travellers and others,
Class struggle is the means of dialectic evolution.

Das Kapital's me bible and the ruling class are liable,
And quoting Marx and Engels, it's entirely justifiable,
If the workers' revolution here is ever to be viable,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

So it's a one-day stoppage, or an overtime ban,
Or a work to rule for the Five Year Plan.
'Til the means of production are safely in our hands,
And we become the rightful owners of this shipyard.

I'm not saying it won't be hard if the boss hands us me cards,
When they try to close us down like other shipyards.
And if industrial action only helps the competition,
As I've heard the bosses bleating from their usual position,
And I stand accused of anarchy, disruption and sedition,
Well ye'll never knock us down, you reactionary clowns!
When it's time for occupation of the shipyard.

My name is Peggy White,
And I've nursed ye through your injuries and yer cuts and wounds I've bound.
Busted arms, and busted heads,
Broken backs and broken legs,
I'd sooner put ye in a splint than have them put ye in the ground.
And the fumes from all the welding where the poison air is hung,
And the toxic radiation that's been blackening your tongue,
I could give you's all an aspirin while you're coughing up your lungs,
But it's all you'll ever get here in this shipyard.

[Additional lyrics not included on the track]
My name is Arthur Cook, I'm the Union superintendent,
Where I represent the interests of ye's all.
And I listen to you men as you talk about the future,
But the truth is that we're heading for a God almighty fall.
But it's clear that intervention's not the government's intention,
'Cos they've got no need for ships, now have I got your full attention?
While the closing of the yard may be beyond your comprehension,
I'm the one who sees the writin' on the shipyard wall.

I've begged and I've pleaded at every meeting that we've held,
That we limit our demands to this reality,
It's like two different metals in a join ye cannot weld,
And there's nothing to be gained from this dream of solidarity.
There's nowt for us to bargain with when the industry's at sea,
It must be obvious to you as it's obvious to me,
And my advice to all of you's is to take redundancy,
And accept that there's no future in this shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
But I don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard.

Ah, me name is Davy Harrison, I like a drink or two,
You could ask me when it started but I haven't got a clue.
I'm never sad or miserable I'm never ever blue,
And I'll still be up tomorrow for the shipyard.

I drink meself into a stupor and I wake up with two heeds,
And then the missus starts complainin' about all me drunken deeds,
Like when I got the train to Sunderland but found meself in Leeds,
And I had to get up early for the shipyard.

I once gave up the drinking, was it 1963?
But it seems as if sobriety was not the thing for me,
It was the worst three hours I ever hope to see…

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole.
And the ship sets sail and the tale gets told,
And the only life I've known is in the shipyard.

Steel in the stockyard,
Iron in the soul,
We'll get the bastard finished, and we'll end up on the dole.
And we don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold,
The only life we've ever known is in the shipyard.",Shipyard,2013

Think on that ship on the slipway they can't ignore us.
It's what he would have wanted, he'll not be disappointed,
Each of us well appointed, we've all but been anointed,
Such was our occupation, this means of our salvation,
We'll make a rope out of our dreams and hopes and tribulations.
We'll weave these strands together, we'll splice a rope and tether,
And though we won't know whether, it's fair or stormy weather,
We'll quit this quay,
And we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea.

Pick up your tools, we're not fools to be treated lightly,
We'll weld our souls to the bulkheads, secure them tightly,
We'll use the skills and the crafts that our fathers taught us,
We work with pride, not as slaves, no one ever bought us.

We'll weave a net of our dreams and our hopes between us,
We'll be the envy of that sorry bunch who'll wish they'd been us,
We'll form a web of steel, a structure that will not be broken,
We'll be the heroes of the day whenever tales are spoken.

And as the dance gets faster, we'll build a double master,
No vessel will outlast her, no other ship gets past her,
We'll quit this quay,
And we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea.

Come strike the floor with your feet all you lads and lasses,
And if you're too old to dance, you can raise your glasses,
Just come on in, take a spin, in your dreams ye've held her.
What are ye? Man or a mouse, or a shipyard welder?

Shy bairns get nowt for waiting, so why ye hesitating?
Ships don't get built debating, or launched just contemplating.
Wear out your old shoe leather, we're in this dance together,
We'll pull the blades and feather, in fair or clement weather.
Each one of us connected, all trades and skills respected,
Always to be expected, we will not be deflected,
We'll quit this quay,
And we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea.

Show some respect, fill the deck, get the lassies twirling,
'Cos they expect to be swept off their feet and whirling,
Life is a dance, a romance where ye take your chances,
Just don't be left on the shores of regretful glances.
We may not drive Rolls Royces, we're hardly spoilt for choices,
If we're to pay invoices, we'll need to raise our voices.
Our strength is in communion, this boilermakers' union,
The shipwright welders' guilds, with every working station filled.

These bonds we've spliced together, will face all kinds of weather,
Considered altogether, and sailing Hell for leather,
We'll quit this quay,
And we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea.

When we cast this net of souls upon the sea?",Show Some Respect,2013
The Wilson Family,"Me first day in the shipyard, the gaffer says to me,
""I want ye to go to the store lad and get a few things, ye see?
Now here's a list, can ye read lad? Can ye read it back to me?
And me and the boys'll listen while were having wah morning tea.""

Now reading was me pride when I left school at fourteen,
There wouldn't be no problem here, I'd show them I was keen,
But when I starts to reading, they just couldn't hold their mirth,
Hugging themselves and spluttering like they was giving birth.

""First off a brace of sky hooks and a packet of nail holes neat,
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete.""
The gaffer pats me on the head and sends me on me way,
He says, ""Don't come back empty handed lad, or I'll have to dock yer pay.""

So I gets to the store all nervous and the quartermaster's there,
I pulls the list out of me pocket and I starts to read all square,
Well I hadn't barely finished when the store-man's face turns red,
He gives me such an evil look I thought I'd soon be dead.

""First off a brace of sky hooks and a packet of nail holes neat,
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete.""
The store-man swipes me on the head and sends me on me way,
With a kick in the arse for me efforts, and such was my first day.

I gets back home that evening and me mother says to me,
""How was it son? How was your day? Sit down and have some tea.""
I told her of the list I'd read and the trouble I was in,
I couldn't go back tomorrow or the gaffer'd have me skinned.

The Wilson Family,"In 18 hundred and 59, the engineer Brunel,
Would build the greatest ship afloat, and rule the ocean's swell.
Nineteen thousand tons of steel they used to shape the mighty keel,
Forged inside the smelter where they made the gates of Hell…
And the name upon the contract, Isambard Brunel.

As day-by-day the monster grew, the engineer Brunel,
Would watch the devil's handiwork, and woe betide a man who shirks,
Or slows the pace to build the keel, nineteen thousand tons of steel,
Anyone with eyes to see is but a bride of Hell,
And the name upon the draftsman's chart, Isambard Brunel.

A riveter was on the hull with his apprentice lad,
He'd served his time with the older man, some say it was his dad.
200 men upon the shift but when the day is done,
The count is hundred 98…before the setting sun,
They searched the yard all through the night until the morning bell,
No more delays are countenanced by Isambard Brunel,
And so they work a double shift, to make the time in full,
No mention of the missing men… they seal the double hull.

The ship was launched upon the tide and all the townsfolk cheered,
A brass band played but not a word of omens they had feared,
But before the afternoon was out, the celebration wrecked,
A dignitary clutched his heart…and collapsed upon the deck.
No doctors could revive him as the telegraphs would tell,
And the name upon the coffin… Isambard Brunel.

And now upon the open sea, the mighty ship did plough,
But many feared the darkness, in the shadow of its prow.
An explosion on the lower deck, would take the souls of five,
With a growing superstition 'mong the sailors still alive.

The captain and his boy are lost while rowing to the shore,
The crew will threaten mutiny and say they'll work no more,
They began to say the ship was cursed, they hadn't even seen the worst,
They'd signed on able-bodied men, but they wouldn't sail to Hell…
When the name upon the manifest is Isambard Brunel.

For 14 years that ship will sail, misfortune taken hard,
The owners barely find a crew to reach the breakers' yard.
And as they take the plates apart, unseal the double hull,
The breakers call the foreman o'er, they'd found a human skull.
And then they find the younger man, perforced to understand,
That in the hour of their torment, he'd reached his father's hand.

In 18 hundred and 59, the engineer Brunel,
Would build the greatest ship afloat, and rule the mighty swell.
The final shift was over, and the breakers' hammers fell,
And the name upon the manifest, the contract signed in Hell,
Was the same as on the draftsman's chart… one Isambard Brunel.",Ballad of the Great Eastern,2013

But her mind is awhirl when she finds the tomb empty

Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage,
For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility,
And there's none of them famous for their compatibility.

But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in yer place!""

There was a star in the east shining bright
Shepherds sitting out on a hill
Watching their sheep lying still

They got on their camels and began to ride

Followed the star to a keeper's stall
There found the greatest gift of all

(Talking 'bout the)
Real meaning of Christmas
You know the real meaning
Of Christmas is Christ

Over the years things have changed
Christmas day has lost it's zing
Instead of celebrating His birth
And praising His presents in the earth

We've turned this day into a fairytale
Frosty men and red-nosed deer
A holiday just for me
A sale on a shopping spree

To seek Him is still wise
And to find Him just look inside
If at this time we get real still
We find out what the meaning is

(For the)
Real meaning of Christmas
(I've found out the)
Real meaning of Christmas
Hey, the real meaning
Of Christmas is Christ
(Yes, it is)

Oh, now
Give gifts on that day
Well it's fine, it's okay
Alright to say ""I love you""
Show someone you care

But when you give
Just give it in His name
Lift a heart and ease the pain
Make a child smile a while

Holding our own in a great big storm
It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own
Holding our own in a great big storm
It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own

I’ve been lost in this maze
Losing love, losing friends
Losing faith in chemicals
Afraid one day you’ll find me
Asleep above the stars
I watch my mother cry
Father Time is catching up
I keep the phone by my side
Afraid she’ll wake me up to catch the next flight
In time to say goodbye

But sometimes I fall asleep at night
To the TV light and it sings
Oh ooo whoa oh
One day the sun will break into the room

Because we’re holding our own in a great big storm
And though we’re cutting it close
We won’t let go
Oh no I can’t believe
Everything falling down around me
But now we’re holding our own
And won’t let go
Holding our own in a great big storm
It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own
Holding our own in a great big storm
It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own

Broken hearts broken homes and broken bones
Secret love let me go
You know I gotta find my own way
Through mistakes that I can’t change
Because there’s beauty in every sin
Every single black eye
Has some blue like the moon just before the sun shines
No I don’t believe in all the things that they preach

But sometimes I fall asleep at night
And I just know you’re smiling at me
Oh ooo whoa oh
One day I’m gonna make this up to you

It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own

I can’t stand myself
And all the curse words that fall from my mouth
I can’t stand myself
Or my legs as they run from the ones here to help
But I just woke up with you next to me
Some new air to breathe
And a belief that it’s all gonna be alright
I can’t stand myself
But it’s high time that we gave it a try
And I think I’m gonna finally give myself a new try

Because I'm holding our own in a great big storm

To begin the beguine [wait]

Don't you say, don't ever ask why to what you are
Race along the road to rack or ruin
Or where ever you are

With half an eye I'll discover why nothing makes sense
With half a lout in substance will out
Hear me why I will not be torn from what is mine
You're going to tremble
It's the magic of fools in all the ways and all the ways
Half an eye discover why that nothing makes sense
You don't need me to see that I was never here at all
You race along the road to wherever you go

To help oblige this need to belong
Fires crack crack crack

When my life is in the balance, neither peace nor moral's wake

People say that I was sad, people say that I was bad
People walking around with other feelings
They never want to contemplate

Reaching out for love but would never say
The churches have a network leading to the sect and to the soul
They levitate their founder's faith up to a higher ground
While we stay home

I am a wicked man
I will not be this unsound
I was a wretched man before I filled this hole
When Jesus was upon his cross he never was this alone

They're playing on our weaknesses and changing every sound
Who could find the right solution when they're being drowned
Har de har the vacant talk can make you see their ways
Now check your faith and sleep with love the modern way
Now is that love, Christianity has nothing for me

This Jerusalemic holy ground is only fit for mealy mouths
Whose contamination breeds subordination
I've said too many times but who leads that kind of life
When my time comes around who will plead my innocence

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1989

Once or twice was enough, but it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it, you're frozen
But something happened, for the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein, that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal, is to keep me from falling
But nothings greater, than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me, thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

It was a chat-up line built not to impress
More a sleazy remark on her whorish dress
My wires crossed like they've never done before
Well it's 3 o' clock and I'm feeling shite
I'm going home alone tonight
I made a move when it was well out of context

It backfired at the disco, she slapped me at the disco

Oh, what a skill to have, oh, what a skill to have

No, I don't care about the soaps
No, I don't care about the soaps

Don't talk to girls, they'll break your heart
And this is my head and this is my spout
They work together, they can't figure anything out

So, with the angst of a teenage band
Here's another song about a gender I'll never understand

My concerns were with prank calls.

She kissed me on the cheek,
She kissed me on the cheek,
Right in front of the older kids,
But my self belief, my self belief,
Wasn’t scarred by the modern itch.

Because now it feels like,
We kissed with one eye on our T.V. set,
And the more I give, the less I get,
Using fairground rides just to spark her smile,
Too little hit to miss,
Bring back 1996
Bring back 1996,
I want to beat those teenage kicks,
Bring back 1996.

We were cloning sheep in the 1990s,
We were building telescopes,
And sugar filled the whole of my body,
As I edged it all to grow.

I kissed her on the cheek,
I kissed her on the cheek,
Just to impress the older kids,
But my self belief, my self belief,
Wasn’t lost in the modern glitch.

And the more I give, the less I get,

So cast away with the doctor's plans

Familiar feelings just the same 

Soon too the warm air comes by 
Lie back and stare at blue skies 
Thinking back away and from 
When I'll be here and you'll be gone 

Further, further, further, further, 
Further, further, further, further from me 

I think now of summers high 
And reminisce of past times gone by 
Only remembered now in 
Earth, trees the stars that have been there 
And there forever held 
Kept safe but memories never told 
But felt if you went by 
In never changing sky 

And will be gone 

Further, further, further, further, 
Further, further, further, further 
Further, further, further, further, 
Further, further, further, further

Collecting clothes, moonshine, washing line

Distorted view, see-through baby blue

He dug it

Takes two to know

Two to know, two to know

Why can't you see ?

Now he's caught a nasty sort of person

They gave him time, doors slam chain gang

A fool can not wait.

And looks in the eyes of an angel.

Why...? it's because my angel is you.

Time, I see you wasting all this time,

But it's not mine. it's your dime.

Time, I see you running on the line

And it's not right to fear the light.

And all the things you said, you understood well.

The past is gone

And there's no welcome in your eyes.

Time, I feel you wasting all this time

And it's a crime. it's so sublime.

And all the things we did, you understood well.

We can't deny. there's no hiding this disguise.

Oooh, gonna let you down

Oooh, gonna let you down this time.

And I'll be fine.

Oooh, let you down.

Oooh, gonna let you down this time

And never pay you mind.

To join with mine. it's so unkind.

Don't throw love away

Because I went astray for awhile

[Verse 1]

You bring your face to mine
Your anger wells inside
You speak your wasted mind
And mine is wasting
You drag me deep inside
The depths of wide decline
And I could not prepare
For the fall

[Pre-chorus]

You're frozen uncertain empty inside
I've fallen so deep I can't see the light

[Chorus]

I'm bleeding my hands are cold
Someone save me
I've trusted what I can't see
But everyone is blind

[Verse 2]

It took me so long to break the chains of time
Servant freedom comes from the inside
They could not see you tearing apart everything
Such a small one you wanted love

[Pre-chorus 2]

Dilated frustrated you can't get out
My fingers keep shaking it's all in vain

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

I was born for this I swear strengthen me
This is the part where I break down on my knees
Maybe the words have lost their shape but I need you
To paint the picture I can't see for 
We are blind
Can't you see

Let insipid figures of light pass by
The mighty light of ten thousand suns
Challenges infinity and is soon gone

To others the fear of solitude

Watch lights fade from every room

Senior citizens wish they were young

Problem solved, time cannot be won

They've got time
Take a step back out

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

And did it my way

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

Is it love or is it me
That makes me change so suddenly
From looking out to feeling free?

I sit here lying in my bed
Wondering what it was I said
That made me think I lost my head
When I knew I lost my heart instead

So won't you please read my signs?
Be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
And because you can find my mind
Please be with me

And of all the better things I've heard
Loving you has made the words
And all the rest seem so absurd
'Cause in the end it all comes out I'm sure

And because you can find my mind

Made mine behind the barb wire fences
Crossfire tent winters
Saw my man blow, bandana tied tight like Rambo
Burn a slug make the land glow
Niggas screamin for medics and ammo
Every soldier in your camp go

[Big Punisher]
Me and my man Joe got ya back
AKA Joey Crack, AK with the mack, makin my to the pack
Everyday I gotta be strapped, 'cause niggas don't know how to act
You don't wanna go the gap, 'cause T-Squad gonna react
Whatta we go? thugs and ammo, by a hundred tons of guns and rambos
Just in case you comin Commando
I'm a Sopranos and Corleones wit they own armies
And a couple of morrenos that'll die for me

[Kool G. Rap]
Hammers a law under the camouflage here to take jars
Put a cap inside ya cap and leave a four in your sarge
Killas are large, my two trade pound gauge will sound hard
For every round sabotage, bodies hit the ground hard

[Big Punisher]
That's a pound dog bout to get down and put the work
Try the jury but it wouldn't work, skit but it wouldn't merk
He glass, no glass, think fast yo ass too late, muthafucka
Put a d-rap too fast

Ugly stories

""Watch them flee, watch them flee""
""Rap up""
""Watch them flee""
""Hip-Hop hits""
""And you do it like this""

It's going down
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super-futureesque style
The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath
From emotional stress
With special effects
And a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

It's going down
The logical progression on a the time line
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now it's going down

Once again it is
Composed sentences all together venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily through the sound of the source
Everybody on board with this blend
The sword with the pen
The mightiest is the weapons
Swinging right from the chin
The elevate of mental states
Long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends
It's going down
Stalence emulation readily
Trekking through the weaponry
Of the pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be
We invent the steadily
It's going down to sub-terrestrial high
I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots
Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly

I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother said ""Damn, what's next?""

Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin' 
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode

If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Just like I thought 
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""oh I like your size.""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell

The Yardbirds,"Diamonds of silvery rain in the fountains
And ten-cent red roses from department store counters
Watching the moonlight reflect off the river
Beside where the trains cross the bridge and slow down
Trains with white letters on black iron sides
And white rushing water that all rolls away
And Little Miss Someone does not want to stay
Everyone's moving, with places to go
And Mr. Zero, he sadly stands still
As the water goes one way, the train goes another
Mr. Zero stands still, and Miss Someone don't bother

Yesterday's kiss will be cold by tomorrow
As campfires of midnight dissolve in the darkness
The room is deserted, the blinds have been drawn
Little Miss Someone has packed up and gone
Fast moving cars disappear down the highway
With signs that say ""hitch-hikers, do not disturb""
Mr. Zero looks quietly up from the curb
Morning has faded, and shadows have grown
And Little Miss Someone is on her way home
Mr. Zero stands watching, her plane flies above
And with frost-bitten hands, waves goodbye to his love

Walks through the park on a bright summer Sunday
And tapestry kittens that hung on the wall
They all die in the air like a soft minor chord
A vacancy sign and a bulletin board
Mr. Zero is wrapping his jacket around him
Speaking kind words that should have been said long ago
But Little Miss Someone does not want to know
The night is deserted, there's dust on the shelf
Mr. Zero sits lonely and talks to himself
It's too late to change, the fine line has been crossed
The charades are all done, Mr. Zero has lost",Mr. Zero [Performed by Keith Relf -- Solo Single],1966

Next day.

Together made a lot of noise.
The other side formed into ranks,
Proud 'cause they had plastic tanks.
High up on the shelf to see,
The soldier had to jump with glee.
At last before his eyes he saw,
A real war.

With a battle raging on the floor,
The soldier boy was urging more.
Soon the floor was strewn with bits,

The Yardbirds,"If you've ever been to New York City,
You know what I'm talking about,
Yes you do.

Well, if you've ever been to New York City,
You know what I'm talking about,
They got such pretty little girls in that big town,
Make a man want to jump around and shout.
I met a little girl there,
She was about five foot eight.

I said ""I want you to love me.""
She said ""Why man, that'd be great.""

So,
I got long hair but,
She took me back,
Back to see her pad,
But the first thing I saw when I arrived there,
Was a big black shiny shotgun,
In the hands of her dad.

Alright now, this is how it was,
Oh no!
Well alright!
I finally learned my lesson,
Such a long time ago,
Next little woman that I date,
I've got to know, I've got to know her family too.

Yes indeed, I gotta know her family too.
But if you don't want to be filled full of shotgun holes,
Mister, this song is just for you.",New York City Blues,1977
The Yardbirds,"I want somebody here to tell me why,
There's always smoke up in the sky.
Please don't make me want to cry,
Detail has not been seen.
Summer trees should all be green,
Plain and green as they have been,
Sun don't ever change the scene,
Please never let them die.

What do you want? [Repeat: x4]

Sounds which soar above my ears,
Will naturally precede in years,
They only cause a flood of tears,
I want to turn and run.
Don't need someone to make my fun,
Only need to see the sun,
I will not go and cause harm,
I cannot think that way.

What do you want? [Repeat: x4]

Sit spellbound by a flickering screen,
Watch the ever changing scenes,
Listen to the rising screams,
Of children of today.
Lock your doors and stay within,
Upon your face the stupid grins,
Penalty for unrealized sins,
Committed on your way.

Can you judge a man,
By the way he wears his hair?
Can you read his mind,
By the clothes that he wears?
Can you see a bad man,
By the pattern on his tie?

Well then, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I.

Could you tell a wise man,
By the way he speaks or spells?
Is this more important,
Than the stories that he tells?
And call a man a fool,
If for wealth he doesn't strive?

Well then, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I.

Can you condemn a man,
If you're faith he doesn't hold?
Say the colour of his skin,
Is the colour of his soul?
Could you say that men,
For king and country all must die?

Well, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Oh, Mr, you're a better man than I,
Yeah, Mr, you're a better man than I.
