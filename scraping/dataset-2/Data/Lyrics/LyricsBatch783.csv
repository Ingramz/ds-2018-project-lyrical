Nicki Minaj,"I’m talkin bout puttin on, ridin out
Glocks in my ma’s house
Front you with that work
(I done front a nigga’s work)
You say you want that head up
But we don’t fight fair brah
Catch you slippin' from your backside, then knock you out
Ace gone stomp you out, then Buddah gone stomp you out
(Has momma ever see you with a busted eye and busted mouth)
Nine milli pokin' out, 4 Fizzy pokin' out
Death Row days show you what this West Coast about

I'd die for my motherfuckin' nigga
Jump in front a bullet for my motherfuckin' nigga
On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga
Real talk, I don't really fuck with too many niggas
'Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughin' to the bank like the fuckin' money tickle
Drivin' somethin' that you ain't, top off, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro
Don't beef over no ho
And my niggas sellin' keys if you can't open your door
Hope you ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
When it rains it pours, it's dry for my motherfuckin' niggas
I kill for my motherfuckin' niggas
Vice versa, eyes red from the kush I blew
White person, got my middle finger on the trigger
With my little finger to you niggas
I swear it's fuck all y'all niggas

I done spent a million dollars on my muthafuckin niggas

And when we on that lean, we ain’t fuckin with the liquor

She can like it on my bitches
'Cause she see the way I ball, how my wrist and that be lit up
Catch you at the red light, have em screamin “can’t get up""
Same nigga from the bottom ain’t a damn thing change
Catch me out in Collins screamin ""money ain’t a thang""
And them red Mulsanne, lookin like I claim blood
And if homie ain’t my homie than I know it ain’t love
Screamin out ""4 Hunnid,” YG that's my nigga
'Cause I been in the field life on the line with him
And if it’s really good, why I prolly die with em
'Cause when I need the choppers, I just tell Tock hit em

Flossy bitches, Sergio Rossi, bitches
And if we at the game then it's floor seat, bitches!
I ride for my bitches
I'm so fuckin' rich I cop rides for my bitches
Dollar menu fries apple pies otha bitches
I drop a freestyle and get a rise outta bitches
Bitches, my bitches

Need a nigga with some good neck, ostriches

Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out

Worried 'bout John's singing us Drake

When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dealing with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut one, hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was pop quiz

Accountant say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girl from a Bida if she wave
Baby and I fucked with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, treat me like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with arm and guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two goons and they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms

Even though what you was doin’ wasn’t tasteful
Even though you out here lookin’ so ungrateful
I'mma keep it movin’ be classy and graceful
I told 'em it’s no friends in the game, you ain’t learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don’t burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible that they love you
When really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don’t wish death on ‘em
I just reflect on 'em

Yo, people will love you and support you when it’s beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga’s life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good now it’s kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzy
I see the envy when I’m causin' a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em
Cop cribs in the hills on ‘em

Bombs in L.A., bombs in the Bay

Oh, you wanna beat me, how?
Oh, you the number one draft in the league now?

Nicki Minaj,"Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was o' six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know, that I love him
Family ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you

Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I'm love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him

Nicki Minaj,"Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mill' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'mma ask on the song

So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""

We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Nicky B.,"Qui veut ma Peau?

Qui veut mon oseille, se chiera dessus comme à l'époque du landau
Qui veut ma peau, aura la sienne suspendu à un porte manteau
Cascadeur et solidaire tah Belmondo
Tu peux me jeter dans la seine, je reviendrai percé ton dos
Je compte plus les coups d'couteau dans le mien
Je me méfie de l'homme au point de finir maître chien
Tu veux m'faire ? fais le bien!
Qu'on sache pas d'où àa vient
De manière à assurer l'espérance de vie des tiens
Monte au ciel mon assassin par instinct de survie
C'est en glissant sur certaines bombes que la paix a fleurie
Et les hagals se demandent pourquoi autant de violence?
C'est les corbillards qui se foutent des ambulances
Je danse entre les balles qui ricochent
Qui veut manger ma gamelle, la chiera par une poche
L'orgueil me perdra un de ces quatre peut-être
Essaye de décrocher mes couilles, t'en aura quatre quand je vais te la mettre!

Qui veut ma Peau ?
Qui veut mon Oseille?

Isolé dans mon coin, dans une période noir
Kalash' en main, je me suis vu dans le miroir
Les histoires ne m'ont jamais dépassées
Chaque fois que je flirte avec la peur, je finis par la baiser
Je me retrouve à redressé
Une vie pas faite pour moi
Qui chasse le naturel, elle revient en glock derrière toi
Entre elle qui me fait croire, qu'elle a avortée
Et ces gens qu'ils veulent me voir, pour des embrouilles montées
Un appel anonyme destiné qu'à induire
Un journaliste à l'erreur, mais l'horreur a su m'accueillir
Pour vous dire, jusqu'où la jalousie irait pour me nuire
Réussir, dans le ghetto n'empêcherai pas de mal finir
Je rêve de paix
Ma propre chance a la poisse
Sous pression depuis que je fais du sale, à coucher dans l'angoisse
On m'envie trop, pour facilité la tâche
Que veux-tu que j'y fasse ? Que je me cache?
Je pars au clash, pour mon cash
Quitte à ce que je gâche tout!

Qui veut ma Peau?
Qui veut mon Oseille?

Cette après-midi là, mes voisins ont sursauté
Mon 3.5.7 a jacté, un pare-brise à sauté
Les menaces téléphonique, sont venue me parasité
Je ne compte pas sur ma lucidité
Je ne parle pas, j'ai pas hésité
À quelques millimètres de la perpétuité
J'avoue ne pas être le parfait muslim
Je ne suis pas dans un film de ? de cocaïne, everyday I'm Housni
Numéro 1 vaut plus de zéro, j'ai les crocs des blèmes-pro
De l'égo j'en ai trop, les impôts soit disant veulent me taxer des euros
Tu sais qu'on ne manque pas d'audace
Rien à perdre comme ce qui entasse
J'suis pas de ces cas qui se laisse pousser la barbe à la moindre menace
C'est pas du rap de baltringue
La vie nous a tous rendu dingue
Question bonheur, d'oseille qui pourrait m'allumer quand je pourrais t'éteindre!

Lost inside your love",Lost Inside Your Love,1989
Nicky Hopkins,"God of the rich man ain't the god for the poor.
God, men and the state hospital is closed, and wouldn't you know
Winos and office girls in the park.
Wanted you alone to walk beside her,
Wanted you alone to live beside her, it was morning,
Better roads with light on them.

[Chorus]
Can your diamonds talk to you, can you see them shine.
Keep them hiding in your room, can they guide you in your time.
Can they guide you in your time.

Windows were broken by your dear one's hands,
Gates left swinging by your dear one's hands,
An old book salesman asked if he could step in.
The sidewalks you slept on held no rest.
Gave away the money you saved
In your trust, you're sorry now.
Light hits you funny at the time.

[Chorus]

The sidewalks, you slept on
They're so broken. they're so broken down
I'll meet you there. i'll meet you there.

Years before and the trees would start to bloom,
You walked outside, wanted back in your room, what did you hope for.
Turn the corner while you slept ?
God of the rich man ain't the god for the poor.
God, men and the state hospital is closed, and won't you know
Winos and office girls in the park.

[Chorus: x 2]",Clouds,2009
Nicky Hopkins,"He was only six years old
When that old killer died
Put him down in a great big hole
And I fill it up all the time

See the building rise into the sky
Parking meters, traffic cops
You best watch your record, son
They'll come and lock you up

And I've been working all night
I go on into the day
Ain't got much money now
Got the time ahead

You got the time ahead to pay
Smoke and lightning, dressed to kill
And don't talk to strangers
Girl take your pill

Forty years of sudden death
The acid rain is falling on my head
Bush raids on the rise
The doctor's working overtime

Too much of a good thing's not enough
Stepping stones, building blocks
And I've been working all night
I go on into the day

Ain't got much money now
Got the time ahead
You got the time ahead to pay
I've been working all night

I go long into the day
Ain't got much money
Got the time ahead
You got the time ahead to pay

'Cause I've been working all night
I go long into the day
Ain't got much money
Got the time ahead
You got the time ahead to pay",Martin's Song,2009
Nicky Hopkins,"You came and you gave
Without taking
The best was yet to come, I know
For I was forsaken

And so I kept my fingers crossed
To win at any cost
The sound of water falling down

[Chorus]
Knock me down
Pick me up
Set me in a row

Your words hung high in the rafters
And settled down like rain
Remain happy ever after

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

You packed up your bags and belongings
And crept out through the back
The sound of footprints on the ground

Your words hung high in the rafters
And settled down like rain
Remain happy ever after
Happy ever after",Settled Down Like Rain,2009
Nicky Hopkins,"I was waiting for the sun
Then I walked on home alone
What I didn't know
Was he was waiting for you to fall

So I never made amends
For the sake of no one else
For the simple reason
That he was waiting for you to fall

It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me
Walkin' on down the road
Looking for a friend to handout
Somethin' might ease my soul

So I kept my spirits high
Entertaining passers-by
Wrapped in my confusion
While he was waiting for you to fall

It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me
Walkin' on down the road
Looking for a friend to handout
Somethin' might ease my soul

It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me
Walkin' on down the road
Walkin' on down the road
Walkin' on down the road
Walkin' on down the road",Waiting For the Sun,2009

Se acabaron las lágrimas y todos tus melodramas
A ti nadie te dejó, tú fuiste la que te marchaste (uh)

Ahora me toca por la noche rumbear
Con mi pana janguear y vivir la vida baby
Y no me importa lo que puedan pensar
Ya no voy a sufrir, porque tú te largaste

Y si me dices que tú te vas
Quedo solito y eso es mejor
Que estar con alguien que no te quiere
Yo sé que otra me da el valor

¡Dale movimiento, dale dembow
Menéalo rápido, ponlo en slow
Se pone dulzona cuando lo baila con flow
Rompe todas las ondas y roba el show
Cuando se combina un parcero con la maña de 'boriquizi' 
Hay mucho piquete pa la nena, estamos 'easy' 
Alguien va a pararnos, whoa whoa, difícil
Ninguna se salva cuando cae el 'missile' 

Que le den, que le den, que le den reggaeton  pa' ver lo que pasa
Que le den, que le den, que le den prueba la fiera y te caza
zumba y arrasa, me prende y pasa 
Yo lo tumbo y exploto la casa

¡Y dale movimiento dale dembow
Menéalo rápido, ponlo en slow

Rompe todas las ondas y roba el show

¿Por qué tú eres así? 
Loquito me tienes a mí 
Los ojos me quieren salir 
Si todo me gusta de ti

Ya ni como ni duermo 
Desde el día que yo vi tu cuerpo 
Aquí me tiene como un enfermo 
Nuevamente te tengo, 
Me acerco y aprovecho el momento
Y te digo al oído bien lento

Y yo hoy estoy aquí imaginando 
Sexy baila, y me deja con las ganas 

Y yo hoy estoy aquí sediento y loco por tenerte 
Tu boca me llama, me pide que te bese
Tú eres la única que me hace morir de ganas
Usted se suelta el pelo cuando baila y me enloquece (farru)

Déjate llevar por el boom boom 
Del bajo cuando azota 
Pégate a mi cuerpo
No te hagas la loca y baila 
Tú no eres una santa
Como te gusta el dembow
Y el reggaeton te encanta 

Hay química entre tú y yo 
No miremos bebe el reloj
Si tomas este servidor te invita
Ya yo se lo que tú necesitas

Que bien te queda a ti esa faldita
Ella es señora no es señorita
Sexy baila y me deja con las ganas
Como te luces cuando lo meneas
Cuanto quisiera hacerte el amor
Enséñame lo que sabes

(Yandel) Ven vamos 
Que la noche no se va a acabar temprano
Siénteme y dame de ese calor humano
Anda con Yandel no con cualquier fulano
Lleguemos mas allá
Más allá de la ropa
Más allá de besarte en la boca 
Más allá de darnos un par de copas 
Tú haces que me eleve la nota 
En la cama me agotas 
Cuando te mueves así, bailando 
Sigue rozándome así, guayando 
Como te brilla la piel sudando 
Sigue sigue me estás descontrolando

Tú andas sola, también ando solo 
Hoy nadie nos controla, 
Olvida el protocolo y deja la maldad salir 
Me gustas tanto que si me dejas bailo contigo hasta morir

Porque yo tengo algo que tu estas buscando

Te acuerdas de mi lengua cuando estas besando
Te acuerdas de mi mano cuando estas rogando
La voz en el oído cuando estaba hablando
Mientras mas pasa el tiempo te voy deseando

Quiero que pierdas el control
Voy a quemarte en pasión
En el aire volaras
Cuando yo te toque a fuego lento

Voy buscándote a ti, hey (Kevin Roldán)
Tú no sabes cómo yo pienso en ti (Nicky Jam)
Porque como tú no hay nadie más
Porque como tú no hay nadie igual

Yo sigo pensando en ti
Yo no te olvido ma
Vuelve te quiero sentir
Desde que no estás aquí 
No, nada es igual 
Ya ni puedo dormir

Me pregunto si piensas en mí
Cómo lo hacíamos
Me lo tienes que decir
Dime si me regalas una noche más

Si me regalas una noche como las de la otra vez
Yes, cuando te besaba de la boquita a los pies
Yo recuerdo cuando planeábamos todo hace un mes
Por cosas de la vida se nos dieron al revés ok
Yo sé que te causo muchas lágrimas
Consecuencias de la maldad de tus amigas
Baby, yo sé no quieres a nadie más
Yo soy quien te hace volar bajo las sábanas
Y me pregunto si hay oportunidad
De volverte a besar
A veces te sueño, te imagino en mi cama
Abro los ojos me doy cuenta que no es realidad
Solo quiero decirte que

Me lo tienes que decir
Dime si me regalas una noche más

Si me regalas otra noche
Te juro que hago que tu cuerpo goce
Me hace falta la locura de tus poses
Cuando te tengo arriba
Esas son las cosas que uno nunca olvida 
Tú me llamas y yo le llego enseguida 
Nunca me olvido de esa vez
Cuando viniste con tu timidez
Pero en la cama me dejaste al revés
Si estás con otro me molesto 
No quiero ver a otro con tu cuerpo
No eres mía y ya me siento dueño de eso 

Yo sigo pensando en ti
Yo no te olvido ma
Siempre te quiero sentir
Y desde que no estás aquí
Hey, nada es igual

Se vuelve loca cuando se trepa en la tarima

Como se toca me fascina, me motiva

A mi me gusta cuando quiere jugar 
Es una fiera como ella me provoca

¿Como estas? 
Esta noche quiero hacer maldades 
Esta noche quiero hacértelo y que no acabes 
Hacer que te entregues a mi
Ven bebe y que mi cama se convertirá tuya

Hoy te hago travesuras a ti (Oh!) 

Dime si conmigo quiere hacer travesuras 
Que se ha vuelto una locura 
Y tu estas bien dura, no me puedo contener

¿Que será de mi? O ¿que será de ti? 
No preguntemos al final solo sabe Dios 
Tengo tu cuerpo en mi mente muy dentro plasmado 
Me tienes enamorado 
Atracción fatal que me hace devorarte como un animal 
Como quisiera ayudarte a olvidar tu pasado 
Pero me lo haz negado 
Solo déjame entrar y vas a ver que al final te va a gustar 

Nos vamos pal oscuro mama 
Tenemos tu y yo las mismas fuertes ganas 
Hagamoslo despacio pa' matar las ganas 
Pa' comerte completa y sin que quede nada 
Olvida la casualidad y aprovecha mama

Pa' subir la intensidad hasta por la mañana 
Matemos curiosidad aquí junto en mi cama

Estaba lista para la ocasión

Y yo sentía como tu temblabas 
Pero por el cuello te besaba 
Y con eso te tranquilizaba 
De tu boquita no oigo una palabra

Y a un ladito de la habitación
Estaba tu ropa interior

Del día que hicimos el amor
Esa fue la ultima vez
Y vivo el día aquí extrañándote

Tú me enseñaste como amar
Y ahora que te vas
No me enseñaste como estar sin ti
Tú me enseñaste como amar
Y ahora que te vas
No me enseñaste como estar sin ti

Y tú y tú y tú y tú
No sales de mi mente
Sigo extrañándote pensándote
Y tú y tú y tú y tú
No sales de mi mente

Esa boquita de miel
Y como combina el sabor con su piel
Es que no existe nadie como tú, mi mujer
Sigo buscando a otra pero no hay como Usted  mami
No este pa' Usted, y enseguida te vas
Me dices que tu sabes pero no sabes na'
Dime por qué te fuiste, solo di la verdad
Sigo buscándote y no he podido encontrar
Quien podrá reemplazarte a ti

Algo que me diga donde estas tú
Así no puedo seguir
Todo el dia pienso en ti
Ya no sé cómo vivir, haces falta aquí
Aun siento tu perfume y duele respirar
Y me mata la nostalgia y esta soledad
Así no puedo seguir
Todo el día pienso en ti
Ya no sé cómo vivir haces falta aquí

No me enseñaste como estar sin ti

Eres mi amiga y no sé cómo
Expresarme sin confundirte
De ti yo quiero algo pero no es amor

A poca luz
Quiero ver tu cuerpo y toda tu virtud
Tengo intenciones atrevidas
Es que tú te vez tan atractiva y me motivas

Y es que tú
Provocas en mi mente deseos
Y como pretendes que no te piense
De la manera que te pienso yo

Sí es que tú
Te me acercas y me tientas con tu olor
Como hago pa’ no hacerte un indecente
Diciéndote lo que pretendo contigo, contigo

Me llevas al espacio cuando tú me caminas
Con esa camisita y el pantalón
Me acuerdo el primer día, yo ni te conocía
Y terminamos hablando en mi habitación

Contigo me confundo
Si solo con hablar tú me cambias de mundo
Y no es que ando buscando algo más profundo
Yo solo me conformo con un día estar juntos
Y voy detrás de ti
Buscando que quieras de mi, ah
Dime si quieres salir
Porque esta noche quiero repetir
Ah

Y voy detrás de ti
Buscando que quieras de mi, ah
Dime si quieres salir
Porque esta noche quiero repetir

Y como pretendes que no te piense

Sí es que tú
Te me acercas y me tientas con tu olor
Como hago pa' no hacerte un indecente
Diciéndote lo que pretendo contigo

Es que me das mucha ganas
Cada vez que te veo
Solo eres mi amiga pero yo no creo
Que esto nos afecte luego
Somos adultos y sabemos
Si pasas por curiosidad
No envuelvas sentimientos

Dejemos que pasen las cosas
Cuando un cuerpo desea otro ya quien lo controla
Quieres ser fuerte de mente pero te traiciona
Terminas haciendo lo que se te antoja

Por eso disfrútate el momento
Hagámoslo pero sin arrepentimientos
Vamos hacerlo sin ninguna duda
Pa' que vivir la vida con tanta atadura

Y es que tú
Provocas en mi mente deseos
Y como pretendes que no te piense
De la manera que te pienso yo

Sí es que tú
Te me acercas y me tientas con tu olor
Como hago pa' no hacerte un indecente

Yo sé que tu novio no te escucha
Ni tampoco te dedica las canciones
Fabrica sus emociones
Salpicas por que peleas con cojones
Al tipo no hay quien lo soporte, y tu con ese corte
Las mujeres te ven y desde el sur al norte
Se tachan, nos tratan de romper y se escrachan
Ma' yo soy tu Khan Jey, tu mi Kim kardashian
Otro amor otro cuento el futuro está escrito
Mami no me compares porque yo no compito
Esos zapatos, carteras, pulseras
Conmigo eh ascensor y con el novio tuyo las escaleras
Demasiao' adelantao' a tiempo yo siento
Que llegastes a brillarme mi mejor momento
Soltero, y al lado tuyo más próspero
Buscando en tu corazón poder ser el primero

Viendo el sol y el atardecer
Sentados solos frente al mar
Tu besándome y yo besándote
Disfrutamos de un momento especial

Ay ay ay ay iah ieh iah iah iah ioh
Yo quiero hacerte el amor
Ay ay ay ay iah ieh iah iah iah ioh
Aprovechemos que ya se escondió el sol

Entremos al agua tu y yo
Sin ropa y comámonos los dos
Tu me gustas mucho y lo sabes
Como tu no existe nadie

Ya casi se esconde el sol
Y quiero abrazarte mi amor
Estamos entrando en calor
Vamonos para el agua los dos

Me want to see you when the sun a come down
Baby girl no bother walk, just run come
Say rum a drink, make have fun
I'll be there for you when it's all done
Girl me nah lie
Love how you shape the way you're design
When you a bubble and your waistline
You know Mr. lover lover
Nah waste time.

Viendo el sol y el atardecer
Sentados solos frente al mar
Tu besándome y yo besándote
Disfrutamos de un momento especial

Ay ay ay ay iah ieh iah iah iah ioh
Yo quiero hacerte el amor
Ay ay ay ay iah ieh iah iah iah ioh
Aprovechemos que ya se escondió el sol

Te gusta sentir la arena en tu piel
Cuando me toca tu y a la vez el sol cayendo
Tu boquita rica sabe a miel
Y no me puedo contener, por que el alcohol esta subiendo

No se tu me estas enloqueciendo
La brisa acaricia tu pelo
Las estrellas alumbran el cielo
Vamos hasta el amanecer solos tu y yo

Viendo el sol y el atardecer
Sentados solos frente al mar
Tu besándome y yo besándote
Disfrutamos de un momento especial

Ay ay ay ay iah ieh iah iah iah ioh
Yo quiero hacerte el amor
Ay ay ay ay iah ieh iah iah iah ioh

Nicky Jam,"S[e que no me conoces lo suficiente
Te habrán dicho que soy un loco y mucho más
Pero sé
Que cuando me miras y me tienes de frente
Algo por mí sientes
Y no lo puedes ocultar
Llevo tiempo deseando
Que estemos hablando
Que me des una oportunidad
No importa que estén hablando
Si tú sientes algo

Es el momento y no hay más que hablar
Yo te quiero a ti, tú me quieres a mí
Aprovecha el momento me tienes aquí
Te cuido hasta morir, no te dejaré ahí
Loco me volvería si me dices que sí
Si me dices que sí
Si me dices que si

No te dejes llevar por las apariencias y las prendas mía
Eso me lo compré con mis cheques de regalía
Yo trabajo, y aunque te digan que no doy un tajo
Todo lo que tengo es porque me fajo
Yo no estoy para relajo
Yo soy un hombre de una sola hembra
El maíz no da fruto si no se siembra
Yo que tanto la esperaba, salía a buscarte 
Y no te encontraba, hice mil intentos y fracasaba
Con mujeres de país en país hay de toos' colores
Diferentes tamaños distintos olores
Pero tu fragancia no hay quien la mejore
Contigo quiero amore' señoras y señores
Lo digo a los cuatro vientos también lo publico en mi red social
""Encontré la que me encanta"" en segundos será viral
Y me da igual, que el mundo se entere de este romance
Sólo abre tu corazón y dame un chance

Llevo tiempo deseando
Que estemos hablando
Que me des una oportunidad
No importa que estén hablando
Si tú sientes algo
Es el momento y no hay más que hablar
Yo te quiero a ti, tu me quieres a mí
Aprovecha el momento me tienes aquí
Te cuido hasta morir, no te dejaré ahí
Loco me volvería si me dices que si
Si me dices que si

Quizá te han dicho que estoy loco, maleducado, un hombre mujeriego
Si me vieras llego a todos lados y me hago el ciego
Y es que yo no soy así
Mami toi' pa too' pa' ti
Sólo abre tu corazón y dame un si
Que la vida es corta y estamos en los últimos tiempos
Te quiero sólo pa' mi te celo hasta del viento
De noche hablo con la almohada la luna no dice nada
Yo juego a ganar pero pierdo en todas las temporadas
Si querer queriendo me sigo amaneciendo
Busco la razón para ver si porfin te entiendo
Y comprendo sufrir por amor es horrendo
Pero vale la pena por un fin estupendo
Bichea la ardille, es mi personaje
Hay un hombre humilde detrás de este camuflaje
Coopera que la espera desespera 
Y el tiempo perdido no se recupera

Llevo tiempo deseando
Que estemos hablando
Que me des una oportunidad
No importa que estén hablando
Si tu sientes algo
Es el momento y no hay más que hablar

De mí todo te entregué
Que lo sepa el mundo entero
Que contigo la paso bien

Si me lloras, yo te lloro
Si me perdonas, te perdono
Si me ríes, te sonrío
Yo te caliento si hace frío

Si me provocas, te provoco
Cuando te desnudas me vuelves loco
Y poco a poco te devoro
Mami yo nunca te abandono

Y es que eres tú mi tesoro
Yo cómo te adoro
Cada día más me enamoro
Por ti lo arriesgo todo

Y es que eres tú mi tesoro
Ay, cómo te adoro
Cada día más me enamoro
Eres mi fortuna y mi oro

Yo me robé tu corazón
Y no te lo pienso devolver
Aunque yo he fallado
Y tú has fallado, no vivamos el ayer

No quiero que te quedes sola
No quiero verte nunca llorar
Que me falte el aire, que me quiten todo
Por tu amor no me dejo robar

Todas las noches pido un deseo
Que nunca te vayas, yo solo quiero
Porque eres tú la única en la que creo
Siempre en mi cama, mami, yo te espero

Y es que eres tú mi tesoro

Tanto amor por ti me tiene enloqueciendo
Mujer, tú me fascinas
Te juro no sé cómo explicar lo que siento (lo que siento)
Yo sé que soy tu otra mitad

Contigo hay sol, no hay lluvia ni viento
Sin ti voy decayendo
Yo sé que tú quieres lo mismo que yo quiero (que yo quiero)
Que estemos juntos

Tú eres mi tesoro en esta historia
Tengo tu cuerpo tatuado en mi memoria
Empezamos desde cero, amor verdadero
Ladrón de tus besos, tu bandolero

Si lo pides, subo volando y te bajo el cielo
Yo por ti, meto las manos mami en el fuego
Ay, que rico recordarme cuando me decías dame dame
Y yo te decía toma toma

Como quiera me recibiste y me aceptabas en tu cama
Y me pregunto yo
Te fuiste y no te despediste
Pagué todo lo que te hice y ahora el que llora soy yo
Ay, que soledad

Si pudiera yo controlar el tiempo y volver atrás
Cambiaría todo lo que te hice mal
Y si pudiera yo controlar el tiempo y volver atrás
Cambiaría todo lo que te hice mal

Sigo extrañándote

Ella es una menorcita
Sin cirugías y con la boca grande
No le gusta el mediante ni los hombres arrogantes
No le gustan los blingblines tampoco los diamantes
Ella no se fija en eso lo que quiere es un buen amante
Que la apriete en la cama las posiciones ama
Ta' estudiando derecho ella me pinta buena dama
No le gusta el bochinche y tiene un buen vocabulario
Yo te amo lo voy a gritar en el vecindario

Mi corazón 'ta lleno de amor pa' dártelo a diario
Te bajo una estrella de día, no tengo horarios
Yo soy tu papi chulo mami, ven, que sí te me mueves bien
Te voy a comprar un Mercedes Benz

Recuerdo el primer beso que nos dimos sentados en la calle 6
Cupido me flechó con una M-16
Tu papá me dijo que yo no tenía futuro
Ahora cuando me ve, se esconde se mete en lo oscuro
Yo me puse pa' trabajar porque yo te amo
Con cuarto, sin cuarto como quiera nos amamos
Lo importante es que somos felices
Yo no me llevo de lo que la gente dice
Que están hablando 'tan criticando
Tú y yo, viajando 'tamos gozando
Ven, que te voy a abrir la cuerda del Maquinón
Y vámonos a dar un jumo de Moët y Chandon

Digo la verdad no hay una mujer
Que lo haga como lo hace usted
Tú sabes, no te mentiré

Soy adicto a ti
El no tenerte me hace mal
Puro sentimiento tengo, ma'
Por eso déjame decirte

Me pone bisorioco
Me pongo nervioso de solo pensar que te toco
Iba guiándome ella más casi por poco choco

Hoy soy tu genio, baby pídeme tus tres deseos
Viajar el mundo, romántico, sitios de paseo
En tu cuerpo descargo la magia que poseo
Cada detalle de tu cuerpo es arte de museo
Quiero abrazarte y conquistarte
Descubrir el sabor que tus labios comparten
Ese suspiro de pasión que activa mis sentidos
Cuando me rozas se aceleran mis latidos
(Tú sabes que yo contigo disfruto)

Sola entrégate a mí
Yo si quiero desnudarte, y provocarte
(Solo quiero que te hagas una pregunta)

¿Quien te amará? ¿Te hará sentir?
¿Te cuidará? ¿Te hará feliz si no soy yo?
Si no soy yo
¿Quien te amará? ¿Te hará sentir?
¿Te cuidará? ¿Te hará feliz si no soy yo?
Si no soy yo
(Yandel)

Pensando en tu piel, en volverte a tener
Revivir esos besos y hacerte mujer
Baby yo te quise, por eso no te olvidé
Dime si lo hacemos esta noche
Y revivimos el momento, quiero tu cuerpo pegaito de mi cuerpo
Quiero que me beses bien lento, aun podemos recuperar el tiempo
Y revivimos el momento, quiero tu cuerpo pegaito de mi cuerpo
Quiero que me beses bien lento, aun podemos recuperar el tiempo

¿Quién puede darte lo que te di antes?
Qué pena que el otro a ti no supo amarte
Si yo con un beso te llevo hasta el cielo y te vuelvo a bajar
Si te estoy molestando quiero que me excuses
Pero yo me acuerdo cuando te propuse
Si un día te ibas, todita la vida te iba a esperar
Ven conmigo mejor, necesito tu amor
Porque ya tengo frio y tú me das calor
Te lo recordare, como éramos ayer
Haciendo el amor, viendo el atardecer

Déjame hacerte el amor, oh
Solo quiero darte un beso, para quitarte el dolor

Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well

That I gotta get back to work

Che se ti guardo diventa rossa, morirei

E del cielo e di dove andrà a dormire la luna
Quando esce il sole
Chissà com'era la terra prima che ci fosse l'amore
Sotto quale stella tra mille anni
Se ci sarà una stella
Ci si potrà abbracciare
Poi la notte col suo silenzio regolare

But never understood the calm
So take me where I wanna be, back in your arms

Well we drank champagne and danced all night,
Under electric candlelight,
She picked me up and sat me on her knee,
And said dear boy won't you come home with me,

Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola,

I pushed her away,
I walked to the door,
I fell to the floor,
I got down on my knees,
Then I looked at her and she at me,
Well that's the way that I want it to stay,
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola.

Well I left home just a week before,
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before,

If fate could play a different hand
All if all the broken hearts
Could be fixed not torn apart

Watching shadows on the wall
Some questions are impossible
And does God make a fool of us all
Watch the skies as sadness falls

Bits of me don't exist anymore
I can't replace what's been and gone
Cars and bits of silhuettes
Buy some time and learn to dance

You can't hold back time

Failure can
Be good for your soul
It tests your desires
And leaves you alone

Need someone something somehow
Serves to remember you as you are
Need too shelter you from the storm
Need a place that I can call home

Like a prayer I can hear you calling
Like a prayer I can hear, hear you calling
Like a prayer I can hear you calling out for me
Like a prayer I can hear you calling",Everything Fades,2006
Nicky Wire,"Goodbye suicide
Wipe the tears down from your eyes
Take my hand
Hold back pride - goodbye suicide

Goodbye suicide
Not for real but for this life
Au-revoir
Auf-wiedersein - goodbye suicide

Goodbye suicide
Never thought I'd tell a lie
See you later
Sianara- goodbye suicide

Goodbye suicide
Beautiful to be so kind
Forever been
But never seen - goodbye suicide

If the ending fits the words
If you struggle to be heard
You can only try so hard
You can only try so fucking hard

So goodbye suicide
Innocence is not a crime
Hold back fear
Don't let it near - goodbye suicide",Goodbye Suicide,2006

Feel the force you better wear your crown

Hey, white boy, you chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just lookin' for a dear, dear friend of mine

Of how much we must not agree.

Nico,"The snow on your eyelids that curtsy with age
Is freezing the stares on tyranny's wings.
The bitter is hard and the warmth of your skin
Is diseased with familiar caresses.

Withdrawing from splendor and royal decay
Among all the triumphs and jaded awards
The angry and blazing circus of sun
Blasphemes as the crown prince arises.

You cannot beget all the sins that you owe
To the people of paradise magic
Pretend to answer passion and form
With foreign rationalizations.

Primroses are the jewels that lurk
Among masks of pleasure that flicker with doubt
Embraces of fame that's simultaneously fear
To advance and demand to be recognized.

The river shall flow through hollow green faces
Of caricature's resentment etched out of the tongues.
Both reluctant princess asleep before birth
The classical sensitive failures.

The worshipping wicked cling to the dark of your heart
Lying there and wait with your angels
Moan and ravish from dawn to dusk
The avaricious young lovers.",Winter Song,1967

Searing with the sides
Caress it with a lover's touch
For it shall be your bride

Send them all away
Put them in a bottle
And across the seas they'll stay

Slash the golden whip, it slaps
Across the lover's sides
The earth trembles without remorse
Preparing for to die

Come crashing to the shore
Bullies kick and kill young loves
Down on barroom floors

Wrap your troubles in dreams
Send them all away

Violence echoes through the land
In heart of every man
The knife stabs existent wounds
Pulse runs through matted hair

Through the midnight air
Cutting entrails in its path
Blood runs without care

Excrement filters through the brain
Hatred bends the spine
Filth covers the body pores
To be cleansed by dying time

Set themselves out upon a plate
For him to choose
What had he to lose

Not a ghost bloodied country
All covered with sleep
Where the black angel did weep
Not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

And wandering's brother
Walked on through the night
With his hair in his face
On a long splintered cut from the knife of g.t.

The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long
To his skull-shrill yell

Shining brightly red-rimmed and
Red-lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind
On ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razor's
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool goodbye
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gone to choose, choose again

Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget
Where you come from
The stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame, choose again

And roverman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
Went the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on

If the stone glances off
Split didactics in two
Leave the colors of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose, if you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start

Titanic curses trap me in
A banishment of stay
Symbols vanish from my senses

Vanish from my glance

I enforce a strike the alarm
For the various defences
That choose to be here and there
And lose the direction everywhere

In a Nibelungen land where we cannot be
Almond trees grow along the mountain trail
From their tongues the words are spelling
The telling numb

I cannot hear it anymore
I cannot hear it anymore

Since the first of you and me here and there
We lose the direction everywhere
Shrieking city sun shiver in my veins
In flames I run
In flames I run
Waiting for the sign to come

Will you spell the words for me to hear

More foolish than that wine

Though we failed before

Closer to me once more

Try to make myself much clearer

Without a house or a home and then she asked you, please,
Hey, baby, can I have some spare change
Oh, can I break your heart ?

She's a wild child, she's a wild child

I was talkin' to Betty about her auditions, how they made her ill
But life in the theater, is certainly fraught
With many spills and chills
But she'd come down after some wine
Which is what happens most of the time
Then we sat and both spoke in rhymes
Till we spoke of Loraine, ah, always back to Lorraine

I was talking to Ed who'd been reported dead by mutual friends
He thought it was funny that I had no money to spend on him
So we both shared a piece of sweet cheese
And sang of our lives and our dreams
And how things can come apart at the seams
And we talk of Lorraine, always back to Lorraine

She's a wild child, oh, and nobody can get at her
She's a wild child, oh, and nobody can get to her

Sleepin' out on the street, oh, livin' all alone

Oh, baby, can I have some spare change
Now can I break your heart?""

She's gonna work it out, bye bye
Bye by by by by by bye baby

A thousand dreams that would awake me

Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Taste the whip, now plead for me

Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, 125
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man

Hey, white boy, what you doin' uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just lookin' for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
PR shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man

Up to a Brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Ah then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man

Baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling oh so fine

Everything you want to know
Long enough to be alive.
How could it be expected
To feel the way you do? Yea
I feel like I'm fading!
Farther away from you
How could it be expected
To remember all the good things, the good things, the good things that you've done?

You are, the only way.
I am, your child today.
I am your servant, won't you teach me how to pray?

How many things I've spoken, 
How many things I've done,
But all the things that have come my way
Have led me to be broken! Yea

But why was I chosen,
To be the thorn on all the roses?
I don't deserve this kind of life.

Nico & Vinz,"I used to pray every night when I was younger
On my knees, folding hands for my mother
And my mother used to say when she was younger
She used to go to bed filled with hunger
The same hunger got her working even harder
Got her travelling to Norway from Ghana
She said ""My son, we're blessed, now let's say Our Father""
Ups and downs, that's how life go
What's high if you don't know low?
So I try not to complain
Appreciate life so I keep saying

Another day goes by, another day goes by
And I thank God that I'm alive
Another day goes by, another day goes by
And I thank God that I'm alive

I think I was about ten years old
Watching the news with my dad
I didn't see nothing but tears and blood
And a bunch of people looking so mad
""That's war"", I was told
I said ""How? That ain't nothing like the games I have""
I couldn't grasp the sense of an innocent child
Dying by the hands of a grown man
And while some kids raised on cartoons
Young girls making money in dark rooms
We all deserve a decent meal
Why his belly so soft, why she holding that hard spoon?
And where is my head of state?
If crime pays, talk peace, still engage in heavy arms trade
In the jungle that we call Sin City
While life rules, survival of the fittest

Una tipa in braccio, ti giuro che non puoi dirmi niente
Sto con la mia gente, sarò qua per sempre
È l’unica vita che ho e non puoi dirmi niente

Sono nato in cattività, così malato serve una visita
Grandi Dil, musica minima, la mia vita è un film, Cinecittà
Ora brillo come un neon prima era tutto nero
La mia vita è come il National Geo, frate, è tutto vero
Ho fatto ritornare i soldi a riva come la marea
E mi sono ricostruito da solo, già, mister Ikea
Mai avuto i soldi di famiglia, è stata dura
Ma per avere quelli, fra devi averne una (ah)
Mi volevano sparito, sono qua più forte di prima
Ti apro la testa e sono proibito, già, il flow è tipo cocaina

Meglio che fare la guerra di click o di cercare la provocazione
E i talent sono uno show baby non sono la soluzione
Quanti Moreno devono ancora morire per farti vedere la luce

Ma nessuno pagherebbe per spaccare di più, fra il mio Rap è fumo denso, il tuo è fumo passivo
Non è un singolo di merda a farvi essere un re, sono qua per restare
Questa scena è il mio trono, tu fai musica da frocio come il gruppo dei Tokyo
Infatti frate per te questa scena è un hotel

Tu sei come fecio, hai capelli da Ken
Io ho capelli da Ken, ma in bocca solo Fat flow

Her inheritance resulted
In contradiction, ceremony
Benediction, hallelujah

There are no more accidents
Living things refuse to offer
Explanations of their worth
We in turn avenge the Author
With paranoia and prediction
Exploration, competition
Ceremony, inner anguish
Lord I pray for us, hallelujah

Oh, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah

Nico Muhly,"My father, working night
First shift, eternal light
The curse of Adam labor
Outside, in the parking lot
The current of wind and the light went hot
He held his head in terror
By Jove and by surprise
The current of lightning filled with light
It burned his hands with symbols
White noise as Lucifer
The sacred fire, the sacred fern
Conceived with holy water

His radiance in the dark
Mysterious shape or beauty mark
As if it were Minerva
Breastplate of Jupiter
The hovering deep, as he spoke the word
The light, the virgin creature
All dreams of all disease are fantasy features, first conceived
Illusions worth remembering
Our father late at night, forbidding death, he kissed the light
As Jupiter transfigured

I need you to change me, prevent you, persuade me, by Jove
I need you, sensation, by virtue, persuasion, by Jove, by Jove
By Jove

Say it to my face, put me in place

Auf Augenhöhe wie die Sonne da am Horizont
Ihr habt schon verloren, als ob 'ne Bombe angeflogen kommt
Du bist jetzt auch ein Rapper, super, du Hippie
Aber wir zwei sind die Wiedergeburt von Tupac und Biggie, verstehste?
Genau um zehn, Hip-Hop geht nicht ohne anzugeben
Und du darfst nicht reden, ohne meinen Penis anzubeten
Geiles Leben, knallharte Champagnerfeten
Rotwein aus Bretagne-Reben, alles handverlesen
Ja, ich geb' dir recht, Rap ist nicht neu

Hören das hier und heften sich an unsre Fersen wie Butterfische
Bilderbuchkarriere, unnachahmlich, Platten alle Kult
Und jede Line fickt dein Leben automatisch wie Buddy Wolfe
Hate, bis du stirbst, nix mit rational
Ich würd' 'nen Finger amputieren, wenn ich wüsste, dass es etwas bewirkt
Nenn' mein nächstes Album Blue Channel, denn es wird gebumst
Spritz 'ner Inderin ins Face und du kämst nicht auf den Punkt

So now it's my turn to say, to say

Yeah, your heart is like a wild bird
And you don't know how to fly it, girl
Changes too much on the breeze
Just to love someone like me
Yeah, your heart is like a wild bird

Nico Santos,"The book of love is long and boring

You're sitting on the bathroom floor 
Drawing pictures 
Making sure it doesn't even show 
But your mother's calling on the phone again 
What you going to say now that it got so late ?

One day you will wake up 
And everything that you thought you would be 
Will be standing there staring right back at you 
And I guess I should have said so 
But I swear I didn't even know how to feel about it 
When it walked right out on you 

And there's a nervous calling running through the walls 
And it's getting louder now 
It's begging you to please 
You know that slow thing humming at the other side of skin
It's what you listen to 
When you run out of you

So I hope
I hope you really get it now

Jungs, seid ihr bereit für die Session? (Auf jeden Fall)
Aha, ja! Ich bin bereit für die Session
Gib mir mal jemand 'n Joint
Dann bin ich auch breit für die Session
Seid ihr bereit für die Session? (Wir sind bereit für die Session)
Ich fang mal so an (ja, fang mal so an)
Hier kommen vier von Deutschlands großen MCs
Augen sind rot, Hosen hängen tief
Samy, Dendemann, Illo und Nico am Mikro
Mit Niveau und viel Flow, kapito, Amigo?

Die gelbe Trikotfarbe gehört nur Nico Suave
Schon klar, dass ich spontan bei dem Beat zusage
Jetzt Spaß beiseite, ich bring phasenweise Texte
So effektiv, dass Wack-MCs die Straßenseite wechseln

Jungs, ich setzt euch 'ne Deadline
Auf drei müsst ihr weg sein
Eins, drei - Pech gehabt! Ich bin halt 'n Dreckschwein
Feilen an Textzeilen
Bis sie glatt sind wie Speckstein
Rhyme fresh fresh Rhymes
So auf Flash kann nur Ress sein

Hey, check mein', ich bleibe, auch wenn ich hier nur störe
Um so zu tun, als ob das ganze Land nur mir gehöre
Denn wir vier Tenöre plus Joni Rewind
Sagen: „Lass dein' Scheiß doch da, wo die Sonne nicht scheint!“
Seid ihr bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Nico, bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Dende, bereit für die Session?

Ja, ich bin bereit für die Session
Und wenn ihr's nicht glaubt
Kann ich das Mic ein zweites Mal testen:
Wenn du wie ich Reime kickst
Und dafür Scheine kriegst
Gehörten diese vorher meist großen und kleinen Kids
Und jeder der denkt, dafür braucht man keine Tricks
Ist leider noch schiefer gewickelt als meine Sticks

Sticks und ich schreibe Hits, während ich auf Klo beim Scheißen sitz'
Rhyme deluxe, weil die Muse mich küsst und mir einen wichst
Heißt eigentlich gibt's zum Meckern hier kaum'n Grund
Bring's auf'n Punkt, und MCs hören dies mit dem Daumen im Mund

Ich sehe nur nen Haufen Schund, schau mich um, glaub' es kaum:
Nur tausend Clowns - von mir gibt's ne Faust frei Haus exakt aufs Auge drauf
Unsere Gigs sind ausverkauft, ihr seid da nie aufgetaucht
Und wenn doch?
Habt ihr euch nie zu uns da oben raufgetraut

Ich hab auch geglaubt, dass die Jungs keinen Mumm haben
Du kannst liebend gern rumfragen
Den Typen fehlen Grundlagen
Wie zum Beispiel Micdisziplin
Es wird Zeit, dass wir Ihnen zeigen
Beim Zeilen Schreiben
Dass wir tight sind im Team
Seid ihr bereit für 'ne Session?

Ich bin bereit für 'ne Session
Dende, bereit für 'ne Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Sam, bereit für 'ne Session?

Bin ich bereit für 'ne Session?
Ich bin nicht nur bereit, ich besteh' drauf weiterzurappen:
Ich könnt wetten, dass hier bald jeder von euch Deppen kapiert
Dass ihr scheiße ausseht wie benutztes Toilettenpapier
Nachdem ich euch in alter Battle-Manier
Die Fresse polier'
Und wieder echten Rap etablier', Sam Semi!

Und jetzt hätten wir auch schon 'n triftigen Grund
Auf dass wir den Stift nehmen und dann die Schrift in den Mund
Kauen sie gut durch und spucken sie wieder aus
Und bringen dann bestenfalls die Reste als sowas wie Lieder raus

Yo, der Beat erlaubt's, ich attackier mit smoothem Rap
Junge träum schön weiter vom Plattendeal bei Groove Attack
Ich appelliere für'n guten Zweck an die wahre Szene
Und plakatier': „Steckt Wannabes in Quarantäne“

Da klappern Zähne reihenweise, vor allem wenn ich mich einschalte
Euch Lappen die Klamotten klau' und meine Jungs neu einkleide
Wenn ich euch jetzt einheize und ans nackte Bein scheiße
Gleicht das einem Fallschirmsprung mit gekappter Reißleine
Bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Und selbst bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session

Ist noch einer von den drei Gästen bereit für die Session?

Jawohl, ich bin so weit bereit und geb' noch einen zum Besten:
Vorsicht! Es gibt ein bisschen Action am Mic
Die Session zu viert hat den meisten jetzt schon gereicht
Ich schick' dir im Nu drei Jungs vorbei, wenn du mit Kontra gibst
Glaub ja nicht, es sei 'was Besonderes, wovon du sprichst

Ich bin hart am Platz wie Zahnersatz, ein Labersack
Der Partner hat, sich gerade macht mit drei MCs
Die wissen wie der Hase tanzt
Verpassen euch 'n Wadenkrampf
Stecken voller Tatendrang
Das Instrumental in Brand
Und richten im Land Schaden an

Ey, Warte Mann, ich hab zwar schon ganze Shows verpennt
Bloß wer denkt, ich sei deshalb nicht schneller als ein Toaster brennt
Der hat jetzt mehr zu verlieren als Hopfen und Malz
Ich hau' euch mit brutalen Ritualen den Kopf in den Hals

Wir sind für's Rauchen und Saufen und Klauen statt Kaufen bekannt
Hängen auf'n Haufen zusammen und labern Mist am laufenden Band
Erfinden Geschichten, weil eh alles falsch nach außen gelangt
Freestylen schon und vertauschen die Namen
Und verkaufen den Kram
Ja, ich denk das war's mit der Session

Ich denk das war's mit der Session

Wir sind Kumpels und ich will nur, dass du ahnst
dass ich immer nur das Beste will für dich und deine Mum

Nicht mal wenn ich rapp, fühl mich streng 
wenn ich dir sagen muss, ich bin hier der Chef aber

damit du auf sie aufpasst, wenn ich irgendwann mal nicht mehr bin

Vergiss das nicht, sollten eure Wege sich mal trenn'

Aus dir wird sicher mal ein Guter, einer mehr in der Stadt
Und das feier ich so krass, deshalb sing' ich es laut
Auf dich ist verlass, wenn deine Stimme mal brauch

Komm sing mit mir, sing mit mir ?
Komm sing mit mir, sing mit mir ?

Ah, ich bin nicht fehlerfrei und ohne Marke
wenn ich so wie jetzt mit Zigarette durch die Wohnung latsche.

Sorry, doch du kriegst davon nichts mit
wie von der ganzen schei*e die an jeden Tag, gibt

Du stehst auf Fußball, ich auf Benjamin und Biene Maja,
Ich steh dir zur Seite, mal als Spielberater wie dein Vater

Du hast Talent, am Anfang war nicht alles easy, aber
Du hast dich durchgekämpft wie Avatar und Peter Parker

Du stehst auf Zeichentrick, Star Wars 
und dabreaker moves, abgeranzte Skatershoes 
und findest die Lakers cool

Genauso wie, zocken auf der Wii
Wenn deine Mum und ich wieder am Wochenende spielen 

Der King of Pop macht auf einmal wieder Sinn
Wenn ich sehe wie du strahlst
Wenn wir Michae, Lieder sing

Und die meisten Kinder klingen nicht im Ansatz wie du
Deshalb leih mir deine Stimme, weil du kannst das so gut

Komm sing mit mir, sing mit mir ?
Komm sing mit mir, sing mit mir ?


Es dauert nicht mehr lang' dann kommst du in die Pubertät
Bleib so wie du bist, wie dir's kehrt was dir super steht

Und wenn man interessiert an neuen Dingen
ich hoffe dass wir auch in 20 Jahren gute Freunde sind

Ich wünsch mir, dass wir für immer miteinander klar kommen, kein Plan 
ob's klappt dafür fehlt mir die Erfahrung. 

Doch ich weiß auch wenn ich mich ein paar Mal wiederhol'
Du hast ein gutes Herz, wie die Mama so der Sohn.

Komm nach Hause wie gerne
Hätte ich dich auch auf der Erde
Aber das ist leider nicht machbar

Kein Plan wie es dir geht
Kein Plan wo du steckst
Paps kann es sein das du mit mir sprichst wenn ich schlafe
Kann es sein das du mich beschützt all die Jahre

Weil du Tag und Nacht auf mich aufpasst
Wie ich auf mein eigenes Baby
Ich werd' da sein wenn mein Kind aufwacht
Du bist da für mich wenn ich flach lieg'
Der mir Kraft und der auf mich acht gibt
Der einzige Beweis das Engel existieren
Der wenn ich falle der mir sagt ich hab dich

Wie der Vater so der Sohn
Ich scheue den Vergleich
Du hast dich nie geschont und
Ich schone mich so leicht
Weil ich denke ich bin fertig
Du dachtest jetzt erst recht
Es gab immer was zu tun
Vater was tust du nun

Ich will dir noch einmal danke sagen
Ich will dir nochmal danke sagen

Du bist wie das Meer und ich würde gern in dir baden gehen
Dein Körper ist ein Wunderland, ich geh auf Entdeckungsreise
Wenn ich wie ein aufgeweckter Schmetterling dein Bett umkreise
Du bist ein Gedicht, im Grunde die perfekte Frau
Draußen auf der Straße eine Lady und im Bett ne, (wow)

Du bist, du bist
Hmm, wie ein Gedicht für mich
Deshalb, deshalb
Schreib ich ein Gedicht für dich

Du bist, du bist
Wie ein Gedicht für mich
Deshalb, deshalb
Schreib ich ein Gedicht für dich (ey)

Es gibt tausend gute Gründe dir ein Lied zu singen
Doch keines meiner Worte kann beschreiben wie verliebt ich bin
Ich hätte Lust dich über die Schwelle ins Bett zu tragen
Und alle Probleme wären auf der Stelle wie weggeblasen
Vögel fangen an zu singen, Wolken ziehen in Herzenform
Über meinen Kopf hinweg, es kommt mir wie ein Märchen vor
Was soll ich sagen, wie soll ich's dir nur beschreiben?
Jetzt wenn Worte deinen Kopf verlassen klingt es wie ein Streichquartett

Wir zwei sind wie die „Schöne und das Biest“
Irgendwo gestrandet im Paradies
Das mit uns ist wie ein Trip nach Paris
Ein frei-Flug ins All, flüster ich dir leise ins Ohr
Wir zwei sind wie Julia und Romeo
Und endlich fallen die Steine wie beim Domino
Wir machen zwanzig Kinder mindestens, sowieso
Komm, wir ham noch einiges vor

Du bist, du bist
Hmm, wie ein Gedicht für mich
Deshalb, deshalb
Schreib ich ein Gedicht für dich

Ist es nicht ironisch, dass der größte Hit den ich je schrieb 
„Vergesslich“ war
Bei all den Augenblicken die so unvergesslich waren
Unvergesslich sind?
Denn ich weiß immer noch wie Samy rappt
Dass seine Mom Weed aus seinem Zimmer roch'
Mit Ill Will bei Super Mario im vierten Stock
Drei Monate später im Radio, denn sie spielten's doch
Es ging ziemlich Flop, ich wusste nicht viel über's Musikgeschäft
Doch ich hielt wie Max an meiner Liebe fest
Vergesse nie das Flash, nie das Splash
Nie die Leute die mich supported haben, so wie mein Dad
Pause bitte!
All die Augenblicke rauschen vorbei
Ein Mic, zwei Plattenspieler, Dreißigtausend die schreien
Ich vertraute auf mein Glück, es zerbrach in tausend Stücke
Doch ich bau's immer wieder neu zusammen
Manchmal schau' ich kurz zurück, denn es wär' nicht wie es ist
Wär' es damals nicht gewesen wie es war
Unvergesslich

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick
Stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Ah manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick (aha)
Stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Ah, irgendwie seltsam, dass der größte Hit den ich je schrieb 
Vergesslich war
So viele Momente, die unvergesslich waren
Unersetzlich sind
Ich denk' oft dran
Mit den Blumentöpfen und klugen Köpfen wie Dendemann
Wochenlang auf Tour, ich verfluchte es zu jobben
Zwischen Schuhen und Klamotten auf der Suche nach den Flocken
Deshalb musste ich's wie Eizi tun, rulen bis zum Schluss
Denn ""ein Fuchs muss tun, was ein Fuchs tun muss
Natürlich war nicht immer alles Rosé wie Rick Ross
Und nicht alles wofür ich heute steh' ist HipHop
Im Grunde genommen ist alles okay
Denn alles was ich erlebt habe
Kann mir heutzutage keiner mehr nehm'
Ich vertraute auf mein Glück
Es zerbrach in tausend Stücke
Doch ich bau's immer wieder neu zusammen
Manchmal schau' ich kurz zurück
Denn es wär' nicht wie es ist
Wär' es damals nicht gewesen wie es war
Unvergesslich

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick
Stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Aha manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick (yo)
Stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Die erste Eins in der Schule
Die ersten kleinen Versuche zu rappen wie damals Biggie und Pun
Unvergesslich!
Die schwerste Zeit meiner Jugend, die erste eigene Bude
Ich weiß noch genau wie alles begann
Unvergesslich!
Das ganze Alben-Gestresse, der lange Fall auf die Fresse
Das Jammern auf wirklich hohem Niveau
Unvergesslich!
Das Bo, die Beginner und Sam, ich bleib' für immer ein Fan
Peace an die Töpfe und Eins, Zwo, unvergesslich!

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick (aha)
Stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder wie's mich trifft

Jedes Mal wenn ich kurz zurückblick (oh)
Stell ich fest, dass es kein Zurück gibt
Manchmal lach' ich drüber, doch dann merk' ich wieder, wieder

Wollen Schulabschlüsse
Kinder machen
Haus und Boot
Ich will lieber Fußabdrücke hinterlassen
Auf dem Mond
Deshalb laufe ich
Streife durch das Hinterland
Pausenlos
Seit ich meine Schleife selber binden kann
Nenn mich einen Freiheitsliebenden
Einen Getriebenen
Meinetwegen einen Fliehenden
Auf Hip-Hop hängen gebliebenen
Schon Run DMC sagten zu mir
""Walk this Way""
Ich brauch kein festen Wohnsitz
Ich wohn in der Hall of Fame
Hoffentlich machen meine Sneaker nie schlapp
Wenn das Reisefieber mich packt
Denn dann bin ich schnell auf der Stelle hier weg
Verlass gleich schon wieder die Stadt
Ich hab gerade eben erneut hinter mir die Türe zugeklatscht
Neue Schuhe brauchen Bewegung
Dafür sind sie gemacht
Ich muss gehen

Drei Streifen, Chucks oder Rebook rock

Wie die Cops
Tragen meine Beine
Schützen mich vor dem tiefsten Frost
Immer wenn ich in die große weite Welt zieh

Ist es für mich selbst ein Wunder
Wie ich in der Welt rumlunger

Nein ich bleib nicht stehen
Ich bin so lange schon am gehen
Ich hab entzündete Achillessehnen
Was auch immer vor mir liegt
Ich will es sehen
Und jeder Schritt tut weh
Aber scheinbar sehn ich mich nicht nach einem neuen Leben
So wie Frauen die die Pille nehmen
Und ich wähl nie den Mittelweg
Nie den Ausweg
Nie den gleichen Weg
Ich such meinen Weg
Und wenn er mal nicht weiter geht
(Bam bam ba bam)
Bin ich mein eigenes Straßenbauamt
Hab an meinen Füßen soviel Blasen oh man
Oh manchmal mags so aussehen als ob
Mir die Luft ausgeht
Doch ganz genau dann
Werde ich noch schneller
Und ich rappe Acapella
Und ich wette diese Rapper bleiben vor mir steh'n
Ich will allen hier beweisen das da noch mehr geht
Guck so wie ich meine Hacken in Teer tret
Packe Metaphern in Takte
Fucke die andern nie ab
Ich paffe die Cannabispflanze
Nein ich mache nicht schlapp
Egal ob breit wie'n Sumo
High wie'n UFO
Der Boden ist immer direkt unter meinen Schuhsohlen
Und ich
Geh soviel darum sind da Löcher drin
Und der Weg ist das Ziel
Und da möchte ich hin
Und wenn auch ihr
Nie stehenbleibt
Dann solltet ihr den Song noch öfter's hören

I've lost the feeling and I'm numb to the core

Por que no tengo esta virtud, 
Si lo buscas rico fascinante no soy yo... 
Yo no he triunfado un solo día de mi vida. 
No darás jamás tu mano a un tipo como yo 
Ni por supuesto el corazón, 
Por que escucho los sentidos no los sentimientos, 
Así que niña no te enfades por que te diga la verdad. 
Se que bebo, se que fumo, se juego y hasta en el amor 
Se que soy un egoísta, un inconsciente, prepotente 
y en la vida como en el amor. 
Vendrá a caso el día en que cualquiera escribirá 
Palabras bellas sobre mi... 
Cualquier chica hablara de mi con ilusión, 
Se mezclaran abrazos flores y mentiras. 
No mas lagrimas ni te preocupes mas de mi.. 
Por que muy alto volaré. 
Yo he embrollado tanto que hasta a EL yo le mentí.. 
Que es perfectísima bondad, pero aun me puede perdonar, 
Se que bebo se que fumo se juego y hasta en el amor 
Se que soy un egoísta, un inconsciente, 
prepotente y en la vida como en el amor. 
Y una nube que vuela baja y vuela va, 
Va y me envuelve sin sentir, 
Y me arrastra sobre la montaña siempre azul, 
Mis pies cansados no los siento ya... 
Yo no quiero ya volver de nuevo que me importa, 
Me avergonzaré de mí 
Mas la cosa que me diga nuestra tierra si... 
Es la voz tuya que me llama, enamorada cual jamás 
Se que bebo se que fumo se juego y hasta en el amor 
Se que soy un egoísta, un inconsciente 
prepotente y en la vida como en el amor. 
Se que bebo se que fumo se juego y no me arrepiento 
Antes recomenzaré.... 
He embrollado a medio mundo a todos siempre he mentido 
Aun que nadie lo haya sabido por que la única lo has sido tu, 
Yo comprendo que he luchado como muchos la vida.. 
Y a la postre siempre solo he pagado una lagrima de mas.

Moving into a new space

Or don't call me, don't tell me what you've been doing

And all that I hope for is one day I will forgive me
Unless we surrender

To a lullaby in ragtime
Sleepy hands are creeping to the end of the clock
Play a lullaby in ragtime
You can tell the sandman is on his way
By the way
That they play
As still, as the trill, of a thrush, in a twilight high

So you can hear the
Rhythm of the ripples on the side of the boat

As you sail away to dreamland
High above the moon you hear a silvery note
As the sandman takes your hand
So rock-a-by my baby
Don't you cry my baby
Sleepy-time is nigh
Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby

Nicola Sirkis,"Ils s'embrassent au mois de janvier
Car une nouvelle année commence
Mais depuis des éternités
L'a pas tellement changé la France
Passent les jours et les semaines
Y a qu'le décor qui évolue
La mentalité est la même 
Tous des tocards, tous des faux culs

Ils sont pas lourds, en février
À se souvenir de Charonne
Des matraqueurs assermentés
Qui fignolèrent leur besogne
La France est un pays de flics
À tous les coins d'rue y'en a 100
Pour faire régner l'ordre public
Ils assassinent impunément

Quand on exécute au mois d'mars
De l'autre côté des Pyrénées
Un anarchiste du Pays basque
Pour lui apprendre à s'révolter
Ils crient, ils pleurent et ils s'indignent
De cette immonde mise à mort
Mais ils oublient qu'la guillotine
Chez nous aussi fonctionne encore

Etre né sous l'signe de l'hexagone
C'est pas ce qu'on fait d'mieux en ce moment
Et le roi des cons, sur son trône
J'parierai pas qu'il est allemand

On leur a dit, au mois d'avril
À la télé, dans les journaux
De pas se découvrir d'un fil
Que l'printemps c'était pour bientôt
Les vieux principes du seizième siècle
Et les vieilles traditions débiles
Ils les appliquent tous à la lettre
Y m'font pitié ces imbéciles

Ils se souviennent, au mois de mai
D'un sang qui coula rouge et noir
D'une révolution manquée
Qui faillit renverser l'Histoire
J'me souviens surtout d'ces moutons
Effrayés par la Liberté
S'en allant voter par millions
Pour l'ordre et la sécurité

Ils commémorent au mois de juin
Un débarquement d'Normandie
Ils pensent au brave soldat ricain
Qu'est venu se faire tuer loin d'chez lui
Ils oublient qu'à l'abri des bombes
Les Français criaient ""Vive Pétain""
Qu'ils étaient bien planqués à Londres
Qu'y avait pas beaucoup d'Jean Moulin

Etre né sous l'signe de l'hexagone
C'est pas la gloire, en vérité
Et le roi des cons, sur son trône
Me dites pas qu'il est portugais

Ils font la fête au mois d'juillet
En souvenir d'une révolution
Qui n'a jamais éliminé
La misère et l'exploitation
Ils s'abreuvent de bals populaires
D'feux d'artifice et de flonflons
Ils pensent oublier dans la bière
Qu'ils sont gouvernés comme des pions

Au mois d'août c'est la liberté
Après une longue année d'usine
Ils crient, ""Vive les congés payés""
Ils oublient un peu la machine
En Espagne, en Grèce ou en France
Ils vont polluer toutes les plages
Et par leur unique présence
Abîmer tous les paysages

Lorsqu'en septembre on assassine
Un peuple et une liberté
Au cœur de l'Amérique latine
Ils sont pas nombreux à gueuler
Un ambassadeur se ramène
Bras ouverts il est accueilli
Le fascisme c'est la gangrène
À Santiago comme à Paris

Etre né sous l'signe de l'hexagone
C'est vraiment pas une sinécure
Et le roi des cons, sur son trône
Il est français, ça j'en suis sûr

Finies les vendanges en octobre
Le raisin fermente en tonneaux
Ils sont très fiers de leurs vignobles
Leurs ""Côtes-du-Rhône"" et leurs ""Bordeaux""
Ils exportent le sang de la terre
Un peu partout à l'étranger
Leur pinard et leur camembert
C'est leur seule gloire à ces tarés

En novembre, au salon de l'auto
Ils vont admirer par milliers
L'dernier modèle de chez Peugeot
Qu'ils pourront jamais se payer
La bagnole, la télé, l'tiercé
C'est l'opium du peuple de France
Lui supprimer c'est le tuer
C'est une drogue à accoutumance

En décembre c'est l'apothéose
La grande bouffe et les p'tits cadeaux
Ils sont toujours aussi moroses
Mais y a d'la joie dans les ghettos
La Terre peut s'arrêter d'tourner
Ils rateront pas leur réveillon
Moi j'voudrais tous les voir crever
Étouffés de dinde aux marrons

Etre né sous l'signe de l'hexagone
On peut pas dire qu'ca soit bandant
Si l'roi des cons perdait son trône
Y aurait 60 millions de prétendants",Hexagone,2014

I have no friends, no-one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know
       
What's the name of the game?  (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)
(But it means a lot)
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow

And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know
Oh yes I wanna know

The name of the game  (I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?  (But I think I can see in your face)
(That it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?  (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)
(But it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?  (I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?  (But I think I can see in your face)

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing

I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?

Nicolas de Angelis,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1997

Aujourd'hui disparu
Mon enfance jouait par là
Je me souviens de cela
Il y avait un' palissade
Un taillis d'embuscades
Les voyous de mon quartier
Venaient s'y batailler

À présent il y a un café
Un comptoir tout neuf qui fait de l'effet
Une fleuriste qui vend ses fleurs aux amants
Et même aux enterrements

Je revois mon coin de rue
Aujourd'hui disparu

Je me souviens d'un triste soir
Où le cœur sans espoir
Je pleurais en attendant
Un amour de quinze ans
Un amour qui fut perdu
Juste à ce coin de rue

Et depuis j'ai beaucoup voyagé
Trop souvent en pays étrangers
Mondes neufs constructions et démolitions
Vous me donnez des visions

Je crois voir mon coin de rue
Et soudain apparus

Vous avez déclaré : Moi, j'ai pas un rond

Quand les jeunesses débarquent
