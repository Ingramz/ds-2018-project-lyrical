Joachim Garraud,"You are the music 
You are the reason I believe 
You are the seasons 
You are the blessing I receive 

You are the answer 
Lighting the fires of passion burning deep 
You are inspiration 
Running like a million rivers over me 

And you take me 
And you take me 
To the place I've never been before",You Are the Music,2004

For the wind blows so sweet
Come away, come away
Dance with me

Let us dance to forget
Let us dance to remember
All those days of last summer

Joachim Garraud,"I believe in the wonder,
I believe this new life took in,
Like a God that I'm under,
There's drugs running through my veins,
I believe in the wonder,
I believe I can touch the flame,
There's a spell that I'm under,
Got to fly, I don't feel no shame,

The world is mine,
The world is mine,
The world is mine,
The world is mine,

Take a look what you've started,
In the world flashing from your eyes,
And you know that you've got it,
From the thunder you feel inside,
I believe in a feeling,
Of the pain that you left to die,
I believe in the livin'
In life that you give to try,

The world is mine,
The world is mine,
The world is mine,

Joachim Garraud,"I'm hurting deep inside
And it's like that always
The passion was not ours to keep (to keep)
The feelings justified
You're giving me this heartache
Rejection comes in and cuts so deep (so deep)
Now everywhere I turn
All my bridges burn
Why can't you see all I need come set me free

[Chorus]
'Cause I still can feel you always
My love can heal you always
It too can heal you always
Alright, always
I still can feel it always
I still believe it always
I can't conceal it always

Everywhere I go, it's like you're there beside me
Possession makes my heart pretend, pretend
Cause I just can't let go
Why did love ever find me
To give affection once again
But too late
I feel I tried inside
With all of my pride
Why can't you see all I need come set me free

Joachim Garraud,"Don't say nothing 
Love in the fall 
God saint child 
Don't you miss of it all 

The Joan of Arc 
Kiss in the dark; she's a Firestone 
Catching all; watch her burn 
So so pretty; cutting her hair 
Dark star spirit now she's up in the gutter 
Kills her feeling; keep us in here 
Come out saint, but she called a healing 
Don't say nothing; love in the fall 
God saint child; don't you miss of it all

The Joan of Arc 
Kiss in the dark; she's a Firestone 
Catching all; watch her burn

It's such a shock 
Watching her getting out 
Let it out 
Lips are burning (The Joan of Arc) 

White heart city, jungle in here 
Hang low spinning, now she's lost in the mirror 
Heart spits ripping, 
Strikes up busy bodies suffer the fever 
All saints come one you loving the fall 
Go my child, look away from it all

But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless

Comme des oriflammes
Le long des berges mornes
Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui meurent
Pleins de bière et de drames
Aux premières lueurs

Y a des marins qui naissent
Dans la chaleur épaisse
Des langueurs océanes

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui mangent
Sur des nappes trop blanches
Des poissons ruisselants
Ils vous montrent des dents
A croquer la fortune
A décroiser la lune
A bouffer des haubans
Et ça sent la morue
Jusque dans le cœur des frites
Que leurs grosses mains invitent
A revenir en plus
Puis se lèvent en riant
Dans un bruit de tempête
Referment leur braguette
Et sortent en rotant

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui dansent
En se frottant la panse
Sur la panse des femmes
Et ils tournent et ils dansent
Comme des soleils crachés
Dans le son déchiré
D’un accordéon rance
Ils se tordent le cou
Pour mieux s’entendre rire
Jusqu’à ce que tout à coup
L’accordéon expire
Alors le geste grave
Alors le regard fier
Ils ramènent leur batave
Jusqu’en pleine lumière

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui boivent
Et qui boivent et reboivent
Et qui reboivent encore
Ils boivent à la santé
Des putains d’Amsterdam
De Hambourg ou d’ailleurs
Enfin ils boivent aux dames
Qui leur donnent leur joli corps
Qui leur donnent leur vertu
Pour une pièce en or
Et quand ils ont bien bu
Se plantent le nez au ciel
Se mouchent dans les étoiles
Et ils pissent comme je pleure

Und unsere Blicke treffen sich das erste Mal

Wir hatten einen langen Weg
Das gleiche Ziel vor Augen
Den gleichen Kampf gefochten
Gegner im Spiel
Streiter um das selbe Herz

Meine Dame schlug der KÃ¶nig
Deine Dame war auch Meine
Rivalen in der Liebe
Partner im Streit

Nichts hattest du jemals zu verlieren
Die Hoffnung war dir treu

Alles hattest du
Und alles hast du verloren
So wie meine Hoffnung
ErfÃ¼llt sich deine Angst

Wer hat die Dame geopfert?!
Und wer hat dabei verloren?!
Verloren sind wir alle

Und dabei sind wir eins
Und so trete ich vor dich

Und so liege ich danieder
Wo ist sie nun - da ich vergehe?

Ich bin nicht gekommen dich zu geleiten!
Ich bin gekommen dich zu befreien
Und ich befreie dich von diesem Kampf
Und ich befreie dich von deinem Feind
Und Ã¼ber dies und mehr als Alles
Befreie ich dich von ihrem Herz!",Abendrot,2006

Ah!

Doch das Leid geht vorüber

Und die Hörner blasen zur Jagd!

Ah!

Wenn die Fessel reißen
Wir uns nach Draußen beißen
Entsteigt die Lust der Melancholie
Wenn wir durch Straßen hetzen
Und unsere Säbel wetzen
Weicht unser Stolz der Hysterie
Und da gehst du vorüber
Und du duftest nach Flieder
Und meine Augen
Verlieren den Schmerz!

Starr das Herz erfror
Und meine Seele steigt empor
Und die Macht zerbricht
Tränen fliehen ins weiße Licht
Die Zeit bleibt stehen, doch du begannst zu gehen
Dein Schritt war schnell, der Mond der schien so grell
Sag' willst du Treue oder zeigst du jetzt doch Reue
Oder bist du nur das Beutetier
Denn ich seh' nur die Gier in dir
Ich geh' vorbei, nun zähl doch 1-2-3
Wer schreit denn hier Fabelwesen
Bist's ja doch wohl nicht gewesen
Ich wart' auf dich, ich wart' ein Leben lang

Ich komm', doch komm' ich auch zurück?
Ich lass dich gehen, jeden Tag ein kleines Stück!

Estuve contigo estando con ella
Quizá fue un error
Pero no me arrepiento
Pues esa noche me hiciste sentir
Lo que nadie a sentido
Lo que nadie a vivido
Eres tu

La que me hipnotiza
Y en la noche nos amamos
La que a solas lentamente nos amamos
Eres tu

Eres tu la que me hipnotiza
Eres tu la que me envicia
Tu eres la que en la cama
Enciende la llama
Tu eres fuego que nunca se apaga tierra callada
que en la madrugada
Me envuelve y me envicia
Y se aleja yo soy el que te acaricia
El que te envicia el que en la noche te hace mía
Estoy con ella pero eres tu

La que me hipnotiza y en la noche nos amamos
La que a solas lentamente nos besamos
Eres tu la que me hipnotiza eres tu la que envicia

En la noche cuando estamos envueltos (mai)
Ya tu me tienes inquieto tu relación poco a poco decayendo
(Y tu) haces que me este perdiendo

Esto no se acaba siempre tu me llamas cuando
Te escapabas nos vamos con ganas d mi gente brava conmigo en la cama
Y por eso oye
Estuve contigo estando con ella quizá
Fue un error pero no me arrepiento pues esa noche me hiciste
Sentir lo que nadie a sentido lo que nadie a vivido eres tu

Esa noche contigo no me arrepiento de lo que hice
Mujer entre tu y yo sabes mujer existen cosas
que nadie sabe guardar en secreto

En un papel

De la puerta

A su merced

Joan Albert Amargós,"Noia de porcellana
Buscava una ànima dintre teu
I això era com buscar
Papallones blanques damunt la neu

Noia de porcellana
La teva entranya és plena de vent
Una brisa de maig
Amb pètals de rosa és aire innocent

Noia de porcellana
Tot el teu cos és un recipient
A punt per ser omplert d'aigua
I posar-hi un lliri quan ve el bon temps

Noia de porcellana
Buscava força en el teu parlar
I això era com buscar
Papallones blaves damunt la mar

Noia de porcellana
D'una mirada et van trencar un braç
Semblaves indignada
Com una santa sense beats

Noia de porcellana
Tota ets tan fràgil que t'has tancat
Sota d'una campana
Que sona dolça I és de cristall

Noia de porcellana
Buscava llum en la teva pell
I això era com buscar
Papallones d'aire allà on bufa el vent

Joan Albert Amargós,"Todo pasa y todo queda
Pero lo nuestro es pasar
Pasar haciendo caminos
Caminos sobre la mar

Nunca perseguí la gloria
Ni dejar en la memoria 
De los hombres mi canción
Yo amo los mundos sutiles
Ingrávidos y gentiles
Como pompas de jabón

Me gusta verlos pintarse 
De sol y grana, volar 
Bajo el cielo azul, temblar 
Súbitamente y quebrarse

Nunca perseguí la gloria

Caminante, son tus huellas 
El camino y nada más
Caminante, no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar

Al andar se hace camino 
Y al volver la vista atrás 
Se ve la senda que nunca 
Se ha de volver a pisar

Caminante no hay camino 
Sino estelas en la mar

Hace algún tiempo en ese lugar 
Donde hoy los bosques se visten de espinos 
Se oyó la voz de un poeta gritar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso 

Murió el poeta lejos del hogar
Le cubre el polvo de un país vecino
Al alejarse le vieron llorar
«caminante no hay camino
Se hace camino al andar» 
Golpe a golpe, verso a verso

Cuando el poeta es un peregrino
Cuando de nada nos sirve rezar

Joan Albert Amargós,"Cuando la llama de la fe se apague, y los doctores 
No hallen la causa de su mal, señoras y señores

Goce la posibilidad de alborotar el barrio

No se sorprenda si al girar, la luna le hace un guiño
Que un par de vueltas le dirán cómo alucina un niño
Le aplaudirán desde un balcón geranios y claveles 
Y unos ojos que le llenaron de cascabeles

Enfúndese en los pantalones largos de su hermano 
Y en la primera bocanada de humo americano 
Que el aire será más azul y la noche más corta
Si no le cura, al menos, le reconforta

Joan Albert Amargós,"Era la gloria vestida de tul 
Con la mirada lejana y azul 
Que sonreía en un escaparate 
Con la boquita menuda y granate, 
Y unos zapatos de falso charol 
Que chispeaban al roce del sol. 
Limpia y bonita. Siempre iba a la moda. 
Arregladita como pa' ir de boda. 

Y yo, a todas horas la iba a ver 
Porque yo amaba a esa mujer 
De cartón piedra, 
Que de San Esteban a Navidades, 
Entre saldos y novedades, 
Hacía más tierna mi acera. 

No era como esas muñecas de abril 
Que me arañaron de frente y perfil. 
Que se comieron mi naranja a gajos. 
Que me arrancaron la ilusión de cuajo, 
Y con la presteza que da el alquiler, 
Olvida el aire que respiró ayer 
Y juega las cartas que le da el momento
Mañana es sólo un adverbio de tiempo. 

No. Ella esperaba en su vitrina 
Verme doblar aquella esquina 
Como una novia. 
Como un pajarillo, pidiéndome
Libérame, libérame
Y huyamos a escribir la historia. 

De una pedrada me cargué el cristal 
Y corrí, corrí con ella hasta mi portal. 
Todo su cuerpo me tembló en los brazos. 
Nos sonreía la luna de marzo. 
Bajo la lluvia bailamos un vals, 
Un, dos, tres, un, dos, tres, todo daba igual, 
Y yo le hablaba de nuestro futuro, 
Y ella lloraba en silencio, os lo juro! 

Y entre cuatro paredes y un techo 
Se reventó contra su pecho 
Pena tras pena. 
Tuve entre mis manos el universo 
E hicimos del pasado un verso 
Perdido dentro de un poema. 

Y entonces, llegaron ellos
Me sacaron a empujones de mi casa 
Y me encerraron entre estas cuatro paredes blancas, 
Donde vienen a verme mis amigos 
De mes en mes, de dos en dos y de seis a siete.",De Cartón Piedra,2003

Iba y venía con 
Prisa en la tarde que 
Anunciaba chaparrón

Sigue jugando en tu playa
Y escondido tras las cañas
Duerme mi primer amor,
Llevo tu luz Y tu olor
Por dondequiera que vaya,
Y amontonado en tu arena
Guardo amor, juegos Y penas.

Yo, que en la piel tengo el sabor
Amargo del llanto eterno
Que han vertido en ti cien pueblos
De Algeciras a Estambul
Para que pintes de azul
Sus largas noches de invierno.
A fuerza de desventuras,
Tu alma es profunda Y oscura.

A tus atardeceres rojos
Se acostumbraron mis ojos
Como el recodo al camino.

Me gusta el juego Y el vino,
Tengo alma de marinero.
Qué le voy a hacer, si yo
Nací en el Mediterráneo.

Y te acercas, Y te vas
Después de besar mi aldea.
Jugando con la marea
Te vas, pensando en volver.
Eres como una mujer
Perfumadita de brea
Que se añora Y que se quiere
Que se conoce Y se teme.

Ay, si un día para mi mal
Viene a buscarme la parca.
Empujad al mar mi barca
Con un levante otoñal
Y dejad que el temporal
Desguace sus alas blancas.

Y a mí enterradme sin duelo
Entre la playa Y el cielo...

En la ladera de un monte,
Más alto que el horizonte.

Y amarillo a la genista.

Joan Albert Amargós,"Tenía diez años y un gato 
Peludo, funámbulo y necio 
Que me esperaba en los alambres del patio 
A la vuelta del colegio. 
Tenía un balcón con albahaca 
Y un ejército de botones 
Y un tren con vagones de lata 
Roto entre dos estaciones. 

Tenía un cielo azul y un jardín de adoquines 
Y una historia a quemar temblándome en la piel. 
Era un bello jinete 
Sobre mi patinete 
Burlando cada esquina 
Como una golondrina 
Sin nada que olvidar 
Porque ayer aprendí a volar, 
Perdiendo el tiempo mirando el mar. 

Tenía una casa sombría 
Que madre vistió de ternura 
Y una almohada que hablaba y sabía 
De mis sueños de ser cura. 
Tenía un canario amarillo 
Que al viento trinaba sus penas 
Oyendo algún viejo organillo 
O mi radio de galena. 

Y en julio, en Aragón, tenía un pueblecillo, 
Una acequia, un establo y unas ruinas al sol. 
Al viento los ombligos 
Volaban cuatro amigos 
Picados de viruela 
Y huérfanos de escuela, 
Robando uva y maíz, 
Chupando caña y regaliz. 
Creo que entonces yo era feliz. 

Tenía cuatro sacramentos 
Y un ángel de la guarda amigo 
Y un ""Paris-Hollywood"" prestado y mugriento 
Escondido entre los libros. 
Tenía una novia morena 
Que abrió a la luna mis sentidos 
Jugando los juegos prohibidos 
A la sombra de una higuera. 

Crucé por la niñez imitando a mi hermano. 
Descerrajando el viento y apedreando al sol. 
Mi madre crió canas 
Pespunteando pijamas,

Y mi hermano se fue 
De casa, por primera vez.

Joan Albert Amargós,"Colgado de un barranco 
Duerme mi pueblo blanco 
Bajo un cielo que, a fuerza 
De no ver nunca el mar
Se olvidó de llorar
Por sus callejas de polvo y piedra 
Por no pasar, ni pasó la guerra
Sólo el olvido 
Camina lento bordeando la cañada 
Donde no crece una flor 
Ni trashuma un pastor

El sacristán ha visto 
Hacerse viejo al cura
El cura ha visto al cabo 
Y el cabo al sacristán
Y mi pueblo después 
Vio morir a los tres
Y me pregunto por qué nacerá gente 
Si nacer o morir es indiferente

De la siega a la siembra 
Se vive en la taberna
Las comadres murmuran 
Su historia en el umbral 
De sus casas de cal
Y las muchachas hacen bolillos 
Buscando, ocultas tras los visillos
A ese hombre joven 
Que, noche a noche, forjaron en su mente
Fuerte para ser su señor
Tierno para el amor

Ellas sueñan con él
Y él con irse muy lejos 
De su pueblo y los viejos 
Sueñan morirse en paz
Y morir por morir
Quieren morirse al sol
La boca abierta al calor, como lagartos
Medio ocultos tras un sombrero de esparto

Escapad gente tierna
Que esta tierra está enferma
Y no esperes mañana 
Lo que no se os dio ayer
Que no hay nada que hacer
Toma tu mula, tu hembra y tu arreo
Sigue el camino del pueblo hebreo 
Y busca otra luna
Tal vez mañana sonría la fortuna
Y si te toca llorar 
Es mejor frente al mar

Si yo pudiera unirme 
A un vuelo de palomas
Y atravesando lomas 
Dejar mi pueblo atrás
Os juro por lo que fui 
Que me iría de aquí
Pero los muertos están en cautiverio 
Y no nos dejan salir del cementerio",Pueblo Blanco,2003

All over your bedroom floor
And there's pictures of you since you were a girl
Since you were a girl of four
You're a child star
They ordained you
You're a child star
At that time that was right
But you're thirty-four today
You gotta stop, stop acting like a child

Been such a long time baby
Since you were knee high
And you're much too old for pampering
And you're much too young to die
Much too old for lollipops
And not old enough for lies
You're a grown woman, stop acting
Acting like a child

Box of heavy tablets
Lying by your bed
And there's sadness clogging up your memories
They block your head
You're playing games, games with nature
Games you can't afford to lose
How can you find out who you are
Surrounded by the blues



",Child Star,1972
Joan Armatrading,"To you it's just another day
When you see the sun you say
That's the way the day begins
And promises you make

Do you really mean to keep
Or are they words you say to fill the silent space
And when there's an empty moment
Won't you dedicate it to me

Or is it spent on burning incense
Or painting rooms in white
Lord won't you call me today just to say hello
Conversation is the name of the game

We got phone calls and letters
And brown paper parcels to my baby
To my baby, to my baby
With all my love

Won't you dedicate it to me
Or is it spent on burning incense
Or painting rooms in white

Keeps you on the straight and narrow

And your false complexion just another alibi

Take a hold of me

A huge old barrel
Rust my car if you must
Just don't go giving too much of yourself
To everyone
I swear
Turn my body into dust
Just show me a clean face
Clean as can be
Either keep your hands to yourself
Or stretch out and give them to me
Need much more from you
Than twenty four hours
So much I don't have to rush
Just don't go promoting yourself to everybody
I'll sell my soul for your trust

Your business
And leave me alone to unwind

So I'm confused
Like most people are at times
But I love you
And this love of mine
Will comfort you
If need be

At times when I'm worried
I'll shy away from you

So at times I'm without the light I need in life
But I love you and this love of mine
Will open many doors
To make you see me to make you see me
See me in loves light

Come when you need me
I'm needing you
We could be the starlight in the morning dew
Even in my sorrows
I'll smile for you
Makes me free to see you happy

So I turn away at times
Turn away from right and wrong
So I freeze in the breeze
In the breeze of your song

And this love of mine will
See you through

In the pale moonlight

Still wanna be there

I saw it happening and it's sad
It came about so go on with your plan

Are still gonna happen
If you lie or make it sound

When we drank the wine
When we talked
When we talked
Made no sense at all

I have found out
Now this haze in gone
That I need your coolness
To keep me alive

Oh baby what am I to do
Get down on my knees
My body aches
And my eyes feel tired
Am I blue for you

Oh darling I remember
When the good feeling was there
How we laughed
How we laughed
Those times are on my mind

Oh darling
I have found out
Now this crazy feeling is gone
That I need your loving

Out last night
It was a clear night
The nearest moon I'd ever seen
Filled the sky

To some party
With your arm around my waist
Planning my weekends
Maybe planning to change

I'm in love
And I got to let you know

Want to be
In your loving arms again

Joan Armatrading,"I was walking down the street, looking like a million dollars
With a pretty person, my arm when someone started shouting
They were hooting and a hollering
They were saying, ""I should never have been born""

I said, ""Baby, you hear that?""
You're listening to the voices of fools
I said, ""Baby, let me tell you""

What they're trying to do
They're trying to make our love
A thing of the past but I said, ""Aha""

The very next day it was early in the morning
The sun was shining on my back
I was feeling pretty rested, the air smelt good
And I forgot about the thing in the park

When they walked up then they passed me
You know, I didn't want to turn my head
But they started up again and those silly voices rang
And the clanging was too much for my brain

But I said, ""Aha, what we've got is the best""

It was Friday, I had money, I was feeling kind of special
I was taking my baby, up town
The moon was high, the stars were bright
And there was lots of people in the street

I held your hand, you kissed me and then
All the people started to stare, we started a commotion
Someone making comments, morals
The state of affairs and I said, ""What we got is the best""

If fell between the covers and my bare skin
It fell between my crying
And my longing for you

I loved this one too long
This one much too much
Sometimes I gave just enough of myself
But most times nothing at all

And you've been gone too long
You know I love you the best
You call me crazy, that's how you won my heart
'Cause you were half crazy too

I read your letter again today
Out loud and to myself
It gave me back my sanity
I didn't feel so alone

Won't be too soon
Not like the night
Not like the night on a summer's day
Can't wait to see you step across the room, empty room

Save you and me
I feel your touches in your letters
But it's not half as good as you touching me

In and quickly out of love

When you know I've got troubles enough?
Why do you call me
When you know I can't answer the phone?

Make me lie, when I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of an unknowin' fool
You make me stare, when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me?

Why do you come here
And pretend to be just passing by?
But I need to see you,
And I mean to hold you

Waking from tormented sleep
This old love has me bound
But this new love cuts deep

Loving the silence
Wrapped in my man's arms at the end of the day

Loving the way you
Make me feel
That women rule the world if women ruled the world
It would be a good thing

No more war
No more hate
Women can fight
But talking's great
Behind your back
To your face
They'd rather talk
Than murder

Not all men kill babies
But a woman would rather
Kill herself
Than see a child suffer
Women are carers
They were born that way

Like mother nature feeds the world
A woman will think of her child first
No more sons dying young
Women bore sons for living

No more war
No more hate
Women can fight
But talking's great
Behind your back
To your face
They'd rather talk
Than murder

I love how you love me
Make me feel that

Let the sea that once did take me
Bring me back safe to your door

Clear the deck let me touch your soul
Maybe I'll bring you back a gift of love

",Dry Land,1997
Joan Armatrading,"I was very sad last night
You came by
I was so glad though sadness covered
The smile I kept for you
I was waiting for the cloud to pass over
Then I could show my love

You could have made me laugh if you'd stayed
But you left
I was more confused than I was before you came
I was frightened
I saw insanity and tears
I shouted for you to stay

It could have been better
If you had held my hand
And smiled at me
Or questioned why
My face was so distorted

I'm back in the sunlight again
Oh I'm so glad
It's only joy I wanna give to you
Sometimes I feel lost and desperate
Please forgive me
If I show no sign of reasoning
Or consideration
In my bleaker times

Joan Armatrading,"Anybody looking on
They can see
I'm not so good

In the night

But there's nothing changes my mind

I've been loving you too long
And I can't seem to stop
You are my lifeline
You make me happy

Love by you

Wouldn't take long to know them well

And to Paul, he is a saint
And Adam, he's from the forest
And to Jane, all day she paints

You ask me how I feel now
Well I will tell you no lie
Jessie, you bring the sunshine
And you can see it in her eyes

Johnny tends the garden
And little David sows the seeds

He gives us all we need

He is Peter
He's a piper, yeah

Welcome brothers, yeah

And she's steppin' out on the town

Means my broken heart

It's all Schubert and Beethoven

So let's go down on Sunday morning
To hear that Jacob sermon read
Everybody dressed in their finest church apparel baby
Listening to the preacher eulogies

Then we'll pray
Pray
Pray
Yea we'll pray
Our souls will rise upon that day
Pray
Pray
Pray
Pray we change to better ways

They're telling stories about love's passion
All about ménage a trois
Hear those heart felt Lieder 
Coming from that deep bass voice
And whilst some sleep though this music
Others weep for all the pain
As they sing secular song in the churches baby
It's time to kneel let's kneel and pray

Well I'm a rake and ramblin' boy.
There's many a city I did enjoy,
And now I've married me a pretty little wife
And I love her dearer than I love my life.

Oh, she was pretty, both neat and gay
Caused me to rob the broad highway
Oh, yes, I robbed it, I do declare.
And I got myself ten thousand bail.

Oh when I die don't bury me at all
Place my bones in alcohol
And at my feet place a snow white dove
To let the world know I died for love.

Well I'm a rake and a ramblin' boy.

I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway 
I woke from my dream and all idols was clay
And all portions of love then had all flown away

He told me to love him and promised to love
And cherish me over all others above
My poor heart is wondering no misery can tell
He left me no warning, no words of farewell

Joan Baez,"Twas in the merry month of May 
When green buds all were swelling, 
Sweet William on his death bed lay 
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town 
To the place where she was dwelling, 
Saying you must come, to my master dear 
If your name be Barbara Allen.
 
So slowly, slowly she got up 
And slowly she drew nigh him, 
And the only words to him did say 
Young man I think you're dying. 

He turned his face unto the wall 
And death was in him welling, 
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all 
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave 
She heard the death bells knelling 
And every stroke to her did say 
Hard hearted Barbara Allen. 

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave 
Make it both long and narrow, 
Sweet William died of love for me 
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave 
Make it both long and narrow, 
Sweet William died on yesterday 
And I will die tomorrow. 

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard 
Sweet William was buried beside her, 
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose 
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar. 

They grew and grew in the old churchyard 
Till they could grow no higher 
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot 
And the rose grew round the briar.",Barbara Allen,1961
Joan Baez,"When Joseph was an old man, an old man was he
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee

Joseph and Mary walked through an orchard green
There were cherries and berries, as thick as might be seen
There were cherries and berries, as thick as might be seen

Mary said to Joseph, so meek and so mild:
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child

Then Joseph flew in anger, in anger flew he
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!

Then up spoke baby Jesus, from in Mary's womb:
Bend down the tallest branches, that my mother might have some
Bend down the tallest branches, that my mother might have some

And bend down the tallest branches, it touched Mary's hand
Cried she: Oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command
Oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command

Joan Baez,"Along came the F15 the swiftest on the line 
Running o'er the C and O road just twenty minutes behind 
Running into Cevile head porters on the line 
Receiving their strict orders from a station just behind 
Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm 
Saying my darling son be careful how you run 

For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time 
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time 
Up the road he darted against the rocks he crushed 

Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast did smash 
His head was against the firebox door the flames are rolling high 
I'm glad I was born for an engineer to die on the C&O road 
The doctor said to Georgie my darling boy be still 

Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will 
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free 
I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three 

The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved 
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave 
His face was covered up with blood his eyes they could not see 
And the very last words poor Georgie said was nearer my God to thee",Engine 143,1961
Joan Baez,"Lily of the West

Arrangement by Joan Baez

When first I came to Louisville
Some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington
Was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips
Like arrows pierced my breast
And the name she bore was Flora
The Lily Of The West

I courted lovely Flora
Some pleasure there to find
She turned unto another man
Which sore distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty
Deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora
The Lily Of The West

Down in yonder shady grove
A man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there
It seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him
It sure did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora
The Lily Of The West

I stepped up to my rival
My dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar and
I boldly made him stand
Being mad to desperation I pierced him in the breast
All for my lovely Flora
The Lily Of The West

I had to stand my trial
I had to make my plea
They placed me in the criminal box
And then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away
Deprived me of my rest
And I still love my faithless Flora
The Lily Of The West



",Lily of the West,1961

Look up and down that lonesome road,
Hang down your head and cry, my Lord!
Hang down your head and cry

They say all good friends must part sometimes
Why not you and I (my Lord)
Why not you and I

I wish to the Lord that I've never been born,
Or died when I was a baby, my Lord!
Or died when I was a baby

I would've not been here eating this cold cold bread
And supping this salty gravy, my Lord!
And supping this salty gravy

I wish to the Lord that I've never seen your face,
Heard your lying tongue, my Lord!
Heard your lying tongue

So look up and down that lonesome road,
All our friends have gone, my Lord!
And you and I must go

Well, I shouldered my axe and I tooted my horn,
Went to find 'possum in the new-grown corn.
Old Blue treed and I went to see,
Blue had 'possum up a tall oak tree.
Boy I roasted 'possum, nice and brown,
Sweet potatoes, n' all a-round
And to say ""Here old Blue (here-boy)
You can have some too""

Made a big dent in my back-yard.
Dug his grave with a silver spade,
Lowered him down with a link of chain.

You've married me to a boy who is too young
I'm twice twelve and he is but fourteen

We'll send him to college for one year yet
I'll tie blue ribbons all around his head
To let the maidens know that he's married

I spied all the boys aplaying with the ball
My own true love was the flower of them all

At the age of sixteen, his grave it was green

He's courted me daily, by night and by day
But now he is packing and moving away

My parents don't like him because he is poor
They say he's not worthy of entering my door
He works for a living, his money's his own
And if they don't like it they can leave him alone

Your horses are hungry, go feed them some hay
Then sit down beside me as long as you may
My horses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay
Then fare thee well darlin I'll be on my way

A story I will tell
Of Pretty Boy Floyd an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well.
It was in the town of Shawnee
It was Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.
There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
And his wife she overheard.
Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed a gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

He took to the trees and timbers
And he lived a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma was added to his name
Yes, he took to the trees and timbers
On that Canadian River's shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At a many a farmer's door.

There's a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How this outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little home.
Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal
And underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
With a letter that did say:
You say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Now as through this world I ramble
I see lots of funny men

And some with a fountain pen.

As through your life you roam

But daddy, you been on my mind

I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down, don't get upset
I am not pleading or saying, ""I can't forget you""
I do not walk the floor bowed down and bent but yet
Daddy, you been on my mind

Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts ,they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me nor bring me down in sorrow
It don't even matter who you're waking with tomorrow
Daddy, you're just on my mind

I am not asking you to say words like yes or no
Please understand me, I'm not calling for you to go
I'm just breathing to myself, pretending not that I don't know
That daddy, you been on my mind

When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror
Oh, you know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on her mind
As someone who has had you on her mind

Joan Baez,"Come all of you cowboys all over this land
I'll sing you the law of the Ranger's command.

To hold a six-shooter and never to run
As long as there's bullets in both of your guns.

I met a fair maiden whose name I don't know
I asked her to the round-up with me would she go.

She said she'd go with me to the cold round-up
And drink that hard liquor from a cold bitter cup.

We started for the round-up in the fall of the year
Expecting to get there with a herd of fat steer.

When the rustlers broke on us in the dead hour of night
She rose from her warm bed a battle to fight.
She rose from her warm bed with a gun in each hand
Saying, ""Come all you cowboys, and fight for your land.""

Come all of you cowboys, and don't ever run
As long as there's bullets in both of your guns.

Joan Baez,"The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Born is the King of Israel!

Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of ought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

For poor on'ry people like you and like I;
I wonder as I wander out under the sky 
When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
But high from God's heaven, a star's light did fall
And the promise of ages it then did recall.

A star in the sky or a bird on the wing
Or all of God's Angels in heaven to sing
He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King",I Wonder as I Wander,1966

",What Child Is This?,1966
Joan Baez,"It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee,
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love,
I and my Annabel Lee,
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that,long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud,chilling
My Annabel lee,
So that her high,born kinsmen came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea.

And the angels,not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me,
Yes!,that was the reason(as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling my Annabel lee,
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Killing my Annabelle.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we,
Of many far wiser than we,
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee, and the moon never beams,
Without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,
And so,all the night, tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling my life and my bride,
In the sepulcher there by the sea,
In her tomb by the sounding sea.",Annabel Lee,1967
Joan Baez,"Why all these bugles cry
These squads of young men drill
To kill and to be killed
Stood waiting by the train

Why the orders loud and hoarse
Why the engine's groaning cough
As it strains to drag us all
Into the holocaust

Why crowds who sing and cry
And shout and fling us flowers
And trade their rights for ours
To murder and to die

[Chorus]
The dove has torn her wing(s)
So no more songs of love
We are not here to sing
We're here to kill the dove

Why must this moment come
When childhood has to die
When hope shrinks to a sigh
And speech into a drum

Why are they pale and still
Young boys trained over night
Conscripts payed to kill
And dressed in gray to fight

These rainclouds massing tight
This train load battle bound
This moving burial ground
Goes thundering to the night

[Chorus]

Why statues towering grave
Above the last defeat
Old words and lies repeat
Across a new made grave

And why the same still birds
That victory always brought
These hours of glory bought
By men with mounds of earth

Dead ash without a spark
Where cities used to be
Where guns probe every spark
And crush it into dust

[Chorus]

And while your face undone
With jagged lines of tears
That gave in those first years
All the peace I'd ever want

Your body in the gloom
The platform fading back
Your shadow on the track
A flower upon a tomb

And why these days ahead
When I must let you cry
And live prepared to die
And to

Joan Baez,"If you were a carpenter, and I were a lady
Would you marry me anyway? would you have my baby?
If a tinker were your trade, would you still find me
Carrying the pots you made, following behind me?

See my love through loneliness
See my love for sorrow
I've given you my onlyness,
Come give me your tomorrow

If you worked your hands in wood, would you still love me?
Answer me, Yes I would, I'd put you above me""
And if you were a miller, had a mill-wheel grinding,
Would you see it written on my face? I'm here for the finding.

See my love through loneliness
See my love for sorrow
I've given you my onlyness,
Come give me your tomorrow

If you were a carpenter, and I were a lady
Would you marry me anyway? would you have my baby?
Would you marry me anyway? would you have my baby?



",If You Were a Carpenter,1967
Joan Baez,"(Music by Joan Baez, Lyrics by Nina Duscheck)

Where icicles hung the blossoms swing,
But in my heart there is no spring.
You were my spring, my summer too,
It's always winter without you.

The flocks head north and the lilacs bloom,
At night they scent my moonlit room.
You were my spring, my summer too,
I'm going north to look for you.

Like a windblown bird my heart goes forth,
Sent by the spring to the shining north.
You are my spring, my summer too,
And I won't rest till I find you.

I'm going out to stem the tide 
A tide that never saw the seas 
It flows through jungles, 'round the trees 
Some say it's yellow, some say red 
It will not matter when we're dead 

How many dead men will it take 
To build a dike that will not break? 
How many children must we kill 
Before we make the waves stand still? 
Though miracles come high today 
We have the wherewithal to pay 

It takes them off the streets, you know 
To places they would never go alone 
It gives them useful trades 
The lucky boys are even paid 
Men die to build their Pharaoh's tombs 
And still, and still the teeming wombs 

How many men to conquer Mars?
How many dead to reach the stars?

Joan Baez,"With your mercury mouth in the missionary times,
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes,
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes,
Oh, who among them do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last,
And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass,
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass,
Who among them do they think could carry you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I put them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace,
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace,
And your basement clothes and your hollow face,
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Who among them would try to impress you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?


The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug,
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs,
Who among them do you think could resist you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?


Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you the dead angels that they used to hide.
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Oh, how could they ever mistake you?
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm,
And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
How could they ever, ever persuade you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?


With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row,
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole
With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

To the cold gray wall that surround me

When we meet beneath the green, green grass of home","Green, Green Grass of Home",1969

There's a man by my side walking
There's a voice within me talking,
There's a voice, within me saying,
Carry on, carry it on.

They will tell their empty stories,
Send their dogs to bite our bodies,
They will lock us up in prison,
Carry on, carry it on.

When you can't go on any longer,
Take the hand, hand of your brother,
Every victory brings another,
Carry it on, carry it on.

Carry on, carry it on.

Repeat 1st Verse
Carry it on, carry it on.

Joan Baez,"If you ever lived in a ghetto
And maybe at the close of your day
On your front porch you hear the sound of a jukebox
From the neighborhood cafe

Well in the noon you may hear the neighbors fussing
When a kid breaks a window pane
In the night, in the night you may be wakened
By the outbound train

Well the rich folks they own the big city
And they down us who living the way we do
But when you're born a child of a poor man
You know the ghetto is the only place for you

Well if there's such a thing as revolution
And there will be if we rise to the call

You pack my peace of mind

Take care with my heart, oh, darling, she's made of glass

And the birds cease to sing when you rise
Ride easy your fairy stallion you have mounted
Take care how you fly, my precious, you might fall down

In the pastel shades of sunlight I have wandered
With my eyes, my ears, my heart strained to the full
I know I've tasted the essence in those few days
Take care who you love, oh, darling, he might not know

The cats are sleeping here in the autumn sun.
Your dog has flushed a deer and he's on the run.
And the coffee cup is cold
And the morning's feeling very old.

Fifteen months of time my man's been gone.
The second winter now is coming on.
And our fates could all be worse
But sometimes I still must curse my own.

And hello
I wish you well
Where you sleep
All in your cell.

As for friends I can't complain, they've been good to me.
The fire's burning bright, they've left wood for me.
And the roof has been repaired.
And I thank them for the love they've shared.

You see, there's really nothing wrong, I've just got the blues.
Because if you give a damn you're going to pay some dues.
But if you see the game we're in
Like I do, you know in time we'll win.

And hello
I wish you well
Where you sleep
All in your cell.

So time give me a break of a week or more.
My head is reeling and my back is sore.
And the baby cries for me.
And I think I'll walk by the sea alone.

The grey quiet horse wears the reins of dawn,
And nobody knows what mountain he's from.
In his mouth he carries the golden key,
And nobody sees him but Gabriel and me.
Gabriel and me.

His nose is silver and his mane is white,
His eyes are black and starry like night.
So softly he splashes his hoofs in the sea,
That nobody hears him but Gabriel and me.
Gabriel and me.

He comes in the morning when the air is still,
He races the sun and he always will.
We raise up the window and call through the trees,
Oh we'd love to fly with you, Gabriel and me.
Gabriel and me.

For your back is wingless and there's room for two,
We'll mount from a tree and ride straight on through.
But I guess you're wiser than I thought you'd be,
For you never will listen to Gabriel and me.
Gabriel and me.

For you know that one day we'll forget to wake,
Call it destiny, call it fate.
You'll nuzzle us softly and so silently,
We'll ride in the morning, Gabriel and me,
With the golden key.
Gabriel and me,
Forever to the sea.

When the mist rolls in on Highway One
Like a curtain to the day
A thousand silhouettes hold out their thumbs
And I see them and I say
You are my children
My sweet children
I am your poet.

With hair just like the burning tree of Moses
The girl beside you is your twin
Behind your fiery make-up you should know this
I am your sister, I am your kin, your flesh and kin
I'll write this tune
In matching phrases
Just to show it

You are the orphans in an age
Of no tomorrows
And with your walking you wage a war
Against the sorrows
Your fathers left you
A row to hoe
And you'll hoe it.

If I could write you easy directions
On a list
You would not read it, you could not see it
For the mist
Besides my pen is
Very righteous
And I know it.

So walk to the edges of a dying kingdom
There's one more summer just around the bend
The amber in your smile is brave and winsome
For though your highway has no end, it never ends
There is still the sky
The windy cliff
And the sea below it
I'd take an angel's ram horn trumpet
And I'd blow it
I'd blow it.

Joan Baez,"You're tired and you're poor, 
You long to be free, 
But in this Godforsaken land 
You find no home, no family 

On the many roads that you've wandered 
Since the day of your birth. 
You've become one of the last, 
Lonely and wretched. 

Your hair is matted, 
Your face and hands are dirty, 
And the years that you've toiled 
Must number somewhere near thirty. 

The deepening of a sadness 
Broke finally into madness. 
You are truly one of the last, 
Lonely and wretched. 

Your eyes are wild and frightening 
At the same time they are blessed 
And I wonder if God died, 
Turned his back or only just rested. 

And you walked out on the seventh day 
Through the big gates and on your way 
To become one of the last, 
Lonely and wretched. 

For once you were a child. 
Your cheeks were red, 
You were well fed. 
You laughed and played 

Till you got teary, 
Ran to your mother 
When you were weary. 
But somewhere you were forsaken 

Alone I'll not bear the blame 
And somehow all was taken, 
Your mind, your body, your name. 
Forgive us our unkindness, 

Our desertion and our blindness, 
With you, all the last, 
Lonely and wretched. 
Forgive us, all the last, 

Lonely and wretched.","Last, Lonely and Wretched",1971

Outside the Nashville city limits
A friend and I did drive,
On a day in early winter
I was glad to be alive.
We went to see some friends of his
Who lived upon a farm.
Strange and gentle country folk
Who would wish nobody harm.
Fresh-cut sixty acres,
Eight cows in the barn.
But the thing that I remember
On that cold day in December
Was that my eyes they did brim over
As we talked.

In the slowest drawl I had ever heard
The man said ""Come with me
If y'all wanna see the prettiest place
In all of Tennesee.""
He poured us each a glass of wine
And a-walking we did go,
Along fallen leaves and crackling ice
Where a tiny brook did flow.
He knew every inch of the land
And Lord he loved it so.
But the thing that I remember
On that cold day in December
Was that my eyes were brimming over
As we walked.

He set my down upon a stone
Beside a running spring.
He talked in a voice so soft and clear
Like the waters I heard sing.
He said ""We searched quite a time
For a place to call our own.
There was just me and Mary John
And now I guess we're home.""
I looked at the ground and wondered
How many years they each had roamed.
And Lord I do remember
On that day in late December
How my eyes kept brimming over
As we talked.
As we walked.

And standing there with outstretched arms
He said to me ""You know,
I can't wait till the heavy storms
Cover the ground with snow,
And there on the pond the watercress
Is all that don't turn white.
When the sun is high you squint your eyes
And look at the hills so bright.""
And nodding his head my friend said,
""And it seems like overnight
That the leaves come out so tender
At the turning of the winter...""
I thought the skies they would brim over
As we talked.

Let's drink to the lowly of birth

Spare a thought for his back breaking work
Say a prayer for his wife and his children
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth

Swirling mass of grey, black and white
They don't look real to me
In fact they look so strange

Raise your glass to the hard working people

Let's think of the wavering millions
Who want leaders but get gamblers instead

Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
And a parade of gray suited grafters
A choice of cancer or polio

And his momma spent her young live havin´ kids and balin´ hay
He had fifteen years and an ache inside to wander
So he hopped a freight in Waycross and wound up in L.A.

Lord, the cold nights had no pity on a Waycross, Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry then the summer came
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco´s Mabel Joy
Destitution´s child born of an L.A. street called ""Shame""

Growin´ up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found their mornings brought meaning to his life
Yes the night before she left sleep came and left that 
Waycross, Georgia boy with dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife

Sonday morning found him standin´ ´neath the red light at her door
When a right cross sent him reelin´ put him face down on the floor
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine
Who growled, ""Your Georgia neck is red but sunny, you´re still green""

He turned twenty-one in a grey rock fed´ral prison
The old judge had no mercy for a Waycross, Georgia boy
Starin´ at those four grey walls in silence he would listen
To that midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy

Sunday morning´ found him standin´ ´neath the red light at her door
With a bullet in his side, he cried, ""Have you seen Mabel Joy?""

A stallion white 
Prances the hills 
In the morning light
His bridle is painted 
With thunder and gold
Orchids and dragons 
Pale knights of old
He´s the horse of the ages past

And now the children run
To see the stallion on the hill
Bringing bags of apples 
And of clover they have filled
And the white horse 
Tells his stories
Of the days
Now passed and gone
And the children stand 
A-wondering
Believing 
Every song
How brightly glows the past

When the sun is high
Comes a mare so red
A-trampling the graves 
Of the living and dead
Her mantle is heavy
With mirrors and glass
All is reflected 
When the red mare does pass
She´s the horse of the here and now

And now there is confusion 
´mongst the children on the hill
They cling to one another 
And no longer can be still
While the red mare´s 
Voice is trembling
With a rare and 
Mighty call
The children 
Start remembering 
The bearers 
And the the pall
And though their 
Many-colored sweaters 
Are reflecting 
In the glass
And though the sun
Shines down upon them
They are frightened 
In the grass
How stark is the here and now

When the night does fall
Comes a stallion black
So proud and tall
He never looks back
He wears him no emaralds
Silver or gold
Not even a covering
To keep him from cold
He´s the horse of the years to come

And I will get me down 
Before this steed upon my knees
And sing to him the sorrows
Of a thousand centuries
And the children 
Now will scatter
As their mothers 
Call them home
For the sadness 
Of the evening horse
No child 
Has ever known
And I will 
Hang about him
A bell that´s 
Never rung
And thank him 
For the many words
Which from his throat
Have never sprung
And I´ll thank God 
And all the angels

Of the evening 
The black horse 
Of the future 
Comes to earth but has no tongue",Three Horses,1971

My hand
My hand
Sadly smiled the band
The band
The band
Softly echoes your laughter
Riddled with tears
When time is stolen it flies
It flies
It flies
Lovers leave in disguise
Disguise
Disguise
Weariness hangs like a curtain
Heavy and old
Heavy and cold.

It is said to never look back
Look back
Look back
To shadows you left on the track
The track
The track
Gather your roses and run
The long way around
And if time should ever be right

My love
I'll come to you in the night
My love
My love
But now there is only the sorrow
Parting is near
Parting is here
Parting is here

Billy Rose was a low rider, Billy Rose was a night fighter
Billy Rose knew trouble like the sound of his own name
Busted on a drunken charge
Driving someone else's car
The local midnight sheriff's claim to fame

In an Arizona jail there are some who tell the tale how
Billy fought the sergeant for some milk that he demanded
Knowing they'd remain the boss
Knowing he would pay the cost
They saw he was severely reprimanded

In the blackest cell on ""A"" Block
He hanged himself at dawn
With a note stuck to the bunk head
Don't mess with me, just take me home

Come and lay, help us lay
Young Billy down

Luna was a Mexican the law called an alien
For coming across the border with a baby and a wife
Though the clothes upon his back were wet
Still he thought that he could get
Some money and things to start a life

It hadn't been too very long when it seemed like everything went wrong
They didn't even have the time to find themselves a home
This foreigner, a brown-skin male
Thrown into a Texas jail
It left the wife and baby quite alone

He eased the pain inside him
With a needle in his arm
But the dope just crucified him
He died to no one's great alarm

Come and lay, help us lay
Young Luna down
And we're gonna raze, raze the prisons
To the ground

And leave the joint and walk the streets again
As the time he was to leave drew near
He suffered all the joy and fear
Of leaving 35 years in the pen

And on the day of his release he was approached by the police
Who took him to the warden walking slowly by his side
The warden said ""You won't remain here
But it seems a state retainer
Claims another 10 years of your life.""

He stepped out in the Texas sunlight
The cops all stood around
Old Kilowatt ran 50 yards
Then threw himself down on the ground

They might as well just have laid
The old man down
And we're gonna raze, raze the prisons
To the ground
Help us raze, raze the prisons
To the ground

If you don't know by now
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why
It don't matter anyhow

When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm travelin' on
But don't think twice, it's all right

And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light
I'm on the dark side of the road

Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
Make me wanna change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
Don't think twice, it's all right

And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name
I can't hear you anymore

I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart and she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

I'm going down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well

I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
Could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

Joan Baez,"Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles and the trumpets play slow
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is on fire and I must go

There's no need for anger, there's no need for blame
There's nothing to prove, everything's still the same
Just a table standing empty by the edge of the sea
Means farewell, Angelina, the sky is trembling and I must leave

The jacks and queens have forsaked the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies, now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is changing color, I'll see you in a while

See the cross-eyed pirates sitting perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun
And the neighbors they clap and they cheer with each blast
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing color and I must leave fast

King Kong, little elves on the rooftops they dance
Valentino-type tangos while the make-up man's hands
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is embarrassed and I must be gone

The machine guns are roaring, the puppets heave rocks
The fiends nail time bombs to the hands of the clocks
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting, I must go where it's quiet
","Farewell, Angelina",1972
Joan Baez,"Oh, where have you been, my blue eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways

I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

And it's hard, and it's hard, it's hard, and it's hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it

I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin'
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

And it's hard, and it's hard, it's hard, it's hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what did you hear, my blue eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, is it roared out a warnin'
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world

I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

And it's hard, and it's hard, it's hard, it's hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And who did you meet, my blue eyed son?
Oh, who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog

I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred

And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what'll you do now, my blue eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Well, I'm a goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a fallin'
Well, I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest

Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden

Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, and none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it

And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'

And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Leave at your own chosen speed

Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

Move lightly from the ledge, babe
Move lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down

You say you're lookin' for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and maybe more

But it still ain't me, babe
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

Go melt back into the night, babe
Everything inside here is made of stone
Well, there's nothing in here that's moving
And anyway I'm not alone

Pick you up every time you fall
Someone to gather flowers constantly
And come at the time you call

Joan Baez,"You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast

Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence

The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheet
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies are all going home

Your lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all her blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind you, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you

A vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, let's start anew
And it's all over now, baby blue
Oh, it's all over now, baby blue

If you were somewheres else,
Then you won't have to die"".
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life,
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife.

She walks these hills in a long black veil,
Visits my grave when the night winds wail,
Nobody knows, nobody sees,

She stands in the crowd, she sheds not a tear,
But sometimes at night, when the cold winds moan,
In a long black veil she cries o'er my bones.

You know the rich would live
And the poor would die,

And her lips of a ruby red 
On her breast she wore white lilies 
There I longed to lay my head 

Well, in my heart you are my darling 
And at my door, you're welcome in 
At my gate, I'll meet you my darling

Where the sun refused to shine 
Then to see you another man's darling 
And to know that you'll never be mine

In the day, I find no rest

In merry Scotland there were three
And they did cast lots which of them should go
Should go, should go

The youngest of all the three
That he should turn robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, the salt sea
For to maintain his two brothers and he

They had not been sailing but a long winter's night
And a part of a short winter's day
When he espied a stout lofty ship
Lofty ship, lofty ship
Come bibbing down on him straight way

""Hello, hello"", cried Henry Martin
What makes you sail so nigh?
I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London Town
London Town, London Town
Would you please for to let me pass by?

""Oh no, oh no"", cried Henry Martin
This thing it never could be
For I have turned robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, the salt sea.
For to maintain my two brothers and me

Come lower your tops'l and brail up your mizz'n
And bring your ship under my lee
Or I will give you a full cannon ball
Cannon ball, cannon ball
And all your dear bodies drown in the salt sea

Oh no, we won't lower our lofty topsail
Nor bring our ship under your lee
And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods
Merchant goods, merchant goods
Nor point our bold guns to the sea

Then broadside and broadside and at it they went
For fully two hours or three
Till Henry Martin gave to them deathshot
The deathshot, the deathshot
And straight to the bottom went she

Bad news to fair London Town
There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away

Has drifted out to sea
Compass cracked and stars unnamed
It's lost to history
And the riders in captivity
Watch ancient waves roll high
And hear the distant voices
Crying rider, please pass by

All you men who should have been
Your fathers beat you down
Your mothers loved you badly
Your teachers stole your crowns
And the wars you fought have taken toll
The price was far too high
You've buried all the images
Of riders passing by

The horses of the riders
Have waited at the tide
But years have passed, they know at last
Their heroes will not ride
So the women oh so gracefully
Mount noble horses high
Shattering the timelessness
Of rider, please pass by

But who can dare to judge us
The women or the men?
If freedom's wings shall not be clipped
We all can love again
So the choice is not of etiquette
Or finding lonesome ways to die
But liberty to ships at sea
And riders passing by

But liberty to ships at sea
And riders passing by

","Rider, Pass By",1973
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

It's walking to the battleground that always makes me cry
I've met so few folks in my time who weren't afraid to die
But dawn bleeds with the people here and morning skies are red
As young girls load up bicycles with flowers for the dead

An aging woman picks along the craters and the rubble
A piece of cloth, a bit of shoe, a whole lifetime of trouble
A sobbing chant comes from her throat and splits the morning air
The single son she had last night is buried under her

They say that the war is done
Where are you now, my son?

An old man with unsteady gait and beard of ancient white
Bent to the ground with arms outstretched faltering in his plight
I took his hand to steady him, he stood and did not turn
But smiled and wept and bowed and mumbled softly, ""Danke shoen""

The children on the roadsides of the villages and towns
Would stand around us laughing as we stood like giant clowns
The mourning bands told whom they'd lost by last night's phantom messenger
And they spoke their only words in English, ""Johnson, Nixon, Kissinger""

Now that the war's being won
Where are you now, my son?

The siren gives a running break to those who live in town
Take the children and the blankets to the concrete underground
Sometimes we'd sing and joke and paint bright pictures on the wall
And wonder if we would die well and if we'd loved at all

The helmetless defiant ones sit on the curb and stare
At tracers flashing through the sky and planes bursting in air
But way out in the villages no warning comes before a blast
That means a sleeping child will never make it to the door

The days of our youth were fun
Where are you now, my son?

From the distant cabins in the sky where no man hears the sound
Of death on earth from his own bombs, six pilots were shot down
Next day six hulking bandaged men were dazzled by a room
Of newsmen. Sally keep the faith, let's hope this war ends soon

In a damaged prison camp where they no longer had command
They shook their heads, what irony, we thought peace was at hand
The preacher read a Christmas prayer and the men kneeled on the ground
Then sheepishly asked me to sing ""They Drove Old Dixie Down""

Yours was the righteous gun
Where are you now, my son?

We gathered in the lobby celebrating Chrismas Eve
The French, the Poles, the Indians, Cubans and Vietnamese
The tiny tree our host had fixed sweetened familiar psalms
But the most sacred of Christmas prayers was shattered by the bombs

So back into the shelter where two lovely women rose
And with a brilliance and a fierceness and a gentleness which froze
The rest of us to silence as their voices soared with joy
Outshining every bomb that fell that night upon Hanoi

With bravery we have sun
But where are you now, my son?

Oh people of the shelters what a gift you've given me
To smile at me and quietly let me share your agony
And I can only bow in utter humbleness and ask
Forgiveness and forgiveness for the things we've brought to pass

The black pyjama'd culture that we tried to kill with pellet holes
And rows of tiny coffins we've paid for with our souls
Have built a spirit seldom seen in women and in men
And the white flower of Bac Mai will surely blossom once again

I've heard that the war is done
Then where are you now, my son?

",Where Are You Now My Son,1973
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

A young gypsy fell out in a slumber
Heading north with a driver he knew
Someone he'd lived with and trusted
A young woman who trusted him too

That very same day the young gypsy
Had come from a farm in the west
Where the children had played throughout the heat of the day
Affording the gypsy no rest

And the gypsy's bones were weary
And the front seat looked secure
And the gypsy slept on until the sun it was gone
And the stars pierced the eyes of the girl at his side

The next morning's day would be Easter
He'd dress in his only fine shirt
And shuffle through clusters of strangers
With his gaze and his shoes in the dirt

And the woman who loved him would watch him
Protect him from curious stares
For the womenfolk tend to be friendly
And the gypsy's as young as he's fair

And the evening brought on laughter
And jars of bright red wine
And the gypsy drank some and the gypsy had fun
And his dancing got wild and the grandmothers smiled

Sleeping came easily after
In the arms of the woman that fold
Up the secrets and dreams of the gypsy
That will never be sought or be sold
In fact, they will never be told
For the gypsy is two years old

Oye el rumor de las armas

Floating like a vapor on the summer air.
I hear her melodies like days gone by,
Sighing around my heart o'er the fond hopes that die.

Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain,
Wailing for her lost love that comes not again.
I dream of Jeannie and my heart bows low,
Nevermore to find her where the deep waters flow.

Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone and all the roses falling;
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow.
It's I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow;
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow.
It's I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow;
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.

The lady's adrift in a foreign land
Singing on issues both humble and grand A
Decade flew past her and there on the page
She read that the prince had returned to the stage
Hovering near treacherous waters
A friend saw her drifting and caught her
Unguarded fantasies flying too far
Memories tumbling like sweets from a jar And take me down to the harbor now Grapes of the summer are low on the bough
Ghosts of my history will follow me there
And the winds of the old days will blow through my hair
Breath on an undying ember It doesn't take much to remember
Those eloquent songs from the good old days
That set us to marching with banners ablaze
But reporters, there's no sense in prying
Our blue-eyed son's been denying
The truths that are wrapped in a mystery
The sixties are over so set him free
And take me down to the harbor now
Grapes of the summer are low on the bough
Ghosts of my history will follow me there
And the winds of the old days will blow through my hair
Why do I sit the autumnal judge
Years of self-righteousness will not budge
Singer or savior, it was his to choose
Which of us knows what was his to lose
Because idols are best when they're made of stone
A savior's a nuisance to live with at home
Stars often fall, heroes go unsung
And martyrs most certainly die too young
So thank you for writing the best songs
Thank you for righting a few wrongs
You're a savage gift on a wayward bus
But you stepped down and you sang to us
And get you down to the harbor now
Most of the sour grapes are gone from the bough
Ghosts of Johanna will visit you there
And the winds of the old days will blow through your hair

Is the will to try our dreams

Joan Baez,"The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down
Anyone with any sense had already left town
He was standing in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts

He moved across the mirrored room, ""Set ?em up for everyone"", he said
Then everyone commenced to do what
They've been doin' before he moved their heads
He walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
""Would you kindly tell me, Mister, what time the show begins?""
He moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts

Backstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs
Lily had two queens and she was hopin' for a third to match her pair
Outside the streets were fillin' up and the window was open wide
The gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts

Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine
He made his usual entrance lookin' oh, so dandy and so fine
With his bodyguards and his silver cane and every hair in place
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
But his bodyguards and his silver cane
They were no match for the Jack of Hearts

Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
She slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
""I'm sorry, darlin', that I'm late"", but he didn't seem to hear
He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts

Well, I know I've seen that face somewhere
Big Jim was thinkin' to himself
Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet
And the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him
Starin' at the butterfly who just drew up the Jack of Hearts

Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
She had that certain something
It was a kind of a flash every time she smiled
She'd come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life who took her everywhere
But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts

The hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And nothin? could ever come between Lily and the king
No, nothing ever could except maybe the Jack of Hearts

Rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife
She was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's wife
She'd done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
Was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died
She was gazin' to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts

Lily took her dress off, buried it away
""Has your luck run out"", she laughed at him
""I guess you must've known it would someday
Be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint
I'm glad to see you're still alive and you're lookin' like a saint""
Down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts

The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
""There's something funny goin' on, I know, I can just feel it in the air""
He went to get the hangin' judge but the hangin' judge was drunk
And the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
But there was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts

Lily had her arms around the man that she dearly loved to touch
She forgot all about the man she hated, who hounded her so much
""I've missed you so"", she said to him and he thought she was sincere
But in the hallway he felt jealousy and fear
Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts

Well, no one knew the circumstance
But they say it happened pretty quick
The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked
And Big Jim was standin' there, you couldn't say surprised
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes
She was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts

Two doors down and the boys finally made it through the wall
Cleaned out the bank safe, it's said that they got off with quite a haul
And in the darkness of the riverbed, they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts

Well, the next day was hangin' day
And the sky was overcast and black
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back
And Rosemary on the gallows, boy, she didn't even blink
And the hangin' judge was sober, Lord, he hadn't had a drink
And the only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts

Well, the cabaret was quiet now and a sign said, 'Closed for repair'
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
She was thinkin' 'bout her father whom she very rarely saw
Thinkin' about Rosemary and thinkin' about the law
But most of all she was thinkin' about the Jack of Hearts

Virgil Caine is my name and I drove on the Danville train
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
I took the train to Richmond that fell
It was a time I remember, oh, so well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin' 
They went, ""Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na""

Back with my wife in Tennessee
And one day she said to me
""Virgil, quick! Come see
There goes Robert E. Lee"" 
Now I don't mind, I'm chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Just take what you need and leave the rest 
But they should never have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin' 
They went, ""Na, na, na, na, na, na

Like my father before me, I'm a working man
And like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand
Well, he was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the blood below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'

To a place by the river
You can see the boats go by
You could spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She takes you in her arms
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you'll maybe trust her
'Cause she's touched you
And she's moved you
And she's kind

When he walked up the water
He spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him
He said, ""All men shall be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
He Himself was broken
Long before the sky was open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a star

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think you'll maybe trust Him
'Cause He's touched you
And He's moved you

Beneath the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning

Infinity gives me chills
So could the waters of Iceland
But there's a difference in finding diamonds in rust
And rhinestones in a dishpan
Miracles bowl me over
And often will they do so
Now I think I was asleep till I heard
The voice of the great Caruso

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

A friend of mine gave me a tape
She'd copied from a record disc
It was made at the turn of the century
And found in a jacket labeled ""misc.""
And midst cellos, harps, and flugelhorns
With the precision of a hummingbird's heart
Was the lord of the monarch butterflies
One-time ruler of the world of art

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

Yes, the king of them all was Enrico
Whose singular chest could rival
A hundred fervent Baptists
Giving forth in a tent revival
True he was a vocal miracle
But that's only secondary
It's the sould of the monarch butterfly
That I find a little bit scary

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

Perhaps he's just a vehicle
To bear us to the hills of Truth
That's Truth spelled with a great big T
And peddled in the mystic's booth
There are oh so many miracles
That the western sky exposes
Why go looking for lilacs
When you're lying in a bed of roses?

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

",Caruso,1976
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

It's only when the high winds blow that I wish my hair was long
Sailing through the autumn leaves singing an ancient song
Or falling in love in the streets at night at the edge of a local square
It's only that I'm here tonight thinking I was there

There are high winds on the pier tonight, my soul departs from me
Striding like Thalia's ghost south on the murky sea
And into midnight's tapestry she fades, ragged and wild
Searching down her ancestry in the costume of a Persian child

And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon
Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew
And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low
Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico

When I was young my eyes were wise, my father was good to me
Instead of having a flock of sons he had two other girls and me
And if we had used our Spanish names, here's the way they'd run
Thalia, Margarita and Juanita, I'm the middle one.

The screen door kept the demons in as we moved from town to town
It's hard to be a princess in the States when your skin is brown
And mama smoothed my worried brow as I leaned on the kitchen door
Why do you carry the weight, she said, of the world and maybe more?

And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon
Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew
And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low
Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico

My grandfathers were ministers and it came on down the line
My father preached in his parents' church when he was ten years and nine
And mama dressed in parishoners' clothes and didn't believe in hell
Her daddy fought the DAR, if he'd lived I'd have known him well

They said go find a Sunday School, we must have tried them all
I never stole from the silver plate, my sisters had more gall
One preacher said sing out loud and clear, it's the only life you've got
And the next one said be good on earth, you've another life at the feet of God

And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon
Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew
And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low
Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico

My father turned down many a job just to give us something real
It's hard to be a scientist in the States when you've got ideals
And mama kept the budget book, she kept the garden, too
Bought fish from the man on Thursday, fed all of us and strangers, too

But time will pass and so, alas, will most of what we know
Though tonight my memory's eye is clear as the story's being told
And I'll play ball with the underdog and sit with the child who's wrong
Be still when the earth is silent and sing when my strength is gone

And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon
Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew
And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low
Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico

Now father's going to India sometime in the fall
They tried to stay together but you just can't do it all
I'll think about him if he goes, there's a little grey in his hair
Though not much because he's Mexican, they don't age, they just prepare

And if he goes to India I'll miss him most of all
He'll see me in the mudlarks' face, hear me in the beggar's call
And mama will stay home, I guess, and worry if she did wrong
And I'll say a prayer for both of them and sing them both my song

And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon
Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew
And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low
Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico

The ship that sails the seven seas
Has finally brought me to my knees
It's not much to my liking
The people standing on the rock
Are innocent and they know not
That the tide comes in
Death rides it like a Viking

The mountains rise above the mist
And the golden prince I've never kissed
He may die tonight
And why do I want to ride with
The prince whose alleged horse is white?
Because when we ride together
Our lives are cloaked forever

Happiness is temporary
Believe me, I know
It can arrive as a shining crystal
And leave as the melting snow
Come all you lads and lasses
The Kingdom of Childhood passes

Oh, but I am hardy in these years
Or I'd have sunk down with my tears
To the earth beneath my feet
I want to endure the slings and arrows
That Hamlet spoke about
But harrowed,
He was forced to a ragged defeat

There was a method to his madness
But overcome by pride and sadness
He did not endure
Surely his death was a grave mistake
How many deaths do we really calculate?
Isn't it true, Lord
Tragedies happen when you're bored?

Happiness is temporary
Believe me, I know
It can arrive as a shining crystal
And leave as the melting snow
Come all you lads and lasses
The Kingdom of Childhood passes

You archangels, you have some nerve
To watch all of this you are absurd
You even have a choice
Do you know all? I think you may
And what is there for you to say
But understand
Why God took back your voice

SIlence is golden, I believe
And you are worth your weight
In wreaths of purest gold
While we are here with debts and bets
And aircraft carriers and jets
I call out fruitlessly
Give me an archangel for company

Happiness is temporary
Believe me, I know
It can arrive as a shining crystal
And leave as the melting snow
Come all you lads and lasses
The Kingdom of Childhood passes

Me in the woods at the break of dawn
The candles of the night still on
The chimes ring from the hollow
I too am worth my weight in gold
But the fishmonger and I are old
When the mint runs out
Our real lives will follow

It was misfortune who woke you up
To pour you the dregs from her broken cup
Cast her aside
The sunrise will appear with the mockingbird
Who stays deep in the canyon and is heard
Glorious in his song
He cannot be wrong

Happiness is temporary
Believe me, I know
It can arrive as a shining crystal
And leave as the melting snow
Come all you lads and lasses
The Kingdom of Childhood passes
There's another one just beyond
Act quickly before it's gone

Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

Don't worry about my politics
They are what they are
I work best when I get some rest
Right now I'm in a bar
Overlooking the whole wide world
It's over the Pacific
I've never written when I was drunk
This could be terrific!

And the seabird struggles in the wind
She topples, balances again

The lady sitting next to me
Is gazing in the eyes
Of the stranger sitting next to her
Who is mouthing truths and lies
He's actually quite nice I guess
He has an honest look
He doesn't know I've lost my mind
Scribbling in this book

And the seabird struggles in the wind
She topples, balances again

Consumed by the evening's masterpiece
Completely introverted
From here I could stare down eternity
Leave alone and not feel deserted
I'm tired of interesting faces
And the dull ones make my weep
Don't ask me what my sign is
Instant intimacy runs cheap

The ocean is so bountiful
It spreads from coast to coast
The winds scale off the whitecaps
And the things I love the most
Come wafting up into my lap
In the colors of the great sunrise
Children holding cupcakes
With paradise in their eyes

And the seabird struggles in the wind
She topples, balances again

Four big pelicans just flew by
The room got very still
One of them carried the breath of God
Tucked way back in his bill
I know it was the breath of God
It's the same as the secret of life
He's carrying it off to the Shah of Iran
To trade it for the end of strife

And the seabird struggles in the wind
She topples, balances again

""You've loved me exquisitely.""
""I tried to.""
""Can we be best of friends now?""
""I never lied to you.""
""And can I love you forever?""
""Sure,"" she said and smiled
""But will you?""

I wish there was some new way
To sing about a full moon
Poured down on us like a thousand rivers
In Stephanie's room
And you said you'd remember always
The shadows on the hills below us
But will you?

You never once tried to sell me
A bill of goods I wouldn't buy
But I'm seasoned and I know a pirate
By the devil in his eye
And the only thing you ever stole from me
Was laughter and some love I made
To fill you

White snow in the morning
Kind of frightened me
But you'd go sailing anyway
Things are different at sea
You know I'll never try and change your habit
As sure as you know if your ship sinks
It'll kill you

And all the lovely ladies who came before me
Are very much the same
As the others soon to follow
In your merry little game
I guess I just want to be remembered
Especially and frequently
Like Stephanie

Five red tail hawks are circling
Above us in the sky
You said they'd bring good luck
And then you said goodbye
You smiled and said, ""I'll see you
Sooner than you think.""
But will you?

Still waters at night
In the darkest of dark
But you rise as white
As the birch tree's bark
Or a pale wolf in winter
You look down and shiver
At still waters at night

Your eyes are as black
As the blackness you're fearing
And yonder a bridge
And a voice within hearing
Come walk on me softly
Look down and you'll see
Still waters at night

You've reason to fear
There is no protection
But a garland of emeralds
And a moonlit reflection
Of a boat in the distance
Will the devil take his chance
At still waters at night

So dance me a small dance
And the night cannot hurt you
Nor the waters be silent
Nor the emeralds desert you
For the boat's full of bright scarves
And wild hats among them
Songs of the vagabond
It's to you he has sung them
And shattered the silence
Of still waters at night

Practically bore your name 
Lying alone in the twilight zone 
Waiting for your call to come in 
Hadn't been for the kid 
Who was sleeping upstairs 
You'd have found me well on my way 
On that midnight plane to L.A. 

You suffered sweeter for me 
Than anyone I've ever known 

I dared to look into the years 
Would you still have your wife? 
I dared to peer through my tears 
Could we ever have a life? 
Even thought I was pregnant by you 
But I didn't care 
I just talked to my son 
Would he mind another one? 

You suffered sweeter for me 
Than anyone I've ever known 

Once more the mist rolls to the sea 
Like a hundred times we've known 
Trees are faded and the clouds have stopped 
Where the wind had blown 
How I dread when the evening comes 
And I cannot be 
What you want me to be 
When you are next to me 

How silent you are as the veils come down 
Before my eyes 
Soft and reserved as you move away 
Donning your disguise 
While every folk song that I ever knew 
Once more comes true 
And loves grows old 
And waxes cold 

You suffered sweeter for me 
Than anyone I've ever known 

Just one favor of you, my love 
If I should die today 
Take me down to where the hills 
Meet the sea on a stormy day 
Ride a ridge on a snow white horse 
And throw my ashes away 
To the wind and the sand 
Where my song began

The moon is low on the southland
The frogs are asleep on the lake
Did you know that tears run in rivulets
And hearts can repeatedly break?
And this may well be the last time
If my spirits don't pick up and fly
For though it's sad
It may well be true
That our time is passing us by

Occasionally you have called for me
I've always tried to be there
But it seemed whenever my train pulled in
You never did really care
And the only thing I could decipher
From the corner of your roving eye
Was that you and I
Were the first ones to know
That our time was passing us by

Well, it was fun for the first few years
Playing Legend In Our Time
And there were those who discussed the fact
That we drifted apart in our prime
And we haven't got too much in common
Except that we're so much alike
And I hate it for though
You're a big part of me
But our time is passing us by

So I can sit here in my silver chair
You can stay there on your gold
You can say you've got commitments
And I can say I'm growing old
And I can get up and make comments
On the color of the evening sky
But our ships have come home
And the night's rolling in
And our time is passing us by

But cast us adrift
And cross a few stars
And I'm good for one more try

So tell me how you've been

Did you read the letters that I wrote?
And I've been on the road since Christmas
But it don't seem so long
Outside of that there isn't much to say.

And wrote another song

Of having one ourselves

When the music gets too loud?
Does your old cat still sleep up on the bed?
And do you still walk around
With your head up in the clouds?

Joan Baez,"It's a still life water color,
Of a now late afternoon,
As the sun shines through the curtained lace
And shadows wash the room.
And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference,
Like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar
In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs,
The borders of our alliance.

And you read your Emily Dickinson,
And I my Robert Frost,
And we note our place with bookmarkers
That measure what we've lost.
Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm,
Couplets out of rhyme,
In syncopated time
And the dangled conversation
And the superficial sighs,
Are the borders of our alliance.

Yes, we speak of things that matter,
With words that must be said,
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""
""Is the theater really dead?""
And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow,
I cannot feel your hand,
You're a stranger now unto me
Lost in the dangling conversation.
And the superficial sighs,
In the borders of our alliance.




",The Dangling Conversation,1977
Joan Baez,"""Well met, well met, my own true love
Well met, well met"", cried he
""I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
All for the love of thee""

I could have married the king's daughter dear
She would have married me
But I have forsaken her crowns of gold
All for the love of thee

Well, if you could have married
The king's daughter dear
I'm sure you are to blame
For I am married to a house carpenter
And find him a nice young man

Oh, will you forsake your house carpenter
And go along with me?
I'll take you to where the grass grows green
To the banks of the salt, salt sea

Well, if I should forsake my house carpenter
And go along with thee
What have you got to maintain me on
And keep me from poverty?

Six ships, six ships all out on the sea
Seven more upon dry land
One hundred and ten all brave sailor men
Will be at your command

She picked up her own wee babe
Kisses gave him three
Said, ""Stay right here with my house carpenter
And keep him good company""

Then she put on her rich attire
So glorious to behold
And as she trod along her way
She shown like the glittering gold

Well, they'd not been gone
But about two weeks
I know it was not three
When this fair lady began to weep
She wept most bitterly

Ah, why do you weep, my fair young maid
Weep it for your golden store?
Or do you weep for your house carpenter
Who never you shall see anymore?

I do not weep for my house carpenter
Or for any golden store
I do weep for my own wee babe
Who never I shall see anymore

Well, they'd not been gone
But about three weeks
I'm sure it was not four
Our gallant ship sprang a leak and sank
Never to rise anymore

One time around spun our gallant ship
Two times around spun she
Three times around spun our gallant ship
And sank to the bottom of the sea

What hills, what hills are those, my love
That rise so fair and high?
Those are the hills of heaven, my love
But not for you and I

And what hills, what hills are those, my love
Those hills so dark and low?
Those are the hills of hell, my love
Where you and I must go
",House Carpenter,1977
Joan Baez,"Seems like only yesterday
I left my mind behind
Down in the gypsy cafe
With a friend of a friend of mine

She sat with a baby heavy on her knee
Yet spoke of life most free from slavery
With eyes that showed no trace of misery
A phrase in connection first with she occurred

That love is just a fou letter word

Outside a rambling store-front window
Cats meowed to the break of day
Me, I kept my mouth shut
To you I had no words to say

My experience was limited and underfed
You were talking while I hid
To the one who was the father of your kid
You probably didn't think I did, but I heard you say

That love is just a four letter word

I said goodbye unnoticed
Pushed forth into my own games
Drifting in and out of lifetimes
Unmentionable by name

Searching for my double, looking for
Complete evaporation to the core
Though I tried and failed at finding any door
I must have thought that there was nothing more absurd than

That love is just a four letter word

Though I never knew just what you meant
When you were speaking to your man
I can only think in terms of me
And now I understand

After waking enough times to think I see
The holy kiss that's supposed to last eternity
Blow up in smoke, its destiny, falls on strangers, travels free
Yes, I know now, traps are only set by me
And I do not really need to be assured

That love is just a four letter word

Strange it is to be beside you
Many years and tables turned
You'd probably not believe me
If I told you all I've learned

And it is very, very weird indeed yo hear words like forever plead
Those ships run through my mind, I cannot cheat
It's like looking in the teacher's face complete
I can say nothing to you but repeat what I heard

That love is just a four letter word
",Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word,1977
Joan Baez,"Come gather 'round, friends
And I'll tell you a tale
Of when the red iron ore pits ran plenty
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty

In the north end of town
My own children are grown
But I was raised up on the other
In the wee hours of youth
My mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother

The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door
The drag lines an' the shovels was a-humming
Till one day my brother
Failed to come home
The same as my father before him

Well, a long winter's wait
From the window I watched
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder
And my schooling was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner

Oh, the years passed again
And the givin' was good
With the lunch buckets filled every season
What with three babies born
The work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason

Then the shaft was soon shut
And my work, it was cut
And the firing air, it felt frozen
Till a man come to speak
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closin'

They complained in the East
That they are paying too high
They say that your ore ain't worth digging
That it's much cheaper down
In South American town
Where the miners work almost for nothing

So the mining gates locked
And the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Where the sad, silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking

I lived by the window
As he talked to himself
This silence of tongues, it was building
Then one morning's wake
The bed, it was bare
And I's left alone with three children

The summer is gone
The ground's turning cold
The stars, one by one, they're a-foldin'
My children will go
As soon as they grow
Oh, there ain't nothing here now to hold them
",North Country Blues,1977
Joan Baez,"In my heart I will wait 
By the stony gate 
And the little one 
In my arms will sleep. 
Every rising of the moon 
Makes the years grow late 
And the love in our hearts will keep. 
There are friends I will make 
And bonds I will break 
As the seasons roll by 
And we build our own sky. 
In my heart I will wait 
By the stony gate 
And the little one 
In my arms will sleep. 

And the stars in your sky 
Are the stars in mine 
And both prisoners 
Of this life are we. 
Through the same troubled waters 
We carry our time, 
You and the convicts and me. 
There's a good thing to know 
On the outside or in, 
To answer not where 
But just who I am. 
Because the stars in your sky 
Are the stars in mine 
And both prisoners 
Of this life are we. 

And the hills that you know 
Will remain for you 
And the little willow green 
Will stand firm. 
The flowers that we planted 
Through the seasons past 
Will all bloom 
On the day you return. 
To a baby at play 
All a mother can say, 
He'll return on the wind 
To our hearts, and till then 
I will sit and I'll wait 
By the stony gate 
And the little one

We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute

And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream
So baby, love me, love me tonight

Oh, but tomorrow
But tomorrow may never, never come

Joan Baez,"Here by my window in Germany 
A morning bird flies close to me 
On his wing I see a yellow star 
The lights are on in the factory 
The frost is hung on the linden tree 
And I remember where we are 
And I remember the holocaust 
I remember all we lost 
The families torn and the borders crossed 
And I sing of it now for Sasha 
A young German officer lies in his bed 
Bandages from toe to head 
A prisoner of the camps draws nigh 
If you are Abel and I am Cain 
Forgive me from my bed of pain 
I know not why we die 
It was I who ordered the building burned 
The job was over and as I turned 
A father and his son 
Caught in the flames high above the ground 
From cradled arms the boy looked down 

One leap and their lives were done 
And I remember the holocaust 
I remember all we lost 
The children gone and the borders crossed 
And I sing of it now for Sasha 
You in frozen streets of Heidelberg 
Your youth unbearded takes form in words 
And the ghosts of the past are kind 
For this was your university 
The years were long but the spirits free 
And your river runs to the Rhine 
The smoke filled taverns that you once roamed 
With the discontented who'd stayed at home 
You must have whiskey or you'll die 
The beer garden under the old chateau 
Our faces now in the candle glow 
See the memories how they shine 
But you remember the holocaust 
You remember all we lost 
The families torn and the borders crossed 
And we'll sing of it now for Sasha",For Sasha,1979
Joan Baez,"Early early in the game 
I taught myself to sing and play 
And use a little trickery 
On kids who never favored me 
Those were years of crinoline slips 
And cotton skirts and swinging hips 
And dangerously painted lips 
And stars of stage and screen 
Pedal pushers, ankle socks 
Padded bras and campus jocks 
Who hid their vernal equinox 
In pairs of faded jeans 
And slept at home resentfully 
Coveting their dreams 
And often have I wondered 
How the years and I survived 
I had a mother who sang to me 
An honest lullaby 
Yellow, brown, and black and white 
Our Father bless us all tonight 
I bowed my head at the football games 
And closed the prayer in Jesus' name 
Lusting after football heroes 
tough Pachuco, little Neroes 
Forfeiting my A's for zeroes 
Futures unforeseen 
Spending all my energy 
In keeping my virginity 
And living in a fantasy 
In love with Jimmy Dean 
If you will be my king, Jimmy, Jimmy, 
I will be your queen 
And often have I wondered 
How the years and I survived 

I had a mother who sang to me 
An honest lullaby 
I travelled all around the world 
And knew more than the other girls 
Of foreign languages and schools 
Paris, Rome and Istanbul 
But those things never worked for me 
The town was much too small you see 
And people have a way of being 
Even smaller yet 
But all the same though life is hard 
And no one promised me a garden 
Of roses, so I did okay 
I took what I could get 
And did the things that I might do 
For those less fortunate 
And often have I wondered 
How the years and I survived 
I had a mother who sang to me 
An honest lullaby 
Now look at you, you must be growing 
A quarter of an inch a day 
You've already lived near half the years 
You'll be when you go away 
With your teddy bears and alligators 
Enterprise communicators 
All the tiny aviators head into the sky 
And while the others play with you 
I hope to find a way with you 
And sometimes spend a day with you 
I'll catch you as you fly 
Or if I'm worth a mother's salt 
I'll wave as you go by 
And if you should ever wonder 
How the years and you'll survive 
Honey, you've got a mother who sings to you 
Dances on the strings for you 
Opens her heart and brings to you 
An honest lullaby",Honest Lullaby,1979
Joan Baez,"In the time spent in the foggy dew 
With the raven and the dove 
Barefoot she walked the winter streets 
In search of her own true love 

For she was Mary Hamilton 
And lover of John Riley 
And the maid of constant sorrow 
And the mother of the doomed Geordie 

One day by the banks of the river 
Midst tears and gossamer 
Sweet Michael rowed his boat ashore 
And came to rescue her 

And fill thee up my loving cup 
Fast and to the brim 
How many fair and tender maids 
Could love as she could then? 

For was was likened to Pretty Boy Floyd 
And also John Riley 
And a rake and rambling railroad boy 
And the Silkie of the Sule Skerry 

And there in the arms of Michael 
In their stolen hour 
Loud rang the bells of Rhymney 
From the ancient church bell tower 

And there in the night with Michael 
While he lay fast asleep 
She put her head to the window pane 
And in the fullness of love did weep 

And fill thee up my loving cup 
Fast and to the brim 
How many fair and tender maids 
Will love as she did then? 

You've heard of the House of the Rising Sun 
And what careless love can do 
You've heard of the wildwood flower 
That fades in the morning dew 

And of the ship that circles three times round 
And sinks beneath the sea 
You've heard of Barbary Allen 
And now you've heard of me 

So fill thee up my loving cup 
Fast and to the brim

Now I lie on my bed,
And I see your sweet face.
The past I remember;
Time can't erase.

Was written in shame.
And I know that your conscience
Still echoes my name.

Now the nights are so alone

And nothing is worth for you and me,

I take a look at my sky.

Too lonely to cry.

And love's a jewel when it's first new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like morning dew

There is a ship it's sailing the sea
It's loaded deep as deep can be
But not so deep as my love for him
I know not if I sink or swim

The water is wide I cannot get over
And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

And both shall row my love and I",The Water Is Wide,1983

Joan Baez,"Willie Moore was a young man, his age 21 and he courted a damsel fair
Oh, her eyes were as white as a diamond after night and a wavy jet black wore her hair
He courted her by night and day until marriage they did agree
Oh, but when he came to get her parents' consent they said it could never be

She threw herself in Willie Moore's hands as often they've done before
Oh, but little did he think as he left her that night, sweet Annie he would see no more
It was about the 10th of may, a time i remember it well
That very same night little Annie disappeared in a way no tongue can tell

Sweet Annie was loved both far and near, she had friends almost all around
And near a little brook not far from her home the body of sweet Annie were found
Her parents now are left alone, one mourns while the other'n weeps
And near a grassy mound outside the cottage door the body of sweet Annie sleeps

Willie Moore scarcely spoke to his friends they say from the moment they both did part
And his last day was spent near his true lover's grave where he died of a broken heart",Willie Moore,1983
Joan Baez,"Well I'll be damned 
Here comes your ghost again 
But that's not unusual 
It's just that the moon is full

And here I sit 
Hand on the telephone

A couple of light years ago 
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes 
Were bluer than robin's eggs 
My poetry was lousy you said 
Where are you calling from? 
A booth in the midwest 
Ten years ago 
I bought you some cufflinks 
You brought me something 
We both know what memories can bring 
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene 
Already a legend 
The unwashed phenomenon 
The original vagabond 
You strayed into my arms 
And there you stayed 
Temporarily lost at sea 
The Madonna was yours for free 
Yes the girl on the half-shell 
Could keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing 
With brown leaves falling all around 
And snow in your hair 
Now you're smiling out the window 
Of that crummy hotel 
Over Washington Square 
Our breath comes out white clouds 
Mingles and hangs in the air 
Speaking strictly for me 
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me 
You're not nostalgic 
Then give me another word for it 
You who are so good with words 
And at keeping things vague

Billy Rose was a night figher
Billy Rose knew trouble like the sound of his own name
Busted on a drunken charge
Drivin' someone else's car
The local midnight sheriff's claim to fame

In an Arizona jail there are some who tell the tale how
Billy fought the sergeant for some milk that he demanded.
Knowing they'd remain the boss
Knowing he would pay the cost
They saw he was severely reprimanded

For comin' 'cross the border with a baby and a wife
Though the clothes upon his back were wet
Still he thought that he could get
Some money and things that make a life.

When it seemed like everything went wrong
They didn't even have the time to find themselves a home

This foreigner, a brown-skin male
Thrown into a Texas jail
It left the wife and baby quite alone.

He eased the pain inside him with a needle in his arm
But the dope just crucified him
He died to no one's great alarm

Kilowatt was an aging con of 65
Who stood a chance to stay alive
And leave the joint and walk the streets again
As the time he was to leave drew near
He suffered all the joy and fear
Of leaving 35 years in the pen

And on the day of his release
He was approached by the police
Who took him to the warden, walking slowly at his side
The warden said ""You won't remain here
But ist seems a state retainer
Claims another 10 years of your life.""

He stepped out in the Texas sunlight
The cops all stood around
Old Kilowatt ran 50 yards then threw himself down on the ground

Joan Baez,"They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him he felt a spark tingle to his bones
It was when he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked down by the old canal a little confused I remember well
And then they stopped in a strange hotel with the neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
And moving with a simple twist of fate

Saxophone some place nearby played she was walking on by at the arcade
As a light burst through a bead of shade
But as he was waking she dropped a coin into a cup of a blind man
That became and both got a bout of a simple twist of fate

He woke up and the room was bear, he didn't see he anywhere
He told himself he didn't care, he pushed the window open wide
He felt an emptiness inside too
He could just not relate but by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks small waves whisper to the rocks
He hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in perhaps he'll see her once again
How long must he wait once more for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a crime to feel to much at any one time
All it cost me was a dime but the bells refuse to ring
He was born in the spring but I was born to late to blame
It on a simple twist of fate

And your mystical stare 
As you walked on the sands of glory

Did you ever wonder who you are 
And do you think that life is just a Belushi movie 
And the heartbreak years that lie ahead 
Be true to yourself and the Grateful Dead 
And remember the summer when all was hip and groovy

Are you living for nothing now, hope you're keeping some kind of record.

And you treated some woman to a flake of your life
And when she got home she was nobody's wife.
Well I see you there with a rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards.
And what can I tell you oh what can I tell you
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
I'm glad that you stood in my way.
And if you ever come by here, be it for Jane or for me
I want you to know your enemy's sleeping, I want you to know your woman is free.

Joan Baez,"Jimmy got nothing, made himself a name
With a gun that he polished for a rainy day
A smile and a quote from a vigilante movie
Our boy Jimmy just blew them all away

He said it made him crazy
Twenty five years living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep
She needs her mother but her mother is dead
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget
Just another hooker, it happens everyday

She loved her little baby
But she couldn't bear to see her living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

I believe in the gods of America
I believe in the land of the free
But no one told me
That the gods believe in nothing

So with empty hands I pray
And from day to hopeless day
They still don't see me

Everybody talks about the new generation
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation
Like to help you buddy but I haven't got the time

Somebody shouted, ""Save me""
But everybody started living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

There's a big white lady on a big white doorstep
She asked her daddy and her daddy said, ""Yes""
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get
Has to give a little, they say it's for the best

Somebody shouted, ""Maybe""
But they kept on living from hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

So she ran to the arms of America
And she kissed the powers that be
And someone told me
That the gods believe in nothing

So with empty hands I pray
And I tell myself one day
They just might see me
They just might see me

And word is up to Madam the Queen, and that's the worst of all
That Mary Hamilton has borne a babe
To the highest Stuart of all
Oh rise, arise Mary Hamilton
Arise and tell to me
What thou hast done with thy wee babe
I saw and heard weep by thee
I put him in a tiny boat
And cast him out to sea
That he might sink or he might swim
But he'd never come back to me
Oh rise arise Mary Hamilton
Arise and come with me
There is a wedding in Glasgow town
This night we'll go and see
She put not on her robes of black
Nor her robes of brown
But she put on her robes of white
To ride into Glasgow town
And as she rode into Glasgow town
The city for to see
The bailiff's wife and the provost's wife
Cried Alack and alas for thee
You need not weep for me she cried
You need not week for me
For had I not slain my own wee babe
This death I would not dee
Oh little did my mother think
When first she cradled me
The lands I was to travel in
And the death I was to dee
Last night I washed the Queen's feet
And put the gold in her hair
And the only reward I find for this
The gallows to be my share
Cast off cast off my gown she cried
But let my petticoat be
And tie a napkin round my face
The gallows I would not see
Then by them come the king himself
Looked up with a pitiful eye
Come down come down Mary Hamillton
Tonight you will dine with me
Oh hold your tongue my sovereign liege
And let your folly be
For if you'd a mind to save my life
You'd never have shamed me here
Last night there were four marys
Tonight there'll be but three
It was Mary Beaton and Mary Seton
And Mary Carmichael and me.



",Mary Hamilton,1990
Joan Baez,"A holiday, a holiday, and the first one of the year
Lord DArlen's wife came into the church,
The gospel for to hear.

And when the meeting it was done, she cast her eyes about
And there she saw little Matty Groves, walking in the crowd
""Come home with me, little Matty Groves, come home with me tonight
Come home with me, little Matty Groves, and sleep with me till light""
""Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home and sleep with you tonight
By the rings on your fingers I can tell you are my master's wife""
""But if I am Lord Arlen 's wife, Lord Arlen's not at home
He is out in the far cornfields bringing the yearlings home""

And a servant who was standing by and hearing what was said
He swore Lord Arlen he would know before the sun would set
And in his hurry to carry the news, he bent his breast and ran
And when he came to the broad millstream, he took off his shoes and he swam

Little Matty Groves, he lay down and took a little sleep
When he awoke, Lord Arlen was standing at his feet
Saying ""How do you like my feather bed and how do you like my sheets
How do you like my lady who lies in your arms asleep?""
""Oh, well I like your feather bed and well I like your sheets
But better I like your lady gay who lies in my arms asleep""
""Well, get up, get up,"" Lord Arlen cried, ""get up as quick as you can
It'll never be said in fair England that I slew a naked man""
""Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up, I can't get up for my life
For you have two long beaten swords and I not a pocket knife""
""Well it's true I have two beaten swords and they cost me deep in the purse
But you will have the better of them and I will have the worse
And you will strike the very first blow and strike it like a man
I will strike the very next blow and I'll kill you if I can""

So Matty struck the very first blow and he hurt Lord Arlen sore
Lord Arlen struck the very next blow and Matty struck no more
And then Lord Arlen took his wife and he sat her on his knee
Saying ""Who do you like the best of us, Matty Groves or me?""
And then up spoke his own dear wife, never heard to speak so free
""I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips than you or your finery""

Lord Arlen he jumped up and loudly he did bawl
He struck his wife right through the heart and pinned her against the wall
""A grave, a grave,"" Lord Arlen cried, ""to put these lovers in
But bury my lady at the top for she was of noble kin""

Or god to man

And then the leaves became a thousand tears
And I was on my knees in a crazy house of mirrors
I couldn't find my face but a voice was drawing nearer
Hush baby - sweet baby - hush, don't you cry

And I thought I woke and my mother was standing there
And my heart broke as the ribbons in her hair
Turned into highways, surrounded and swirled
Like a crown come down around a not-so-perfect world

In the corner of the dream was the man with the blue guitar
It had no strings but the music touched the stars
And his long dark curls turned to gold before my eyes
And the barefoot girl smiled off to the side
And it was real

Then a thousand birds took flight with a joyful noise
And I heard the angels up on high rejoice
I could see my face and I recognized the voice
Hush baby - sweet baby - hush, baby, hush

It's just a dream, one of those that goes on and on
Scene after scene, with the rhythm of a gypsy song
When I really woke, I was frozen in between
I didn't know who I was, it was a dream inside a dream

It's all a dream
Oh what a dream
I had a dream",The Dream Song,1992
Joan Baez,"My house stands at the edge of glory
Steady as the seasons change
Dreams of grace arise before me
And they call me home again

I went forth with no protection
Through a fierce and a blinding rain
Seeking truth but not perfection
Saw my father's face again

Father father can you hear me
Through this swirl of thoughts unsaid
Dreams of grace arise before me
And they call me home again

My house stands at the edge of glory
Steady as the seasons change
Dreams of grace arise before me
And they call me home again

Take this hand that I hold out
Meant to bridge the years apart
Come in come in from the howling wind
To the clearing of my heart

Still and lovely came the morning
Gone was my father's face
In my house a bright reflection
New among my dreams of grace

My house stands at the edge of glory
Steady as the seasons change
Dreams of grace arise before me
And they call me home again",Edge of Glory,1992
Joan Baez,"So it's time to set you free
Watch you sail away from me
Though I'll miss you when you do,
I'm with you

Turn your face into the wind
Let your greatest dreams begin
Take the high road, win or lose
I'm with you

I was there in the morning light
with a love that would last
And I'll be there on your darkest night
when the sun's long gone and your heart is sinking fast

When you stumble, when you fall
When they back you to the wall
After all the rest are through
I'm with you

So it's time to set you free
Watch you sail away from me
Though I'll miss you when you do,
I'm with you

Take the high road, win or lose
I'm with you",I'm With You (Reprise),1992
Joan Baez,"Hard times, hard times in Canaan land
Trouble in the mind of a man
A voice came whispering softly to him
Go offer, offer up the lamb

Abraham took his only son
High up on a hill
His test of faith had finally come
As the wind, the wind begin to chill

Cold steel, cold steel in the father's hand
Tears falling from the sky
The angels, the angels did not understand
Why the righteous, the righteous boy should die

Abraham most mysteriously
Laid down that deadly knife
Said, ""My darlin' son, I wish I was the one
Who spared you, spared your precious life""

Oh Isaac, the light of all your days
Will shine upon this mountain high
And never, never fade away
And never fade away
",Isaac & Abraham,1992
Joan Baez,"Kneeling in the moonlight, gazing on the shore, the girl with the blue bouquet
What if you got it, what you're praying for? Careful what you pray

You turn around, the old way is gone, you wonder how you will carry on
All my pride I will lay aside, I will steal across the border for you

Lying in the dusty shadows of your bed, dreaming on a clear blue sky
Paying for something that you never even did, victim of a time gone by

You turn around, everything has changed, familiar scenes have been rearranged
All my life I will work and strive, I will steal across the border for you
All my pride I will lay aside, I will steal across the border for you.",Steal Across the Border,1992
Joan Baez,"When we were young, we pledged allegiance 
Every morning of our lives
The classroom rang with children's voices 
Under teacher's watchful eye
We learned about the world around us 
At our desks and at dinnertime
Reminded of the starving children
Cleaned our plates with guilty minds

The stones in the road 
We played like marbles in the dust
Until a voice called for us 
To make our way back home
The stones in the road 

When I was ten, my father held me 
On his shoulders above the crowd
To see a train draped in mourning 
Pass slowly through our town
His widow kneeled with all her children 
At the sacred burial ground
And the TV glowed that long hot summer 
With all the cities burning down

And the stones in the road 
Flew out from our bicycle tires
Worlds removed from all those fires as we raced 
Each other home
The stones in the road 

Stones

And now we drink our coffee on the run 
Climb that ladder rung by rung
We are the daughters and the sons 
But here's the line that's missing

The starving children have been replaced 
By souls out on the street
We give a dollar when we pass 
And hope our eyes don't meet
We pencil in, we cancel out
We crave the corner suite
We kiss your ass
We make you hold, we doctor the receipt

Stones in the road
Flew out from beneath our wheels
Another day, another deal, before we get back home

The stones in the road 
Leave a mark from whence they came
A thousand points of light or shame
Baby, I don't know

Stones in the road

Stones

In the road",Stones in the Road,1992
Joan Baez,"There are voices in the mirror, faces at the door
That open on the rivers we've never seen before
Are there choices for the sparrow, or does he only fly
High above the rivers that are pulling you and I

Oh, there are strange rivers, rivers that we cannot see
There are strange rivers who know our destiny
There are strange rivers who brought your love to me

He could have been a builder, he could have been the one
Who turned his dreams to steel cathedrals in the sun
He could have been a builder, until he bought the gun
There are forces in that river that keep him on the run

Oh, there are strange rivers, rivers that we cannot see
There are strange rivers who know our destiny
There are strange rivers who brought your love to me

Have you ever turned the corner and wondered why you did?
You haven't been that way since you were just a kid
Nothing really happens and then you have to say
You wonder what would happen had you gone the other way

Oh, there are strange rivers, rivers that we cannot see
There are strange rivers who know our destiny
There are strange rivers who brought your love to me",Strange Rivers,1992
Joan Baez,"You were dreaming on a park bench about a broad highway somewhere
When the music from the carillon seemed to hurl your heart out there
Past the scientific darkness, past the fireflies that float
To an angel bending down to wrap you in her warmest cloak

And you ask ""What am I not doing?""
She says, ""Your voice cannot command,
In time you will move mountains
And it will come through your hands.""

Still you angle for an option, still you argue for your case
Like you wouldn't know a burning bush if it blew up in your face
Yeah, we scheme about the future and we dream about the past
When just a simple reaching out could build a bridge that lasts

And you ask ""What am I not doing?""
She says, ""Your voice cannot command,
In time you will move mountains
And it will come through your hands.""

So whatever your hands find to do you must do with all your heart
There are thoughts enough to blow men's minds and tear great worlds apart
There's a healing touch to find you on that broad highway somewhere
To lift you as high as music running through an angel's hair

Don't ask what you are not doing
'Cause your voice cannot command
And in time we will move mountains
And it will come through your hands",Through Your Hands,1992
Joan Baez,"Blessed are the one-way ticket
Holders on the one-way street
Blessed are the midnight-riders
For in the shadow of God they sleep

Blessed are the huddled hikers
Staring aut at falling rain
Wond'ring at the retribution
In their personal acquaintance with pain

Blessed are the blood relations
Of the young ones who have died
Who had not the time or patience
To carry on this earthly ride

Rain will come and winds will blow
Wild deer die in the mountain snow
Birds will beat at Heaven's wall
What comes to one must come to all

For you and I are one-way ticket
Holders on that one-way street
Which lies across a golden valley
Where the waters of joy and hope run deep

So if you pass the parents weeping
Of the young ones who have died
Take them to your warmth and keeping
For blessed are the tears the cried
and many were the years they tried
Take them to that valley wide
And let their souls be pacified",Blessed Are...,1993

Of uncertainty
I want to be
In the warm hold of your loving mind.

To feel you all around me
And to take your hand
Along the sand,
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while
Behind your smile,
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find.

For me to love you now
Would be the sweetest thing,
'T would make me sing,
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

Diddy di dee dee diddy diddy,
Diddy diddy diddy dee dee dee.

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fears,
To help me to leave all my blues behind.

Is where I want to be
And long to be,

Oh, now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry land
Now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a foul command.

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of the springtime mind
And once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
Oh, why are the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

So, now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.
....................................

the original song of RICHARD FARINA
(copyright Whitmark and Sons) is the following

Now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of the springtime mind
It's once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
So why are the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

And where was the will of my father when
We raised our swords on high?
And where was my mother's wailing when
Our flags were justified?
And where will we take our pleasures when
Our bodies have been denied?

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry land
Now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a foul command.

There's a calf with a mournful eye

Me and Loretta liked living there.
It's been years since the kids had grown,

And Joe is somewhere on the road.

Still don't know what for, don't matter anymore.

Ya know that old trees just grow stronger,
And old rivers grow wilder every day.
But old people just grow lonesome

She sits and stares through at back door screen.
And all the news just repeats itself
Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen.
Someday I'll go and call up Rudy,
We worked together at the factory.
But what'd I tell him if he asks ""What's new?""
""Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do.""

So if you're walking down the street sometime
And spot some hollow ancient eyes,

And in the hours that followed, no one could repair
That poor girl, tossed by the tides of misfortune
Barely here to tell her tale, rolled in on a sea of disaster
Rolled out on a mainline rail

She once walked tight at my side, I'm sure she walked by you
Her striding steps could not deny, torment from a child who knew

That in the quiet morning, there would be despair
And in the hours that followed, no one could repair
That poor girl, she cried out her song so loud
It was heard the whole world round, a symphony of violence
The great southwest unbound

There was a wealthy merchant,
In London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter,
The truth to you I'll tell
Oh the truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
There was none but Jack the sailor,
Her true love e'er could be
Oh her true love e'er could be

Now Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
To leave his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind.

She went into a tailor shop
And dressed in men's array
And stepped on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, to convey herself away.

""Before you step on board, sir,
Your name I'd like to know""
She smiled all in her countenance,
""They call me Jackaroe""
Oh, they call me Jackaroe.

""Your waist is light and slender,
Your fingers are neat and small
Your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball""
Oh, to face the cannon-ball.

""I know my waist is slender,
My fingers neat and small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall""
Oh, to see ten thousand fall.

The war soon being over,
They hunted all around
And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found.

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds
Oh, who quickly healed his wounds.

And well they did agree
This couple they got married,
So why not you and me
Oh, so why not you and me.

Joan Baez,"How long since I've spent a whole night in a twin bed with a stranger 
His warm arms all around me? 
How long since I've gazed into dark eyes that melted my soul down 
To a place where it longs to be? 
All of your history has little to do with your face 
You're mainly a mystery with violins filling in space 

You stood in the nude by the mirror and picked out a rose 
From the bouquet in our hotel 
And lay down beside me again and I watched the rose 
On the pillow where it fell 
I sank and I slept in a twilight with only one care 
To know that when day broke and I woke that you'd still be there 

The hours for once they passed slowly, unendingly by 
Like a sweet breeze on a field 
Your gentleness came down upon me and I guess I thanked you 
When you caused me to yield 
We spoke not a sentence and took not a footstep beyond 
Our two days together which seemingly soon would be gone 

Don't tell me of love everlasting and other sad dreams 
I don't want to hear 
Just tell me of passionate strangers who rescue each other 
From a lifetime of cares 
Because if love means forever, expecting nothing returned 
Then I hope I'll be given another whole lifetime to learn 

Because you gave to me oh so many things it makes me wonder 
How they could belong to me 
And I gave you only my dark eyes that melted your soul down 
To a place where it longs to be",Love Song to a Stranger,1993

Naming the sorrow you've seen
Too many sad times, too many bad times
Nobody knows what you mean

And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

Trailing a wandering star
No one beside you, no one to guide you
Nobody knows who you are

And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

Oh, no use roaming, lying by the roadside
Seeking a satisfied mind
Too many highways, too many byways
Nobody's walking behind

And give them all to me, oh

Joan Baez,"Speaking of dreams 
Here we are in the glistening streets of Gay Paree 
Playing the Gipsy Kings 
After the rain and taking tea at the Ritz in boots and jeans 
With a teenage girl who said that it would be her grandest dream 
And speaking of dreams, I really must say 
I couldn't have dreamed you up 
Nor the way you burst into my life, rattled my cage 
And woke my sleeping demons up 

You were not yet born 
When my career began in '59 
We're a sign of the times 
Who cares if you are a breath of spring and I am vintage wine 
We come from two different worlds 
Like every other couple on the Rue de Rivoli 
You spent your youth in the rainforests of distant Camaroon 
Your father was a Navy captain, I am the Queen of Hearts 
And the daughter of the moon 

Speaking of dreams 
You took me to see the paintings of Paul Gaughin 
Speaking of dreams 
We stood in the midst of waterfalls, flaming trees 
Golden dogs and shining Tahitian ladies 
But it was you, not Paul Gaughin 
Who stopped my heart and then 
Started my life over again 

And if you feel as I do 
That we've erased the lines between reality 
And all our painted dreams 
Then take me down to where the Gipsies sing 
The songs their mothers knew 
Tie bright ribbons in my hair 
Lean on the wind and watch me while I dance for you 

And carry me off to the rainforests of distant Camaroon 
Tell me that you've always know that 
I am the Queen of Hearts 
And the daughter of the moon",Speaking of Dreams,1993
Joan Baez,"Come wander quietly and listen to the wind
Come here and listen to the sky
Come walking high above the rolling of the sea
And watch the swallows as they fly

There is no sorrow like the murmur of their wings
There is no choir like their song
There is no power like the freedom of their flight
While the swallows roam alone

Do you hear the calling of a hundred thousand voice
Hear the trumbling in the stone
Do you hear the angry bells ringing in the night
Do you hear the swallows when they've flown?

And will the breezes blow the petals from your hand
And will some loving ease your pain
And will the silence strike confusion from your soul
And will the swallows come again?",The Swallow Song,1993
Joan Baez,"Sweet Sir Galahad 
Came in through the window 
In the night when 
The moon was in the yard. 
He took her hand in his 
And shook the long hair 
From his neck and he told her 
She'd been working much too hard. 
It was true that ever since the day 
Her crazy man had passed away 
To the land of poet's pride, 
She laughed and talked a lot 
With new people on the block 
But always at evening time she cried. 

And here's to the dawn of their days. 
She moved her head 
A little down on the bed 
Until it rested softly on his knee. 
And there she dropped her smile 
And there she sighed awhile, 
And told him all the sadness 
Of those years that numbered three. 
Well you know I think my fate's belated 
Because of all the hours I waited 
For the day when I'd no longer cry. 
I get myself to work by eight 
But oh, was I born too late, 
And do you think I'll fail 
At every single thing I try? 

And here's to the dawn of their days. 
He just put his arm around her 
And that's the way I found her 
Eight months later to the day. 
The lines of a smile erased 
The tear tracks upon her face, 
A smile could linger, even stay. 
Sweet Sir Galahad went down 
With his gay bride of flowers, 
The prince of the hours 
Of her lifetime. 

And here's to the dawn 
Of their days, 
Of their days.",Sweet Sir Galahad,1993
Joan Baez,"Swing low, sweet chariot,
Comin' for to carry me home!
I looked over Jordan and what did I see,
Comin' for to carry me home!
A band of angels comin' after me,
Comin' for to carry me home! 

Swing low, sweet chariot,
Comin' for to carry me home!

If you get there before I do,
Comin' for to carry me home,
Jess tell my friends that I'm acomin' too,
Comin' for to carry me home. 

Swing low, sweet chariot,
Comin' for to carry me home!

Comin' for to carry me home,
But still my soul feels heavenly bound
Comin' for to carry me home!","Swing Low, Sweet Chariot",1993
Joan Baez,"Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I was taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that land that I live in
Has God on its side

Oh, the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Oh, the country was young
With God on its side

The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War, too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I was made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side

The First World War, boys
It came and it went
The reason for fighting
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead
When God's on your side

The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now, too
Have God on their side

I've learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side

But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust 
If fire them, we're forced to
Then fire, them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side

Through many a dark hour
I've been thinkin' about this
That Jesus Christ was
Betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you
You'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side

So now as I'm leavin'
I'm weary as Hell
The confusion I'm feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor
That if God's on our side
He'll stop the next war",With God on Our Side [Live],1993
Joan Baez,"Maybe it's the color of the sun cut flat

I am not pleadin' or sayin', I can't forget
I do not walk the floor bowed down an' bent, but yet
Mama, you are just on my mind.

Even though my mind is hazy an' my thoughts they might be narrow

But mama, you're just on my mind

When you wake up in the mornin', baby, look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near

Take the high road, win or lose
I'm with you

I was there in the morning light 
With a love that would last
And I'll be there on your darkest night

Joan Baez,"You don't have to play me backwards
To get the meaning of my verse
You don't have to die and go to Hell
To feel the Devil's curse

Well, I thought my life was a photograph
On the family Christmas card
Kids all dressed in buttons and bows
And lined up in the yard

Were the golden days of childhood
So lyrical and warm
Or did the picture start to fade
On the day that I was born

I've seen them light the candles
I've heard them bang the drum
And I've cried Mama, I'm cold as ice
And I got no place to run

Let the night begin, there's a pop of skin
And the sudden rush of scarlet
There's a little boy riding on a goat's head
And a little girl playing the harlot

There's a sacrifice in an empty church
Of sweet lil' baby Rose
And a man in a mask from Mexico
Is peeling off my clothes

I've seen them light the candles
I've heard them bang the drum
And I've cried Mama, I'm cold as ice
And I got no place to run

So, I'm paying for protection
Smoking out the truth
Chasing recollections
Nailing down the proof

You don't have to play me backwards
To get the meaning of my verse
You don't have to die and go to Hell
To feel the Devil's curse

I'll stand before your altar
And tell everything I know
I've come to claim my childhood
At the chapel of baby Rose

I've seen them light the candles
I've heard them bang the drum
I've seen them light the candles
I've heard them bang the drum

Se mi vuoi lì vicino
Se mi vuoi lì con te

E se c'è tu non tenerlo più nascosto
Più nascosto

Le tue labbra fra i denti
Se ripensi un po' a me

Noi ci perdemmo dentro il rosso di un tramonto
Fino a gridare I nostri nomi contro il vento
Tu fai sul serio o no

Tra un walzer pazzo cominciato un po' per caso
Tra le tue smorfie e le mie dita dentro il naso
Noi due inciampammo contro un bacio all'improvviso
Troppo bello per essere vero, per essere vero, per essere vero

Amore mio
Ma che gli hai fatto tu a quest'aria che respiro
E come fai a starmi dentro ogni pensiero
Giuralo ancora che tu esisti per davvero
Amore mio
Ma che che cos'hai tu di diverso dalla gente
Di fronte a te che sei per me così importante 
Tutto l'amore che io posso, proprio niente

Mentre il vento accarezzava piano
Il tuo vestito

E tu
Fatta di sguardi tu
E di sorrisi ingenui, tu
Ed io
A piedi nudi io
Sfioravo i tuoi capelli, io

E fermarci a giocare
Con una formica
E poi chiudere gli occhi
Non pensare più
Senti freddo anche tu
Senti freddo anche tu

E nascoste nell'ombra della sera poche stelle
Ed un brivido improvviso
Sulla tua pelle

Poi correre felici a perdifiato
Fare a gara per vedere
Chi resta indietro

E tu
In un sospiro tu
In ogni mi pensiero, tu

Con un filo d'erba
E scoprirti più bella

E mi piaci di più
Forse sei l'amore

E adesso non ci sei che tu
Soltanto tu e sempre tu
Che stai scoppiando dentro il cuore mio

Se adesso non ci fossi tu
Ad inventare questo amore

Ed un bacio e un altro e un altro ancora
Da non poterti dire
Che tu
Pallida e dolce tu
Eri già tutto quanto, tu

Presto si consumerà

Tanto stretta al punto che m'immaginavo tutto
E quell'aria da bambina
Che non glie'ho detto mai ma io ci andavo matto
E chiare sere d'estate, il mare, i giochi, le fate
E la paura e la voglia di essere nudi
Un bacio a labbra salate, un fuoco, quattro risate
E far l'amore giù al faro
Ti amo davvero, ti amo lo giuro, ti amo, ti amo davvero

E lei

Poi mi sorrideva e mi teneva stretto, stretto

Pure in mezzo a chissacchè l'avrei riconosciuta

Ma io questa cosa qui mica l'ho mai creduta
E lunghe corse affannate incontro a stelle cadute
E mani sempre più ansiose di cose proibite
E le canzoni stonate urlate al cielo lassù
""Chi arriva prima a quel muro""
Non sono sicuro se ti amo davvero
Non sono, non sono sicuro

E lei
Tutto ad un tratto non parlava
Ma le si leggeva chiaro in faccia che soffriva

From the city that dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
Cross the valleys and streams

And the world's on it's side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride

Ring the bells st.peter
Where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand
For the people will know
Oh it's rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow

Ring them bells sweet martha
For the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know
That God is one
Oh the shephered is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains they are filled
With lost sheep

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the day is through
Ring them bells, for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When the innocence dies

Ring them bells st.catherine
From the top of the room
Ring the bells from the fortress
For the lillies that bloom
For the lines they are long
And the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance
Between right and wrong

Ethnic echoes spitting out their trials.
I'll be the first to praise the sun,
The first to praise the moon.
The first to hold the lone coyote,
The last to set it free.

Welcome me  to a haven given,
It's well received into my open arms.
I ran in my sleep through shaking tremors,
I had the splitting earth echoing in my ears.
I'll be the first to praise the sun,
The first to praise the moon.
The first to hold the lone coyote,
The last to set it free.

Welcome me to the city of angels,
There's a devil monkey laying on our backs.
Where's the heart, where's the bullet for breaking.
Somebody give me a weapon,
A pacifying weapon.
I'll be the first to praise the sun,
The first to praise the moon.
The first to hold the lone coyote,
The last to set it free.",Welcome Me,1995
Joan Baez,"Why is it that as we grow older and stronger
The road signs point us adrift and make us afraid
Saying ""You never can win,"" ""Watch your back,"" ""Where's your husband?""
Oh, I don't like the signs that the sign makers made.

So I'm going to steal out with my paint and brushes
I'll change the directions, I'll hit every street
It's the Tinseltown scandal, the Robin Hood vandal
She goes out and steals the king's English
And in the morning you wake up and the signs point to you

They say
""I'm so glad that you finally made it here,""
""You thought nobody cared, but I did, I could tell,""
And ""This is your year,"" and ""It always starts here,""
And oh ""You're aging well."" 

Well I know a woman with a collection of sticks
She could fight back the hundreds of voices she heard
And she could poke at the greed, she could fend off her need
And with anger she found she could pound every word.
But one voice got through, caught her up by surprise
It said, ""Don't hold us back, we're the story you tell,""
And no sooner than spoken, a spell had been broken
And the voices before her were trumpets and tympani
Violins, basses and woodwinds and cellos, singing

""We're so glad that you finally made it here
You thought nobody cared, but we did, we could tell
And now you'll dance through the days while the orchestra plays
And oh, you're aging well.""

Now when I was fifteen, oh, I knew it was over
The road to enchantment was not mine to take
'Cause lower calf, upper arm should be half what they are
I was breaking the laws that the sign makers made.

And all I could eat was the poisonous apple
And that's not a story I was meant to survive
I was all out of choices, but the woman of voices

She turned round the corner with music around her,
She gave me the language that keeps me alive, she said:

""I'm so glad that you finally made it here
With the things you know now, that only time could tell
Looking back, seeing far, landing right where we are
And oh, you're aging, oh and I am aging,
Oh, aren't we aging well?""",You're Aging Well,1995
Joan Baez,"Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe
If you don't know by now
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe
It don't matter anyhow
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
And don't think twice, it's alright

Ain't no use in turning on your light babe
It's a light I've never known
There ain't no use in turning on your light baby
I'm on the dark side of the road
I wish there was something you could do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
And don't think twice, it's alright

Ain't no use in calling out my name now
Like you've never done before
Ain't no use in calling out my name now
I can't hear you anymore
Thinking and wondering all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
I gave her my heart, she wanted my soul
And don't think twice, it's alright

I'm going down that long lonesome road babe
Where I'm bound I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a word babe
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't saying you treated me unkind
Coulda done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
And don't think twice, it's alright
And don't think twice, it's alright

Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto

Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto

Joan Baez,"When we were young we pledged allegiance
Every morning of our lives
The classroom rang with children's voices
Under teacher's watchful eye
We learned about the world around us
At our desks and at dinner time
Reminded of the starving children
We cleaned our plates with guilty minds

And the stones in the road
Shone like diamonds in the dust
And then a voice called to us
To make our way back home

When I was ten my father held me
On his shoulders above the crowd
To see a train draped in mourning
Pass slowly through our town
His widow kneeled with all their children
At the sacred burial ground
And the TV glowed that long hot summer 
With all the cities burning down

And the stones in the road
Flew out beneath our bicycle tires
Worlds removed from all those fires
As we raced each other home

And now we drink our coffee on the run
We climb that ladder rung by rung
We are the daughters and the sons
And here's the line that's missing
The starving children have been replaced 
By souls out on the street
We give a dollar when we pass
And hope our eyes don't meet
We pencil in we cancel out
We crave the corner suite
We kiss your ass, we make you hold 
We doctor the receipt

And the stones in the road
They fly out from beneath our wheels
Another day, another deal
Before we get back home

Stones in the road
Leave a mark whence they came
A thousands points of light or shame
Baby, I don't know",Stones in the Road [*/#][#],1995
Joan Baez,"The water is wide, I cannot get o'er
Neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall cross my true love and I
I lean'd my back against an oak
Thinking it was a mighty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
So did my love prove false to me
I put my hand in some soft bush
Thinking the sweetest flow'are to find
I prick'd my finger to the bone
And left the sweetest flow'are behind
O love is handsome and love is kind
Gay as a jewel when it is new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like the morning dew 
The water is wide, I cannot get o'er
Neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall cross my true love and I",The Water Is Wide [*/#][#],1995

He plays country records till you've had your fill

A myth has just been shattered
Upon the four winds scattered
Back to some storybook
From whence it came
Vicarious hearts may ache
And try to mend the break
And seek for a righteous place
To put the blame

Neither of us knew
What the future would bring
We only know that now there is
Some room to talk and sing
The baby laughs a lot
And that's the most important thing
And as soon as we can handle
The hurt and pain
There may be more
Than just happy memories to gain

So to hell with all the troubles
And counting up the couples
Who travelled this same route
On their way down
Because if we keep on growing
There is no way of knowing
When we'll meet
As two new people we just found
We just found

Joan Baez,"I was born a poor poor man
All my life I had hard workin' hands
But I sang a song as I carried my load
Cuz I had a dream about rainbow, rainbow road

Then one day my chance came along
A man heard me singin' and playing these old songs
He bought me fine clothes, paid the money I owed
Started me on my way down rainbow, rainbow road

Then one night a man wiht a knife
Pushed me till I had to take his life
Fast as fallin' all my friends were gone
That old judge traded me a sentence for a song

Just livin' with that ball 'n chain
Had to wear a number 'for they'd ever call my name
Like a dream I'm growing old
But we still sing about rainbow, rainbow read

Bangladesh, Bangladesh
Bangladesh, Bangladesh
When the sun sinks in the west
Die a million people of the Bangladesh

The story of Bangladesh
Is an ancient one again made fresh
By blind men who carry out commmands
Which flow out of the laws upon which nation stands
Which is to sacrifice a people for a land

Bangladesh, Bangladesh
Bangladesh, Bangladesh
When the sun sinks in the west
Die a million people of the Bangladesh

Once again we stand aside
And watch the families crucified
See a teenage mother's vacant eyes
As she watches her feeble baby try
To fight the monsoon rains and the cholera flies

And the students at the university
Asleep at night quite peacefully
The soldiers came and shot them in their beds
And terror took the dorm awakening shrieks of dread
And silent frozen forms and pillows drenched in red

Bangladesh, Bangladesh
Bangladesh, Bangladesh
When the sun sinks in the west
Die a million people of the Bangladesh

Did you read about the army officer's plea
For donor's blood? It was given willingly
By boys who took the needles in their veins
And from their bodies every drop of blood was drained
No time to comprehend and there was little pain

And so the story of Bangladesh
Is an ancient one again made fresh
By all who carry out commands
Which flow out of the laws upon which nations stand
Which say to sacrifice a people for a land

Bangladesh, Bangladesh
Bangladesh, Bangladesh
When the sun sinks in the west
Die a million people of the Bangladesh

",Song of Bangladesh,1996
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

I'll put flowers at your feet and I will sing to you so sweet
And hope my words will carry home to your heart
You left us marching on the road and said how heavy was the load
The years were young, the struggle barely had its start
Do you hear the voices in the night, Bobby?
They're crying for you
See the children in the morning light, Bobby
They're dying

No one could say it like you said it, we'd only try and just forget it
You stood alone upon the mountain till it was sinking
And in a frenzy we tried to reach you
With looks and letters we would beseech you
Never knowing what, where or how you were thinking
Do you hear the voices in the night, Bobby?
They're crying for you
See the children in the morning light, Bobby
They're dying

Perhaps the pictures in the Times could no longer be put in rhymes
When all the eyes of starving children are wide open
You cast aside the cursed crown and put your magic into a sound
That made me think your heart was aching or even broken
But if God hears my complaint He will forgive you
And so will I, with all respect, I'll just relive you
And likewise, you must understand these things we give you

Like these flowers at your door and scribbled notes about the war
We're only saying the time is short and there is work to do
And we're still marching in the streets with little victories and big defeats
But there is joy and there is hope and there's a place for you
And you have heard the voices in the night, Bobby
They're crying for you
See the children in the morning light, Bobby
They're dying

Joan Baez,"""Give to me your tired and your poor
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me""

Blessed are the persecuted
And blessed are the pure in heart
Blessed are the merciful
And blessed are the ones who mourn

The step is hard that tears away the roots
And says goodbye to friends and family
The fathers and the mothers weep
The children cannot comprehend
But when there is a promised land
The brave will go and others follow
The beauty of the human spirit
Is the will to try our dreams
And so the masses teemed across the ocean
To a land of peace and hope
But no one heard a voice or saw a light
As they were tumbled onto shore
And none was welcomed by the echo of the phrase
""I lift my lamp beside the golden door""

Blessed are the persecuted
And blessed are the pure in heart
Blessed are the merciful
And blessed are the ones who mourn",Ballad of Sacco and Vanzetti [*],1996

They'd frozen half way down in the ice 
They froze up so quickly, the keys and their owners

First we forgot where we'd planted those bulbs last year 
Then we forgot that we'd planted at all 
Then we forgot what plants are altogether 
And I blamed you for my freezing and forgetting and 
The nights were long and cold and scary 
Can we live through February? 

You know I think Christmas was a long red glare 
Shot up like a warning, we gave presents without cards 
And then the snow 
And then the snow came, we were always out shoveling 
And we'd drop to sleep exhausted 
Then we'd wake up, and it's snowing 

And February was so long that it lasted into March 
And found us walking a path alone together 
You stopped and pointed and you said, ""That's a crocus"" 
And I said ""What's a crocus?"" and you said ""It's a flower"" 
I tried to remember but I said ""What's a flower?"" 
You said ""I still love you"" 

The leaves were turning as we drove to the hardware store

Oh Lily",Lily,1997
Joan Baez,"Late last night I awoke in a dream 
To the sound of a voice that was almost a scream 
Oh oh oh 
From out of the city and out of the street 
Out where the wind hits the cold concrete 
Oh oh oh 

It's cold outside 
Darkness your enemy 
No place to hide 
The voice said this to me 
In your doorways I have shivered 
In your alleys I have gone to ground 
But I will be delivered 
Someday I will be mercy bound 

I dreamed again it was west L.A. 
On a crowded street on a hot summer day 
She was alone 
Three months late and beginning to show 
In a midriff blouse she would soon outgrow 
She had no one to call 
And no way home 
And in my mind 
I knew I'd seen myself 
But in our blindness 
It always seems like someone else 
There I was a rag a bone 
A remnant in your lost and found 
I was for once truly alone 
Longing to be mercy bound 

And I knew that I would wander as child in the forest 
Till they found me 
And I called out to them but I could not penetrate the silence 
All around me 

And when I wake I know you'll comfort me 
And I won't sleep again for an eternity 
But others lie awake at night 
In desperation more profound 
And the coming of the morning light 
Will not see them mercy bound 

And some will never dream again 
From sleeping on the ground 
Just longing to belong 
And dying to be mercy bound 
Oh please don't stop your dreaming 
Someday we'll all be mercy bound",Mercy Bound,1997
Joan Baez,"My name is Eliza
I live by the river 
My daughter Louise 
Will be three in July
If July ever comes 
It's beginning to feel like
The water will never
Surrender the field

The river will swell 
But they always find money 
They always find money
They always find money for floods

In a green helicopter
He and the governor walked all around

He told her he'd do everything that he could

But they always find money

I went out with a boy

Joan Baez,"Must've been in late September 
When last I climbed Reunion Hill 
I fell asleep on Indian Boulder 
And dreamed a dream I will not tell 
I came home as the sun went down 
One eye trained upon the ground 
Even now I find their things 
Glasses, coins, and golden rings 

It's ten years since that ragged army 
Limped across these fields of mine 
I gave them bread, I gave them brandy 
Most of all, I gave them time 
My well is deep, the water pure 
The streams are fed by mountain lakes 
I cleaned the brow of many a soldier 
Dousing for my husband's face 

I won't forget our sad farewell 
And how I ran to climb that hill 
Just to watch him walk across the valley 
And disappear into the trees 

Alone there in a sea of blue 
It circles every afternoon 
A single hawk in God's great sky 
Looking down with God's own eyes 
He soars above Reunion Hill 
I pray he spiral higher still 
As if from such an altitude 
He might just keep my love in view 

Must've been in late September 
When last I climbed Reunion Hill",Reunion Hill,1997

Joan Baez,"I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would have stayed home
Who uses all his power to do evil and in the end is always left so alone
That man who with his fingers cheats, who lies with every breath
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death

I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain
Whose heaven is like ironsides, whose tears are like rain
Who eats but is not satisfied, who hears but does not see
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me

I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who fills his town with blood
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass

Joan Baez,"Dear landlord, please don't put a price on my soul
My burden is heavy, dear
And my dreams are beyond my control
Oh yes, they are

But when that steamboat whistle blows
Oh, honey I'm gonna give you everything I ever had to give, yeah
And I do hope that you can receive it well
I know that it must be dependin' on the way you feel that you live

Whoa, landlord, please heed these words that I try to speak
I know you must have suffered much
But honey you ain't alone, you ain't so unique
No no no, no no

All of us at times, I said, we might have worked too hard
Or too heavy, too fast and way too rushed, yeah
But everyone can fill their life with anything
You can look around, but baby, you just cannot touch

Whoa, my dear landlord, please don't you dismiss my case
I'm not about to argue with you
And honey I'll tell ya, I'm ain't gonna move to no other place
'Cause I just ain't gonna do it, no no no

Each of us must have our own special gift
Oh honey, don't you know that it's got to be true
And if you don't underestimate me, I'll tell you one thing
I said that I won't underestimate you, no

Joan Baez,"""Help me in my weakness""
I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the courtroom
And were taking him away

""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one
My time it isn't long
And I still do not know
What it was that I've done wrong""

Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
""You fail to understand"", he said
""Why must you even try?""

Outside, the crowd was stirring
You could hear it from the door
Inside, the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more

""Oh, stop that cursed jury""
Cried the attendant and the nurse
The trial was bad enough
But this is ten times worse

Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape
And while everybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escape
",Drifter's Escape,1998
Joan Baez,"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine alive as you our me
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold
Searching for the very souls who already have been sold

""Arise, arise"", he cried so loud in a voice without restraint
Come out, he gifted kings and queens and hear my sad complaint
No martyr is among you now whom you can call your own
So go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone

I dreamed I saw St. Augustine alive with fiery breath
I dreamed I was amongst the ones who put him out to death
Oh, I awoke in anger so alone and terrified
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and I cried
",I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,1998
Joan Baez,"My love, she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true like fire, like ice

People carry roses
Make promises by the hour
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, read deep quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall

Some speak of the future
My love, she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge

Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring

The wind howls like a hammer
The night wind blows cold and rainy
My love, she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing
",Love Minus Zero/No Limit,1998
Joan Baez,"Down the street the dogs are barking
And the day is a-gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-falling
The dogs will lose their bark

And the silent night will shatter
From the thoughts inside my mind
And I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

At the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they start to fade
And I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid

And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

It's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good
When everything I'm saying
You can say it just as good

You were right from your side
But I was right from mine
We're both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind
",One Too Many Mornings,1998
Joan Baez,"Oh, all the money in my whole life I spent
Be it mine right or wrongfully
I let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully

But the bottles are done, we've killed each one
And the tables are full and overflowed
And the corner sign says, ""It's closing time""
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road

Oh, every boy that ever I've touched
I did not do it harmfully
And every boy that ever I've hurt
I did not do it knowingly

But to remain as friends, you need the time
To make amends and stay behind
And since my feet are now fast and point away from the past
I'll bid farewell and be down the line

Oh, every foe that ever I faced
The cause was there before we came
And every cause that ever I fought
I fought it full without regret or shame

But the dark does die as the curtain is drawn
And somebody's eyes must meet the dawn
And if I see the day I'll only have to stay
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone

Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract and bother me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me

But if the arrow is straight and the point is slick
It can pierce through the dust no matter how thick
So I'll make my stand and remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn
",Restless Farewell,1998
Joan Baez,"We carried you in our arms
On Independence Day
And now you'd throw us all aside
And put us on our way

Oh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun
Would treat a father so
To wait upon him hand and foot
And always tell him, ""No""?

Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so alone and life is brief

We pointed out the way to go
And scratched your name in sand
Though you just thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand

Now, I want you to know that while we watched
You discover there was no one true
Most everybody really thought
It was a childish thing to do

Tears of rage, tears of grief
Must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so low and life is brief

It was all very painless
When you went out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe

And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse
But oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse?

'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
I took the train to Richmond that fell
It was a time I remember, oh, so well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin' 
They went, ""Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na""

Back with my wife in Tennessee
And one day she said to me
""Virgil, quick! Come see
There goes Robert E. Lee""

And like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand

Joan Baez,"Seems like only yesterday
I left my mind behind
Down in the gypsy cafe
With a friend of a friend of mine

She sat with a baby heavy on her knee
Yet spoke of life most free from slavery
With eyes that showed no trace of misery
A phrase in connection first with she occurred

That love is just a fou letter word

Outside a rambling store-front window
Cats meowed to the break of day
Me, I kept my mouth shut
To you I had no words to say

My experience was limited and underfed
You were talking while I hid
To the one who was the father of your kid
You probably didn't think I did, but I heard you say

That love is just a four letter word

I said goodbye unnoticed
Pushed forth into my own games
Drifting in and out of lifetimes
Unmentionable by name

Searching for my double, looking for
Complete evaporation to the core
Though I tried and failed at finding any door
I must have thought that there was nothing more absurd than

That love is just a four letter word

Though I never knew just what you meant
When you were speaking to your man
I can only think in terms of me
And now I understand

After waking enough times to think I see
The holy kiss that's supposed to last eternity
Blow up in smoke, its destiny, falls on strangers, travels free
Yes, I know now, traps are only set by me
And I do not really need to be assured

That love is just a four letter word

Strange it is to be beside you
Many years and tables turned
You'd probably not believe me
If I told you all I've learned

And it is very, very weird indeed yo hear words like forever plead
Those ships run through my mind, I cannot cheat
It's like looking in the teacher's face complete
I can say nothing to you but repeat what I heard

That love is just a four letter word

The couch is gold with a floral design

Frankfurt is covered with snow
And numbly they ride on an icy wind

Who held me in my limousine
And slept with me under a burgundy quilt
With sheets of silk in between

His face was sculpted by God
His words were gentle and ever so true
And soft as the Irish fog
And lost in the Irish fog

Who wanted to be a monk
But he brought flowers and wine to my room
And we both got happily drunk
And we both got perfectly drunk

His eyes were alexandrite blue
He danced the t'ai chi with the grace of a deer

Kept telling me I was still young
He spoke in pure southern and smoothed out the lines
Round my eyes saying I was the one
Forever that I'd be the one

He drank and he cussed and he wrote his own songs
He was very much on the go

And a man can't get around
So I sold my soul for wheels that roll
Now I'm stuck here in this town

[Chorus]

There's foxes in the hen house
Cows out in the corn
The unions have been busted
Their proud red banners torn
To listen to the radio
You'd think that all was well
But you and me and Cisco know
It's going straight to hell

So come back, Emma Goldman
Rise up, old Joe Hill
The barricades are goin' up
They cannot break our will
Come back to us, Malcolm X
And Martin Luther King
We're marching into Selma
As the bells of freedom ring

[Chorus]",Christmas in Washington,2003
Joan Baez,"Will you comfort me in my time of need
Can you take away the pain of a hurtful deed
Cause when we need it most there's no rain at all
And the dust just settles right there on the feed

Will you say to me a little rain's gonna come
When the sky can't offer none to me
Cause I will come for you
When my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me
Cause when the calm comes down
I take the truck into town
And buy whatever we can't seem to grow
I work these hands to bleed cause I got my mouths to feed
And I got 15 dollars hid above the stove

Will you say to me a little rain's gonna come
When the sky can't offer none to me
Cause I will come for you
When my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me 

Cause it ain't like it was on back in those days
When everyone would offer up a hand
These old bones are worn
I've grown tired some
And I know my time is surely gonna come

Will you comfort me in my time of need
Can you take away the pain of hurtful deeds
Cause I will comfort you when my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me
Lord we married young and stayed where we came from
And gave those children everything we had
Will you stay with me in my time of need

Though it seems we had such little time for us
Will you say to me a little rain's gonna come
When the sky can't offer none to me
Cause I will come for you
When my days are through
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me",In My Time of Need,2003
Joan Baez,"I might just change my mind
Sometimes you can never tell
Where a story will unwind
How deep is the shallow ground

Sometimes you would never guess
Who's all talk and who just might
Find a way or lose themselves
On the king's highway tonight

I am just like many more
Who lie in bed, still and numb
Waking up and I can see
Just how dark it has become

Who knows no better angels now
Who knows none but earthly light
Who is waiting for a stranger
On the king's highway tonight

It wasn't how I had it planned
When it finally came around
I took a man with my own hands
But I held him close when he went down

He hadn't time to be afraid
His look was only of surprise
Staring up from where he lay
On the king's highway tonight

I took the little that he had
Only as an afterthought
He wouldn't have to feel so bad
To think I killed him just because

He was passing through this town
Only 'cause he looked about right
He stopped when I flagged him down
On the king's highway tonight

I might just change my mind
Sometimes you can never tell",King's Highway,2003
Joan Baez,"Where in the hell can you go
Far from the things that you know
Far from the sprawl of concrete that keeps crawling
It's way about 1,000 miles a day

Take one last look behind
Commit this to memory and mind
And don't miss this wasteland
This terrible place

When you leave
Keep your heart off your sleeve

Motherland cradle me
Close my eyes, lullaby me to sleep
Keep me safe, lie with me
Stay beside me don't go, don't go, don't you go

Oh, my five and dime queen
Tell me what have you seen?
The lust and the avarice, the bottomless
Cavernous greed, is that what you see?

Motherland cradle me
Close my eyes, lullaby me to sleep
Keep me safe, lie with me
Stay beside me don't go, don't go

It's your happiness I want most of all
And for that I'd do anything at all, oh, mercy me
If you want the best of it or the most of all
If there's anything I can do at all

Now come on shot gun bride
What makes me envy your life?
Faceless, nameless, innocent and blameless
And free, what's that like to be?

Oh, motherland cradle me
Close my eyes, lullaby me to sleep
Keep me safe, lie with me
Stay beside me don't go, don't go

Motherland cradle me
Close my eyes, lullaby me to sleep
Keep me safe, lie with me
Stay beside me don't go, don't go

Don't you go

Joan Baez,"At night we crossed the border
Following a Black robe
To the edge of the reservation ton
Cataldo Mission
Where the saints and all the martyrs
Look down on dying converts
What makes the water holy she says is that that it's the closest thing to rain

I stole a mule from Anthony
I helped Anne up upon it
And we rode to Coeur d'Alene
Through Harrison and Wallace
They were blasting out the tunnels
Making way for the light of learning
When Jesus comes a calling she said he's coming round the mountain on a train

It's my home-last night I dreamt that I grew wings
I found a place where they could hear me when I sing

We floated on to Hanford
On a lumber boat up river
Past the fisheries and the mill towns like a stretch of future graveyards
She was driven to distraction
Said I wonder what will happen
When they find out they're mistaken
The land is too changed to ever change

We waded through the marketplace
Someone's ship had come in
There was silver and begonias
Dynamite and cattle
There were hearts as big as apples
And apples in the shape of Mary's heart
I said inside this gilded cage a songbird always looks so plain

It's my home-last night I dreamt that I grew wings
I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.

And so they came with cameras
Breaking through the morning mist
Press and businessmen-tycoons-Episcopal philanthropists
Lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman
But all we saw were lowlands
Clouds clung to mountains without strings

And at last we saw some people
And at last we saw some people

And at last we saw some people
Huddled up against
The rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers
They were headed for the border
Walking and then running
And then they were gone into the fog but Anne said
Underneath their jackets she saw wings",Wings,2003
Joan Baez,"Well I'll be damned 
Here comes your ghost again 
But that's not unusual 
It's just that the moon is full 
And you happened to call 
And here I sit 
Hand on the telephone 
Hearing a voice I'd known 
A couple of light years ago 
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes 
Were bluer than robin's eggs 
My poetry was lousy you said 
Where are you calling from? 
A booth in the midwest 
Ten years ago 
I bought you some cufflinks 
You brought me something 
We both know what memories can bring 
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene 
Already a legend 
The unwashed phenomenon 
The original vagabond 
You strayed into my arms 
And there you stayed 
Temporarily lost at sea 
The Madonna was yours for free 
Yes the girl on the half-shell 
Could keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing 
With brown leaves falling all around 
And snow in your hair 
Now you're smiling out the window 
Of that crummy hotel 
Over Washington Square 
Our breath comes out white clouds 
Mingles and hangs in the air 
Speaking strictly for me 
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me 
You're not nostalgic 
Then give me another word for it 
You who are so good with words 
And at keeping things vague 
'Cause I need some of that vagueness now 
It's all come back too clearly 
Yes I loved you dearly 
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust 
I've already paid",Diamonds and Rust,2003
Joan Baez,"They poured across the borders
We were cautioned to surrender
This I could not do
Into the hills I vanished

No one ever asks me
Who I am or where I'm going
But those of you who know
You cover up my footprints

I have changed my name so often
I have lost my wife and children
But I have many friends
And some of them are with me

An old woman gave us shelter
Kept us hidden in a garrett
And then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper

There were three of us this morning
And I'm the only one this evening
Still I must go on
Frontiers are my prison

through the graves the winds are blowing

Then we'll come from the shadow",The Partisan,2003
Joan Baez,"Tell me when you see them 
Gathered at the shore 
Dancing on their broken chains 
Ah, the ladies are no more 

In their blue jeans and their necklaces 
Against an evening sky 
But some of them are weeping 
Crying rider, please pass by 

The ship with all the riders 
Has drifted out to sea 
Compass cracked and stars unnamed 
It's lost to history 

And the riders in captivity 
Watch ancient waves roll high 
And hear the distant voices 
Crying rider, please pass by 

All you men who should have been 
Your fathers beat you down 
Your mothers loved you badly 
Your teachers stole your crowns 

And the wars you fought have taken toll 
The price was far too high 
You've buried all the images 
Of riders passing by 

The horses of the riders 
Have waited at the tide 
But years have passed, they know at last 
Their heroes will not ride 

So the women oh so gracefully 
Mount noble horses high 
Shattering the timelessness 
Of rider, please pass by 

But who can dare to judge us 
The women or the men? 
If freedom's wings shall not be clipped 
We all can love again 

So the choice is not of etiquette 
Or finding lonesome ways to die 
But liberty to ships at sea 
And riders passing by 

But liberty to ships at sea 
And riders passing by",Rider Pass By,2003

Joan Baez,"All the weary mothers of the earth will finally rest
We will take their babies in our arms, and do our best
When the sun is low upon the field
To love and music they will yield
And the weary mothers of the earth shall rest

And the farmer on his tractor, and beside his plow
Will stand there in confusion as we wet his brow
With the tears of all the businessmen
Who see what they have done to him
And the weary farmers of the earth shall rest

And the aching workers of the world again shall sing
These words in mighty choruses to all will bring
""We shall no longer be the poor
For no one owns us anymore""
And the workers of the world again shall sing

And when the soldiers burn their uniforms in every land
The foxholes at the borders will be left unmanned
General, when you come for the review
The troops will have forgotten you
And the men and women of the earth shall rest

And there was nothin' anyone could do or say

And I almost listened to him
Yeah, I almost lost my mind
Then I regained my senses again
And looked into my heart to find

That I believe that one fine day all the children of Abraham
Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem

Well maybe I'm only dreamin' and maybe I'm just a fool
But I don't remember learnin' how to hate in Sunday school
But somewhere along the way I strayed and I never looked back again
But I still find some comfort now and then

Then the storm comes rumblin' in
And I can't lay me down
And the drums are drummin' again
And I can't stand the sound

But I believe there'll come a day when the lion and the lamb
Will lie down in peace together in Jerusalem

And there'll be no barricades then
There'll be no wire or walls

And word is up to Madam the Queen, and that's the worst of all
That Mary Hamilton has borne a babe
To the highest Stuart of all
Oh rise, arise Mary Hamilton
Arise and tell to me
What thou hast done with thy wee babe
I saw and heard weep by thee
I put him in a tiny boat
And cast him out to sea
That he might sink or he might swim
But he'd never come back to me
Oh rise arise Mary Hamilton
Arise and come with me
There is a wedding in Glasgow town
This night we'll go and see
She put not on her robes of black
Nor her robes of brown
But she put on her robes of white
To ride into Glasgow town
And as she rode into Glasgow town
The city for to see
The bailiff's wife and the provost's wife
Cried Alack and alas for thee
You need not weep for me she cried
You need not week for me
For had I not slain my own wee babe
This death I would not dee
Oh little did my mother think
When first she cradled me
The lands I was to travel in
And the death I was to dee
Last night I washed the Queen's feet
And put the gold in her hair
And the only reward I find for this
The gallows to be my share
Cast off cast off my gown she cried
But let my petticoat be
And tie a napkin round my face
The gallows I would not see
Then by them come the king himself
Looked up with a pitiful eye
Come down come down Mary Hamillton
Tonight you will dine with me
Oh hold your tongue my sovereign liege
And let your folly be
For if you'd a mind to save my life
You'd never have shamed me here
Last night there were four marys
Tonight there'll be but three
It was Mary Beaton and Mary Seton
And Mary Carmichael and me.

The Indians fell
The cavalries charged

Oh, the country was young

War had its day
And the Civil War, too

I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride

And then we were friends

It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely

Then fire, them we must

That Jesus Christ was
Betrayed by a kiss

Had God on his side

And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
It's just a ragged clown behind

Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees
Out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow

With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate
Driven deep beneath the waves

Joan Baez,"A bullet from the back of a bush
Took Medgar Evers' blood
A finger fired the trigger to his name
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man's brain
But he can't be blamed
He's only a pawn in their game

A South politician preaches to the poor white man
""You got more than the blacks, don't complain
You're better than them, you been born with white skin,"" they explain
And the Negro's name
Is used, it is plain
For the politician's gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game

The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
And the marshals and cops get the same
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool
He's taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he's in
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game

From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoofbeats pound in his brain
And he's taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back
With his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game

Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
They lowered him down as a king
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun

On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name

Filling up the world with time turning time to flowers
I can show you all the songs
That I never sang to one man before

You have climbed the hills with me to the mountain shelter
Taken off the days one by one

And it's cold here
And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old Rockford town
Up by the Wisconsin border

Shoveling snow and raking leaves
And my plane will touch tomorrow
On the day after tomorrow

Every night
And I dream that I can hold you

About what it means to be a soldier

About all the blood that's been spilled

Get me back home
On the day after tomorrow

You can't deny
The other side
Don't want to die
Any more than we do
What I'm trying to say,
Is don't they pray
To the same God that we do?
Tell me, how does God choose?
Whose prayers does he refuse?
Who turns the wheel?
And who throws the dice
On the day after tomorrow?

I'm not fighting
For justice
I am not fighting
For freedom
I am fighting
For my life
And another day
In the world here
I just do what I've been told
You're just the gravel on the road
And the one's that are lucky
One's come home
On the day after tomorrow

And the summer
It too will fade
And with it comes the winter's frost, dear
And I know we too are made
Of all the things that we have lost here
I'll be twenty-one today
I've been saving all my pay
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow
And my plane it will touch down
On the day after tomorrow",Day After Tomorrow,2008
Joan Baez,"I believe in prophecy.
Some folks see things not everybody can see.
And, once in a while, they pass the secret along to you and me.

And I believe in miracles.
Something sacred burning in every bush and tree.
We can all learn to sing the songs the angels sing.

Yeah, I believe in God, and God ain't me.

I've traveled around the world,
Stood on mighty mountains and gazed across the wilderness.
Never seen a line in the sand or a diamond in the dust.

And as our fate unfurls,
Every day that passes I'm sure about a little bit less.
Even my money keeps telling me it's God I need to trust.

And I believe in God, but God ain't us.

God, in my little understanding, don't care what name I call.
Whether or not I believe doesn't matter at all.

I receive the blessings.
That every day on Earth's another chance to get it right.
Let this little light of mine shine and rage against the night.

Just another lesson
Maybe someone's watching and wondering what I got.
Maybe this is why I'm here on Earth, and maybe not.

But I believe in God, and God is God.",God Is God,2008
Joan Baez,"I was walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road
And every mile that I traveled showed
And I'm walkin' down the Jericho road
I just kept on walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road
And the sun set red over fields of gold
And I'm walkin' down the Jericho road
Well Joshua fit the battle, that's how the story goes
And the walls come a-tumb-a-lin' down I know
But I'm still walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road

I met my mother walkin' down the Jericho road
Tears in her eyes and her head hung low
And she was walkin' down the Jericho road
I met my father walkin' down the Jericho road
His back bent over from a heavy load
And he was walkin' down the Jericho road

I said ""papa, don't you know me? Won't you lay your burden down?""
He just shook his head and told me ""son, you better turn around""
And he kept on walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road

I met my brother walkin' down the Jericho road
And his hands were bloody but his face was clean
And he was walkin' down the Jericho road
I met my sister walkin' down the Jericho road
With a babe in her arms that I'd never seen
And she was walkin' down the Jericho road

She said ""It's just a little orphan child I found along the way
I'll raise him as my own and he'll forgive us all someday""

Joan Baez,"Mary you're covered in roses, you're covered in ashes
You're covered in rain
You're covered in babies, you're covered in slashes
You're covered in wilderness, you're covered in stains
You cast aside the sheet, you cast aside the shroud
Of another man, who served the world proud
You greet another son, you lose another one
On some sunny day and always stay, Mary

[Chorus]
Jesus says Mother I couldn't stay another day longer
Flies right by me and leaves a kiss upon her face
While the angels are singin' his praises in a blaze of glory
Mary stays behind and starts cleaning up the place

Mary she moves behind me
She leaves her fingerprints everywhere
Every time the snow drifts, every time the sand shifts
Even when the night lifts, she's always there

Mary you're covered in roses, you're covered in ruin
You're covered in secrets
You're covered in treetops, you're covered in birds

You greet another son, you lose another one

Joan Baez,"Well, I recall his parting words
Must I accept his fate
Or take myself far from this place?

I thought I heard a black bell toll
A little bird did sing
Man has no choice when he wants everything

[Chorus]
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
They trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride

Man goes beyond his own decision
Gets caught up in a mechanism
Of swindlers who act like kings
And jokers who break everything

The dark of night was swiftly fading
Close to the dawn of day
Why would I want him just to lose him again

[Chorus]",Scarlet Tide,2008
Joan Baez,"Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I was taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that land that I live in
Has God on its side

Oh, the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Oh, the country was young
With God on its side

The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War, too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I was made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side

The First World War, boys
It came and it went
The reason for fighting
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead
When God's on your side

The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now, too
Have God on their side

I've learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side

But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them, we're forced to
Then fire, them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side

Through many a dark hour
I've been thinkin' about this
That Jesus Christ was
Betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you
You'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side.

So now as I'm leavin'
I'm weary as Hell
The confusion I'm feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor
That if God's on our side
He'll stop the next war",With God on Our Side,2009
Joan Baez,"Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon",Dark as a Dungeon,2010
Joan Baez,"It was seven months since 9/11
And the work was almost done
It was seven months since 9/11
And the work had just begun
Ground Zero lit the evening sky
Like a beacon through the heart
The searchlights drove through Heaven's doors
And blew them far apart
A few miles north on the Hudson River
We had gathered for a sort of wake
Nobody felt like celebrating
But the Firemen needed some kind of break
They'd been to so many funerals
And seen so many God-awful sights
They'd been to Ground Zero from dawn to dusk
And round the clock some nights

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

I was all dressed up like the rest of the crowd
At the Roxy Club that night
The men and women in Uniform
Tried hard to keep it light
Kevin Bacon played and sang
And folks began to smile
Chris Bodi played his silver horn
With rhythm and with style
I sang my song Amazing Grace
And people laughed and cried
Ronan Tynan sang Danny Boy and
Not an eye was dry
Steve Buscemi spoke of life
At Engine 55,
Of how these heroes
Stayed the course and
Saved so many lives

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

A burly man with a handsome face
Stuck out his hand and smiled
Say, meet my wife, we like your songs
We've been with you mile for mile
Though he had a rugged face
I knew I saw the hurt
Then he pointed to a spot above the collar of his shirt.
Just look here on the back of my neck,
There's a tattoo, can you see?
Just right here, I got up close
And saw the number 343,
The number of the Firemen
Who were lost upon that day
The numbers of those heroes,
Ground Zero was their grave

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

Those firemen loaded up with gear
Climbed to their death's that day
Along with all the other hundreds
Blasted on their way
Police and EMS and those
On whom death took its toll
And more whose dreams will never dawn,
More than three thousand souls
I left the party after that
I could not stay my tears,
For all our gifts for all our hopes
For all our nameless fears
For all our heroes, men and women
Lost on that black day
Those firemen with courage
In their hearts so strong and brave,
Who made sure in their final hours
There were 30,000 saved.

They've gone to where there are no tears
And every heart is gay,
And they won't be forgotten on a sunny day

To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day.",Kingdom Come,2010
Joan Baez,"Oh fare thee well, I must be gone
And leave you for a while
Wherever I go, I will return
If I go ten thousand miles
If I go, if I go
If I go ten thousand miles

Oh, ten thousand miles it is so far
To leave me here alone
Well, I may lie, lament and cry
And you'll, you'll not hear my mourn
And you'll, no you'll
And you'll not hear my mourn

Oh, the crow that is so black, my love
Will change his color white
If ever I should prove false to thee
The day, day will turn to night
Yes the day, oh the day
Yes the day will turn to night

Oh, the rivers never will run dry
For the rocks melt with the sun

Till all, till all
Till all these things be done

Joan Baez,"There's a Vietnam Vet with a cardboard sign
Sitting there by the left turn line
The flag on his wheelchair flapping in the breeze
One leg missing and both hands free

No one?s paying much mind to him
The V.A. budget?s just stretched so thin
And now there's more coming back from the Mideast war
We can't make it here anymore

And that big ol? building was the textile mill
That fed our kids and it paid our bills
But they turned us out and they closed the doors
'Cause we can't make it here anymore

You see those pallets piled up on the loading dock
They're just gonna sit there ?til they rot
?Cause there's nothing to ship, nothing to pack
Just busted concrete and rusted tracks

Empty storefronts around the square
There's a needle in the gutter and glass everywhere
You don't come down here unless you're looking to score
We can't make it here anymore

The bar?s still open but man it?s slow
The tip jar?s light and the register?s low
The bartender don't have much to say
The regular crowd gets thinner each day

Some have maxed out all their credit cards
Some are working two jobs and living in cars
Minimum wage won't pay for a roof, won't pay for a drink
If you gotta have proof just try it yourself Mr. C.E.O.
See how far 5.15 an hour will go
Take a part time job at one your stores
I bet you can't make it here anymore

And there's a high school girl with a bourgeois dream
Just like the pictures in the magazine
She found on the floor of the laundromat
A woman with kids can forget all that

If she comes up pregnant what'll she do
Forget the career and forget about school
Can she live on faith? Live on hope?
High on Jesus or hooked on dope
When it?s way too late to just say no
You can't make it here anymore

Now I'm stocking shirts in the Wal-Mart store
Just like the ones we made before
?Cept this one came from Singapore
I guess we can't make it here anymore

Should I hate a people for the shade of their skin
Or the shape of their eyes or the shape I'm in
Should I hate ?em for having our jobs today
No I hate the men sent the jobs away

I can see them all now, they haunt my dreams
All lily white and squeaky clean
They've never known want, they'll never know need
Their shit don't stink and their kids won't bleed
Their kids won't bleed in their damn little war
And we can't make it here anymore

Will I work for food, will I die for oil
Will kill for power and to us the spoils
The billionaires get to pay less tax
The working poor get to fall through the cracks

So let ?em eat jellybeans let ?em eat cake
Let ?em eat shit, whatever it takes
They can join the Air Force or join the Corps
If they can't make it here anymore

So that's how it is, that's what we got
If the president wants to admit it or not
You can read it in the paper, read it on the wall
Hear it on the wind if you're listening at all
Get out of that limo, look us in the eye
Call us on the cell phone tell us all why

In Dayton Ohio or Portland Maine
Or a cotton gin out on the great high plains
That's done closed down along with the school
And the hospital and the swimming pool

Dust devils dance in the noonday heat
There's rats in the alley and trash in the street
Gang graffiti on a boxcar door
We can't make it here anymore

CHORUS:
Well I'm a rake and ramblin' boy.
There's many a city I did enjoy,
And now I've married me a pretty little wife
And I love her dearer than I love my life.

Oh, she was pretty, both neat and gay
Caused me to rob the broad highway
Oh, yes, I robbed it, I do declare.
And I got myself ten thousand bail.

Chorus

Oh when I die don't bury me at all
Place my bones in alcohol
And at my feet place a snow white dove
To let the world know I died for love.

Well I'm a rake and a ramblin' boy.
There's many a city I did enjoy,
And now I've married me a pretty little wife
And I love her dearer than I love my life.

",Rake & Rambling Boy,2013
Joan Baez,"Some of them were dreamers
And some of them were fools
Who were making plans and thinking of the future
With the energy of the innocent
They were gathering the tools
They would need to make their journey back to nature
While the sand slipped through the opening
And their hands reached for the golden ring
With their hearts they turned to each other's hearts for refuge
In the troubled years that came before the deluge

Some of them knew pleasure
And some of them knew pain
And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered
And on the brave and crazy wings of youth
They went flying around in the rain
And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered
And in the end they traded their tired wings
For the resignation that living brings
And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow
For the glitter and the rouge
And in a moment they were swept before the deluge

Let the music keep our spirits high
Let the buildings keep our children dry
Let creation reveal its secrets by and by, by and by
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky

Some of them were angry
At the way the earth was abused
By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power
And they struggled to protect her from them
Only to be confused
By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour
And when the sand was gone and the time arrived
In the naked dawn only a few survived
And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge
Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge

Let the music keep our spirits high
Let the buildings keep our children dry
Let creation reveal it's secrets by and by, by and by

Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared,
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know

And a fighter by his trade

Joan Baez,"Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto

I've been ridin' them blind passengers way down the road
I've been ridin' them dead enders, flat wheelers, kickin' up cinders
I've been havin' some hard travelin', Lord

I've been hittin' some hard rock man and I thought you know
I've been leanin' on the pressured grill way down the road

Six feet of mud and a shovel muggin'
I've been havin' some hard travelin', Lord

Well I've been layin' in a hard rock jail I thought you know
I've been layin' there ninety days way down the road
And a mean old judge said to me it's ninety days for vagrancy
And I've been havin' some hard travelin' Lord

I've been workin' at Pittsburgh Steel I thought you know
I've been dumpin' that red hot slag way down the road
I've been blastin', I've been firin', I've been a pourin' that red hot iron
And I've been a havin' some hard travelin', Lord

I've been hittin' some hard harvest and I thought you know
North Dakota to Kansas City way down the road
Cuttin' that wheat and stackin' that hay
And tryin' to make 'bout a dollar a day
And I've been a havin' some hard travelin', Lord

Well I've been workin' on Lincoln Highway I thought you know
I've been hitchin' on 66 way down the road
Heavy load and worried mind lookin' for a woman that's hard to find

Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
Safe from all that wind and snow

You'll find no policemen there

Joan Baez,"I've got to know, yes, I've got to know, friend;
Hungry lips ask me wherever I go!
Comrades and friends all falling around me
I've got to know, yes, I've got to know.

Why do your war boats ride on my waters?
Why do your death bombs fall from my skies?
Why do you burn my farm and my town down?
I've got to know, friend, I've got to know!

What makes your boats haul death to my people?
Nitro blockbusters, big cannons and guns?
Why doesn't your ship bring food and some clothing?
I've sure got to know, folks, I've sure got to know!

Why can't my two hands get a good pay job?
I can still plow, plant, I can still sow!
Why did your lawbook chase me off my good land?
I'd sure like to know, friend, I've just got to know!

What good work did you do, sir, I'd like to ask you,
To give you my money right out of my hands?
I built your big house here to hide from my people,
Why you crave to hide so, I'd love to know!

You keep me in jail and you lock me in prison,
Your hospital's jammed and your crazyhouse full,
What made your cop kill my trade union worker?
You'll hafta talk plain 'cause I sure have to know!

Why can't I get work and cash my big paycheck?
Why can't I buy things in your place and your store?
Why do you close my plant down and starve all my buddies?
I'm asking you, sir, 'cause I've sure got to know!

Joan Baez,"It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road
Out of your Dust Bowl and westward we rolled
And your deserts were hot and your mountain was cold

I worked in your orchards of peaches and prunes
Slept on the ground in the light of your moon
On the edge of the city you'll see us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind

California and Arizona, I make all your crops
And its North up to Oregon to gather your hops
Dig the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light sparkling wine

Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
Every state in this Union us migrants have been
We'll work in this fight and we'll fight till we win

Well, it's always we rambled, that river and I
All along your green valley, I will work till I die
My land I'll defend with my life if it be
'Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free",Pastures of Plenty,2017

Be of good heart evermore

Have been a way to pass your time

But I came home late and there it sat
You rose to show what hats are for

They flood with dreams and they drift away
They cling to logs and cupboard doors
While riding out this civil war

Fighters came and they pitched a tent
And everyone around here went
The fix was in, we bet and we swore
From both sides of a civil war

We call our little mob a town
We nail a sign above the door

Joan Baez,"Oh, I have myself a silver blade
The edges sharp, the handle bone
Little thing of silver made
Now it's the only thing I own
Once I knew a lordling fine
I heard him whistle as he rode
And I was bold to call him mine
The shoes upon his horse were gold, shoes were gold

One look into my eyes and he
Bid me climb onto his horse
He asked if I'd his lady be
And come away for ever more?
He spoke of love songs at each kiss
And I who was a young girl then
Was promised every young girl's bliss
Got up and rode away with him, away with him

He took me to his castle tall
With promises and jewels until
He led me through his castle hall
And took my clothes and worked his will
And when he had and I lay there
From my head with a silver blade
He cut a lock of my cold black hair
And bid me dress and go my way, go my way

But when I marked the silver blade
And where he said it when he did
And when his back was turned away
I buried it beneath his ribs
I used my dagger as a spade
Where the thorns and lilacs grow
I cut the ground into a grave
In a place that even God don't know

And every evening I returned
To the place for him I chose
Until his skin had turned to worms
Wild dogs scattered around his bones
And all I have of what I was
Is the memory of a maid
Who mistook a thief for love
But who gained a silver blade, silver blade",Silver Blade,2018
Joan Baez,"I remember driving down the rutted roads late at night 
Following the summer moon, bright as any pair of headlights 
I felt the air on my face and the night pressed inside my palm 
A moment captured in a place this memory stays strong

Oh my darling, oh my love 
Oh my darling, oh my love 
Oh my darling, oh my love 
The things that we are made of

And I remember feeling, I'm alive and in no need of saviors 
If the past's another country, I'm at the border with my papers 
Where is your heart if not inside you, where is home, or are you lost?
Where is love if not beside you? 
I had no answers but they let me cross

Oh my darling, oh my love 
Oh my darling, oh my love 
Oh my darling, oh my love 
The things that we are made of

Like the silence of my shadow when the twilight world is calling 
The loneliness that knows me by the cadence of my walking 
And the scar upon my elbow and the sound of my own breathing 
My reflection in a window and the way I'm always leaving 

And I remember wishing for some other life than this one I've claimed 
How often have I been convinced how eagerly I'd make that trade 
Then all at once I see your face and the summer night and the open door 
Dimmer now but not erased and I know what these are for

But I dreamed someday I'd go
Where the blue eyed girls and red guitars 
And the naked rivers flow

I'm not all I thought I'd be

And I've been as far as Mercy and Grand
Frozen to the ground

I can't stay here and I'm scared to leave
So kiss me once and then 
I'll go to hell
I might as well 
Be whistlin' down the wind

The buses at the corner
The clock on the wall
Broken down windmill
There's ain't wind at all

And I've yelled and I' cursed
If I stay here I'll rust
I'm stuck like a shipwreck
Out here in the dust

The sky is red, and the world is on fire
And the corn is taller than me
And the dog is tied to a wagon of rain
And the road as wet as the sea

Sometimes the music from a dance
Will carry across the plains
The places I've been dreaming of
Dream only of your face

There are places where they never sleep
And the circus never ends

And be whistlin' down the wind

Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is

Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is

I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

These are always the hardest to forget
All the old friends and the loved ones
These are the people you haven't even met

Looking back at what there will be

There's no real sanity just plain confusion

Well I don't know just how I feel 
All I know that I love you girl (what is real)
It's so real, so real, surreal

Here we go
There is no single circumstance I never took a final chance
I made it something that you can see and touch forever
I always looked the same from every angle and never cast a shadow
That would change the way you thought about your very being
That what what you were seeing would always be
Would always be
Would always be the truth

Just another victim of the...victim of the ghetto
Just another victim, that's how it goes, ooh

Heavy foot traffic jam the hallway all day
Adolescence workin' for small pay
World so little, he could never leave his block
His home full of riddle, so he always need his glock
He coast with his eye open, keep his metal smokin'
Young wasted minds, fiendin' on dimes, cokin'
Forgot kids quick to break rules, and known to make fools
Out of many, down the streets be more safe than school
There's no diploma, that can break him from the coma
A bloody war in the country, the youth hungry
On the corner, hyenas amongst me
Yabbin' 'bout the stories, they be hearin', always swearin'
Can't even spell the shit that he be wearin'
Caught up in the silk web of material
Superficial stains ya brain tissue, that's the issue
The young is lost at their own cost, dreamin'
Screamin' how we never hold positions, that's the meanin'
Brothers of murder victims share the same grief
The elderly shake their head in disbelief
And no relief came till I aimed
And blast one shot and left my name
The GZA... 

[Chorus:]

My residence is a city where army veterans smoke rocks
On torn down blocks, drug spots set out their shops
And cops watch, innocent niggaz roam in flocks
Romanism in tops, papers and knots
Churches and liquor stores on every corner, plot to get money not
Some funny niggaz act like they could pop glocks and those who can't cop
Sisters givin' up ass a lot, brothers givin' up cash a lot
They be strugglin' to become someone because their parents not
Just another victim of the ghetto, where lost minds settle
When the devil uncivils society and die free
With double 'W' followed by J-D around the necks
And wrists the God is now a dog, the earth is called a bitch
And all my people wish to get rich in this wilderness
To push a Lexus, ice on everythin' from rings and bracelets to the necklaces
Children molested within these pest infested buildings
Thieves uneducated in these schools, paint on the ceilings
Peelin' off, but all I see is lost black babies callin'
""Please somebody save me, please somebody save me""

Crystal ringlets paint a picture of a gold sunrise above

Little girl you're sad
Though all you have
Is visible to you
Within your heart
There stays a part
That like the sky is blue

Shifting breezes, grace the inner spectrum of your glance
Leaves on branches, for your pleasure, perform a soothing dance

Little girl it seems
In all my dreams
Your happiness is due
But still they last
Their in your past
Events that make you blue

Thoughts of love are in your mind
Yet splintered hopes push them aside
A look at life is what you need to try

In an instant there'll be sunshine
Sprinkled every place
Drops of rain will kiss the softness of your lovely face

Show yourself you care
Let others care for you

Oh let me go, let me go

It's just no good, I've got to tell you
Oh oh, an' I will now
Just say goodbye and wish me well
I've had my fill so
Go find somebody new to
Play your tricks on, put your fix on
I hope you get what you deserve you bugger




",Let Me Go,1981
Joan Jett,"(Gentry-Levine)

I know you know
Everybody knows it's true
I'm in love
But it's only make believe to you

I love your love
All the things that lovers do now, baby
I can tell
That's it's only make believe to you

I said uh-huh uh-huh uh
It's only make believe to you, yeah
It's only make believe
You're drivin' me insane
It's only make believe to you, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I can't stand the pain

I kiss you kiss
But I ain't gettin' through
No, I don't
'Cause it's only make believe to you

I cry, oh my
But you ain't cryin' too now, baby
No, you don't
'Cause it's only make believe to you

I said uh-huh uh-huh uh
It's only make believe to you, yeah
It's only make believe
You're drivin' me insane
It's only make believe to you, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I can't stand the pain

Make believe to you love
Make believe to you love

It's only, it's only
Make believe to you, love
It's only, it's only
Make believe to you, love
