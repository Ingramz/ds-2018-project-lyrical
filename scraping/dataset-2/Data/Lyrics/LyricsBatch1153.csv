The Kills,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",Crazy,2012
The Kills,"Baby save it, we're wasted
I know we gotta slow it down
But when the waves come, you face them
And you know we can't stop it now

Heads up we're in a dead club
Put your hands up and do your dipsy and dropsy
And line up, we're hanging up
We're double sixing it, night after night
Doing it to death
Doing it to death

Baby lately the plans we're making
Are the shape of things that never come
Hold your horses, the lights up
Can't feel it coming back around

Listen up, it's picking up
Put your hands up and do your kicksy and lipsy
Your times up, we're hanging up
We're double sixing it, night cause tonight
We're doing it to death
Doing it to death

We're double sixing it night after night after night 
We're double sixing it night after night after night

The Kills,"Cut your branches at the root
That long have grown that bitter fruit
Cut your branches at the root
That only gave me bitter fruit

I was conceived in a red cage, from a wild love
I am the seed of a dead age, gone viral
Those feelings I've tried to shake, all my life long
But the demons I'm keeping are hard to face
When you hide them, so long

I gotta cut you at the root
I gotta save my soul from the bad in you
I gotta cut you through and through
You only ever gave me bitter fruit

Oh and it grew like a shockwave
And I was blindsided, oh oh
The fruit that your love gave
Poisoned my mind up, oh oh

I cut your branches at the root
I gotta save my soul from the things you do
I cut your branches through and through
But still I only taste that bitter fruit

Down to the bone
All my love was cut in a single blow
Gone, and I know
All my love was cut in the seed I sowed

I could pray, but can't you see
The kind of things I pray for are cursing me
I could pray, but can't you see
The kind of things I pray for
The kind of things I need

I cut your branches at the root
That only ever gave me bitter fruit
I cut your branches through and through
But still I only taste that bitter fruit

I could pray, but can't you see

The Kills,"One hit, one invention
You must pay your ransom
Love, lust, you're too handsome
Fairytales are fair game

The world is looking for you
Sharpening its blade
London's bloodthirsty
Paris is a vein, open
A vein on the pulse of mean

Ain't doing me good,
I can feel it in my blood
Thunderstruck
Wheels spun

Always looking,
Never found
How I'm keeping
My head down
These days of why and how
Get so hard,
I'm not saying another word

When I hear your name
It's like a freight train
Shake shake shake shake
Shaking me
Off my tracks

The one acting
The fool is nigh
I can feel it in my heart
Silence is the loudest shot,
A train passing in the dark
All I do is wonder why,
Why and how
you leave me every night
Oh, oh

Feel the same as when viewing a mountain range
And when questioning how man forms mal-intent
I wonder ""Might refuge exist for estranged?""
I tire of sheepish; admire the wolf
I don't care if it's lonely
I must become so wholly wolvish, naturally free
Wolvish, eerily calm in lunacy
I must go
Off alone in wild
Where I just might escape my restraints
But what of the other?
Could I endure the cold thought of
Never seeing her 'gain?
Though there is madness here
She is least one shining brilliance
To challenge the splendour of that glorious mountain range
A care so tender it gets me rethinking
My hopeless appraisals of our society
Oh, could I endure a life lived without her, in the wild?
(Oh, could you be wolvish?
Oh, could you become wholly the wolvish?)
Would it be selfish
Or best for us all
If I become so
Wholly the wolvish one?",Wolvish,2014

The King Blues,"If I threw a brick through the window of Nike Town
They'd probably stamp it with a tick, sell it back to me marked down
Or maybe take the footage caught on CCTV
Throw in a hip hop sound track, stamp their logo and sell me
They'll buy up all the forests, package up the trees
Advertise the air,start charging me to breathe
Or maybe they'll buy babies and give them corporate names
Like Little Baby Big Mac, or Finger Licking James
The irony is, this rhyme don't exist without a label
But things ain't as black and white as they were in the cradle
Let go of the fable, breathe, my chest ain't so tight
And I'm getting everything when I just step into the light
It's like all we built society around was a lie
Made it way too complicated, fed on fear and we tried
To blow up insecurities, pretend we have the answer
Had to make my own mistakes to see the fakeness in the adverts
Had to live that life before saying ""fuck the glamour""
Because money can't buy happiness, man that should be our banner
Had to stop, meditate and listen, had to give back instead of counting what I'm given
Had to realise that dropping out was really winning
Had to have everything I built blow up like demolition
No more heading for collision if I only learn to give
And learn to live simply, that all may simply live

I'll be cursed by what I'm spitting if I follow my own ego
I'll be worse off living, not appreciating zero
I know it 'cause I done it, got the tale to tell
Seen and rocked a thousand faces then been miserable as hell
When I achieved my dreams it never satisfied me
I just wanted more, couldn't see the wood for the trees
More likes, more fans, how many friends can I collect?
How many records can I sell? But numbers, are infinite
I was only focusing on what I can get
But the irony is, when I don't think of it
I find joy and reflect, my time spent was a waste
'Cause the universe works in mysterious ways
Success has never brought me any kind of peace
And trying to control everything just brought me to my knees
So now I'm buying in, trying to find serenity
Putting pen to paper, giving the best of me

So now I know, the only thing I know, is that I don't know nothing
Been given a millionth chance to make myself something
I'm on my knees praying that I can see the light
'Cause it takes a bigger man to walk away from the fight
It takes a bigger man who's been wronged to do right
It takes a bigger man to not react when they're talking shite
So I humble myself and may God bear witness
'Cause what other people think of me ain't none of my business
I was clouded, but now I seek forgiveness
I seek a way out of my insanity and sickness
Used to say ""take pride in being whoever the fuck you want to be""
Now I take pride in my mistakes and in saying I'm sorry
I take pride in my failures, it means ""I tried something new""
And maybe next time I'll get it if I keep pushing through
So now I'm back and I'm better than ever no gimmicks
That machine kills fascists and this microphone kills cynics

Now I tap into a spirit that I have been given
Find inspiration like these verses were pre-written
Drop the attitude, find gratitude in all I've been given
Letting go of the resentment, now my soul is singing
No more imagined enemies, I have no opponents
I'm getting to know myself, I'm present in the moment
Now I'm present to the gift of the words I've spoken
I will show myself not hide behind these slogans
I'm unbroken, seeing what's important
I don't care about approval, don't care about endorsements
Ain't hiding behind the chattering of my mind
And when I lose my chains it's amazing what I find
Now I'm back on my grind, I'm back on a mission
Saw a couple shooting stars fly by now I'm wishing
I won't get lost again now I've reappeared
I will stay true to myself and I will show no fear

So tell me, tell me, tell me why
I'm left so unsatisfied
The more I seek, the less I find
Love is more than I can buy
So tell me, tell me, tell me why

Tell me, tell me, tell me why
I'm left so unsatisfied
The more I seek, the less I find
Love is more than I can buy
So tell me, tell me, tell me why",Nike Town,

Gave her my e-mail address and an alias name
And they tell me take it easy but I can't help it
I want more green than the Boston Celtics
Let a true nigga breathe don't be selfish

But I see you with no straps like low-top Air Force Ones
And you hollerin' bout money ain't got no funds
And you rappin' on beats using pots for ya drums
And you'll never see me with ya bitch
Oh I got the hoe with me, you just can't see through the tint

The only cap you pop is off a bottle of Pepsi
I got enough waves for you to ride on jet skis
And fuck a bodyguard I let the tech protect me

Say you got skills ha bitch keep frontin'
And I'll carve ya face up like a Halloween Pumpkin

Each sweetheart has heard with a sigh
Over high garden walls this sweet echo falls
As a soldier boy whispers goodbye

Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu
When the clouds roll by I'll come to you
Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in Lover's Lane, my dearie

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Every tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

Though goodbye means the birth of a teardrop
Hello means the birth of a smile
And the smile will erase the tear blighting trace
When we meet in the after awhile

Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu
When the clouds roll by I'll come to you

The King's Men,"There's many a man that rode a horse across the western 
Plain There's never been one like the Irishman 
O'Sullivan was his name.

He never packed a shooting iron 
The need he never felt 
With two shillelaghs always hanging there
A'hanging on his belt.
O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko 
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

(Har the shillelagh. 
You know we call it the Tipperary rifle. 
You never have to reload it.)

This bronco-busting Irishman 
From the heart of Erin's Isle it was after living peaceful, like
He always wore a smile.
But when the smile was leaving him
In a fight he'd 
Come unwound Bad cess for any crossing him
They'd wind up on the ground.

O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

(Why he was so strong was Sullivan, 
He could put his right hand in his own left pocket, 
And hold himself out at arm's
Length. No man could do that. 
It's O'Sullivan I'm talking 
About. Oh, well he could.)

At throwing the rope for branding calf
He was a mighty man
At throwing his two shillelaghs now
The fastest in the land.
T'would be a sad mistake me boys
To reach for a 44
Before you could get the hammer cocked
He'd have you on 
The floor.
O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

(Did you know O'Sullivan played the Irish Harp? 
No. Oh, sure, and he did. 
He put 75 strings on his two shillelaghs,
He'd stretch them out 24 feet,and he had four leprechauns
Dancing on them to make the music. 
Oh, the wonder of it. Sure and he would charm the coyotes out of the hills)

Across the range from morn 'til night
He rode for days
And days
A'fixin' fences here and there
And a picking 
Up the strays.

A cattle spread he really built
As big as Ireland
Where he could range a million head
And a 
Shamrock be his brand.
O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

A bit of his lip, he back of his hand, 
And the toe of his shoe to boot. 
Oh, Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan.

(Now if you're ever riding through the sagebrush wilderness,
And you suddenly come upon acres and acres of shamrock sprinkled with stardust, 
Well, you'll be after knowing,
That you've just arrived at the O Sullivan spread,
Known has the Lazy Leprachauns. 
Stop in, won't you? 
Sure, and they'll give you a belt of Bushmill's.)",Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan,2009

But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair,
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared,

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.

Count your blessings to find what you look for.
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,

Fare thee well, my own true love. I'm leavin' the first hour of the morn.
I'm bound off for the bay of Mexico and maybe the coast of Californ.

Chorus:
So, fare thee well, my own true love. We'll meet another day, another time.
It's not the leavin' that's grievin' me, but my true love who's bound to stay behind.

The weather is against me and the wind blows hard and the rain, she's a-turnin' into hail,
But I still might strike it lucky on a highway going West or ridin' on a fast movin' train.

I'll write you a letter from time to time. As I ramble you can travel with me, too.
With my hands in my head and my heart, my love, I will send what I know back home to you.
This line above doesn't seem to make much sense
(Chorus)

There's a place I've heard of where I might as well go. It's down in the heart of Mexico.
They say that the people are all friendly down there. All they ask of you is your name.

I'll tell you of the laughter and the troubles be their somebody else's or my own.
With my hands in my pocket and my coat collar high, I will travel unnoticed and unknown.

(Chorus)

Chorus:
I have been a rover. I have walked alone. Hiked a hundred highways. Never found a home.
Still and all, I'm happy. The reason is, you see, once in a while, along the way, love's been good to me.

There was a girl in Denver before the summer's storm. Oh, her eyes were tender. Oh, her arms were warm,
And she could smile away the thunder. Kiss away the rain and even though she's gone away, you won't hear me complain.

(Chorus)

There was a girl in Portland before the winter chill. We use to go a-courtin' along October hill,
And she could laugh away the dark clouds. Cry away the snow. It seems like only yesterday as down the road I go.

(Chorus)

Once in a while along the way, love's been good to me.

I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn

Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

He rode easy in the saddle. He was tall and lean, and at first you'd a-thought nothing but a streak of mean could make a man look so down right strong, but one look in his eyes and you knowed you was wrong. He was a mountain of a man, and I want you to know. He could preach hot hell or freezin' snow. He carried a Bible in a canvas sack and folks just called him The Reverend Mr. Black. He was poor as a beggar, but he rode like a king. Sometimes in the evening, I'd hear him sing:

[Chorus:]
I gotta walk that lonesome valley. I got to walk it by myself. Oh nobody else can walk it for me. I got to walk it by myself.

You got to walk that lonesome valley. You got to walk it by yourself. Oh nobody else can walk it for you. You got to walk it by yourself.
If ever I could have thought this man in black was soft and had any yellow up his back, I gave that notion up the day a lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray. Yeah, he kicked open the meeting house door and he cussed everybody up and down the floor! Then, when things got quiet in the place, he walked up and cusses in the preacher's face! He hit that Reverend like a kick of a mule and to my way of thinkin' it took a real fool to turn the other face to that lumber jack, but that's what he did, The Reverend Mr. Black. He stood like a rock, a man among men and he let that lumberjack hit him again, and then with a voice as quiet as could be, he cut him down like a big oak tree when he said:

[Chorus]

It's been many years since we had to part and I guess I learned his ways by heart. I can still hear his sermon's ring, down in the valley where he used to sing. I followed him, yes, sir, and I don't regret it and I hope I will always be a credit to his memory 'cause I want you to understand. The Reverend Mr. Black was my old man!

This land is your land. This land is my land from California to the New York island,
From the red wood forest to the Gulf stream waters. This land was made for you and me.

As I was walkin' that ribbon of a highway, I saw above me that endless skyway.
I saw below me that golden valley. This land was made for you and me.

I roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps to the sparklin' sands of her diamond desert
And all around me a voice was sounding, ""This land was made for you and me.""

As the fog was lifting a voice was calling, ""This land was made for you and me.""

When he got there the conductor told him, ""one more nickel""
Charlie couldn't get off of that train!

But did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (poor old Charlie)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned

Now, all night long Charlie rides through the station
Crying, ""what will become of me?
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea
Or my cousin in Roxbury?""

But did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (shame and scandal)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned

Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square station
Every day at quarter past two
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich
As the train comes rumbling through!

But did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (he may ride forever)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned
Pick it Davey

Kinda hurts my figers

Now, you citizens of Boston, don't you think it's a scandal
How the people have to pay and pay?
Fight the fare increase, vote for George O'Brian
Get poor Charlie off the MTA!

Or else he'll never return
No he'll never return and his fate is still unlearned (just like Paul Revere)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned

Chorus:
Irene, goodnight. Irene, goodnight Goodnight, Irene. Goodnight, Irene. I'll see you in my dreams.

Last Saturday night I got married. Me and my wife settled down.
Now, me and my wife are parted. Gonna take a little stroll downtown.

(Chorus)

Yeah, sometimes I live in the country and sometimes I live in town.
Yeah, and sometimes I take a great notion I'm gonna jump in the river and drown.

Stop ramblin'. Stop that gamblin'. Stop staying out late at night.
Go home to your wife and family. Stay there by the fireside, bright.

If today was not an endless highway. If tonight was not a crooked trail.
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all.

Chorus:
Yes' 'n' only if my own true love was waiting; if I could hear her heart softly pounding.
Only if she were lying by me, I'd lie in my bed once again.

I can't see my reflection in the water. Can't speak the sounds that show no pain.
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps. Can't remember the sound of my own name.

(Chorus)

There's beauty in the silver singing river. There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky.
But none of these and nothing else can match the beauty that I remember in my true love's eyes.

And I heard my child in prayer
""Please bring me some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair""

Searched all night, my heart was aching
Just before the dawn was breaking

I peeped in, and on her bed
In gay profusion lying there
Scarlet ribbons, lovely ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

If I live to be a hundred
I will never know from where
Came those ribbons, lovely ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

And who's goin' to hold you to his breast?

Seven starving sailors sold their summer homes in Saginaw to search for something better in Rangoon (in Rangoon)
Down where Salty Sam from Turkistan had organized a marching band of Mau Maus in the Crazy Horse Saloon.
They harmonized together singing verses of the netherworld of darkness in an unfamiliar tune
And before the night was over they was a-floatin' down the river with their belly buttons winkin' at the moon.

Chorus:
Oh, isn't it the same the whole world over? People seem to go from bad to worse.
Whether you're a fighter or a lover, Gypsy Rose and I don't give a curse.

Seven sorry sisters from the Sun Canal sorority went strolling on a summer afternoon
Down where little Ricky Vanderpool would work his way through Sunday school playing his electricfied kazoo
They'd hide their best to back it, not intending to distract it, singing seven kinds of sorry out of tune,
And before the night was over they was a-floatin' down the river with their belly buttons winkin' at the moon.

When Jesse James was a lad he killed many-a man. He robbed the Glendale train.
And the people they did say for many miles away. It was robbed by Frank and Jesse James.

[Chorus]
Poor Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life, three children, they were brave.
But that dirty little coward who shot Mister Howard has laid poor Jesse in his grave.

It was on a Saturday night if I remember right when they robbed that Glendale train.
It was one of the Younger boys who gathered in the spoils and he carried Jesse's monies away.

[Chorus]

He was standin' on a chair just a-dustin' pictures there. 
He thought he heard a noise (Yeah, what did he do?)
When he turned his head around, 
Why that bullet smacked him down and it laid poor Jesse on the floor.

[Chorus]

Jesse robbed from the poor and he gave to the rich. He never did a friendly thing.
And when his best friend died he was right there by her side 
And he lifted off her golden wedding ring.

Chorus:
Last night I had the strangest dream I never dreamed before. I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war.

I dreamed I saw a mighty room and the room was filled with men
And the papers they were signing said they'd never fight again
And when the papers were all signed and a million copies made,
They all joined hands and bowed their heads and grateful prayers were raised
And the people in the streets below were dancing 'round and 'round
And guns and swords and uniforms were scattered on the ground.

(Chorus)

The Kingston Trio,"Love's is but the song we sing and fear's the way we die.
You can make the mountains ring or make the angels cry.
Know the dove is on the wing and you need not know why.

[Chorus]
C'mon, people. Smile on your brother. Hey, let's get together and love one another right now.

Some may come and some may go and we shall surely pass.
When the one who left us here returns for us at last.
We are just a moment's sunlight, fading on the grass.

[Chorus]

If you hear the song I sing, then you must understand,
You hold the key to love and fear. It's in your trembling hand.
One key unlocks them both, you know, and it's at your command.

Love's is but the song we sing and fear's the way we die.
You can make the mountains ring or make the angels cry.
Know the dove is on the wing and you need not know why.

The Kingston Trio,"Ten years ago on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed in the townhall light
There were few at the scene
But they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The judge said, 'Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
Then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word though it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil,1995

We could capture for the Queen

And deep within its side the tides of night alone reveal
El Diego's hidden cave where we'll plunder the riches of Grenada
While the Spaniard, blind with pleasure
Plays ashore in Ensenada

We will sail before the dawn along the coast of California

And our map is clearly drawn to the dark and stormy shore

Is attempting to levy a burdensome tax on the population in the form of a subway fare increase

And he changed for Jamaica Plain

Crying, ""what will become of me?
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea
Or my cousin in Roxbury?""

No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (shame and scandal)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston

Every day at quarter past two
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich

No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (he may ride forever)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston

A rollin' stone gathers no moss. (Repeat) So, as far as I can see, I guess I was meant to be just a rollin' stone.

A rollin' stone gathers no moss. A rollin' stone hasn't a boss.
Just like a Spring or a Summer's breeze, I can roll just where I please. I'm just a rollin' stone.

Can't lose my way, all directions are the same when I'm a-travelin'. I've got no home, sweet home.
Just keep boppin', never stoppin', couldn't even if I wanted to, I've got to roam and roll.

A rollin' stone gathers no moss. A rollin' stone's like that coin that you toss.
But I don't need level ground. I can roll up hill or down. I'm just a rollin' stone.

When I'm travelin', all directions are the same. A string unravelin', I don't think that I'm to blame.

Some might think my life's a loss. A rollin' stone never gets lost.
So, I'll just keep playin' it straight 'til I roll right through that gate. I'm just a rollin' stone.
A rollin' stone. (Repeat and fade)

Ruby red were her lips. Diamond pure was her heart. Emerald green (emerald green) were her eyes.

He built up a barn for to keep his cow warm and a drop of good cider will do us no harm.

I lingered there and lost myself in dreams.

We parted strangers, thoughtless and free 
And set our hearts to wandering aimlessly.

How seldom love has come to me.

Ah, yes, he did her wrong long years ago and she comes up at night to tell him so,

With her head tucked underneath her arm she walks the bloody tower,
With her head tucked underneath her arm at the midnight hour.

She comes to haunt King Henry. She means giving him what for. Gadzooks, she's going to tell him off. She's feeling very sore,
And just in case the headsman wants to give her an encore, she's has her head tucked underneath her arm.

The sentries think that it's a football that she carries in and when they had a few they shout, ""Is Army going to win?""
They think that it's Red Grange instead of poor old Ann Bolyn with her head tucked underneath her arm.

The headsman craves the joint and cuts the bread then in comes Anne Bolyn to queer the do.
She holds her head up with a wild war whoop and Henry cries, ""Don't drop it in the soup!""

Well, the Goo Ga Gee is a mighty funny bird. He sings the best song that you ever, ever heard.
He learned this song from a little baby 'cause ev'ry little baby goes ""Goo ga gee.""

Well, the Goo Ga Gee is from the Milky Way. It flies down to earth ev'ry other day.
It hides in the corner where you can not see and as he flies away he sings, ""Goo ga gee.""

Well, the Goo Goo Ga Ga, Goo Goo Ga Ga, Goo Ga Gee, the Goo Ga Gee is the bird for me
And if you think my song is a little crazy, it's only 'cause you never sing the Goo Ga Gee.

Six counties are under John Bull's tyranny
So, we gave up our boyhood to drill and to train
To play our own part in the patriot game

It's barely two years since they wandered away
And it was with the local battalion of the bold IRA
For they'd read of our heroes and they wanted the same
To play their own part in the patriot game

Who bargained in souls
I wish that my rifle
Had given the same

When I was a little boy, my mother said to me, ""Watch the new born roses grow. It's a pretty sight to see.
You, my son, shall blossom as the flower below. I will be your raindrops. You will be my rose.

Listen while I tell you of the beauty in the sky. There's a home for angels on the clouds so high.
I must be an angel. In heaven I shall stay. If you ever need me, I'll hear each word you say.""

(I find that extremely offensive!) So did Old Paint.
But there were no gals for miles around, not one gal in the whole darn town.
So, if you want to go dancin', just look around for the next best thing that can be found.

That's right. 
I soon found there wasn't no women nowhere. 
Fellows goin' to the dance was takin' some of the strangest things. 
One was takin' a broom, all dressed up in a pinafore, bleached straws, looked kinda cheap to me. Another was totin' a picture of a girl. 
He'd been goin' with that picture so long he thought real girls folded in the middle.

Had little eyes, curly tail, and the dearest little pointed ears you ever seen.

Shut up when he's a-talkin'!) and we wobbled into the dance.

Only forty-four were saved
'Twas the last day of October
They saved forty-four

Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

Of that cold and watery night

And they waited for a fight
Then a whine and a rock
And a great explosion's roar
They lay the Reuben James
On that cold ocean floor

Oh, tell me, what were their names,
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

Oh, tell me, what were their names,
Tell me, what were their names?

Many years have passed
Since those brave men are gone
Those cold, icy waters,
They're still and they're calm
Many years have passed
And still I wonder why
The worst of men must fight
And the best of men must die!

Tell me, what were their names?

Who come with faces wan
From farm stead and from Fisher's cot
Along the banks of Ban
They come with vengeance in their eyes,
Too late,
Too late are they,

Smiling, proud and young
About the hemp rope on his neck,
The golden ringlets clung
There was never a tear in his blue eyes,
Both glad and bright were they,
As young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome

When he last stepped up that street
His shining pike in hand
Around him marched in grim array
A stalwart earnest band
For Antrim Town!
For Antrim Town!
He led them to the fray,

There is never a one of all who die
Who bravely fell in fray
Than he who marches to his death

The Kingston Trio,"These are the times that try men's souls. In the course of our 
Nation's history the people of Boston 
Have rallied bravely whenever the rights of 
Men have been threatened. 
Today, a new crisis has arisen. 
The Metropolitan 
Transit Authority, better known as the M-T-A, 
Is attempting to levy a burdensome tax 
On the population in the form of a subway fare increase. 
Citizens, hear me out. 
This could happen to you!

Well, let me tell you of the story of a man named Charlie
On a tragic and fateful day
He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family
Went to ride on the M-T-A

Well did he ever return, no he never returned
And his fate is still unlearned (what a pity)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned

Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendall Square station
And he changed for Jamaica Plain
When he got there, the conductor told him ""one more nickel""
Charlie couldn't get off of that train.

But did he ever return, no he never returned
And his fate is still unlearned (poor old Charlie)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned

Now all night long Charlie rides through the station
Crying ""what will become of me?""
""How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea?""
""Or my cousin in Roxbury?""

But did he ever return, no he never returned
And his fate is still unlearned (shame and scandal)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned

Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square station
Every day at quarter past two
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich
As the train comes rumblin' through.

Well did he ever return, no he never returned
And his fate is still unlearned (he may ride forever)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned (pick it, Davey)

Now you citizens of Boston don't cha think it's a scandal
How the people have to pay and pay
Fight the fare increase, vote for George O'Brian!
Get poor Charlie off the M-T-A!

Or else he'll never return, no he'll never return
And his fate is still unlearned (just like always)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned
He's the man who never returned
He's the man who never returned",MTA/Tom Dooley,2004

Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard

And he looks up ladies dresses as they sadly pass him by
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life

If you covered him with garbage
George Sanders would still have style
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn round and smile
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
Cause she's not very tough
She should have been made of iron or steel
But she was only made of flesh and blood

Make your hair grow longer if you need it.

And I wish I could erase
I was standing on the street with a whole crowd of people

Spoke to or acknowledged me
I had no identity or individuality
No thoughts of my own, no mind or personality

Crushed people to acquire
Anything that I desired
Been deceitful and a liar
Now I'm facing Hell Fire
I can't believe that my time has come
For confessing all the evil
And the wrong that I've done
The reckoning's come
And now I'm just a no one
I confess to the timid and the meek
To the cripples and the beggars
And the tramps in the street
I confess my cruelty, my ego and conceit
I've opened up my body and looked inside
And I'm everything that I once despised
I confess for the thieves
The affected and deranged
I confess for the muggers and incurably insane
I confess to the ugly for being vain
I confess to those I hurt for causing them pain

And unemployment's no enjoyment,
Welfare State owned my mind and my body and my soul.
So I worked my way up to be a second-hand car spiv,

So don't double-cross me or my hoods will dissect you

I built an empire because I used my brains.

That running a multi-million corporation
Sure beats selling cars second-hand.

And the world is at my feet.

The Kinks,"When I was small I believed in Santa Claus
Though I knew it was my dad
And I would hang up my stocking at Christmas
Open my presents and I'd be glad

But the last time I played Father Christmas
I stood outside a department store
A gang of kids came over and mugged me
And knocked my reindeer to the floor

They said
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Don't give my brother a Steve Austin outfit
Don't give my sister a cuddly toy
We don't want a jigsaw or monopoly money
We only want the real mccoy

Father Christmas, give us some money
We'll beat you up if you make us annoyed
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys

But give my daddy a job 'cause he needs one
He's got lots of mouths to feed
But if you've got one I'll have a machine gun
So I can scare all the kids on the street

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Have yourself a merry merry Christmas
Have yourself a good time
But remember the kids who got nothin'
While you're drinkin' down your wine

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
Father Christmas, please hand it over
We'll beat you up so don't make us annoyed

Wish I could cure this infernal allergy 
I got, hay fever blocking up my brain 
Hay fever, feel the sinus pains 
And all the pills and the powders are in vain 
Thought I was cured but here it comes again 
It goes ooh-ah 

The pollen count's getting higher and higher 
My eyes are sore and my nose is on fire 
My throat's dry now and I'm starting to perspire 
My stuffed up head's killing all of my desire

Hay fever, you put the curse on me 
And I've inhaled every know remedy

I can't make love when I can't hardly breathe 
We start to dance and my nose starts to bleed 
There must be a cure for this hay fever 
Is there a pill or a powder I can take 
I must get a cure, for my romance is at stake

Hey fever, I must look like a clown 
I must have used every tissue in town

And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are
There are starts in every city
In every house and on every street
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete

Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard
But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom
Because she wanted to be alone

Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

Rudolph Valentino looks very much alive
And he looks up ladies dresses as they sadly pass him by
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
Cause he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life

If you covered him with garbage
George Sanders would still have style
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn round and smile
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
Cause she's not very tough
She should have been made of iron or steel
But she was only made of flesh and blood

And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are
And those who are successful
Be always on your guard

And celluloid heroes never really die

The Kinks,"Haven't you noticed a kind of madness in my eyes? 
It's only me, dear, in my midnight disguise. 
Pay no attention if I crawl across the room. 
It's just another full moon. 

Don't be afraid of me when I'm walking in my sleep. 
Don't get alarmed, dear, when I start to crawl and creep. 
Try not to listen when I mumble like a loon. 
It's just another full moon. 
It's just another full moon. 

You see before you a truly broken man. 
'Cause when it gets to midnight, I don't know who I am. 
Full moon's a-callin', and it's put a curse on me, 
And it will never set me free. 

The full moon's still up there, 
Like a great white balloon. 
The owls are a-callin', 
And they're singin' my tune. 
The night keeps a-callin'. 
I wish the day would come soon, 
To get away from another full moon. 
Here comes another full moon. 

If your hands start shakin' 
When night starts to fall, 
If you're scared of the moonlight 
And the shadows on the wall, 
If the face in the mirror 
Isn't you at all, 
It's just another full moon. 
It's just another full moon.

So much confusion headed my way

Tea and biscuits in bed
The headlines said that Diana is dead
She couldn't act much but she put on a show
She always smiled

It's no surprise that I'm singing the blues

With a bloody great blast,
Make it fast, make it fast
So have a good day today 
Because it could be your last,
Make it last, make it last

Will it light up the sky? 
Will it blot out the sun? 
Well we've waited this long,
So it better be a good one
Good day, good day, good day

Yeah, it's gonna be a good day
Hey baby, if you come back home 
It'll be a good day today.
They could drop a small atom bomb 
On the city today,
But if you walk through that door, honey, 
You know it'll be a good day

And now survival is my only aim
I call friends and see if any remain
Who was that girl who used to be my flame? 
I'd call her if I could remember her name

Today has got to be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,

To make the world take notice of you

Watch out, she's still growing up, she's in a rage, 
I guess she's reached that difficult age.

I only wanted to take a photograph of you, 
But I was shocked when I heard what you had to say. 
You picked up my camera, threw it away, 
I didn't really mean to ruin your day. 

Now I see you've got a little girl of your own. 
Little princess certainly grown, 
And there's a man, he's smiling at you. 
He must have been the one who always knew.

It's just like another world 
Jogging in the park is my excuse 
To look at all the little girls 

I'm not a flasher in a rain coat, 
I'm not a dirty old man, 
I'm not gonna snatch you from your mother,

I'm an art lover 
Come to daddy, 
And I'll give you some spangles 

Little girl don't notice me 
Watching as she innocently plays 
She can't see me staring at her 
Because I'm always wearing shades 
She feeds the ducks, looks at the flowers 
I follow her around for hours and hours 
I'd take her home, but that could never be, 
She's just a substitute 
For what's been taken from me 
Ah, come to daddy, come on

The Kinks,"Sunset over the high-rise,
By a motorway,
A little man looks up at the sky.
An uneventful end to a wasted day.
Close-up on the man at the window,
Looking at the street down below.
It's obvious he's got things on his mind.
He shakes his head, pulls down the blind.
He start's writing a letter,
To make it perfectly clear.
He's just a man who's reached the end of his rope,
Expressing his doubts and his fears.
In a world, feels so lonely and afraid,
Disillusioned by the promises they made,
It's a pity that it ended up this way,
Life is just a cliche.
I'm gonna do tomorrow
What I did yesterday.
It's such a dull routine,
Somebody cut this scene,
It's such a boring cliche.
Live life, day to day,
Seems so passe.
Everything you hear and say,
Just another cliche.
Like an actor on a movie screen,
Living out someone else's dream.
Living out a total misconception,
Reality, a false perception.
It's such a wasted life,
Without any conclusion.
Days drift into days,
His life just slips away.
People so blase,
Everything's a cliche.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
Just an illusion.
Just an illusion.
Moonlight over the high-rise,
At the end of the day.
The little man is asleep in his bed,
Tucked up, safely away.
In his dreams he's taken away by alien beings to another
Galaxy, deep in space. To a planet where a man can live
Out his fantasies, and experience unimaginable pleasures.
But morning comes and soon the realities of life will
Shatter his illusions, and the cliches of the world will
Bring him down. But still he's waiting for a change.
Days drift into days,
His life just slips away.
Everything is passe,
Everything's a cliche.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
Just an illusion.

Looking in the mirror wondering, ""Well, 
After all this time you never thought you'd still be out on the road?"" 
Like a gypsy I was born to roam 
Like a wanderer with no fixed abode 
I think about the friends I've left behind on the road 

Well, the road's been rocky along the way 
It's been a long, hard haul on the motorway 
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day 

(On the road) 
The bed and breakfasts and the greasy spoons 
(The road) 
The loser bars and the noisy rooms

The casualties who did too many lines 
(The road) 
Wasted talent on women and wine 

I think of all the friends I've left behind 
Whenever it's time to get back out on the road 

Started playing blues in a coffee bar 
I took a trip down Charing Cross Road 
With my imitation Gretsch guitar 
And my head full of songs and my eyes full of stars 
I saw a band called the Rolling Stones 
I thought, ""That's it, I'll get a band, 
I'm leaving home, I'm out on the road"" 

The motorways all over this land 
(The road) 
Far away places like Wigan and Birmingham 
(The road) 
Didn't have no name, didn't have any fans 
(The road) 
Didn't have no money so we slept in the van 

All those early gigs we ever played 
Sometimes we were lucky if we even got paid 
On the road 
Pete played on the bass guitar 
Liked to get around, mixing with all the stars 
But Mrs. Avory's child was all fingers and thumbs 
But solid as a rock, setting time on the drums 
While Dave the Rave hit the rock 'n' roll riffs 
Yours truly strummed away with a slightly limp wrist 
On the road 

Everyday is when I can't get used to it 
Everyday is when I can't get away 
Another day, another freeway to face 
That's the road 

Well, life is a road, it's a motorway 
And the road gets rocky along the way 
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day 

(On the road) 
Jimi Hendrix, The Who, the Led Zeppelin and Free 
They took the road so it's alright by me 
Some are survivors, some are debris 
If you play in a band that's the road that you take 
Living in it, eating in it, sleeping in it 
You wake up in the morning, what do you see? 
The road 

Life is a road, it's a motorway 
Lost a lot of good friends along the way 
All the families and homes that I've left behind

Flower power, heavy metal and acid rock 
And still all the critics keep saying 
""Are they still around? When they gonna stop?"" 
It's just the dedicated followers of fashion who like putting down 
All the well respected men who came dancing and are still on the road 

Sometimes I get suicidal 
Now everyone is a rival 
Different cars, different bars and hotels 
Corporations, big business and egos 
When it all gets too bad I think back 
When we were all each other had 
When we started out on the road 

And there's gas in my tank and I've still got a way to go

To see if anybody was there.
But there was nobody home at 3 Bywater Street,
And they had sold Cadogan Square.
And I remember myself in my tie dye sweater,
And my hipster corduroy flares.
As I knocked on doors,
And walked down one-way streets that led nowhere.

Ah, did ya ever think it wouldn't last forever?
Did ya ever think that it would get this bad?
Did ya ever think that everything would get so crazy?

Now the Chelsea Drug Store needs a fix,
It's in a state of ill repair.
And my Cuban heels are hurting my feet,
Just to add to my despair.

And they can't pay the fine.

Oh, baby.

They filled us full of false illusions and promiscuity,
And they led us down that class-less road to mediocrity.
As we walked down that alley way of hope,
We thought we'd found the motherload,
But we were led like lambs to that promise land,
With all the debts that we would owe.
Once trendies posed for tourist pictures in the summertime.

Not content with taking Polaroids, they purchased all the property that they could find,
And I've just sold mine. (Did you ever!)

The Kinks,"Sitting alone in my hotel
Looking in the mirror wondering, well
After all this time you never thought
You'd still be out on the road

Like a gypsy I was born to roam
Like a wanderer with no fixed abode
I think about the friends
I've left behind on the road

Well, the road's been rocky along the way
It's been a long, hard haul on the motorway
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day

(On the road)
The bed and breakfasts and the greasy spoons
(The road)
The loser bars and the noisy rooms
(The road)
The casualties who did too many lines
(The road)
I'm wasted talent on women and wine

I think of all the friends I've left behind
Whenever it's time to get back out on the road

Started playing blues in a coffee bar
I took a trip down the Charing Cross Road
With my imitation Gretsch guitar
And my head full of songs and my eyes full of stars

I saw a band called the Rolling Stones
I thought, ""That's it, I'll get a band
I'm leaving home, I'm out on the road""

The motorways all over this land
(The road)
Far away places like Wigan and Birmingham
(The road)
Didn't have no name, didn't have any fans
(The road)
Didn't have no money, so we slept in the van

All those early gigs we ever played
Sometimes we were lucky if we even got paid
On the road

Pete played on the bass guitar
(The road)
Liked to get around, mixing with all the stars
(The road)
But Mrs. Avory's child was all fingers and thumbs
(The road)
But solid as a rock, setting time on the drums

While Dave, the Rave hit the rock 'n' roll riffs
Yours truly strummed away with a slightly limp wrist
On the road

Everyday is when I can't get used to it
Everyday is when I can't get away
Another day, another freeway to face
That's the road

Well, life is a road, it's a motorway
And the road gets rocky along the way
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day

(On the road)
Jimi Hendrix, The Who, the Led Zeppelin and Free
(The road)
They took the road so it's alright by me
(The road)
Some are survivors, some are debris
(The road)
If you play in a band that's the road that you take

Living in it, eating in it, sleeping in it
You wake up in the morning, what do you see?
The road

Life is a road, it's a motorway
Lost a lot of good friends along the way
All the families and homes that I've left behind
To the wives and the lovers and friends who had their time

I say, ""You take your road and I'll take mine""
(You take your road and I'll take mine)
You take your road and I'll take mine
(You take your road and I'll take mine)

Life is a road, it's a motorway
And the road gets rocky along the way
But if it gets too smooth it's time to call it a day

(On the road)
Observed all the various phases from
Flower power, heavy metal and acid rock
And still all the critics keep saying
""Are they still around? When they gonna stop?""

It's just the dedicated followers of fashion who like putting down
All the well respected men who came dancing and are still on the road

(The road)
Sometime I get suicidal
(The road)
Now everyone is a rival
(The road)
Different cars, different bars and hotels
(The road)
Corporations, big business and egos

When it all gets too bad I think back
When we were all each other had
When we started out on the road

And there's gas in my tank
And I've still got a way to go

Mama, what I sense from outside
It's a world full of fear
And there's nowhere to hide
Mama, I feel safe between these walls
And I'm so scared of heights
And it's a long way to fall
Into the great big nowhere
Maybe Papa's getting pressure from his peers
Are you straight, are you queer
So he made me, baby

Babies being born, some are rich, some are poor
But they're innocent and unprepared
Little girls and boys, didn't ask to be born
But they're always popping out there
Falling into the great big nowhere

Mama, I know that once upon a time
You and Papa were rich
When you were both in your prime
Mama, now you got the pains
And I know it's nearly time
But I don't want to join the crowd
I see standing in line
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Babies being induced, no excuse, what's the use
So they're always popping out there
Babies didn't wanna be born
Ill equipped, running loose
But they're innocent and unprepared

Mama, now you are showing all the signs
But is your world upside-down
On its head just like mine
Mama, now your ambition is mine
Don't make me over
Achieve too much in my time
Oh Mama, please don't make me climb

They're pointing at a man standing high on a ledge
And somebody just cried out loud

Don't look down, things might start looking up

He's heard the cries of the lunatics facing defeat
The cheers of the winners
Who are dancing in the street
Perhaps the crime and corruption finally got through
And the violence of the city
Just broke him in two
Now a voice from the queue shouts

Don't look down, don't look down
Down here on the sidewalk
It's stopped all our lives

The world can't make us alter this position
At least you and I know where we stand
We can't be friends, walk hand in hand

Yeah, hatred
Your attitude is downright rude
Your jokes appall me, they're so crude

That you're sitting here with me tonight 
I know you're on the run, you shouldn't be here

It's strange we always go to church on Sundays 
After getting right out of it on a Saturday night 
And if we stay here too long, I know that we'll quarrel 
And end up having a fight 
Just a couple of losers putting the world to right 
Just two people having a beer 
But on either side there is so much anger 
And so much fear 
Just two people trying to get by 
But we're torn apart 
Because of different pressures 
From different sides 
I hear you're on the run from law and order 
But you had to show up 
''cause you knew it was a matter of pride 
But beliefs aside, religion apart 
Did you ever think about all the suffering you caused 
And all the broken hearts? 
The word is out that you are the informer 
Who gave me away without so much as a fight

Waiting for the flashing light
To lift me up from the ground

Then the elevator opened
And I saw her standing there
She had to be a young executive
She looked so corporate and clean

And I thought I'd seen her somewhere before
On the cover of a magazine
I didn't think she'd even look at me
Or bother to glance my way

But she actually smiled at me and said
Hi-ya handsome, have a good day

I gotta be dreaming, is it a fantasy

Buzzing 'round every molecule in me

Was it real or only a dream

Was it my imagination playing tricks on me
When she looked my way
Maybe she took me for somebody else
Whatever it was, it made my day, hey hey

I wake up in the morning
Smiling with anticipation
Suddenly I feel alive
Face the world with expectation

I must be dreaming this world is a better place

But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on
Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine (Waterloo sunset's fine)

Millions of people swarming like flies 'round
Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on
Waterloo Sunset
They are in paradise

The Kinks,"On reflection, it was not all wine on the wall 
It was not all cuts and bruises 
Or the pulling out of hair 
And the bloodying of nose 
And the tearing off of clothes, although 

It was really animal, truly animal 
There were times when there was absolute compassion in the air 
Though it was really animal, truly animal 

It could not compare to times we cared 
And were in control and less emotional 

While the intellect controls the spiritual 
The animal respects what's natural 
Ying and yang control man's actions 
And both extremes are a natural reaction 

It was really animal, truly animal, 
Well there were times when there was absolute compassion in the air 

On reflection it was not all crash and bang 
Broken bottles and abuse 
Sometimes there were sunsets on the sands 
Holding onto caring hands 
But there were vampire fangs 
As the angels sang 
It was ying and yang, oh yeah 

It was truly natural, though it was really animal 
In a sense it fell into a truly natural romance

The Kinks,"In the back of a record rack
There's an old double pack.
Twelve inches and black,
With an old crumpled cover,
But every track is stacked.

And it takes me back
To the one who caused this melancholy mood,
And every single groove
Cuts me to the bone,
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone.

I took her back to my bachelor flat
While the stereo played for two.
She unwrapped her gift
And played me a riff
And said, ""This old record was just made for you.""

Then we danced to songs of passion and
The singer's velvet tones
On the gramaphone
While the record played.
She rocks me to the bone,
Knocks me to the bone.

Those rock n' roll romantic songs
Played all summer long,
And she rocks me to the bone,
Knocks me to the bone.

Yeah, she rocks me to the bone,
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone.

In dreams she's smiling in slow motion,
Devouring all of my emotion,
Angels singing rock 'n' roll,
While demons take away my soul.

Voices sound, her image fades,
Every time that record plays,
She rocks me to the bone,
Knocks me to the bone.

In my back room there's an old 45
That we played all summer long.
Shakin' the beams so loud it covered up the screams
When lover's harmony went oh so wrong.

And in every word emotion is torn,
And blood flows down the drain,
Like she opened up a vein
And cut me to the bone,
Yeah, she rocks me to the bone.

And now I'm just a prisoner
In that stereo hi-fi jail --
The needle pierced just like a nail

Come dancing

Why not come dancing, it's only natural

She would be ready but she's always make him wait
In the hallway, in anticipation
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek
Come dancing
That's how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing
My sister always did
My sister should have come in a midnight
And my mom would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row

Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate
The day they knocked down the pally
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the pally

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band
And there's a car park where the pally used to stand
My sister's married and she lives on an estate

She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her I wonder if she would

I loved to wander wild 
Through the bright city lights, 
And find myself a life I could call my own. 
It was always my ambition 
To see Piccadilly, 
Ramble and roam around Soho 
And Pimlico and Savile Row, 
And walk down the Abbey Road. 
So I saved all my money 
And packed up my clothes, 
And I said good-bye to my friends 
And my folks back home. 
And I left for a life of my own. 
I left for a life on the road. 

I'm a real hungry tyke, 
And I know what I like. 
And I know where I'm goin'
To those bright city lights. 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, 
This time I'm gonna get there. 
I'm bound for a life on the road. 
Give me life on the road. 
I said life on the road. 

When I arrived in Houston, 
I was little more than a child. 
And I didn't know then 
That the dives and the dens 
Would be so vulgar and wicked and wild. 
Mama always told me 
The city ladies were bawdy and bold. 
And so I searched night and day 
To catch a kissable lady, 
But all that I caught was a cold, 
Cause those stuck-up city ladies 
Didn't notice me walk by. 
Now I've got holes in my shoes 
Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night. 
And I'm livin' the life that I chose. 
Livin' my life on the road. 
I said life on the road. 
I want life on the road.

He'll drink anything, 
Port, Pernod or tequila, 
Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks, 
As long as all his troubles disappeared. 
But he messed up his life and he beat up his wife, 
And the floosie's gone and found another sucker 
She's gonna turn him on to drink 
She's gonna lead him to the brink 
And when his money's gone, 
She'll leave him in the gutter, 
It's such a shame.

And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard

Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard
But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom
Because she wanted to be alone

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

Rudolph Valentino looks very much alive
And he looks up ladies dresses as they sadly pass him by
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life

If you covered him with garbage
George Sanders would still have style
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn round and smile
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
'Cause she's not very tough
She should have been made of iron or steel
But she was only made of flesh and blood

And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are
And those who are successful
Be always on your guard
Success walks hand in hand with failure
Along Hollywood Boulevard

I'm gonna leave this body now
I'm gonna leave this body now
Oh Baby...............................Oh Baby
I was lying on the floor
With the music in my head
The Todd Terry Project
Was the last thing that I heard
I had searched for the answer
It was not much to find
Then Kylie said to Jason
""It's all in the mind""
My mind was empty (party)
Had been for a while (party)
So I said to Kylie (party)
""Jason's got some style"" (party)
You got it, You got it
I'm gonna leave this body now
I'm gonna leave this body now
Oh Baby...............................Oh Baby
Trapped in a rerun
Of a seventies sitcom soap
""Some Mothers Do Have 'Em""
Or ""The Archie Bunker Show""
I was smokin with Felicity
The good life begins in bed
Richard was in the garden
Or I think that's what she said
Then in walks Skippy (party)
The bush kangaroo (party)
Rolf playing ""Sad Eyes"" (party)
And playing the didgeridoo (party)
You got it, You got it
You got it, You got it
I'm gonna leave this body now

Schoolboy stuff, a sticky sweet romance.
And she makes you want to scream,
Wishing you could get inside her pants.
So, you fantasize away.
And while you're squeezing her, you thought you heard her saying...

""Good girls don't,
Good girls don't,
Good girls don't, but I do.""

So, you call her on the phone
To talk about the teachers that you hate.
And she says she's all alone,
And her parents won't be coming home til late.
There's a ringing in your brain,
Cause you could've sworn you though you heard her saying...

""Good girls don't,
Good girls don't,
Good girls don't, but I do.""

And it's a teenage sadness
Everyone has got to taste.
An in-between age madness
That you know you can't erase
Til she's sitting on your face.

You're alone with her at last,
And you're waiting til you think the time is right.
Cause you've heard she's pretty fast.
And you're hoping that she'll give you some tonight.
So, you start to make your play,
Cause you could've sworn you thought you heard her saying...


""Good girls don't,

I stay here all night
And when I've stayed all the night
We go out in the morning light

Is it medicine or social skill?

And you haven't slept for several days
You've been turning inside out, looking for reasons
And your black sorry eyes made you pale

And you couldn't catch them
You couldn't be there
You couldn't help them at all
And it was cold

If we say there is something above the mountains
If we say that there is something we can't see
Promise you will never believe me
'Cause I guess I'm just trying to make it easy

One for you and one for me

I'm coming over
I'm making a new song

I pick a car and it's a fifteen minutes drive
Rock Classics on the radio
To clear my mind

Sometimes in the weekends
We meet up at our favorite café
I'll order a chai tea
And you will have the usual au lait

And when the place gets crowded
Then they freak out
And they play the music louder

Here comes another day in isolation
Hold out your hand, feel my brain burns
You suck and lick but you still don't know why
I could fuck your brains out
But I'm not interested in that life

I felt the ground, I felt the snow
I thought of linen and of lace
I never really saw his face

I heard a grunt, I heard a moan
I felt the sun, I saw the moon
I saw the northern light above
And the eclipse of the sun

I am a breath, I am a wish
I am a rocket and a fish
I felt his measures and his weight
My own body as a scale

I heard a whisper in my ear
”You are not here, you are not here”
I saw the northern light above
And the eclipse of the sun

My feet was hurt and heals were sore
And I wondered why it burned
And I wondered why it burned

Then I had to climb down
I went down to see the sun rise
And then I had to climb back up again
I had to be there to see the sun rise

All the air that you sent to guide me
Had a tone of the elephant gray
We were all there in the morning
We were there and we wanted to stay

So quite a lot of what people had heard was right
Some was wrong
