Cole Porter,"Have you heard? The coast of Maine just got caught in a hurricane? 
Well did you ever? What a swell party this is! 
Have you heard that poor dear Blanche got run down by an avalanche? 
Well, did you ever? What a swell party this is! 
What daiquiris! What sherry, please! What burgundy! What pommery! 
Have you heard? Professor Munch ate his wife and divorced his lunch? 
Well, did you ever ? What a swell party this is! 

Misses Smith in her new Hup crossed the bridge when the bridge was up, 
Well, did you ever ? What a swell part this is! 
What brandy, wow! What whiskey, here's how! 
What gin and what beer, will you sober up, dear?","Well, did you evah!, song (from ""High Society"")",1956
Cole Porter,"Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-knighting

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel, I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands 
They sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain

Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again",Autumn In New York,1974
Cole Porter,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1989
Cole Porter,"Another op'nin', another Show
Another op'nin', another show
In Philly, Boston or Baltimoe,
A chance for stagefolks to say ""hello""
Another op'nin', another show.

Another job that you hope, at last, 
Will make your future forget your past,
Another pain where the ulcers grow,
Another op'nin', another show

For weeks, you rehearse and rehearse,
Three weeks and it couldn't be worse.
One week, will it ever be right?
Then out o' the hat, it's that big first night!

The overture is about to start,
You cross your fingers and hold your heart,
It's curtain time and away we go,
Another op'nin', another show

Another op'nin', another show
In Philly, Boston or Baltimoe,
A chance for stagefolks to say ""hello""
Another op'nin', another show.

Another job that you hope, at last, 
Will make your future forget your past,
Another pain where the ulcers grow,
Another op'nin', another show.

For weeks, you rehearse and rehearse,
Three weeks and it couldn't be worse.
One week, will it ever be right?
Then out o' the hat, it's that big first night!

The overture is about to start,
You cross your fingers and hold your heart,
It's curtain time and away we go,
Another op'nin', just another op'nin', of another show!","Another Op'nin', Another Show",1991
Cole Porter,"Times have changed 
And we've often rewound the clock 
Since the Puritans got a shock 
When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking. 
But now, God knows, 
Anything goes. 
Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
(If any brains you've got) 
From those little radios. 
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's, 
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons 
'Cause Franklin knows 
Anything goes.",Anything Goes,1991
Cole Porter,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"". 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. 

Or GOP! 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a Waldorf salad. 
You're the top! 
You're a Berlin ballad. 
You're the boats that glide 
On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia, 
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher, 
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop, 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top!",You're the Top,1991
Cole Porter,"From this moment on
You for me, dear
Only two for tea, dear
From this moment on

From this happy day
No more blue songs
Only hoop-de-doo songs
From this moment on

You've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight

From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be ridin' high, babe
Every care is gone

Cole Porter,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear,

Cole Porter,"I so often dream
We might make a team
But so wild a scheme
I must banish
For each time I start
To open my heart
You vanish

We might find some isle
Where lotuses smile
And our time beguile
Going native
But how can we go
Unless you are co
Operative

My dear, I've a feeling you are
So near and yet so far
You appear like a radiant star
First so near, then again so far

I just start getting you keen
On clinches galore with me
When fate steps in on the scene
And mops up the floor with me
No wonder I'm a bit under par
For you're so near and yet so far

My condition is only so-so
'Cause whenever I feel you're close, oh
You turn out to be, oh, so
Far",So Near and Yet So Far,1992
Cole Porter,"Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par
Oh, how lucky we are

While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on it will always be
True love, true love

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high, with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever, true

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high, with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever, true

Love forever...true",True Love,1992
Cole Porter,"I should like you all to know,
I'm a famous gigolo.
And of lavender, my nature's got just a dash in it.
As I'm slightly undersexed,
You will always find me next
To some dowager who's wealthy rather than passionate.
Go to one of those night club places
And you'll find me stretching my braces
Pushing ladies with lifted faces 'round the floor.
But I must confess to you
There are moments when I'm blue.
And I ask myself whatever I do it for.

I'm a flower that blooms in the winter,
Sinking deeper and deeper in snow.
I'm a baby who has
No mother but jazz,
I'm a gigolo.
Ev'ry morning, when labor is over,
To my sweet-scented lodgings I go,
Take the glass from the shelf
And look at myself,
I'm a gigolo.
I get stocks and bonds
From faded blondes
Ev'ry twenty-fifth of December.
Still I'm just a pet
That men forget
And only tailors remember.
Yet when I see the way all the ladies
Treat their husbands who put up the dough,
You cannot think me odd
If then I thank God
I'm a gigolo.",I'm a Gigolo,1992

Cole Porter,"Every time I look down on this timeless town
Whether blue or gray be her skies.
Whether loud be her cheers or soft be her tears,
More and more do I realize:

I love Paris in the springtime.
I love Paris in the fall.
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles,
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles.

I love Paris every moment,
Every moment of the year.

Because my love is near.",I Love Paris,1994

Cole Porter,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1994

Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies

Cole Porter,"Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'd the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me.",The Physician [From Nymph Errant],2002
Cole Porter,"Oh, I'm so mad about a lad
It's too deep to express
And when he tries to use his eyes
They have instant success
So full of passion, these pupils are
That girls forget what their scruples are
So when he turns them on me
I murmur tenderly

I think you're great, I think you're grand
And I don't mind if you hold my hand
But don't look at me that way

Your kisses, too, are heavenly
And oh, so full of variety
But don't look at me that way

When you tell me sweetly you're mine completely
I always give a long cheer
But those sudden flashes behind your lashes
Are nobody's business, dear

Since you began to play your role
I've lost my heart and I've lost my soul
But as for losing my self-control
Don't look at me that way

I just adore your loving arms
In fact, they're two of your greatest charms
But don't look at me that way

I'm very mild, I'm very meek
My will is strong, but my won't is weak
So don't look at me that way

When that strange expression of indiscretion
Begins to show in your stare
There's a hocus-pocus about your focus
That gives me a terrible scare

I feel a thrill when you arrive
And while you're near I simply thrive
But if you want to get home alive
Don't look at me that way","Don't look at me that way, song (from ""Paris"")",2002

Yes, with certain reservations
Will you try your best to go for this moll?

If you do, I'll buy a new dress for your doll
But please let me pick it out
And I'll take you to hear the big cathedral bells

Would you like a big box of chocolate creams?
No, for candy I never did care

The minute my eyes open in the morning.
Out on some highway, or pulling in the driveway.
Clear blue sky or when it's thunder storming.
My mind just can't escape you,
The first time I touched you, that's when I knew.

I want you trust me, I want you to love me,
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose.
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you.
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about,
All it ever comes down to, girl I just want you.

When you get rattled, or you're coming all unraveled,
When your holding everything together for me.
The way you revealed me, the way that you feel me.
The way you know I'm holding something inside.

But as long as I'm here, one thing I'm sure of

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another

My very life is in her keeping

As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring

They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Your lips may be near
but where is your heart?

It's always like this
I worry and wonder
You're close to me here
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts
When we kiss, do you close your eyes
pretending that I'm someone else?

this cloud that I'm under
So please won't you tell, darling

The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer

To being me consolation, you're my inspiration

Nothing but love in view, then you fall

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Coleman Hawkins,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994
Coleman Hawkins,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon [Alternate Take][#],1994

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?

I am his forever more

Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,2004

Still I don't care you thrill me so

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me

I commission you, find a riff that's new

Though old Joe is gone, his jive lives on

Colette,"Lay a whisper on my pillow,
leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around.

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows...",It Must Have Been Love,1993

Y yo no quiero morir

I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?

Got me thrown back like who the hella is that?
Nick-nack-paddy-wack give a dog a bone back,
Break me off a piece of the kit-kat cognac,
Brushing on my lipstick, hit me with the throwback,
Small white and fresh chew me up like a tic-tac
Hit me with the clip to the click to the clack
Everything passed in a flash of the Kodak
So run running man run as fast as you can
Hit me with the numb with the jack to the chan,
Gotta put it down like a bad hand with the Mac 10 like a backhand,
Remember back when you would chase me down like a PacMan
Upside down in the world in a handstand,
Now I see your lies in the eyes of a cat-scan, how can I be Robin if you can't be my Batman?

I feel the pressures on me,
I'll be your precious army,
I really need you to know.

With your F16 flying over me,
Dropping every bomb like a masterpiece,
With your F16 flying over me,
Laying it out like a casualty.

You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart.
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
Never take away my heart, take away take take away my heart.

With an M16 and a Glock to the face though,
Blew me away spent cheap like a peso
Stole my mind leave me like a bagel,
Hole in my head now I'm stuck as a Leggo.
Said I'm your center but you were my staple
So far gone in a bind and a tangle,
Going down south now I'm tripping San Diego,
Stuck at the boarder in a hot Winnebago.
O but it's so cliché,
Ace high went to waist with your poor play,
Could've had a diamond but you lost me in a poor raise,
Poor taste now a closed case.
Pop like a PPK, semi automatic,
CC sprays, Hot villa Tiki Bay,
Gotta get away alleviate.

I feel the pressures on me,
I'll be your precious army,
I really need you to know.

With your F16 flying over me,
Dropping every bomb like a masterpiece,
With your F16 flying over me,
Laying it out like a casualty.

You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart.
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
Never take away my heart, take away take take away my heart.

Every little feeling that I stacked in a rack,
Every little plan got lost so I ran,
Cold war status C.O.D.,
Got me all surrounded V.I.P.
With your love gone I'm stung as a needle
Clean as a whistle colt desert eagle,
Couldn't see the day when you said it was over
Chalked me out like the white cliffs of Dover.

With your F16 flying over me,
Dropping every bomb like a masterpiece,
With your F16 flying over me,
Laying it out like a casualty.

You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart.
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,
You can take away almost everything but you'll never take away my heart,

Colette Carr,"Bah Humbug, now that's too strong!
'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year
Ski shop encounter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines
So deck those halls Trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens Sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course 'till summertime
Out to the beach to his boat
Could I join him?
No This time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-dos
A few cards, a few calls
Because it's RSVP
No, thanks No party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot
So on with the boots
Back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
'Spending this one alone,' he said
'Give me a break, this year's been crazy'
I said 'Me too, but why are you
You mean you forgot cranberries too?'
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year

Colette Renard,"Y’avait un’ fois une rose
Une rose et un marin
L’marin était à Formose
La rose était à Dublin

Jamais au monde ils n’se virent
Ils étaient beaucoup trop loin
Lui quittait pas son navire
Ell’  quittait pas son jardin 

Au d’ssus de la rose sage
Des oiseaux passaient tout l’temps
Et puis aussi des nuages 
Des soleils et des printemps

Au d’ssus du marin volage
Des rêv’s étaient tout pareils
Aux printemps et aux nuages
Aux oiseaux et aux soleils

L’marin périt en septembre
Et la ros’, le même jour
Vient se flétrir dans la chambre 
D’une fille en mal d’amour

Personn’ jamais ne suppose
Qu’il y ait le moindre lien
Entre l’marin de la Formose
Et la rose de Dublin

Et seul un doigt sur la bouche
Un ang’ beau comme un éclair
Jett’ quand le soleil se couche 
Des pétales sur la mer",Le Marin et La Rose,1987
Colette Renard,"Quand je suis devenue belle,
Quand j'ai pris mes seize ans,
Je suis restée demoiselle,
Mais j'ai eu des amants
Z'avaient de bonnes têtes,
Ou z'étaient bons garçons,
M'emmenaient à la fête,
Me chantaient des chansons...

Zon... Zon... Zon... froissé mon corsage
Et toutes ces choses qui ne servent à rien
Zon... Zon... Zon... puisque c'est l'usage,
Voulu toujours aller plus loin.

De la porte à la chambre
Et du fauteuil au lit,
M'ont fait croire en décembre
Au mois de... Mai Joli
Mais au petit matin blême,
Fallait se rhabiller,
Y avait plus de «je t'aime»
Et même plus d'amitié...

Zon... Zon... Zon... cueilli tant de roses
Que le jardin s'est défleuri.
Zon... Zon... Zon... rien vu de la chose,
Z'avaient l'œil sur le paradis.

J'ai laissé ma jeunesse
Au bal des quatre vents
Et me voilà la princesse
D'un drôle de bois dormant.
Chez Marie ça s'appelle,
Mais y a pas de plaque au seuil,
C'est la maison des belles.
La maison «N'a qu'un œil»

Zon... Zon... Zon... c'est toujours les mêmes,
Z'avaient qu'une corde à leur violon.
Zon... Zon... Zon... besoin qu'on les aime.
Oh mes seize ans... où c'est qu'ils sont ?",Zon Zon Zon,1987
Colette Renard,"En vieille Russie
Vivaient deux amants
Serge et Nathalie
Agés de vingt ans

Ils avaient pour tout trésor
À part leur cœur aimant
Elle, sa chevelure d'or
Lui, sa chaîne d'argent

Cheveux sans un peigne
Comment les coiffer?
Sans montre la chaîne
Pourquoi la porter?
Il y a bien des peignes fins
Des montres en quantité
Mais le marchand tend sa main
Avec quoi le payer?

Et Noël arrive
Sur les amoureux
Nathalie pensive
Serge malheureux
C'est l'époque des présents
Nathalie voudrait bien
Offrir la montre d'argent
Serge le peigne fin

Elle part en cachette
Chez le perruquier
L'homme lui achète
Ses boucles dorées
Puis elle court chez l'horloger
Mais Serge au même instant
Contre un peigne a échangé
Une chaîne d'argent

Ils sont face à face
Avec leurs présents
Mais leur joie se casse
En se regardant
Nathalie sans ses cheveux
Lui sa chaîne envolée
Rient et pleurent tous les deux
Leurs cadeaux à leurs pieds

En vieille Russie
Vivaient deux amants

Agés de vingt ans
Vous, tous les jeunes amants
Pensez à leur histoire
Car eux si pauvres étaient pourtant
Plus riches que le tsar",Serge Et Nathalie,2010

We danced the dance

Colin Bailey,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1965

Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year

Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share

Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year

Wie oft hat nicht zur Weihnachtszeit
Ein Baum von dir mich hoch erfreut!

Gibt Trost und Kraft

Colin Bailey,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we

Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1997

Colin Blunstone,"Sometimes when I wake at night
In the hour before the light
Darkness seems to cover
And hide me from all reason
Then out on the rooftop high
Another day begins to climb
Something is waking in the light
There I can see
A sleepy head so close to me
And every little word we sang through the night
Is bright for the day

Hey, you know you are love to me
You hold everything like a child for me
And I think of you and your funny ways
That sweet summer smile on your lovely face
For I love you
You are love to me

I try when we have to fight
To say the words
To put things right
It gets so hard not touching
With miles between our fingers
And then when you don't believe
There's so much pride to hide beneath
That something is growing
In every room the touch of you
The tender edge of loving you
And everything I have is nothing
If it can't belong to you

Hey, you know you are love to me

When I would feel settled with somebody
It's really hard to be alone
When you're not sure who you wanna be
And then I found I'd ran aground
No longer could I hang around with nobody
But when we sat side by side
I knew that I'd never tried
You took me out of the crowd
I just wanna shout out loud

Something happens when you touch me
Something happens when you touch me
Something happens when you touch me there

Many times I told myself
You're sitting here left on the shelf
All by yourself
And nobody gets younger now'days
Living good is something that we all know pays
I've faced an empty life ahead
Buth then I've found you instead
To show the way
And when you took hold of my hand

They broke the mold in two
They turned the sky to blue

It's shining down on me to light my way
Warming up my body
From my head down to my toes

It rises up to turn my night to day
Now we can burn and we can dazzle
It can turn this bud into a rose

When I was so afraid
And hiding in the shade
You came along and made
My spirit come alive

Now when it rains on me
I look out hopefully
And see if I can see
A rainbow

Show me you're still there
Show me that you're there

You feed the flowers of desire

You could set the world on fire

Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.

Northern seas from home
And told me about the morning that was breaking
And the love she kept inside
The California sun may have me on the run, but
Home is where my heart lies
Far beneath the grey skies
Home where my love keeps a song sung for me
Home where my thoughts keep on wandering
No matter where I might be

I've flown the world and watched
The sunset down in old Jamaica
I've crossed the mountains and the desserts
Where the western heroes sung
And I'll be back someday
As soon as I can get away
Those memories will never fade away, but
Home is where my heart lies
Far beneath the grey skies
Home where my love keeps a song sung for me
Home where my thoughts keep on wandering
No matter where I might be

I wanna be back home again
In the land where I belong
I wanna see my love again soon

And deep grim lodges
Housed in siblings' far off game chambers
Comes the rain, oh Lord
And it reflects my tears, which originally grew in mirrors
Oh windows of illusion

And the rain fell, like ball bearings on a roulette wheel
Eliminating the future
And I saw ghosts, they were children
Running through a cedar boulevard
Into a wood
They came to a gate and looked inside
It was raining
And they heard a soft moaning, warm and plural

And the rain fell, on the lake, in the vast garden
Faster and faster
It was dark
Suddenly children were everywhere
Gliding along the lake, running through the trees
The stars arranged themselves like an illuminated skipping rope
The trees were rich and high, and mingled with the stars
As jewels complement skin

Come, jump across the lake
Into he branches
Higher than the clouds

Let the rain fall
From secret passageways
And oak casements come these spirits
Out of their sleepy silver webs
They play with the forgotten animals at night
And patter on our windows when we sleep
Only the rain has such soft fingers

Colin Donnell,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top!

You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add;

You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy.

You're the National Gallery

You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante,

Colin Firth,"I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years
That was the time of the flower-power
But underneath
We had a fear of flying
Of growing old
A fear of slowly dying
We took our chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all

In the tourist jam

Round the Notre Dame

Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

Paris restaurants

Our last summer

Morning croissants

Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry

How dull it seems

Yet, you were the hero of my dreams

I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all

Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance

And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen

Leave them burning and then you're gone

When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show (wishing every show was the last show)
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right

Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me

But I won't feel blue (super-per trouper-per)
Like I always do (super-per trouper-per)

How can anyone be so lonely?

Still I'm thinking about you only (still I'm thinking about you only)
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy (think I'm going crazy)

The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
