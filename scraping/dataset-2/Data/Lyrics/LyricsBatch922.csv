Ricardo Montaner,"Cuerpo santo caído del cielo
Como garúa de madrugada
Moldeaste para mi otro yo
Moldeaste para mí otro todo

Boca santa que besa y mata
Que me recorre que sube y baja
Boca que a tu parecer
Por mi cuerpo se pasea

Poseído por tus embrujos
Medio derrocado por tus ojazos
Hágase tu voluntad
En el suelo y en la cama

Sometido aunque no lo diga
Yo te reconozco como dueña mía
Y hágase tu voluntad
En mi alma y en mi cuerpo

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Te quiero tanto que el cuerpo me duele
Y no me puedo aguantar

Que no me puedo aguantar
Y hasta tenerte me duele y me duele
Y no me puedo aguantar

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Te quiero tanto que el cuerpo me duele
Y no me puedo aguantar

Que no me puedo aguantar
Y hasta tenerte me duele y me duele
Y no me puedo aguantar

Virgen santa como he rogado
Por el milagro que me ha tocado
Es como una aparición
Esa cara y esos labios

Poseído por tus embrujos
Medio derrocado por tus ojazos
Hágase tu voluntad
En el suelo y en la cama

Sometido aunque no lo diga
Yo te reconozco como dueña mía
Y hágase tu voluntad
En mi alma y en mi cuerpo

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Te quiero tanto que el cuerpo me duele

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Y hasta tenerte me duele y me duele
Y no me puedo aguantar

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Te quiero tanto que el cuerpo me duele

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Y hasta tenerte me duele y me duele
Y no me puedo aguantar
Ooh

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Te quiero tanto que el cuerpo me duele

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Y hasta tenerte me duele y me duele
Y no me puedo aguantar

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Te quiero tanto que el cuerpo me duele

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Y hasta tenerte me duele y me duele
Y no me puedo aguantar

Ricardo Montaner,"La balanza va marcando un desbalance
Entre el lado que más pesa y el lado del aguante
La cincha de la vida me puso en desventaja
Por un lado tú y por otro tu ausencia

Y sigo de ambulante vendiendo fracaso
Y sigo de doliente llorando tu amor

Parado de manos
Cruzando el anden atado de mano y de pies
Mordaza en los sueños que acaso soñé
Y me mordí la lengua
Y le sangro a la luna el corazón

Y tu carencia está ganándole al olvido
Fue difícil conseguirte imposible de tenerte
Y sin embargo yo me alegro de haberte conocido
Por un lado me hizo bien y por otro frío

Y sigo de ambulante vendiendo fracasos
Y sigo de doliente llorando por tu amor

Corazón inválido infeliz
Corazón desangra hasta morir

",Parado de Manos,2003
Ricardo Montaner,"Dios nos dio la vida de gratis
Dios nos trajo para jugar
Si dios nos puso boca fue pa' besarnos
Si nos dios brazos fue pa' abrazar
Dios esta pensando en retiro
Dios esta cansado y se va
No te dio pies pa' que metieras la pata
Te trajo aquí para ser feliz

Esta prohibido olvidar
Que venimos del amor
Que el mesías es uno y no son dos
Que la vida es un ratito apenas
Que hay que ganarse la eternidad
Esta prohibido olvidar
A que huele la libertad
Como usar la paciencia de arsenal
Tolerancia como contraataque
Como decreto la compasion
Y el amor
Dios plantea un paro forsoso
Huelga de hambre y manifestar
Le va a echar llave
A las compuertas del cielo
Y de milagros no quiere ni hablar

Esta prohibido olvidar
Que venimos del amor
Que el mesías es uno y no son dos
Que la vida es un ratito apenas
Que hay que ganarse la eternidad
Esta prohibido olvidar
A que huele la libertad
Como usar la paciencia de arsenal
Tolerancia como contraataque
Como decreto la compasion
De que vale la sed
Si me vas a matar
Doy la vida a cambio de paz
No hay por que traicionar
Ni mentir ni fallar
Si al finar tendrás que pagar",Prohibido Olvidar,2003
Ricardo Montaner,"Que ganas de volver 
Que ganas de besar 
Que ganas de salir corriendo de este lugar
Que ganas de reír 
Que ganas de llorar 
Que ganas de encontrarte a la salida y entrada

Madrugar tirados en el cielo 
Surcándonos el suelo como si fuera el mar 
Que ganas con tenerme 
Que ganas con dejarme 
Que ganas con morder la luna por la mitad 
Que ganas de ganar
Ganándome tu vida 

Ganándome el respiro noche a noche día a día 
Que ganas con llorar
Que ganas de ayunar 
Comiendo de tu fuego 
Que ganas de romper el vidrio en caso de incendio 
Que ganas de arrimarme 
Que ganas con soltarme 

Que ganas de rodillas si me vas a golpear

Ricardo Montaner,"Vale la pena una mujer que se despierta sonriendo
Vale la pena ir a estudiar haciendo huelga al perder tiempo
Vale la pena amar a la niñez, vale la pena ser heroe del barrio
Y a punta de cargaras con crujir

Viva el amor en la ciudad, republica de la alegria
Y que viva la mujer q me enamore de verdad
Viva el amor en la ciudad, republica de la alegria
Que viva el buen humor, viva la vida y los cariños de mama

Vale la pena por amor hacer de tripas corazon
Vale la pena que el orgullo te lo metas al bolsillo
Vale la pena amar a tu enemigo
(Vale la pena)
Vale la pena honrar a Jesucristo
(Vale la pena)
Y en medio de la plaza hechar un grito

Viva el amor en la ciudad, republica de la alegria
Y que viva la mujer q me enamore de verdad
Viva el amor en la ciudad, republica de la alegria
Que viva el buen humor viva la vida y los cariños de mama
Y de papa tambien

Donde va, mi gente, pa' donde va
Se haga punta de machete limpiando mote pa' la ciudad, ooh
Donde va, mi gente, pa' donde va
Se rie Simon Bolivar porque ahora el mismo el que hace paz

Como tai?
Donde va
Donde va
Pa' donde va?

Donde va, mi gente, pa' donde va
Vengan todos a mi fiesta, trainganse algo para tomar
Donde va, mi gente, pa' donde va
Nos esta llamando Quique para contarnos que se acaso en Paraguay

Donde va, mi gente, pa' donde va
Ay dios mio
Junto al lago azul de Pacarai
Donde va, mi gente, pa' donde va

Ricardo Montaner,"Se me da extraÃ±arte pendiente al ventanal 
Se me da esperar por si te da llegar 
why por si te diera un ataque de fe

Lloro por mi mismo 
Por que en tu piel mori 

Desesperado casi hecho leÃ±os 
Desesperado de cara a la pared, 
Desesperado con pesadumbre 
Desesperado de volver why no volver

why todo lo que quise fue amar a una mujer 
Por si mÃ¡s tarde te ataca el corazÃ³n 
Si quieres verme avisa por favor

Ricardo Montaner,"Hoy volví a leer
En tus ojos y en tu corazón
Y en la línea divisoria de la eternidad

Hoy volví a leer tu nombre
En el cuadro que aun no se pintar
Y en el libro de mi vida
Se escribió tu nombre en sangre

Esta escrito que tu serias para mi
Esta escrito mi fábula real
Como te digo que Dios
Te puso en mi destino

Esta escrito que tu serias para mi
Esta escrito mi fábula real
Como te digo que Dios
Te puso en mi destino

Hoy volví a leer tu nombre
En el pino de una nube blanca
Y el vapor en el espejo
Dibujo tu nombre a fuego

Esta escrito que tu serias para mi
Esta escrito mi fábula real
Como te digo que Dios
Te puso en mi destino

Ves, ves, aun yo sigo aquí
Pidiéndote perdón por amarte tanto

Esta escrito que tu serias para mi
Esta escrito mi fábula real
Como te digo que Dios
Te puso en mi destino

Ricardo Montaner,"No sabía que un día mis suspiros 
Y la frase que robaba 
De algún cartel del metro 
Era un patin

Que algun día te toca 
Del cielo, aquí en la tierra recibimos 
Te entrege un pacto y la promesa 
De un nuevo paraíso

Y ahora se amar sin condenar 
Y ahora se darle valor al respirar

Dar gracias justo al despertar un dia más

Si un día por olvido 

Te olvidas de pensarme por mirar 
No sabia que hacer con la mirada

Ricardo Montaner,"Como puede atar la luna sus hilos en el cielo? 
¿Como pueden los cometas vivir en gravedad? 
¿Cómo puedes aguantar el último suspiro? 
¿Cómo calla la agonía su grito de dolor? 

¿Cómo va a hacer el mar sin tu profundidad? 
¿Cómo va a hacer la lluvia sin caras que mojar? 
¿Qué vas a hacer amor, sin mi? Oh 

¿Cómo puede la tristeza morirse de risa? 
¿Cómo puede la alegría vivir en soledad? Oh 
¿Cómo pueden los amantes burlar la lejanía? 
¿Cómo rompes el silencio tapándome la boca? 

¿Cómo va a hacer el mar sin tu profundidad? 
¿Cómo va a hacer la lluvia sin caras que mojar?

Ricardo Montaner,"Amar es jugarse la vida
Ser un blanco perfecto dejar las defensas rendidas
Amar es romper el espejo gritar contra el viento y sentir

Cada mirada tuya rara es un puñal que se me clava
Cada vez que me rechazas el impacto de una bala
Y saber que voy perdiendo la batalla
Perdiendo la batalla

Soldado del amor en esta guerra entre tu y yo
Cada noche caigo herido por ganar tu corazón
Soldado del amor luchando a muerte por tu piel
Soy un héroe de mentira un gigante de papel

Amar es quedarse sin fuerzas
Es volver a intentarlo otra vez aunque tu no comprendas
Amar es sentir un incendio que avanza por dentro y fingir

Cada vez que me rechazas el impacto de una bala
Y saber que voy perdiendo la batalla
Perdiendo la batalla

Ricardo Montaner,"Cada mañana el sol nos dio
En la cara al despertar
Cada palabra que le pronuncié
La hacía soñar

No era raro verla en el jardín
Corriendo tras de mí
Y yo dejándome alcanzar
Sin duda, era feliz

Era una buena idea
Cada cosa sugerida
Ver la novela en la televisión
Contarnos todo

Jugar eternamente
El juego limpio de la seducción
Y las peleas terminarlas
Siempre en el sillón

Me va a extrañar, al despertar
En sus paseos por el jardín
Cuando la tarde llegue a su fin

Me va a extrañar, al suspirar
Porque el suspiro será por mí
Porque el vacío la hará sufrir

Me va a extrañar y sentirá
Que no habrá vida después de mí
Que no se puede vivir así

Me va a extrañar
Cuando tenga ganas de
Dormir y acariciar

Al mediodía era una aventura en
La cocina se divertía
Con mis ocurrencias y reía

Cada caricia le avivaba
El fuego a nuestra chimenea
Era sencillo pasar
El invierno en compañía

Me va a extrañar, al despertar
En sus paseos por el jardín
Cuando la tarde llegue a su fin

Me va a extrañar, al suspirar
Porque el suspiro será por mí
Porque el vacío la hará sufrir

Me va a extrañar y sentirá
Que no habrá vida después de mí
Que no se puede vivir así

Me va a extrañar
Cuando tenga ganas de
Dormir y acariciar

Me va a extrañar y sentirá
Que no habrá vida después de mí
Que no se puede vivir así

Cuando el dia llege a su fin
Cuando tenga ganas de dormir
Me va a extrañar

",Me Va Extranar (Unchain My Heart),2006
Ricardo Montaner,"Juré que no iba a verte
Mucho menos a enloquecerme
Pero no sé
Que has hecho en mi
Es tu veneno que lentamente
Se apodera de mis deseos 
Y me ahogan todos tus besos
No puedo hablar
Solo sentir 
Como estremeces todo mi cuerpo

Y tu bien sabes que no fui yo
No es culpable la situación
Que quede claro por esta vez 
Que sólo eres tu
Solamente tu
La que con dulzura entiende mis palabras 
Y ama mi locura
La que me domina con una sonrisa
Pintada en sus labios
La que entrega todo sin pedirme nada
Sólo que la ame
La que en silencio logra todo en mi
Sólo con un beso 

Quisiera vestir tu cuerpo 
De caricias que llevo dentro 
Y disfrutar un poco más
Hasta perderme por un momento 

Y tu bien sabes que no fui yo
Es culpable la situación
Que quede claro por esta vez oh
Que sólo eres tu
Solamente tu
La que con dulzura entiende mis palabras 
Y ama mi locura
La que me domina con una sonrisa
Pintada en sus labios
La que entrega todo sin pedirme nada
Sólo que la ame
La que en silencio logra todo en mi
Sólo con un beso

Ricardo Montaner,"Mírame en nada me consigo concentrar
Ando despistado todo lo hago mal
Soy un desastre y no sé qué está pasando
Me gustas a rabiar, yo te deseo

Me llegas a desesperar
Es tan grande lo que siento por ti
Que tenerte no bastará
¿Qué es esto que me invita a vivir?

¿Qué me da la ilusión?
¿Qué será esa fuerza que a todos
Nos une de dos en dos?
¿Será la fuerza del corazón?

Hace que te abrace
Y los cuerpos lleguen a estorbar
Tiemblo sólo con la idea de rozar
Tus labios llenos de besos nuevos

No puedo dormir, robas mi tranquilidad
Alguien ha bordado tu cuerpo
Con hilos de mi ansiedad
De cinturón tuis piernas cruzadas

En mi espalda un reloj
Donde tus dedos son las agujas
Y dan cuerda a este motor
Que es la fuerza del corazón

Y es la fuerza que te eleva
Que te empuja y que te llena
Que te arrastra y que te acerca a Dios
Es un sentimiento casi una obsesión

Si la fuerza es del corazón
Es algo que te lía una descarga de energía
Que te va quitando la razón
Te hace tropezar, te crea confusión

Seguro que es la fuerza del corazón
Es la fuerza que te lleva
No puedo pensar, tendría que cuidarme más
Como a poco pierdo la vida y luego me la das

¿Qué es lo que va cegando al amante
Que va por ahí de señor?
Y no es más que un chiquillo
Travieso, provocador
¿Será la fuerza del corazón?

Y es la fuerza

",La Fuerza del Corazón,2007
Ricardo Montaner,"Fuiste ave de paso, y no sé porque razón
Me fui acostumbrando, cada día más a ti
Los dos inventamos, la aventura del amor
Llenaste mi vida, y después te vi partir
Sin decirme adiós, yo te vi partir

Quiero en tus manos abiertas buscar mi camino
Y que te sientas mujer solamente conmigo
Hoy tengo ganas de ti, hoy tengo ganas de ti
Quiero apagar en tus labios la sed de mi alma

Y descubrir el amor juntos cada mañana
Hoy tengo ganas de ti, hoy tengo ganas de ti
No hay nada más triste, que el silencio y el dolor
Nada más amargo, que saber que te perdí

Hoy busco en la noche, el sonido de tu voz
Y donde te escondes, para llenarme de ti
Llenarme de ti, llenarme de ti
Quiero en tus manos abiertas buscar mi camino

Y que te sientas mujer solamente conmigo
Hoy tengo ganas de ti, hoy tengo ganas de ti
Quiero apagar en tus labios la sed de mi alma
Y descubrir el amor juntos cada mañana

Hoy tengo ganas de ti, hoy tengo ganas de ti
Hoy tengo ganas de ti, hoy tengo ganas de ti

",Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti,2007
Ricardo Montaner,"La noche se perdió en tu pelo
La luna se aferró a tu piel
Y el mar se sintió celoso
Y quiso en tus ojos
Estar él también

Tu boca sensual, peligrosa
Tus manos la dulzura son
Tu aliento fatal fuego lento
Que quema mis ansias
Y mi corazón

Ternura que sin prisa apura
Caricias que brinda el amor
Caprichos muy despacio dichos
Entre la penumbra
De un suave interior

Te quiero y ya nada me importa
La vida lo ha dictado así
Si quieres yo te doy el mundo
Pero no me pidas que no te ame así

Si quieres yo te doy el mundo
Pero no me pidas que no te ame así
Que no te ame así
Que no te ame así

Invadido por la ausencia

De mis manos a tu altar 
Con agua bendita de tu fuente 
Bésame toda la frente

Esa manera de besar.

Besa mis campos y mis flores 
Con tus gotitas de colores 
Besa la lluvia 
Que resbala en la ventana 
Besa mi vida y mis cenizas 
Y me dirás que voy de prisa 
Bésame y deja con un grito 
Que lo logre. 
Besa el torrente de ilusiones 
Bésame todas las pasiones 
Besa mi río hasta su desembocadura 
Besa mi vida y mis cenizas

Besa mis días y mis noches, 
Mis diluvios y mi cielo a pleno sol.

La canción que necesito
Suena a historia triste
A melancolía
Y a caricias que no di jamas

Y cuando estas cerca de mi
La canción que necesito
Suena a amor bonito
A pasión sorpresa
A regalo que aun no abrí

Adonde vas sin mí
Adonde vas sin mí
Adonde va tu amor
Tu corazón
Y tu promesa
Adonde, va

Si ahora es cierto que te vas
La canción que necesito
Para ahogar de pena
Suena a amor solito
Que se muere despacito

Adonde vas sin mí
Adonde vas sin mí
Adonde va tu amor
Tu corazón
Y tu promesa

Voy a buscar una canción que le haga daño a mi dolor
Que me haga mal
Que me corte hasta sangrar

Dime que la luna es roja
Que sus mejillas son de queso
Y que venden arcoíris

Y que el agua se mudo al desierto

Termina en un final de cuento

Voy burlando el tiempo
Voy jugando a hacer poemas
Y voy jugando a no pensar
Y a ser feliz

Desde la tarde que te vi
Con ese otro amor
Con quien elegiste estar
Mi certeza de saber
Que eras mía se murió

Y hago una poesía que te quite de mi mente
Hago una poesía que me duela y que te aleje
Se muere el viento mueren las flores
Se hace un desierto en dos corazones
Que se murieron

En un intento mágico
Quiero imaginarme
Que estas a punto de llegar
A punto de decir que ya
Ya volví abrázame

Hago una poesía que te quite de mi mente
Hago una poesía que me duela y que te aleje
Se muere el viento mueren las flores

Llanto inmenso, de amor
Llanto santo, de amor

Por entregarme el control
Por enseñarme a vivir
Porque me dejas a mi
Creer que digo que si
Porque una lágrima tuya
Seca una lágrima mía
Porque una sonrisa tuya
Son mas de mil risas juntas
Por ser mi alíada en la vida

Ricardo Montaner,"Llanto de tanto que me duele
El alma y la vida
Canto una canción
De melancolía
El cielo lloroso, llovizna y graniza

Y me duele tanto vivir
Que salto de la noche
Al fondo del día
Intento ahogar su amor, su luz de la mía
Y de mis dedos cada caricia

Solo por buscar, yo la busco
Para nunca encontrarla
Y aunque no se donde esta
En mi olvido jamas
En mi olvido jamas
Llanto, llanto que le hace llorar a mi vida
Tanto que me hace sufrir esta soledad
Voy a convertir mi llanto en un mar
O en un mar de llanto

Llanto eres capaz de abrir mis heridas
Llanto amargaste mi luna y mi miel
Llanto de fe
Llanto sin fe
Soy un mar de llanto

Llanto
De tanto recostarte en mi hombro
Me duele
Tanto que te puse la otra mejilla
Un día una lagrima y un día otra encima
Es que arde tanto vivir
Arde como en el alcohol mi cortada
Arde como arde mi voz sin su agua
Y nada me apaga, y nada me calma

Solo por buscar, yo la busco
Para nunca encontrarla
Y aunque no se donde esta
En mi olvido jamas
En mi olvido jamas

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on

There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town
But no local yokel gonna shut me down
'Cause me and my boys got this rig unwound
And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town

Nothin' ever happened 'round my hometown
And I ain't the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone callin' my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway

Everybody told me you can't get far
On thirty-seven dollars and a jap guitar
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
And a rockin' little combo from the Guitar Town

Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault
I love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant wonderin' why I don't stop

Gotta keep rockin' why I still can
I gotta two pack habit and a motel tan
But when my boots hit the boards I'm a brand new man
With my back to the riser I make my stand

And hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight
We're loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight
One of these days I'm gonna settle down
And take you back with me to the Guitar Town",Guitar Town,2006
Riccardo Arrighini,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day

Riccardo Cocciante,"Quando finisce un amore così 
Così com'è finito il mio
Senza una ragione né un motivo
Senza niente
Ti senti un nodo nella gola
Ti senti un buco nello stomaco
Ti senti vuoto nella testa 
E non capisci niente
E non ti basta più un amico 
E non ti basta più distrarti
E non ti basta bere da ubriacarti
E non ti basta ormai più niente
E in fondo pensi, ci sarà un motivo
E cerchi a tutti I costi una ragione
Eppure non c'è mai una ragione
Perché un amore debba finire

E vorresti cambiare faccia
E vorresti cambiare nome
E vorresti cambiare aria
E vorresti cambiare vita
E vorresti cambiare il mondo
Ma sai perfettamente
Che non ti servirebbe a niente

Perché c'è lei, perché c'è lei
Perché c'è lei, perché c'è lei
Perché c'è lei nelle tue ossa
Perché c'è lei nella tua mente
Perché c'è lei nella tua vita
E non potresti più mandarla via
Nemmeno se cambiassi faccia
Nemmeno se cambiassi nome
Nemmeno se cambiassi aria
Nemmeno se cambiassi vita
Nemmeno se cambiasse il mondo

Però, se potessi ragionarci sopra
Saprei perfettamente 
Che domani sarà diverso
Lei non sarà più lei, io 
Non sarò lo stesso uomo
Magari l'avrò già dimenticata, magari 
Ma se potessi ragionarci sopra
E se potessi ragionarci sopra 
Ma non posso, perché

Riccardo Cocciante,"E solcherò il tuo corpo
Come se fosse terra
Cancellerò quei segni
Dell'ultima tua guerra

E brucerò col fuoco
Quest'erba tua cattiva
E ti farò con l'acqua
Più fertile e più viva

E pregherò che il sole
Asciughi questo pianto
E pregherò che il tempo
Guarisca le ferite

Poi costruirò una serra
Intorno al tuo sorriso
Farò della tua vita
Un altro paradiso

Sarò il tuo contadino
E tu la terra mia
Combatterò col vento
Che non ti porti via

Poi spargerò il mio seme
Nella tua verde valle
E aspetteremo insieme
Che venga primavera
Che venga primavera

",Primavera,1994
Riccardo Cocciante,"E adesso siediti su quella seggiola,
stavolta ascoltami senza interrompere,
è tanto tempo che volevo dirtelo.
Vivere insieme a te è stato inutile,
tutto senza allegria, senza una lacrima,
niente da aggiungere ne da dividere,
nella tua trappola ci son caduto anch'io,
avanti il prossimo, gli lascio il posto mio.

Povero diavolo, che pena mi fa,
e quando a letto lui ti chiederà di più
tu glielo concederai perché tu fai così,
come sai fingere se ti fa comodo.
E adesso so chi sei e non ci soffro più,
e se verrai di là te lo dimostrerò,
e questa volta tu te lo ricorderai.
E adesso spogliati come sai fare tu,
ma non illuderti, io non ci casco più,
tu mi rimpiangerai, bella senz'anima.

Riccardo Cocciante,"Io non posso stare fermo con le mani nelle mani
Tante cose devo fare prima che venga domani
E se lei già sta dormendo io non posso riposare
Farò in modo che al risveglio non mi possa più scordare
Perché questa lunga notte, non sia nera più del nero
Fatti grande dolce luna e riempi il cielo intero
E perché quel suo sorriso possa ritornare ancora
Splendi sole domattina come non hai fatto ancora

E per poi farle cantare, le canzoni che ha imparato
Io le costruirò un silenzio che nessuno ha mai sentito
Sveglierò tutti gli amanti, parlerò per ore ed ore
Abbracciamoci più forte, perché lei vuole l'amore

Poi corriamo per le strade e mettiamoci a ballare
Perché lei vuole la gioia, perché lei odia il rancore
E poi coi secchi di vernice coloriamo tutti i muri
Case, vicoli e palazzi, perché lei ama i colori
Raccogliamo tutti i fiori, che può darci primavera
Costruiamole una culla, per amarci quando è sera
Poi saliamo su nel cielo, e prendiamole una stella
Perché Margherita è buona, perché Margherita è bella

Perché Margherita è dolce, perché Margherita è vera
Perché Margherita ama, e lo fa una notte intera
Perché Margherita è un sogno, perché Margherita è il sale

Perché Margherita è tutto, ed è lei la mia pazzia

Un giorno in più che passa, ormai
Con questo amore che non è grande come vorrei

Storie come amici perduti
Che cambiano strada, se li saluti
Storie che non fanno rumore
Come una stanza chiusa a chiave
Storie che non hanno futuro
Come un piccolo punto su un grande muro
Dove scriverci un rigo
A una donna che non c'è più

Un giorno in più che se ne va
Un uomo stanco che nessuno ascolterà
Per tutti quelli così come noi
Senza trionfi, né grossi guai
Un giorno in più che passa, ormai
Con questo amore che non è bello come vorrei

Storie come anelli di fumo
In un posto lontano, senza nessuno
Solo una notte che non finisce mai
Un giorno in più che se ne va
Dimenticato tra i rumori di città

Con questo amore che non è forte come vorrei",Storie Di Tutti I Giorni,2003

Tempo ignora i miei silenzi per il troppo sgomento 
Tempo ignora, per un momento 

La cercavo per le strade 
come un pirata innamorato 
Avevo finito la benzina 
E il fiato l'avevo tutto sprecato 
Per parlare con i passanti 
Per ordinare ancora da bere 
Poi tuffarmi nei peccati 
Di quelle maledette sere. 

Tempo ignora i miei errori fuori argomento 
Tempo ignora i miei silenzi per il troppo sgomento 
Tempo ignora per un momento 

Perchè dai miei sogni sei fuggita 
Come un lampo mi hai strappato il cuore 
E già non ti riuscivo più a vedere 
E intanto passavano le ore 

così me ne stavo accovacciato 
Dietro un palo della luce 
Come se la solitudine illuminata 
Possa portare un po' di pace 

E se io sono un ladro di emozioni 
O forse un poeta che ha perso le parole 
Ora ho un amore da soffocare 
Con le mie canzoni rimaste da sole 

Tempo ignora i miei errori fuori argomento 
Tempo ignora i miei silenzi per il troppo sgomento 
Tempo ignora per un momento 

Sento ancora la sua voce 
Che mi rincorre per le scale 
Mi perseguita senza motivo 
Non mi vuol lasciar stare 

Dentro alle notti senza sonno 
Nei miei incubi peggiori 
Sotto il mio letto che va in fiamme 
E il mio corpo in preda a malori 

Ma disperarsi non è grande affare 
In fondo è solo soltanto la vita 
A volte si vince 
A volte si perde 
Poi ricomincia la partita 

E quei castelli campati in aria 
Prima o poi se ne volano via 
E tu con loro sarai andata 
E mai sarai più mia

Need you by my side, girl you'll be my bride.
You'll never be denied everlasting love.
From the very start, open up your heart,
Be a lasting part of everlasting love.
Real love will last forever.
 
Ooh, ooh.
Where life's river flows, no one really knows
'til someone's there to show the way to lasting love.
Like the sun that shines, endlessly it shine,
You always will be mine. It's everlasting love.
When other loves are gone, ours will still be strong,
We have our very own everlasting love.
Real love will last forever.
You give me, you give me, you give me everlasting love

Ricchi e Poveri,"Paese mio che stai sulla collina
Disteso come un vecchio addormentato
La noia l'abbandono niente
Solo la tua malattia
Paese mio ti lascio io vado via

Che sarà che sarà che sarà?
Che sarà della mia vita chi lo sa?
So far tutto o forse niente
Da domani si vedrà
E sarà, sarà quel che sarà

Amore mio ti bacio sulla bocca
Che fu la fonte del mio primo amore
Ti do l'appuntamento
Come e quando non lo so
Ma so soltanto che ritornerò
Che sarà che sarà che sarà?
Che sarà della mia vita chi lo sa?
Come porto la chitarra
Se la notte piangerò
Una nenia di paese suonerò

Gli amici miei son quasi tutti via
E gli altri partiranno dopo me
Peccato perché stavo bene
In loro compagnia
Ma tutto passa tutto se ne va

Che sarà che sarà che sarà?
Che sarà della mia vita chi lo sa?
So far tutto o forse niente
Da domani si vedrà
E sarà, e sarà, sarà quel che sarà

Che sarà che sarà che sarà?
Che sarà della mia vita chi lo sa?
So far tutto o forse niente
Da domani si vedrà
E sarà, sarà quel che sarà",Che Sará,2001

Piccolo piccolo piccolo amore mio

Piccolo piccolo piccolo amore

Dolce come il suono della pioggia sopra i tetti
Bello come quando torno a casa e tu mi aspetti
Strano e colorato come un film americano io ti amo

Forte come il gusto della grappa contadina
Bianco come il trenta di dicembre la mattina
Sotto questo cielo preso da una cartolina siamo soli

Piccolo piccolo piccolo amore
Piccolo piccolo piccolo amore

Grande amore detto all'ultimo gettone
Vero come il caldo di un abbracio alla stazione
Bello como quando posso stringerti la mano io ti amo

Prepotente come il bacio che ci ha fatto innamorare
Diffidente come un gatto nel lasciarsi accarezzare
See'e una cosa di piu di tutte che non so dimenticare io ti amo

Piccolo piccolo piccolo amore

Invitante come l'aria di una notte in piena estate
Delicato come il suono delle vecchie serenate
Questa sera sotto un cielo con
Le stelle appiccicate siamo soli

And I mention we gone.

Right on right on

Give it to em shawty

I'm eons and eons beyond these peon's
Another human like me there will never be one
The planet that I'm from, I can't even speak on
The stars is what I sleep on
The moon I put my feet on
The way my aura glow, you swear I'm made of neon
Cooler than the freon on, its in your dodge neon
They say the future is now, to me it hasn't begun
Stay tuned to me and their will never be a re-run
So come and leap on my body and as we come
You'll probably feel moist like the trees on the tropics
We gone we gone, we out it, no we don't need rockets
We hope up on the mother ship an we gone, we sliding
We slipping through dimensions, we hyper space gliding
Blasting through the atmosphere
Frightening in the lightening
I know I'm out my mind girl, but you know you like it
So hope up on my cosmic highway so we can ride it

Shorty are you going my way
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
(Ooh) let's go (Ooh) let's go
Shorty I cant take earth no more
Another galaxy we must go

Well, fresh up out the sky I'm like a meteorite
So when the studio, no I don't need to write
Man I just came up in the game cause y'all just needed more light
So, so by the time I'm done their ain't gonna be no more mics
And people ask me B.o.B what kind of language is that
Cause I may blast into the future, I may never come back
And I'm a leave with a thirty thousand a night yearly
Headed to a distant planet called B.o.B
And then I'm gone, man they not ignoring me
Taking off from half court Air Jordan'
All systems go in  ten seconds I'm orbiting
Hanging in the cosmos like a space ornament
Heat 'em up like a solar flare oh yes I bring the pain
Similar to asteroid that's headed to your brain
My lane is something that they really cannot explain
They try to hold me down but  man it's me that they cant contain

Shorty are you going my way
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
(Ooh) Let's go (ooh) let's go
Shorty I cant take earth no more
Another galaxy we must go

Come and go with me, I'll take you to my galaxy
I'm talking Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mars, Mars
And I'm saying girl, I'll ride all night
And I need you for this ship to take flight
Let's go, let's go
Come on baby let me take it off
Another second we gone blast it off

Look shorty are you going my way
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway

Hey yeah, ooh now

[Chorus]
If I had one wish, that wish would be clear
That I would not have to go, that I could stay here
And although it hurts me, to leave you all alone
Just know I'll come back to you, for now I am gone

For now I am gone, for now I am gone (gone)
For now I am gone, for now I am, gone (for now I am gone)
For now I am gone, for now I am gone (gone)
For now I am gone, for now I am, gone (for now I am gone)

When I'm dead and gone don't even worry
Don't mourn me too long, death'll get you discouraged
Keepin' your vision blurry, prison and mentally hurtin'
I know it for certain if I'm really restin' in heaven
No need for you to fear, don't cry
Cause death won't forever have a grip on our lives
So I'm a be comin', be ready for the next shine
Cause I'm a believer that I'll see a resurrection
Don't believe that I'll burn in hell
I study the scriptures and they learn me well
No trippin', no drippin', no purgatory I dwell
I sleep, I rest in piece 'til I prevail
It's just a temporary lay down, I won't forever stay down
So keep me in your memory, don't let me fade out
I'll probably never see you at the crossroads
Guess I was wrong, I'm gone gone, long gone

[Chorus]

We hit the road back in 1993
Had a vision like a prophet, the project was go see
The logic was so deep, I come back and do a lotta good
I heard the callin' so I headed out to Hollywood
One-way tickets, my niggas and no fear
Some said that we was trippin', the mission was so clear
Don't wanna go there, the money was over there
I still love ya 9-9, I miss ya St. Clair
Yeah, now I'm movin' on a roller coaster
Just ridin', tryin' to be Jehovah's soldier
And I'm grindin', tryin' to make it better for ya
So for now I best be gone, be gone
I made a vow to change the world somehow
I'm a impact it and see it in this lifetime
On the dark road to bring back the sunshine
But for now I'm gone - I gotta go get it

[Chorus]

If it's out there to get, then I'm a go and get it
Get it 'til I got nothin' left, chasin' better livin'
It's a 'tinuous mission, so I'm steady movin'
And I gotta get it in, never settle for losin'
I'm a Thug true, add to or get out the way
You could settle for less, but I need more on my plate
Eatin' good, family good
Okay 'til that day I'm a get up and move, move
Show my babies how the Thug do, ooh
I'm a play it like it's my last game
If it's due better give it up right away
Cause a thug nigga's gonna bring pressure
See me fucked up, starvin' nigga, never
And as long as niggas out here gettin' paid
Back to my old ways, who they gonna run and tell, huh?
It's a street thang, c'mon

[Chorus]

Yeah we ready, back up in 'em with nothin' but the harmony rhythm
Hard hittin' flows all we give 'em
Flows that spit venom, no cop, there goes the end of 'em
Ever since the beginnin' we winnin' it
Get a glimpse of legends standin' on deck
'Til we come we'll be here holdin down the set
Keep on wonderin' what the Bone 'bout to do next
Still they humble and the hungriest, God bless

You know we go the hardest, no need to say we better than the rest

Catch ya ass at the red light
Wanna run at 'em sideways in a Hellcat
On some run flat
By the way I
Never seen a better view, not in Malibu
Bunch of bad bitches naked in the swimming pool
Hear the waves crashing, playing spades in the living room (Cracking)
Sound like a Doggystyle interlude

One time for the West Coast
LA, the Bay, from Sacramento out to San Diego, California

And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

Palm trees in the air, the top pushed back
Blowing smoke out the roof cookies to be exact
I'm always in Cali cause this is where it's at
Bitches, bud, good weather, what you know bout that
Where all the fly bitches ride Benzs and Beamers
They either wanna be an actress, or a singer
I'm at the strip club on Sunset, throwing singles
With this bad bitch from Compton, pouring lean up
Breaking down backwoods, rolling gasoline up
Left the Laugh Factory, pulled up in Inglewood
I fuck with some crips and I fuck with some bloods
And I fuck with some esé
My stash house in the Valley
Welcome to my palace
Just went and killed two shows out in Dallas
Selling OG from LA and crates from the Bay

I had to take a trip to Cali for the best bud
I been chilling with the goons, yeah the real thugs
Went to Sacramento nigga met a real plug
I said I'm looking for the gas where the kill at
Want the strong gotta go where the hill at
I met a bad bopper chilling out in Frisco
Like to sip the lime-a-ritas and the sisco
I hopped my ass on the 101 and headed north
And when I hit the hill I found what I was looking for
I'm feeling like a leprechaun with a pot of gold
Bags of the gas yeah the Colonel got a soul
I fly a bitch from the A with 100 racks
Put her ass in a rental told her run it back
Fly another bitch in with 200 more
Welcome to California the State of gold

What makes you want to be that way
You cheated on me and you lied
You put teardrops in my eyes

   I found out what they say is true
   I hope someday that you'll be blue
   And then you'll know dear why I cry
   With these teardrops in my eyes

I heard the rumors all around
That someday you'd let me down
I turn my head when gossip flies
Cause it puts teardrops in my eyes

Rice Brothers,"There are songs that birds don't sing to people
There are secrets you keep right through to the end
There are heros they hide until forever
And I'm singin' this song for one of them

He's the man that you passed on the road there
The one with his life on the loose
Goin' either somewhere or nowhere
Goin' without me without you

For he is this world's constant orphan
Travelin' out his long time
Livin' on apples from orchards
And dyin' from grapes on the vine

You can find him in big city winters
Out where the mission bell crys
And sorrow echos through the suburbs
And tries to close all his eyes

And dream of his railroad existance
As if it were some kind of dream
As if the extent of the distance
Were what his heart would go him

You can find him in Pittsburg at Christmas
You can find him in Buffalo in June
And he knows all the back roads between them
Like a Gypsy he pulls a broom

And it's route twenty-two all over again
Stake it well down and try to look like sombody's friend
Look strong at the men smile for the girls
Puzzle at the rest of the world

Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1956
Rich,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day

I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Who would ever thought that me and you would get the cream?
We took a lot of trips together, you stayed down
Remember when we start hoppin' on that Greyhound?

She say she like to play hide and seek in the ride
And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside
She say she think I'm cheatin' wit a girl named Jane
You ain't just my baby, bitch, you my everything

I was broke but you made things better
As long as me and you together, we can get this cheddar
Whatever, her name White Sally
I met her through my homeboy Rico out in Cali

I thank Reagan for the haters when ya got hard
You bought me jewels, Gator shoes and some big cars
Yeah, you took me out in the hood, gave me good thangs
Now we on a private plane eatin' chicken wings, come on

(And I love you)
You the reason why I ride good
You the reason why I shop good
Drink good, smoke good

(And I love you)
You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed
Candy on my old school

(And I love you)
You the reason why I quarterback
Took a nigga out the projects
Put me in a cul-de-sac

That's why I get it how I live, boy
'Cause you took me
From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy

And I love you, baby, muah, hugs and kisses
Fuck them niggas and fuck them bitches
Been in this game since 1998
Nigga, take the safety and shit but I'm great

Maybe it's fate, destiny, you tell me
Damn near ten and that shit been free
But I'm PT so I gots to cruise, nigga
Really ain't shit to prove to y'all niggas

All the cars, all the clothes
Wit all the stars and all the hoes
First class flights, a nigga live in the lights
But see you in the dark, this stuff is kinda hard

See where I park, valet costs a note
Drop another fifty just to check my coat
Probably leave wit yo' chick, know how I do
It's Pastor Disaster, baby, I love you

That's why I get it how I live, boy
'Cause you took me
From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy

Took me from a gun totin' nigga to a Big Boi
Too legit to slip, now I got papers on my shit, boi
And not just a weapon, I'm talkin' 'bout titles and deeds
You payin' rent you can't afford and can't break out of your lease

I'm out of your league, I might as well be Ivy
All over ya ass like injections in a stripper's hiney
Rhyming is a skill that requires timing
Like dual ejaculation while my lady's riding

I'm 'bout to cum, I'm 'bout to cum at the same time
Satisfied? I'm satisfied, that's how I slang mine

A generation came up under my style
From penetration of the nation when I was just a child
Now, who's really in the critics talk 'bout me?
Andre 3000 and three mo' niggas that's really fie

Let me break it down, I get fly at that mouth
I stay fresh to the hosiery we 'posed to be
Them niggas from the South
So one to the two, the three, the fo'
Satisfied? I'm satisfied, so I'ma get 'cha some mo'

They got that...
They got that kryptonite...

[Verse 1:]
It seems the more I try to do right,
The more I lie about being at sessions and leaving at certain times,
She's like, ""Where you at?""
I'm at the studio at home,
and I'm thinking to myself we cut that record days ago
Cause shorty on the east side, hit me and want to know if I could stop by,
Now I'm contemplating what I am gonna say, bout this being the umpteenth time that I'm late

[Chorus:]
I wanna be your superman,
I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can,
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
These girls got kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
And I really wanna make it work, but I cant stop messing round,
I keep doing dirt,
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
These girls got kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
Oh baby

[Verse 2:]
It's like the more I brush them off, the more they call,
The more I want to tell them that I'm not involved,
With anyone, when I know it's you,
Wanna tell the truth but it's just so hard to do,
Caught up in me again it's driving me crazy
It's the reason I won't tell em i got a lady,
Now I'm trying to contemplate on what I am gonna say, on this being the umpteenth time that I'm late

[Bridge:]
No matter what I do, I know that your my true love,
But I just cant help it to get caught up with all these broads,
Sittin' here with this mic in my hand,
Trying to make all the words to make my baby understand

[Chorus:]

oooh yeah yeah

[Verse 3:]
I want you to be my Louis Lane,
Girl I promise I'm gonna change, and it ain't gonna be this way forever,
Girl I'm gonna get myself together, cause your the one I love,
Because your like a drug that I can't get enough of,
I'm just so confused, don't know what to do,
Cause the way that it's feeling, I like how it's feeling,
It's getting so hard, to fight that feeling

[Rap: Rich Boy]
I'm a rich boy riding in my big superstar shit,
The one girls try to get they text me on my sidekick
Bring em to my palace, tell em take it off we make a flick,
Every night I do it so at least one chick I gotta get
Just like kryptonite them girls make me super weak,
Suck my dick and play with me until they put me straight to sleep,
Twenty girls on my sheets, seven days out the week,
It's hard trying to hold it down with groupies trying to get with me,
I stay dreaming, fantasizing, with my eyes closed,
I love you girl but I'm addicted to them hoes
If ballin' is a sin then God please forgive me,

So just my ghetto queen gon' take that ride

Look here lil'momma I'm gangsta
Prolly nothin like you done delt with on the day to day
Some say that I'm a star, but in the hood I'm better known as Trae
I'm from around the way - where not too many make it out
And even if I did it's in my blood I'll never take it out
You say you got a man but I ain't tryna take his spot
I'm tryna be ya partna while I'm late night flippin on the block
So we can post up on this glass, tippin the Chevrolet 
And get it, how we get it, then I'm gettin right back out ya way
I'm in my zone so all that drama you can leave at home
Ya man can lock you down, but me ain't nothin - rollin stone
And if you wanna chill tell his ass to leave you alone
Cause if he run up on me, I'm a run my fist upside his dome
Understand when I say I'm grown, and on that other shit
I'm tryna make a team but I ain't feelin all that lover shit
I'm tryna hit the lights and take it to you on that rubber shit
And keep it G, and leave it on that undercover shit

Ay lay back with me, feel free lil'momma
We can go the Bahamas in the summer
Lookin for the fat[? ], fuck the dumb hoes
And know that you'll ride with me baby fuck the po - po's
No pressure I ain't gotta test ya
I can leave you in my house with a hundred thousand on the dresser
Me and you - my beautiful bitch, so glamorous
So bad niggas pullin out they cameras
Together baby the world can't handle us
Hoes can't compete, no challengers
Summer time, we float on the boat
While I sip a lil'lean, and you puff a lil'smoke
I'm married to my money, but you could be my honey
The groupie bitches dump me - but I know that you love me
So on that note you can take this
Me and you be shinin harder then them diamonds on my wrist, M.O.B!

[Chorus: Lloyd]

[Verse 3: Rich Boy]
We can ride in my drop and spend some money on some Fendi
You never ask what type of gold diggers try to get me
Them hoes are silly, but I pass 'em in the Hemi
If a mothafucker touch you - I'm a hit 'em with that semi
You down like my nigga, so you know I got yo'back
Anybody put they hands on you, I'm a lay 'em flat
So spread ya wings baby come on let's fly
I'm down with my lady till the day that I die

[Verse 4: Trae]
Say lil'momma what you waitin on - actin like you don't know no better
You say you tired of that shit, then roll with me and it's whatever
When in the presence of a gangsta don't worry I got ya
And fuck the stress, give me a sec - I'm a get that up out ya
So get ya spot I'm on the grind right now
I'm prolly less then two seconds away from shine right now

Where niggas tote semi-automatics, bustin' them K's
Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police
Still gettin' pulled over and asked by the police

'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of ya skin get 'cha put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sendin' niggas to the pen or the funeral home

I be feelin' like the Lord'll never answer me back
So I'm holdin' on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in ya house'll make it hard to sleep
Ya see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap

Can't explain how I feel growin' up in the gutter
Told my mama that I love her put nobody above her
Doin' crimes, a hard time for food on the plate
Know a couple of niggas ain't never comin' out the gate

Movin' weight the only thing them street niggas know
Servin' thangs at school, they never teach 'em, don't show
But a 44'll get 'cha money fast from robbin'
Do or die situation when ya tired, be stavin'

Got a couple white packs 'cause they fiend for that
Early five in the mornin', pigs showin' they badge
Real niggas in the street still showin' they rags

Speed bumps in the road start slowin' me down
See them fake niggas actin' like they know me now
Got a chance to advance, so I'm makin' my move
Couple o' people still thinkin' they got somethin' to prove

Niggas dyin' everyday 'cause they wanna be hard

Still totin' my piece 'cause it ain't nothin' like the movies

See my Bentley, what I got when my two Phantoms had a baby
I'm not crazy, why you lazy? I get so politely daisy
Fuck you, pussy nigga, pay me my Lambo do 'bout 280

I sellin', heard you tellin', thought you killin' while you stealin'
Thought you dealin' while you chillin', you ain't ballin' with a million
God made me super rich, the devil made you stupid, bitch
You could be just like me if you quit with all that stupid shit

Why you actin' hard now you must want go see God now?
The same niggas you were beefin' with are up in your yard now
If you bout to run dogg, I guess you better start now
Forgot to bring your gun so you got to use your heart now

It's hard to get rich but it ain't shit to go to hell
It's hard to sell dope but it ain't shit to go to jail
It's hard to keep it real but it ain't shit for you to tell
I smoked so much of this that I can't even hide the smell

So drop
Drop, drop, drop
Now drop
Drop, drop, drop

We marijuana farmers, all our rides look like Transformers
Tell the pretty girls to pull they titties out and dance for us
You don't need a Gym Class, crack like Slim Fast
Take a hit and loss a fuckin' hundred pounds quick fast

Snow cone with a chain on and deep off or chain off
My blunt goin' kick the game off, we never take the game off
Find a hater, sign a hater, let him see my elevator
Hundreds in my refrigerator, now they know we gettin' paper
Find a hater, sign a hater, let him see my elevator
Hundreds in my refrigerator, now they know we gettin' paper

Pullin' coupes and escalators, enemies on respirators
Million dollar generators, 90 fast investigators
For flashy cars, the prison bars, ménage à trois
The playin' cards I swear it's hard, now drop

Rich Boy,"I remember when I met 'cha, I was only sixteen
Who would ever thought that me and you would get the cream?
We took a lot of trips together, you stayed down
Remember when we start hoppin' on that Greyhound?

She say she like to play hide and seek in the ride
And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside
She say she think I'm cheatin' wit a girl named Jane
You ain't just my baby, bitch, you my everything

I was broke but you made things better
As long as me and you together, we can get this cheddar
Whatever, her name White Sally
I met her through my homeboy Rico out in Cali

I thank Reagan for the haters when ya got hard
You bought me jewels, Gator shoes and some big cars
Yeah, you took me out in the hood, gave me good thangs
Now we on a private plane eatin' chicken wings, come on

You the reason why I ride good
You the reason why I shop good
Drink good, smoke good

(And I love you)
You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed
Candy on my old school

(And I love you)
You the reason why I quarterback
Took a nigga out the projects
Put me in a cul-de-sac

That's why I get it how I live, boy
'Cause you took me
From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy

And I love you, baby, muah, hugs and kisses
Fuck them niggas and fuck them bitches
Been in this game since 1998
Nigga, take the safety and shit but I'm great

Maybe it's fate, destiny, you tell me
Damn near ten and that shit been free
But I'm PT so I gots to cruise, nigga
Really ain't shit to prove to y'all niggas

All the cars, all the clothes
Wit all the stars and all the hoes
First class flights, a nigga live in the lights
But see you in the dark, this stuff is kinda hard

See where I park, valet costs a note
Drop another fifty just to check my coat
Probably leave wit yo' chick, know how I do
It's Pastor Disaster, baby, I love you

Took me from a gun totin' nigga to a Big Boi
Too legit to slip, now I got papers on my shit, boi
And not just a weapon, I'm talkin' 'bout titles and deeds
You payin' rent you can't afford and can't break out of your lease

I'm out of your league, I might as well be Ivy
All over ya ass like injections in a stripper's hiney
Rhyming is a skill that requires timing
Like dual ejaculation while my lady's riding

I'm 'bout to cum, I'm 'bout to cum at the same time
Satisfied? I'm satisfied, that's how I slang mine

A generation came up under my style
From penetration of the nation when I was just a child
Now, who's really in the critics talk 'bout me?
Andre 3000 and three mo' niggas that's really fie

Let me break it down, I get fly at that mouth
I stay fresh to the hosiery we 'posed to be

So one to the two, the three, the fo'

It was a girl named Shanda
Drove a Honda
Stayed talking back and get smart with her mama
The real grown type
She was always right
Couldn?t get along with Pops cause they stayed in a fight
If it ain?t skipping school going out with grown men
Better your man named Sam with a white Benz
He used to take her out and buy Shanda the world
And even told Shanda 
You my only girl
One night it was late, they kissing and hugging
Next thing you know they kissing and loving
Two days go by and Sam ain?t showed up
Now Shanda on the bathroom floor sick throwing up
Mamma found out and had Sam arrested
Now Shanda at the doctor?s cause she wanna get tested
When the results came back it was positive
That?s the thing about life; you learn and you live

It was a girl named Courtney
She was fine as hell
She was looking for a man with a lotta mail
She had big dreams about the real good life
And everything she wanted had a real high price
Like Dolce Gabbana, Gucci and Prada
So if you ain?t spend big Courtney ain?t holler
She all about the dollar, but let?s go way back
When Courtney was going with this hard working cat
A drug dealer came along and ?
Next thing you know she was taking it right
We part of the reason why she at where she at
Now her ex-man got a million dollar car jack
His pockets are fed but Courtney is still broke
Cause her old man got caught with a lil dope
She stuck with two kids and no child support
I did it for girls taking life for a joke

Shakin' my wrist might just start a snowstorm

I'm a ball on, make that ass roll
Pussy look like gold comin' down that pole

Got the whole club outta control
Fake ballers in the bitch throwin' rent money, stupid bitch
I laugh at that shit, what you wanna do?
I got hundred dollar bills, tens and twenties too

All these thick girls that I wanna take home
Throwin' big faces until they all gone
While I watch all these girls take off they thong

Mr. DJ, won't you turn up my song?
Bouncin' that ass, I don't see nothin' wrong
One bitch, two or three bankrolls
Eighty-five thousand dollars worth of Russian rose gold

Take a picture of ya broad, put it in my iPod

Rich Boyz,"Chorus:
If you ain't wit my team you can get stomped out
When I get crunked on get stomped out
If you hatin on my team you can get stomped out
Get stomped out, get stomped out

[Verse:1]

Now the kid is back,
I'm not Michael Joradn but I'm coming back
Kinda like Pierce in Boston the truth is back
Got a dez on my team but his name ain't Shaq
Yeah my team is stacked, I only roll with the best
And yeah I'm leading the pack like my name was Ron Artest
Best believe I got my back brotha,
My cell on the right and lattrell on the left, huh
And I know things are gonna heat up,
When I watch the Suns and Heat I catch a fevea
That don't stop me from jumpin' up
And like Kobe Bryant jam my 360 dunk
It don't matta, I come cross to shake it dawgg
Like A.I. I'll break our ankles dawgg
I'm kinda like Shaq, no one could hold me
The only way to stop pme is if you foul and throw me

[Chorus:2x]

[Verse:2]

Ummm, let's get it crakin' like Jason Kidd I make it happen
Go through the legs I dunk the ball
I'm like Vince Carter I'm 1/2 amazing dawgg
Get rings like Detroit, I'll bend you like Ben Wallace
I'm going to the pro's then going to college
Ain't Lebron James, but the youngest in the game
And I put it through the net, like I was from New Jersey
Catch me in Philly with a throwback jersey
I like games with a real good pace
That's why I'm watching Indiana take on Yao Ming
I'm number one like Tracy McGrady
My jump shot daily the gotta pay me
Born to ball my game just so sick
My jump off os like my handles it's so tricky

[Chorus:2x]

I live my life the way I want I got nothing to hide nothing at all life is not a
Fairy tale life they should know that life is real.

A friend of mine gave me an advice he said be careful and think twice before you talk about your life protect yourself just keep quiet the more they know the harder they try to spoil your ways to spread lies and even though I know he could be right I just said i..

I live my life the way I want I got nothing to hide nothing at all life is not a fairy tale life is about more cause life is real.

Rich Brian,"I'm givin' my number to any bitch
Lookin' like Ronda
I'm gonna stall, I'm takin' many pics
I'm thinkin' 'bout havin' many kids
Even some are gon' be like, ""Goddamn that's a lot of kids""
Hit 'em with a, get 'em with out of the hits
I'm thinkin' will I put 'em out of the bitch
$uicideBoy$, kill ‘em all, rest in piss
Sip on La Croix the buzz that I missed
Talkin' 'bout somethin' that I never did
I talk to myself, and all my seven chicks
They love to go down, dawg, like your relevance
I'm a rapper, but my name isn't Chance
Come to my show, people think I'm intense
Don't look at me, somethin' wrong with your lens
One day the money's gon' be for the Benz
Flow be so dirty, it needed a cleanse
I'm in my zone, I went through this shit alone
Didn't have no friends, talk to myself we always get along
I'm still learnin', I'm still fuckin' up
Correct me if I'm wrong
Talkin' business more than usual that means I'm out with Sean (88)
Never yellowin' my urinal, I'm always drinkin' on that Pellegrino
I been rockin' my own merch, I'm makin' way more green than CeeLo
I saw people from my school, they all turned out to be some weirdos
I don't need no education, Internet's my favorite teacher
Ayy, ayy

Told 'em, told 'em
Told that bitch that I don't really give a fuck 'bout you
Told that man that he gotta quit it, it ain't cool
Makin' up for the competition that I ain't do
As a teen, all the fighting and 'em wars virtual
Now I'm gettin' old (now I'm gettin' old), and my dick is gettin' older
Keep 7 bitches on my phone like a folder
Wonder what 18, man I was a toddler
Damn, home school felt like yesterday
I worked at my mom's cafe
Met a girl like every day
It's my only social place
They thought I was from LA
No I'm not, but now I'm here
Tryna fill my parents' plate
They call me up like every day
People say I'm good, they say I get what I should
Tell me not to worry, everything will go real smooth
People think I'm Dory, I'm forgettin' 'bout my hood
Man should I be sorry for just doin' somethin' new?
Man these dudes, gotta be more quiet than they think
They be hella sure, but I always say Amen
Do the shit for the people that look like me
So the girls can't see them when they think of me
And not that kid that throw that fit

Staring at my screen I need a fuckin' window

Damn it feel good to be a boss
Eyes wide open like I'm smokin' on the rocks
Never spent bread even though I got a lot
Still like to rap even though I sing a lot
Money flipper, I'm earnin' burnin' Catalina wine mixer
Workin' out so much, you might just see me on the Sixers
I'm lookin' pretty good you might just wanna hide your sisters

They just want to take a trend and they gon’ use it
Been a minute since I’ve heard a lyric
That can move somebody in their feelings
I just started spittin' then I'm killin' it
I love these women I'm a feminist
I'm just talkin', they call me a lyricist
I'ma make it debut album after this
Its the end, but I'm just gettin' started, feel like no finale and I prolly be offense
I'm the one and only, but I swear about a thousand Indonesian kids who come from me

This is not a fairy tale, no, that's not what I'm implying
This is really not the type of rhyme, writing 'bout flexing
Got some bitches on the phone
But I'm really not replying type shit
With the clique, and we going out to get ourselves a drink
To to the fast lane, might make the pedal fuckin' sick
Bumping Lil Wayne, feeling like we ain't got time to think
Cigarettes, feeling like we be the kings
Got to the party 'bout 11:28
Went up to the bartender asking for some Bombay
No mixer, straight up, so you know I'm getting wasted
Then I realized I ain't even bring my paper
Might know it should be seen, lose it like I'm Charlie Sheen
Lookin' like them wipe panicking 'cause now my glass is clean
Talking to the bartender, ""Sorry sir, I'm just a teen""

Drive to the store just to buy a fuckin' mattress
If that can mean she gon' end up on my nitrous

Back to the story and now I'm talking to this girl
I'ma call her Tracy and she looking like dessert
She noticing that I'm trussing, then she asked me, ""What for?""
And I told her everything, and she gave me three fours
She said, ""Where you wanna go?"" and I told her, ""I don't know""
""Do you got a girlfriend? That don't really matter, though""
I'm like, ""Oh shit,"" thinkin' 'bout where this gonna go
So I proceed, man's never did this shit before
Back to her place now, tryna get my thing up
2 AM, whiskey dick, 80% discount
So I had to go down, cruising down to poon town
Making sure I put that bitch's frown on upside-down
Getting pretty wet, sweat running down her neck
And the kitty so cute, I wanna keep it as a pet
She so clean, man, that pussy smell like honeydew zest
Finally getting hard, so you know what's finna happen next

Turning red, I feel like a million

""Bump and Grind"" playing on the stereo
When I told her, ""It's my first time""

Called Mike on the team, said I need to leave the scene

Are means our redeemer I means Israel S is for the stars that shone so bright

Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime

Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away

Now judge judge I had debts no honest man could pay
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they was takin' my house away
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man

And I was out there with that work
From the 15th to the 1st

We’ll let them clips squeeze like dirt
When it come to them dollars, nigga, why bother?
These niggas don’t want no problems
‘Cause I’ll kill all y’all dead, put a price on your head
Get your brain, I doubt it

Burnin’ up the track like a motherfuckin’ matchstick,

Tryna shine when you come around stars like us
They do look dim
Ain’t got your game tight, ain’t got your swag up
Shame on them
Your legs too little and your T-Shirt big
Nigga, go to the gym
For the love of my clique, we up in this bitch
So sorry that your girl’s suckin’ my dick
Throwin’ money in the air like I’m sick of this shit

And all I know is girl I owe you 100, 100, 100 favors
I owe you 100 favors, 100, 100, 100 favors

Niggas all talk, it'll never change
Keep on choosin do your thang
All them favors, I call her like a driver
Drowning in that pussy, and I’m a soul survivor
Vodka, hunned flavors, GT watermelon
She always do me favors, and I don’t never tell her
GT yellow mango, I love to drink juice
Owe her 100 favors, I call her my 100 proof
Man I heard about an angel

Now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka
And all I ever see is your face
And I be sitting here thinking bout the shit that you’ve been doing
And all I know is I owe 100, 100, 100 favors
I give you 100 favors, 100, 100, 100 favors
And now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of GT
And all I ever see is your face, a 100 favors

Prices with the life, rollin on them dice
Spent a mill on a flight
Flew back and she bounced back
High speed, all gold
Lord of the ring, we live that life big time
Big time, 100 times I gave my bitch the sunshine

Twin cam, I gave my bitch a 100 favors

And now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of GT
And all I ever see is your face, a 100 favors

You was a college student abusing the credit union
The music was way too loud, the tuition was fuckin stupid
And me I was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' Buick
Confusing, you like my style even though I was broke and doing
Stick em ups, you wanna pick em up
Inside your Civic Plus the difference was
I wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us
And I missed the crush that we had every time winter December come
And we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, end up shootin' himself
And the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself
And I'm losing now too looking at you boo hoo from what's dealt
So as I reminisce the coupon that we used to split at Baileys
On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
You say K. Dot your page got that pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day you'll reap what you sow, now I reap for us both
That's one hunnid

Now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka
And all I ever see is your face

Give a nigga bread like ""bless you"" (thank you) nada
I'm been on the block from the top tryna plot on a spot
Now I'm game with it - ta da!
Fuck around, I'll bang with the sawed-off
Fuck around, rob these niggas, do my thing like ""voila""
Ain't nothin' changed but the dollars
Niggas so lame 'cause they ain't gon' claim I'm they father
I'm one of the niggas that don't fold
Treat me like one of them niggas that don't rap
Spinning 'em like a Tommy, automatic my laddy
I've been known to get niggas in one ""blap!""
When I trip up, it's foreign - when I grip up, it's foreign
When I fuck, bitch foreign
Pull on my Trukfit foregin
Pull on my Trukfit foregin
I don't trust these hoes

[Chorus]
Hustle in the morning, smokin' in the clouds
Bitches come in dumpin' 'cause they ran a hundred miles
Rain still pourin', the bottles lift up
Stuntin' on them bitches and the whips flamed up
The sun do shine, Christmas every day
Them holidays comin', so you know we quick to spray
Muscle is a must, the money in the can
Strapped every day, we still hustle in the sand

Every single morning that a nigga get out of bed
Kknow a nigga gotta get it
Money to burn, raw OG kush in a $100 bill, smoke weed with it
Why y'all niggas wanna whip shit with it?
Musson, I ain't gotta put a key in it
True don, make me wanna whip in it
Different money - add another didget
Get this money then I slide and I'm gone
Y'all already know who's side that I'm on
YMCMB my nigga - Rich Gang, everything far from the norm
From the jails to the college campus, we've got 'em yellin' in the dorms
We try to compete 'til they go bankrupt, and we're just gettin' warm
If you ain't know, motherfucker, you can take another look, nigga
Whole team strong
And we knock every spot on the charts
Every time a nigga drop each song
I don't need to tell 'em, they already know what it is
We run every city and we runnin' every block, nigga
Respect this conglomerate, bitch, 'cause you can't reach the #1 spot

When every day is sunshine
Everyday is sunshine

I was born by the river with the sunblock
Say I'm cooking up the heat so I'mma stay hot
And just like that river, I've been running ever since
I know I can't go wrong if I'm on top
I've got the shine on me, when I say me he's gotta ride for the team
Cause I'm on that
The sun hit me every morning, the club with them models
Come and feel 'em like I'm calling
The Don Perrier, probably like a cactus
Throwing every Franklin, I'm a Tim Jackson
Action the napkins, wet, no cash, got a milly after taxes
I'm on the road to winning, I've been exposed to women
Already know what they getting but with the flow in the middle
They gotta think twice
And just know that every day is like sunshine

No intermission in the mission
All of my idols big pimping, all of my rivals been missing
This right here ain't revival, this right here is the birth of an idol
This right here is why I work for the title, I gotta be an icon
My old man had dreams of putting nice, he rest in peace
A lil bit of him rest in me
Every time that I'm blessed to be
I work hard, got scars, I got a mother I provide for
I got homies I would die for
A big sis I would lie for but I ain't relying on this record
No, I'm working on my vernacular
I'm tryina have a lil' brains to back it up
I used to roll around town in a maxima
Now my next step looking spectacular
And that right there is a blessing
Truest evil when this shit go wrong, don't stress it
'Cause sometime the universe testing you

Everyday is sunshine

Fade those lights, paid that price and did it
Overnight when we shoot that dice
And I'll probably fly, play that game and did it
Hustle from the bottom and get it
Get this money then flip it

Louboutin, foreign cash, hundred dollars on my kite
Hundred dollars on my flight, hundred G's every night

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time

Yeah I said
I was in Houston for the minute now I’m back in town

Rich Homie Baby!

All it takes is one text
Asking me where I’m at
Told her,” Baby I’m on one but your destination is next”
Now I’m coming down on that freeway that UGK in my deck
Got that “Take It Off “on replay like Pimp C said it
Now she texting me she need it bad because she ain’t have good in so long
And I’m like,’Damn shorty I’m speeding fast and when I get to you girl it’s on’
And when I make it there juss wanna to see that ass
No boy shorts and no thong
She got that ocean hair but nigga sinking quick
Rock the boat on my Aaliyah shit
I hit the block and showed up in a beastin’ whip
I see Ciroc is poured up and Keisha lit
I know your neighbors probably never heard of me
But they gon’ know my name when you screaming it
'Cause I'm going in, going in
At The same time I'm showing out
Got her legs shaking, rolling round
And her head crazy like a robot

I could tell she had her shit when she smiled
Shorty lil' dramatic but it compliment her style
Late nights we get romantic
Need a babysitter for her child
If I whip her she like ooh child
Imma hit that pussy all night wake up another two rounds
Living room got like 8 pictures we done knocked another two down
Two! yeah, yeah (leggo)
I was in Houston for the minute now I’m back in town (leggo)
I was in Houston for the minute now I’m back in town (Rich Homie baby)

She ain't worried about no nigga (no nigga)
Got a her own bread  got her own business
Laced up and it's a velvet ?
Silent niggas think she gold digging
Truth be told she got more than you
So what the hell you think she need with your figures?
Ain't nothing better so I drop whatever
I'm doin' down when she call
Really ain't nothing with her it go down whatever
From the bedroom to the wall
It's the ones who bad with hustle that never ask for nothing
That a nigga wanna give all
Every time I hit it man I need some more I notice
I can't resist it's when the dope is potent
Shorty ride this dick just like a roller coaster
Likes to drive it quick then in a slower motion
I be hitting it like I got sentenced to life
I’m going dumb I’m so unfocused
It’s a trill nigga, trill nigga
All she want is a trill nigga
Most you lames couldn’t deal with her
I knock it out ?

I could tell she had her shit when she smiled
Shorty lil' dramatic but it compliment her style

If I whip her she like ooh child

Glocks in my ma’s house
Front you with that work

You say you want that head up
But we don’t fight fair brah
Catch you slippin' from your backside, then knock you out
Ace gone stomp you out, then Buddah gone stomp you out
(Has momma ever see you with a busted eye and busted mouth)
Nine milli pokin' out, 4 Fizzy pokin' out
Death Row days show you what this West Coast about

I'd die for my motherfuckin' nigga
Jump in front a bullet for my motherfuckin' nigga
On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga
Real talk, I don't really fuck with too many niggas
'Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughin' to the bank like the fuckin' money tickle
Drivin' somethin' that you ain't, top off, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro
Don't beef over no ho
And my niggas sellin' keys if you can't open your door
Hope you ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
When it rains it pours, it's dry for my motherfuckin' niggas
I kill for my motherfuckin' niggas
Vice versa, eyes red from the kush I blew

Call in RondoNumbaNine, Lil Durk will bring the trigger
And when we on that lean, we ain’t fuckin with the liquor
I’m a buy a hundred bottles just to give it to the bitches
She can like it on my bitches
'Cause she see the way I ball, how my wrist and that be lit up
Catch you at the red light, have em screamin “can’t get up""
Same nigga from the bottom ain’t a damn thing change
Catch me out in Collins screamin ""money ain’t a thang""
And them red Mulsanne, lookin like I claim blood
And if homie ain’t my homie than I know it ain’t love
Screamin out ""4 Hunnid,” YG that's my nigga
'Cause I been in the field life on the line with him
And if it’s really good, why I prolly die with em
'Cause when I need the choppers, I just tell Tock hit em

I just got 250 thousand dollars for a verse, nigga
I don't know, is it me or it's your thirst, nigga?
You niggas ain't got no joints
Like a injured Chris Paul, you ain't got no point
I just come through with a couple bossy bitches
They get money too, they some ""don't cross me"" bitches
Flossy bitches, Sergio Rossi, bitches
And if we at the game then it's floor seat, bitches!
I ride for my bitches
I'm so fuckin' rich I cop rides for my bitches
Dollar menu fries apple pies otha bitches
I drop a freestyle and get a rise outta bitches
Bitches, my bitches

Shout out to my main bitches, and my side bitches
Need a nigga with some good neck, ostriches

Got a whole lot, remember I ain't had nothin'
We done sold out, now everybody mad at me
Tell 'em roll out, now everybody smashin'
Get ready cause you know we 'bout to be a problem
Hope you ready cause you know it 'bout to be a problem

It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together

Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway
Cash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way
I fight you like a matador, fresh out the catalog
One fall we all fall, crew like dominoes
But chase vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke
Mob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold
We are not alone, boy, better check your tone
You gone need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans
Sit with us, table last supper
Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers
Yeah, ain't nothin' but pure luxury
You lookin' left to me, should be looking up to me
Preferably one of the best
She ridin' cause we next now and forever to death
Be loyal, real, and respect, stay ahead of the rest
We just sit back, relax, doin' things to impress

Ridin' on ton of waves
And no way these niggas stoppin' me, oh no
Flyin' from a mile away
It's not a problem, only real ones follow me
And I can do this with my eyes closed
Blindfold two times over
Ride solo, I got women and got soldiers
I ain't trippin', you try to get it your night's over
Talkin' all Melatonin, get it and fight coma
What's defeat to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire
History, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'
You don't believe it? Then try it
We don't believe in just tryin'
I call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided
That's cold blooded
And I've been this dope for like four summers
And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say
Keep it G for Pete's sake
I know this shit that bone you pick
Might leave you niggas feetless

It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together

It's YG 4hunnid!
Is you ridin'?
Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence?
If Jimmy got caught up, but you right there with him
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet?
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate
You got that fake friend, syndrome
There's no cure so your symptoms is gon' show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up, each one teach one
Motivate each one to be somethin'
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this and that if you wanna get specific
I'm just tryna make bread come quicker
For me and my day one hitters

Treat a queen like a queen and a ho like a ho

You know they told me tell on Turk and Mel for lesser charges
Ask me what I want to say, I say I want to fuck your daughter
I was raised to get paid plenty ways like a man
Taught to get it out the mud cause they ain't puttin' it in your hand
Beef came, I bring pain, Lord knows I never ran
Whole code up in the street, you never see me on the stand
System tried to convict me off testimony and lyrics, but I'm a G

Gotta do it like a man
Mama ain't have no help growin' up so I had to step up like a man
Can't see my mama strugglin', I had to hit them streets like a man
Get caught doin' your crime, better do your time, like a man

Feelings of rejection, no false hopes or misconception
Just a burning in my head and in my heart
Promises were made, friendship lost along the way

A twisted path of lies, deception from the start
The future lay in your hands with talk of stardom, all your plans 
We had our dreams, high hopes, we trusted you
But the decisions that you made

And the staring role you played
Quickly made us realize what we must do
And I gave my trust to you
Got stabbed in the back and left for dead

Why'd you do the things you do?
With all the lies, deceit, wrong things got said
Never expected this of you
I should've known better than to do what I did

I was blind and you were shrewd
Had me eating from your hand like a naive little kid
Laid down my guard, wound up screwed

When quickly we must learn from our mistakes 
Now trusting no one, guard held high

To those deserving of the phrase
Avoiding the pain and all the rage from knowing 
That you've been betrayed

Never again will I trust you
Left for dead, knife buried in my back 
I wish I would have knew
Your sneakiness, plan of attack

This is what you do
Lying, cheating, and all that crap
No chance for number two
With my guard held high and my wall built strong
Next time around I'll screw you

There comes the time in all of our lives 
When quickly we must learn from our mistakes
Not knowing why we made them, just the outcome
And the feelings they create 

Whether it's sadness, loss of trust, death, pain, forgiveness,
Love, joy, sex, happiness, or fate,
It's one of these, the biggest one, that I really hate

I know you'll pick me up somehow

As free as two birds in flight 
At least they are tonight

May never reach the streets of gold 
No, no, no 

So much love is on the inside 
Better give in and let it out

But let the Spirit show you how 
Speak your heart and maybe you could shed light 
On the shadow of someone's doubt 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

So don't hold out, don't let these chances pass you by

Believing love lasts forever, live right 

The things you grab will never last you 
Once they get you in their hold 
What once were your slaves become your masters 
They burn you up and leave you cold

If you gain the world and lose your soul 
Oh, no, no

Asking only for Your grace

All those empty dreams I chased 

And when my body lies in the ruins 
Of the lies that nearly ruined me 
Will You pick up the pieces 
That were pure and true 
And breathe Your life into them 
And set them free? 

And when You start this world over 
Again from scratch 
Will You make me anew 
Out of the stuff that lasts? 
Stuff that's purer than gold is 
And clearer than glass could ever be 
Can I be with You? 
Can I be with You? 

And everybody all and each 
From the day that we are born 
We have to learn to walk beneath 
Those mercies by which we're drawn 
And now we wrestle in the dark 
With these angels that we can't see 
We will move on although with scars 
Oh Lord, move inside of me 

And when my body lies in the ruins 
Of the lies that nearly runied me 
Will You pick up the pieces 
That were pure and true 
And breathe Your life into them 
And set them free?

To kingdom come

That you've probably heard 
And at the risk of being redundant 
I'm gonna tell you something 
That may not thrill you 
But it could not hurt 
Well it comes out of the sacred 
Writing of the Israelites 
It's the story of David 
And how he slew Goliath 

Well now the king of his country 
He didn't trust in him much 
And so to David's alarm 
He tried to fit him in his armor 
But the thing was so heavy 
David couldn't stand up 
So he left it by the river 
Where he gathered five smooth stones 
I guess it's safe to say he figured 
He wasn't going out alone 
He's not alone

Among the Philistines 
At the sight of this scrawny little shepherd

And so sometimes you pray and sometimes you sing 
And when you love you thank the Lord for everything 

There's a rest you can find in your work 
That you can't get out of sleep 
And there's a healing that may hurt 
And there's a war that must be waged for peace

To the battle on the journey

They wrapped you in swaddling clothes
Me they dressed in baby blue

Listening to the old men pray
Well, I was tryin' hard to figure out
What it was that they was tryin' to say

There you were in the temple
They said, ""You weren't old enough to know the things you knew""

Well did you grow up hungry?
Did you grow up fast?
Did the little girls giggle when you walked past?
Did you wonder what it was that made them laugh?

And did they tell you stories 'bout the saints of old
Stories about their faith
They say stories like that make a boy grow bold
Stories like that make a man walk straight

And you was a boy like I was once but was you a boy like me
Well I grew up around Indiana
You grew up around Galilee and if I ever really do grow up
Lord, I wanna grow up and be just like you

Well did you wrestle with a dog
And lick his nose?
Did you play beneath the spray of a water hose?
Did you ever make angels in the winter snow?

And did they tell you stories 'bout the saints of old
Stories about their faith
They say stories like that make a boy grow bold
Stories like that make a man walk straight

Did you ever get scared
Playing hide and seek?
Did you try not to cry when you scraped your knee?
Did you ever skip a rock across a quiet creek?

And did they tell you stories 'bout the saints of old

Meet Him in your hour of prayer

Where you are, however grim it may seem 
This is real life, baby 
This ain't no Hollywood dream 
And where you are no matter what you may face 
You're gonna find out real soon what they mean when they say

Rich Mullins,"Now Balaam, he had a donkey 
Who was gentle and true and kind 
And the donkey saw an angel with a sword 
So he slipped old Balaam past him 
And when he done it three times 
Well, Balaam got so me mad he beat the donkey 
And so the Lord 
Well, he gave the donkey language 
And the donkey plainly brayed, 
""Well, there's an angel about to strike you from the path"" 
Then old Balaam's eyes were opened 
And he realized he'd been saved 
By his donkey from the angel of God's wrath

Who was pleasing to a man 
And the man that she was pleasing was a king

Nobody knew just how the lord was gonna intervene 
Well, Mordecai her uncle, he was honest but he was smart 
And he knew that Esther's beauty was a gift 
He said, ""Maybe you could cook some supper 
Maybe you could change a king's heart

He'd led a hundred men, and lived alone among the graves 
He had a thousand questions, and a million heartaches 
He was everyman, he was everyman 

She was caught in a sin, she knew the well was so deep 
She threw her last pennies in, and poured oil upon His feet 
She touched the garment's hem, she had only been asleep 
She was everyman, she was everyman 

And the Lord looks down and He understands 
The world draws up it's lines 
But at the foot of the cross there's room for everyone 
And love that is not blind 
It can look at who we are and still see beyond 
The differences we find 
But with thorns in His brow and a spear in His side 
Nails in His hand, He died for you and I 
For you and I and everyman 

He had nets to mend, he gave his fish and his loaves 
He had to wash his hands, and ran away without his robe 
He couldn't understand, until on Damascus road 
He was everyman, he was everyman 

She brought the world a lamb, and took warning from a dream 
From an empty tomb she ran, for her children she would weep 
In her womb a baby danced, she'd been waiting for a King 
She was everyman, she was everyman 

And the Lord looks down and He understands 
The world draws up it's lines

They have left it cold and dark 
And bleeding, 
Bleeding and falling apart 

[CHORUS:]
And everybody used to tell me big boys don't cry 
Well I've been around enough to know that that was the lie 
That held back the tears in the eyes of a thousand prodigal sons 
Well we are children no more, we have sinned and grown old 
And our Father still waits and He watches down the road 
To see the crying boys come running back to His arms
And be growing young 
Growing young 
I've seen silver turn to dross 
Seen the very best there ever was 
And I'll tell you, it ain't worth what it costs 
And I remember my father's house 
What I wouldn't give right now 
Just to see him and hear him tell me that he loves me so much 

[CHORUS:]

And when I thought that I was all alone 
It was your voice I heard calling me back home 
And I wonder now Lord 
What it was that made me wait so long 
And what kept You waiting for me all that time 
Was Your love stronger than my foolish pride 
Will You take me back now, take me back and let me be Your child 
'Cause I've been broken now, I've been saved 
I've learned to cry, and I've learned how to pray 
And I'm learning, I'm learning even I can be changed

There's really nothing new to say 
But the old, old story bears repeating 
And the plain old truth grows dearer every day 
When you find something worth believing 
Well, that's a joy that nothin' could take away 

And so we meet again 
After all these many years 
Did we sow the seeds we're reaping 
Now that the harvest calls us here 
It seems that love blooms out of season 
And much joy can blossom from many tears

Where people live in perfect peace 
Where there is food on every plate 
Where work is rewarded and rest is sweet 
Where the color of your skin 
Won't get you in or keep you out 
Where justice reigns and truth finally wins 
Its hard fought war against fear and doubt 
And everyone I know wants to go there too 
But when I ask them how to do it they seem so confused 
Do I turn to the left? 
Do I turn to the right? 
When I turn to the world they gave me this advice

They said boy you just follow your heart 
But my heart just led me into my chest 
They said follow your nose 
But the direction changed every time I went and turned my head 
And they said boy you just follow your dreams

But the Father of hearts and the Maker of noses 
And the Giver of dreams He's the one I have chosen 
And I will follow Him 
I believe there'll come a time 
Lord, I pray it's not too far off 
There'll be no poverty or crime 
There'll be no greed and we will learn how to love 
And children will be safe in their homes 
And there'll be no violence out on the streets 
The old will not be left alone 
And the strong will learn how to care for the weak 
And everyone I know hopes it comes real soon 
But when I ask 'em where I'd find it they seem so confused 
Do I find it in the day? 
Do I find it in the night? 
When I finally ask the world they give me this advice 

[CHORUS:]

And oh, I hear the voice of a million dreams 
Then I wake in the world that I'm partly made of 
And the world that is partly my homemaking 
And oh, I hear the song of a heart set free

By the fury and sound 
Of a world that is wasting away but keeps saying (keeps on saying)

Rich Mullins,"Momma, I've got two strong hands. 
And they're fine as far as hands go 
I can shoulder the future, I can face the wind 
For the dream that I must follow 
It's a dream that can kill with its beauty 
It's a hurt that can heal with its pain 
And with all of these miles that lie before me 
I may never get home again 

But I'll carry the songs I learned when we were kids 
I'll carry the scars of generations gone by 
I'll pray for you always, and I promise you this 
I'll carry on, I'll carry on 

I kissed the earth on my daddy's grave 
Said goodbye to my brave young companions 
But when they hoist that sail I know my heart will break 
As bright and as fine as the morning 
I don't know where this road will take me 
But they say there's a place there for a man 
And I'm only afraid that my dreams may betray me 
And I'll never get home again 

But I'll carry the songs I learned when we were kids 
And I'll carry the scars of generations gone by 
I'll pray for you always, and I promise you this 
I'll carry on, I'll carry on 

And oh, I can shoulder the future, I can brave the wind 
Oh, we go on, we go on, but we never get home again

I'll pray for you always, and I promise you this

With their bellies full of coal 
And their big wheels a-hummin' 
Down this road that lies open like the soul of a woman 
Who hid the spies who were lookin' 
For the land of the milk and the honey 
And this road she is a woman 
She was made from a rib 
Cut from the sides of these mountains 
Oh these great sleeping Adams 
Who are lonely even here in paradise 
Lonely for somebody to kiss them 
And I'll sing my song ~ and I'll sing my song 
In the land of my sojourn 

And the lady in the harbor 
She still holds her torch out 
To those huddled masses who are 
Yearning for a freedom that still eludes them 
The immigrant's children see their brightest dreams shattered 
Here on the New Jersey shoreline in the 
Greed and the glitter of those high-tech casinos 
But some mendicants wander off into a cathedral 
And they stoop in the silence 
And there their prayers are still whispered 
And I'll sing their song, and I'll sing their song 
In the land of my sojourn 

Nobody tells you when you get born here 
How much you'll come to love it 
And how you'll never belong here 
So I call you my country 
And I'll be lonely for my home 
And I wish that I could take you there with me 

And down the brown brick spine of some dirty blind alley 
All those drain pipes are drippin' out the last Sons Of Thunder 
While off in the distance the smoke stacks 
Were belching back this city's best answer 

And the countryside was pocked 
With all of those mail pouch posters 
Thrown up on the rotting sideboards of 
These rundown stables like the one that Christ was born in 
When the old world started dying 
And the new world started coming on 
And I'll sing His song, and I'll sing His song 
In the land of my sojourn 

In the land of my sojourn 
And I will sing His song 
In the land of my sojourn""",Land of My Sojourn,1993

And may peace rain down from Heaven 
Like little pieces of the sky 
Little keepers of the promise 
Falling on these souls 
This drought has dried 
In His Blood and in His Body 
In the Bread and in this Wine

Prisoners in these lonely hearts 
And though our blindness separates us 
Still His light shines in the dark 

And His outstretched arms are still strong enough to reach 
Behind these prison bars to set us free 

So may peace rain down from Heaven

You have been King of my glory 
Won't You be my Prince of Peace

It's so hot inside my soul
I swear there must be blisters on my heart

So hold me Jesus,

I'd rather fight you for something

Than to take what you give that I need
And I've beat my head against so many walls
Now I'm falling down, I'm falling on my knees

And Your grace rings out so deep
It makes my resistance seem so thin

I was hung in the ropes of success
When You stripped away the mask of life
They had placed upon the face of death

And I wanna thank You, Lord
More than all of my words can say
(I give my life)
And I give my life to sing Your praise

And all those fortunes I hoarded
They were the well from which my poverty sprang
Oh, they led me to no greater glory
And they left me with no less shame

And I wanna thank You, Lord
More than all of my words can say
(I give my life)
So I give my life to sing Your praise

I say I wanna give You glory Lord, and I do
But everything that I could ever find to offer comes from You
But if my darkness can praise Your light
Give me breath, and I'll give my life to sing Your praise

When You stripped away the mask of life
They had placed upon the face of death

For anything except the grace

To give my life to sing Your praise

Sent through you to blow away these walls I've built

And if I was moved you would never guess it 
By the look upon my face 
But You said man looks without but I look within 
I can see the love you hide 
It's a matter of doubt it's a symptom of sin 
It's a problem of too much pride 
And I, now I'm opening up wide 
Wet feathers pulled out from beneath me 
And You're teaching me to fly 
For the strength that comes with friendship 
For the warmth that comes with hope 
And for the love time can't diminish

Could they find peace and quiet so they could go back to bed 
He said if it's peace that you want, you're gonna find it on the hill

To part the waters of the sea 
But it only took one little lie 
To separate you and me 
Oh, we are not as strong as we think we are 

And they say that one day Joshua 
Made the sun stand still in the sky 
But I can't even keep these thoughts of you from passing by 
Oh, we are not as strong as we think we are 

We are frail, we are fearfully and wonderfully made 
Forged in the fires of human passion 
Choking on the fumes of selfish rage 
And with these our hells and our heavens 
So few inches apart 
We must be awfully small 
And not as strong as we think we are 

And the Master said their faith was 
Gonna make them mountains move 
But me, I tremble like a hill on a fault line 
Just at the thought of how I lost you 
Oh, we are not as strong as we think we are 

We are frail, we are fearfully and wonderfully made 
Forged in the fires of human passion 
Choking on the fumes of selfish rage 
And with these our hells and our heavens

And not as strong as we think we are 

And if you make me laugh 
I know I could make you like me 
'Cause when I laugh I can be a lot of fun 
But we can't do that I know that it is frightening 
What I don't know is why we can't hold on

Can't keep his hope from turning this world 
Toward the morning light. 
I know this world will never understand 
Or return the love that he's been born to give. 
It's in the giving he receives. 
His pardon is in the pardoning. 
And in dying he's born again to live.

Rich Mullins,"I stood on that Cherokee Plain, 
And the Cameron broke free and jumped its banks 
All in a rush of life. 
The thunderhead roared out its song, 
And it gave what was too much for it to hold. 
And so must I. 

[Chorus]
And You light the sun to lead me. 
Send the wind to be my guide. 
Just the wonder of this prairie, 
So lonely and so alive. 
And the song the moon is singing 
With the rain and with the fire. 

Says there You are. 
(There You are) 
There You are 
In front of me. 

The antelopes' white flashing flanks 
Sparked in the heart of the Cheyenne breaks, 
Only to disappear. 
Just like this memory of what once was my home. 
And as I move beyond everything I've known, 
You pull me near. 

[Chorus]

Says there You are. 
(There You are) 
There You are

Of a power that is Yours alone. 
And You're the one breathed into the many.

Our hands are free to let go.

Yet He could stop the rising storm 
With a gesture of His hand

Hearts of darkness, hearts of stone 
Just like mine would be revealed 

[CHORUS:]
He was a man of no reputation 
And by the wise, considered a fool 
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness 
In a time when the strongest arms ruled 
But this man of no reputation 
Loved the weak with relentless affection 
And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were 
He was a man of no reputation 
It was said this man brought only confusion 
That He'd achieve his ends by any means 
And the truth that it brings revolution 
And for once they were right 
The truth set us free 
The hearts of the captive were his only concern 
And the powerful knew their days were ending

One day soon the gates of heaven will open wide 
And the Prince of Peace will come back for His bride 
But for now we live on these streets 
Forbidding and tough 
Where push always comes to shove 
And it's said love's never enough 
Where a prophet in rags gives hope to a fearful world 
No injustice, no heart of darkness 
Will keep this voice from being heard 
He was a man of no reputation 
And by the wise, considered a fool 
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness 
In a time when the strongest arms ruled 
But this man of no reputation 
Loves us all with relentless affection 
And He loves all those poor in spirit, come as you are

Even if I found the strength to fly
And if I rose on the wings of the dawn
And crashed through the corner of the sky

If I sailed past the edge of the sea
Even if I made my bed in Hell
Still there You would find me

'Cause nothing is beyond You
You stand beyond the reach

The heavens stretch to hold You
And deep cries out to deep

Nothing is beyond You

Time cannot contain You
You fill eternity
Sin can never stain You
Death has lost its sting

And I cannot explain the way You came to love me
Except to say that nothing is beyond You
Nothing is beyond You

If I should shrink back from the light
So I can sink into the dark
If I take cover and I close my eyes
Even then You would see my heart

And You'd cut through all my pain and rage
The darkness is not dark to You
And night's as bright as day

Nothing is beyond You
You stand beyond the reach
Of our vain imaginations
Our misguided piety

The heavens stretch to hold You
And deep cries out to deep
Singing that nothing is beyond You

Behind these prison bars to set us free

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?
