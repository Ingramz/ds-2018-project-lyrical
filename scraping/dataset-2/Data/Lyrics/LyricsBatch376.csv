Ice Cube,"[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
I am the one, that you heard about, read about
I am the one, that had to take the ghetto route
I am the one, don't make me pull this ghetto out
I'm comin' straight from the cave who let him out
Crazy nigga thought he was gone, but he ain't gone
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home
When I hit the block, watch them scatter like roaches
So don't be fake, 'cause I know what a hoe is
Handle my business, no playin' 'cause I'm focused
You the definition of what a fuckin' joke is
When they see you comin', they play with your emotions
Fuck with my emotions and they find you in the oceans
Yeah I said oceans, yeah I mean plural
My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl
We'll fuck up your world, no boos to my drama
We'll include yo mama, if you f**k with my commas
I ain't tryin' to scary you
I ain't tryin' to hear you
I ain't tryin' to control that nigga in the mirror
I'll I'm tryin' to is bark before I fight
Before I take you down, might as well be polite

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Now when I roll through the hood, lil' kids watch my every move
Tryin' to be a good example, don't make me bury you
If you sit on my swagger, bitch take some carellflu
Don't underestimate the damage caused by a '22
Pop yo' ass right behind the ear within' hear
Nothin' like a firecracker, hits you like a linebacker
Don't forget the grind factor, I am a grinder
And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya
Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China?
Nothin' motherfucker just don't act like a vagina
You won't catch the rath of this hardcore rhymer
Now you got 55 niggas right behind ya
Now you wanna talk it out, but we don't negotiate
Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate
Straight from the west and we got to be respected
Here it's going down, here 'em runnin' for the exit

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Doughboy]
See this boy in this bitch gonna ape shit
Glitch Mob niggas takin' off like a spaceship
Pace those to Euros, eatin' those green and great chips
Get 'em by the bag, you can say we Feedo Lay chips
I'm so hungry that I can eat these niggas faces
Beat the plastic surgeons givin' Hollywood a face lift
Off the grape shit, and I'm feelin' like I'm faceless
The Mob you ain't in, nigga don't say shit
You ain't nothin' to play with, nigga I beat the basics
Cock and spray shit, quick to leave a nigga faceless
Playin' Superman, we get a brave nigga sprayed quick
Niggas can't fade this, music for the ages
Because we get it in like Young Crush
She be payin' big fishin'
In the water bitch you in the deep end
Boy I pull you deep in, underneath the deep end
Nigga have you sinkin', when I hear you creepin', hear you sayin'

[Chorus]

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come",Here He Come,2008
Ice Cube,"Fuck school, nigga, I'ma be a dope dealer,
I'ma be a killer, yup a urban guerrilla,
I'ma stack strilla, yeah, buy me a villa,
Sell a five-oh to my Auntie Priscilla,
I don't give a fuck that she look like thriller,
Hit that shit, one more time and fuck around and kill her.
Cause I got the heart of a Pittsburgh Steeler,
Black nigga, draped in gold with a nine milla,

Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary mail,
Love the way these niggas smell, keep comin' back, can't you tell,
Love to see my mama cry, love to see my babies struggle,
Love to see my woman juggle nuts cause she got the hustle,

I don't give a fuck, how my life go,
Now I'ma slave man to this cave man, without Geico
Everybody wanna a car, Michael a psycho
But he ain't never came through the hood with a rifle,
Gunnin' niggas down cause they don't got the right clothes,
Hit the wrong person cause we shoot just like hoes,
First I was blood thirsty, Mr. Mr. Controversy,
Now I wanna beg for mercy, should of took my ass to first

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,

Fuck school, Nigga, if I grow a little taller,
Everybody tell me I'ma gonna do it, I'm gonna be a baller,
So fuck that thinkin', fuck that thinkin',
Fuck them Lincolns, I want Franklin's
Come back through here with my crew, I'ma gonna have my own shoe,
I'ma gonna be that little fool, coming in your living room,
Startin' point guard, nigga, fresh outta middle school,
Either is the NBA, or is the NFL,
I dunno what else I can do, to keep my ass self outta jail,
I wanna be like Tiger Woods, swing that club, make you sick,
I wanna be like Pacman Jones, I wanna be like Michael Vick,
I wanna be like Barry Bonds, I wanna be like OJ Simpson,
Leader's feel, leader's prison, tell you motherfuckers where to kiss em,
I wanna be all broke'd up, moving all old and slow,
I wanna be a alcoholic, just like Barway Joe,
I wanna be a side show, kinda like Iron Mike,
Used to have a few Bentley, now I just ride a bike,

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,

Fuck school, nigga, they ain't tryin' to educate me,
All they give a fuck is what I memorize lately,
I'ma gonna have to teach myself,
Clock that money, get that wealth,
I wanna be like Santa Claus,
I don't wanna be no fucking elf,
No kid left behind, buddy get the run around,
Can't you motherfuckers see that they tryin' to doom us down,
Don't trust the government, president, is for sale,
He don't give a fuck about a nigga, just a oil well,
Sell crack, go to jail, bust a rap, go to hell,
Do I got to sell my soul, if I wanna go to Yale,
Go kiss Oprah's ass, if you wanna be Gail,
I rather have my ass kissed, up in Bloomingdale,
You can go, be a pimp, you can go, be a hoe,
But you only gonna get paid off, what you know,
If you don't know shit, then you can't work for me,
Cause you read your first book, in a penitentiary,

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality,
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality,",Hood Mentality,2008

I got my locs on
I got my locs on
And you can't see my eyes
And you can't see my eyes
I got my locs on
I got my locs on
And you can't tell I'm high
And you can't tell I'm high

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
I got my locs on welcome to the terror dome
I got them carrots on givin' off them pheromones
Women love it when the see me on that motorcycle
Niggas hate it cause they know I'm makin' more than Michael
Been ballin' since the word ballin played out
They brought it back to describe me in that Maybach
Me and Jeezy Jeezy rollin' with our locs on
Smokin' somethin' good fuckin' up the ozone

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Brand new Versace's ran me a buck 50
(They must have set you back) no baby not really
Switchin' lanes yes yea the chopper's just silly
When it's bustin' at your ass we just laughin' at ya really
I got my locs on dickies on keep the workin' niggas on
Keep the cashmere vickis on yea she keep them vickis on
Keep my locs on see you hatin' mother fuckers keep my locs on you know they match my bag suckers

[Chorus: x2]

I got my locs on cause my eyes are burgundy
And when I get home I don't want the third degree
The verdict be urgently these niggas wanna murder me
They scared of the consequences comin' from my defenses
It ain't that expensive have your ass hoppin' fences
Lucky motherfucker missed your ass by some inches
Next time understand what you fuckin' with its legendary status
Sittin' behind these glasses nigga

[Chorus: x2]",I Got My Locs On,2008
Ice Cube,"There are seven known wonders of the world, 
You about to witness the eighth motherfucker

[Verse 1]
I got King Kong in my trunk,
King Kong in my doors
My nuts play ping-pong from the noise;
You can hear me from a block away
I'm sitting next to your ass and cant hear what you got to say
My shit is loud, my ears is ringing
My paint job is wet
My chrome is gleaming
I feel like a vet ballin' on these rookies
An old-school bully, you must have played hooky
I bring it like a bookie,
My aggression is depressing
Don't give a motherfucker time to learn his lesson
A lunatic, yall know what I represent
The only rapper that wanna fist-fight the president

[Chorus]
It takes a nation of niggas to hold us back [Repeat: x4]

[Verse 2]
When I bang this its dangerous
Niggas go brainless
So bang this with the four-five stainless
And understand that you looking at the famous
West-coast rapper who act like an anus
Hollywood, they thought they could tame this
Pit-bull, but I know what the game is
Them fuckers cheat like an NBA ref
If you smoke one now,
They'll electrocute you to death
I got god on my intellect
Godzilla by the neck
When the nigga come through, who you wanna holla at
Ghostwriters hit the deck
When ya boi got a tech
Where the fuck is Africa-Bamabata at
We need to take it back, fuck Viacom
Clear Clear Channel and Radio One
You motherfuckers programmed by the programmers
That's why you getting locked up by the dope slammers
Not me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They music so fluffy, I'ma stay gutter
That shit is kinda popcorn, my shit is so butter
My style never change in 22 summers
Straight independent and doing my numbers
This shit don't sell, you know I'm still paid
So sour-puss niggas, can drink lemonade
I'm doin' it for the love
You doing it because
You need that advancement to spend on them dubs
I don't need a penny, but I need many
Don't worry bout ma money boi, cause I got plenty
You motherfuckers worry bout flossing so much
You don't know the fundamentals, you forgot how to brush
These thirty-two teeth
Will give your ass grief
Bite you like a fat burger if you got beef
So whose it gonna be, your favorite MC
Your scared of the government, they scared of me
Now what?

Ice Cube,"The West-coast Warlord,
The Grand Wizard,
Ice Cube,
Motherfuckers head so big they call him jack in the box

[Verse 1]
I'm a superhero, like Lou Ferrigno,
Made by the Nero, look like a zero,
Shine the spotlight, this is my night,
Get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti,
I'm a champion, I do what can't be done,
In the real league nerd, not the fantasy one
Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy,
When I hit the stage get an ear full of noise,
When I bring the noise from here to Illinois,
Motherfuckers love when I do what it does,
A all-star, superstar entertainer,
World class, first ballot hall-of-famer,
Some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger,
How when your lyrics weren't written by a stranger,
Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest,
I'm loved by your grand mama, and your baby

[Chorus]
See my head is so big they call me jack in the box,
You can't impress me, so fuck what you got,
I said my head is so big they call me jack in the box,
Don't talk about money cause I'm stacking a lot,

[Bridge]
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,
Cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,
Cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,

[Verse 2]
I was a born loser, I was a born sinner,
Now I am a winner, in a convincing sinner,
I got to take a bow, cause I still wonder how,
The system didn't get me when I was a juvenile,
Just think if I had got locked up,
No Boyz in da Hood thanks to America,
No Eazy, NWA, no 'Friday',
Don't let your motherfucking talent go to waste,
Don't catch a case cause these people got a place,
To throw your life away and take you right out the waste,
Throw your hands up, you got to man up,
I had to show the world, what I was made of,
What you say Blood, I was a slad cause,
Now I'm V.I.P., up in Vegas,
I'm up in Nike-town, so how you like me now,
See the whole industry had to bite my style,

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Now mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,
I got to let them know I never break like glass,
What you looking at it's top notch world class,

Mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,
I got to let them know I never break like glass,
What you looking at it's top notch world class,

Ice Cube,"Now is the time
C'mon y'all

Stand tall, live your life to the limit
Cause haterism seem like a fucking epidemic
And look at Ice Cube, I ain't no gimmick
I'm straight from the hood, I got to represent it
Now, every day I think about my color
And all the crazy shit we do to one another
I ain't your blood brother, but I'm your cause brother
Let's take it back to the love and how it was brother
If not, we goin' pull these triggers
Show the world we deserve to be called niggas
I make a fuck-up, like Don Imus
Bow on his knees, and call me yo' highness
You can too, you got the power to
Don't let this motherfucking system devour you
I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowing you
But check it out I understand what you going through

[Chorus]
But remember, brothers and sisters
You can still, stand, tall
Just be thankful
For what you got

I know what y'all motherfuckers thinking, heh heh
Here comes another rapper with a song about hope
All you wanna hear is a song about dope
And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope
But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap
No~! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note
Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes
And some of our people used to hang from trees
Now the only thing hangin' motherfucker is these
So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right
Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke
I'm the sunlight, too bright to look
When it's all said and done I should write the book
You too cool for school, too old to know?
Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow
I understand, it ain't no love lost
But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus

[Chorus]

Yeah, for real
I was born in the mud but I came out clean
That's 'til the government tried to intervene
Tried to lock me up when I was only 19
Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream
I make shit raw that piss off the law
If you want some fake shit turn this off
If you want some realness I know you can feel this
Maybe we can heal this just like an illness
Black on black, I got your back
People don't think that we know how to act
Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack
And the CIA, won't take it back
Never on top, always on the bottom
Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham
Cause I can tell you now it's goin' turn out rotten
Keep on pushin', get 'em 'til we got 'em

[Chorus]

Stand up, for real
Raise your hand if you sick of this bullshit
Heh, in the belly of the evil empire",Stand Tall,2008
Ice Cube,"Haha, today was a good day
Sometimes I just get on my knees you know what I mean
And pray to the man with the master plan

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Lord have mercy, my people so thirsty
Come feed 'em, either Jesus or Mohammad
All we get is vomit, come like a comet
Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach
Only you can do it, I'ma learn from it
Do what I gotta do, try not to plum it
America used to shoot like reptiles
Don't worry tomorrow, let's get this right now
They wanna run us in the ground
Educate yourself, before they dumb you down
Get your money boy, the legal way
Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may
Now rich white men they got the world fucked up
Why should I give a fuck about a Styrofoam cup
Environmental saying, but if I go green
You know what I mean bitch

[Chorus]
Take me away from these people [Repeat: x4]

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Ice Cube for President, let's just do it for the hell of it
See how I run the government
Make money irrelevant
I might tell a chick, it's illegal to resell of it
Secret service don't know where the hell I went
Sorry yall, I had to fuck a super delicate
Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama
American dream, Ice Cube and yo mama
The Terminator, are you Sarah Conner?
Arnold Schwarzenegger, can kill who he wanna
In California, they strap you to a jury
And murder your ass, in front of your attorney
Do you really wanna take this journey?
And scared of none of yall, motherfuckers like Bernie
Mad step back, I got the mac 11
Unlike Obama, I'ma have to back my Reverend

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now the Lord is my Sheppard
My flow is respected, world wide
In the west I got to rep it
So please check it, cause my style is infected
With the virus, Ice Cube's the ocyeros
I bailed through, they wanna put up in bail view
Cause my point of view is not red, white and blue
It's black and blue residue
I know what crack can do, to a whole fuckin' avenue
Spit on it, and they'll get mad at you
You know I do this bullshit for your gratitude
I'ma nigga with a attitude
I'ma do what I gotta do, just to change my latitude
In the system, rollin' with my diamonds glistening
And niggas listenin', from your local prison
I'ma prism, your only vision is a rainbow in the sky
When I spit the ism

[Chorus]",Take Me Away,2008
Ice Cube,"I do gangsta Rap
They want to blame the world problems on Gangsta Rap
It's our fault,
Cause motherfuckers are dieing in Iraq
It's our fault,
Cause motherfuckers is starving in Africa
It's Gangsta Raps fault,
That people are poor
Can't get enough to fucking eat or live their life

The man is in the building.
Don't touch him, don't look at him, and don't ask to take a picture.

With that attitude that it ain't nothin' badder
Now you can call me rapper
Or you can call me mister
Big money trapper, fuckin' with your sister
I'ma do it my way, from here to Zimbabwe
It's too hot today
Fuck what you got to say
Fuck if you mad at me, better go change your battery
Ain't gon' take my sunshine, like I hit the lottery
Ah, he's a show off, a hot head go off
Yeah don't make he mad
He might tear the fucking door off
Take all his cars, and don't try to fall
Cause one of his people, might cut your fucking toe off

The West coast warlord, and the future is today

Cause tomorrow, that shit never come
I worry 'bout today and this urban decay
I worry 'bout hip-hop, when did it flip-flop
Get whack, and turn into gridlock
I don't know is it a government plot?
I don't give a fuck whether you love it or not

Tomorrow, don't you worry about tomorrow (that shit never come)

Keep your hand up on that throttle
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow

Cause tomorrow, I might be a little quicker
But today, I'm just the same old nigga

Still you wanna kill a young nigga randomly
You wanna take the life God handed to me
Send it back to him cause you ain't a fan to me
Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me
That's an animal,
A fucking cannibal
I'm Duranimo and Hannibal
We international Gangsta bull
I'm bull and Barcelona, with a Corona
You a fake ass nigga, where's ya owner?
I'm real live man, you a persona
Now I'm a goner, call ma momma, in the corner
Mister gun man, your plan is working
Cause niggas is dieing and mommas is hurting

[Chorus]
Why you wanna murder me?
You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am
I could be part of your family tree
Now
Sent by G.O.D
To save the word you and me
You never know who you facin'
Who ya chasin'
The life you wastin'

[Verse 2]
I was made by the one and only G.O.D
To take my life to the T.O.P
Now here comes a motherfuckin' D.O.G
Who ain't happy til a nigga is R.I.P
Tryin' to be somethin' you saw on BET
Either T.I.P or B.I.G
I don't give a fuck what you saw on TV
But a 187 don't make a O.G.

I'm a O.G
Never had to fake it
God gave me this, how you goin' take it
What you goin' tell 'em, when you get to heaven
When he asks you why did you send back his present.
Who the fuck are you, you motherfucking peasant
Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing.
Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes
Nigga, hell on earth is being stuck in the 80's

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Before you shoot me man think about it
Lets go have a drink about it
Before you make a stink about it
Man lets talk about it
Maybe we can walk about it.
But just don't be a coward
And take my life 'cause you got the power
Of the white mans gun powder
Cause you might face a gun tower.
And time never run out,
They take the fun out, til your life run out.
So don't pull your gun out,
If you ever want a house, just like Run's house.
It's better than a big house,
Less four-five some woman we can dig out,
Find a place we can dig out,
Party all night til the owner say 'get out'

[Chorus]

Dedicated to all the niggas, that's dead and don't know why.
Who wanna look at the nigga who shot 'em
And ask these questions.

Oh my, do I love to grip the hips and ass.
Only 17, with a lot of practice on black boys' jimmys and white boy's cactus.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, but I gotta be brief:
A lotta niggas like bustin' nuts in her teeth.
Drink it up, drink it up, even though she's Catholic,
That don't mean shit, 'cause she's givin' up the ass quick.

Can take on three men built like He-Men;
Her little-bitty twat got gallons of semen.

I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter!

I'm here to let you know your little girl is a hoe.
Nympho, nympho, boy is she bad; get her all alone and out come the kneepads.
I know she's a minor and it is illegal,
But the bitch is worse than Vanessa Del Rio.

And wear that dress that's tight on her butt,
So I can finger-fuck on the way to the bed,

'cause after I got 'em it was over. Now niggas get lucky like a four-leaf clover.

The ice was set free but I was still complaining
The situations worse oh yes it's worse the situation
Would've been better off with a different education
My mother and my father they were born in Jamaica
I haven't been there yet I hope to visit there later
Know where I'm coming from and
Know where I'm going
I'm a britaican as I grow it is showing
I'm funkin' with you
F.u.n.k.i.n. I'm funkin' with you, funkin' with you
Eventually finally I got it together
And I won't stop rocking no way no dubt
So this is a shout goin' out for all the louses
Who don't know what rap music is about
I didn't get a chance to say exactly what I wanted
Long ago so now it is my chance just tune in close
'cause now I'm getting paid and laid don't be afraid
I'm getting paid for my lyrics take a double dose
'cause wasn't before now things have changed and I'm
Jumpin' like Jack Flash but with you I am funkin'
Time after time after rhyme after rhyme
Ya try to put me down 'cause I'm gettin' mine

It had enough power to take out a whole army 
I'm barmy out of my mind this time 
I got to have you for my woman cause your so damn fine 

Tell me tell me tell me? 

l'd give you what you want and make you feel like a lady 
Give you good loving and l'd feed it to you daily 
Do it in the shower in the closet cause l'm adle 
Do it in the kitchen underneath the round tadle 
No I wouldn't rush it l'd be cool and chill 
Do it real slow 'cause I know I got skill 
Massage your body and your mind and your soul

Is one of the most important habits you can learn
David has probably never stopped to think what a wonderful thing sleep is
Dreams are normal too
Going to bed at a regular time each night
Makes it easier to go right off to sleep

Rest your head, here's a lullaby
A melody for heavy eyes
Early to bed, early to die
Welcome to your worst nightmare

Fast asleep, it's all in your head now
Past the street where they cursed my name
But I won't be forsaken
Craven my revenge from the shallow grave
Where I went down in flames
The beast has been awakened

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

Of countin' the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare

I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
Sweet dreams

Fell in love with hate 'cause evil fit like a glove
It's fate that I'm still here
And I won't be forsaken
Wicked when I was just a man
But sickening now and fed by fear

Crime rules the streets, who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Look at the cars as they roll by
Benz, Ferraris, trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're livin' proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game, that's why you boast
Because you're high priced, high speed high post
  
High roller
  
That's right, you're high rollin'
You think you got it goin' on right?
You got money, cars, jewelry 
You think you got everything
Lemme tell you, you ain't got nothin'
You ain't got nothin' but a one way ticket to death row
You gotta get out of the game man
Or the game is gonna get you

Now when I say high rollers, I mean the best
Forget the half-steppers, eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood, Scarface runnin' through their veins
Silk shirts, leather suits, hair always fresh
Eelskin boots, large hearts, though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruisin' in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin' ""Pusher Man""
Yes, their fashion's high but hard to beat
They buy their GUCCI at GUCCI'S, not the swap-meet
Eat very well, much clientele
Whatever you need, they probably sell
  
High rollers

Yeah and let me break it down for the ladies
All you girls out there that think you gon' get that quick money and ain't goin' to jail
You better think again
  
Oh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold
Cold as a igloo, or hot as a flame
They'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name
Gangsters to the max, all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferrari's not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded, most men don't understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
They're junkies for fun, love life on the run
And if things get hot, they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame, no shame to the game
And they all seek power, fuck the fame
  
The high rollers
Yeah, the high rollers
Street hustlers, the players
Out there getting that long money, you know what I'm sayin'
But that fast money leads to a fast life and a quick death
This is my word, this is Ice-T
And I ain't got no reason to lie to you
  
Now radio stations probably won't play
This record because of the things I say
They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustlin' hood
And a record like this can do no good
But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
I don't know which side of the law you belong
  
Yes, the game has flash but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake, hard times lurks
And jail's not your only problem, though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from a M-16
But to each his own, choose you mobile phone
Choose a tailored suit, the luxury home
You'll never get caught, 'cause you got nerves of ice
And you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right
You wanna be a high roller
  
You wanna be a high roller",High Rollers,1988
Ice T,"Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record's revolvin'
Evil's the mixer, I'm the rap trickster
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, coolin', yo colder than ever
Punk executioner, E pull the lever
Rotate the wax, then cut and axe the tracks
Push up the levels 'til the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're on the rise up
We're sellin' dope 'til we're succeeded 
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
I'm sellin' dope in each and every record store
I'm the king pin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high? Let the record play

I know you're lovin' this drugs as it's comin' out your speaker
Bass through the bottoms, highs through the tweeters
But this base you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep you hype
Groovin' like I see you doin'
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high, why? That ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
From sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T

I'll bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up
You want in? I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot'em up
Cops found'em in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean'em up with no Ivory soap
I leave'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope
'Cause you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give, makes me invincible

The cops don't know what to do because my dope breaks through
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut then removes it
IZ checks for purity, then approves it
And then you get it, try it and like it
And if it ain't potent, we remix it and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Because if you're doin' crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope come look in my trunk
The dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit
So get real fool and try some real hit",I'm Your Pusher/Pusherman,1988
Ice T,"Emcee's no time out, it's time to rhyme out
You've dug your own grave, now you must climb out
Dig out, crawl out, hide from the fallout
'Cause when I get mad I go all out
ICE cooler than the coldest cube, dude
And when I'm micin' boy, I'm known to get rude
Criminal background, it's time to get down
I use a silencer, don't like the loud sound
Of my mic blast, you better run fast
The last punk that popped junk passed
Spit on his grave, laughed, jumped in my stretch
Signed his bitch and autograph
Syndicate boy, I don't fool out
You're full grown, school's out
You try to diss? I think you better cool out
'Cause your butt is smoke, if we ever duel out
This jam is directed, to all of those who expected
For me to cold be rejected but now I'm highly respected 
And now their ears are infected
With dollar signs I've collected
Jealous punks, I said it!

Take it personal
(Personal)

Take it personal punk, I'm talkin' to you
And if they agree with you, then your crew too
I never diss an emcee, I wish'em all good luck
But if you diss me to my face, duck
My style don't ramble, you shouldn't gamble
With your grill, I got a fist like an anvil
I write a record, lock it on the topic
EVIL and IZ dog the track, then we drop it
Record stores rock it, stock it, fans buy it
People that never heard of ICE-T try it
Then you try to diss? You got gall
I got gold on my neck and gold on my wall
Gold on my fingers, gold in my ear
When this jam's spinnin', gold's what you hear
Toy, this ain't Christimas, no time to play
I ain't no child, punk, you'll get sprayed
Illin' on a mega-villan
You must want a pine box to go chill in
Buried deep, creep, no one will weep
'Cause the next night with your bitch I'll sleep

Take it personal
(Personal)

I ain't East Coast, West Coast, new style, or old style
You wanna know about me? Check police files
Get out my face or you might have a bruised one
Brass knuckle prints? Yes, I used some
I ain't here to boast, I don't do that
When I talk it's straight dope, pure facts
I rock hard but still called a new jack
But talk shit, you're sure to get heard cracked
I don't drink or smoke or do dumb drugs
But my posse's still labeled street thugs
L.A.P.D's got all my boy's mugs
Can't use my phone for the damn bugs
I live in privacy, don't like suckers hawking me
News reporters, some think they can talk for me
Lies, misquotes, changin' all my words around
But if I catch 'em on the street they'll get beat down
They get money for hype-type publicity
They don't think twice, about dissin' me
But that's a mistake, with the SYNDICATE you shouldn't mess
I hope those punk reporters wear vests

Take it personal
(Personal)
Take that personal
(Personal)

Now the words I kick to some might sound radical
But I'll explain, it's simply mathematical
You diss, I diss, this creates an equal
You reply to my diss, this is called a sequel
I reply to your diss, this is called a battle
Not intelligent, not very adult
So I don't battle, I just put heads out
A straight line is always the direct route
I write lyrics clear, to leave no doubt
Don't even have to say who I'm speakin' about
You know who you are, you just jealous
'Cause you hear my records, are million sellers
Try to say I'm wack, out on the streets
While your whole crew is jockin' my beats
See me on T.V. and in the papers
See me at a jam, catch vapors

(Personal)

This shit is personal",Personal,1988
Ice T,"People, it's time for the Ice crush
So listen to my words I bring much
Sense, as I commence, my lyrics intense
Your telephoto, break out your big lens
Look, check out the sales charts
My record's kickin', I'm breakin' P.D.'s hearts
They banned me from their shows
'Cause they said I'm too hard
But no sell-out, I guess I'm just barred
I ain't changin' mine for no body
They bleeped words from Doug's LA-DE-DA-DE
I can't get a bleep? What's the deal?
Maybe my words are just too real
It's not profanity, it's just the man and me
He doesn't want you to see what I see
Doesn't want you to be what you can be
Word, censorship of reality

Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me

Suckers don't, but some do
The real troopers bring the ICE to you
And close friends to me, yeah, Public Enemy
These stations have high intellect
They don't pretend to be, too bourgeois to rock a jam raw
Understand what I'm sayin', they're down by law
They play the jams that are right, sometimes not polite
They realize you gotta get some people uptight
Speak the word, your voice will definitely be heard
Lie to yourself, you're destined to be to the curb
Some stations don't care, they'll never put on the air
Nothin' but commercial junk, their brain power's impaired
They don't listen or try to hear what I write
Maybe just think once, or try some school at night
They're makin' radio wack, people have to escape
But even if I'm banned, I'll sell a million tapes

Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me

I make records for music, not for the money
To some of you that might sound funny
But I ain't broke, and I don't joke
And my lyrics are known to make ears smoke
Clear as a gun scope, I speak the pure dope
Can the radio handle the truth? Nope
Uncut, no edits, no censors
You can get a plastic rapper from any old dispenser
A penny a yard, to make a record ain't hard
But to make it mean something, that's a job
But then we do it, they refuse it
So I tell them duck suckers to cold go screw it
We shouldn't sell out, we should just yell out
And get them wack motherfuckers the hell out

Cruisin' down the street what do I see?
Crash Task Force, L.A.P.D.
Gangs illin', wildin' and killin'
Hustlers on a roll, like they got a million
Girls in the strap and you know that
You know the guys will stop wildin' if you stop that crap
But you can't, you want money so bad
You'll jock anything with a Gucci tag
You gotta have it, so the men go get it
Robbin' and stealin', soon to regret it
Livin' in a jail cell, feelin' like a dumbbell
While you jump the next jock, well
That's reality, that's  what I see
Nobody says that you got to agree
Censorship that ain't the way to be
I thought you said this country was free?

The FCC will not allow profanity
Your subject matter's too hard, make a love song
You better get real, come on
I ain't no lover, I'm a fighter
Hard core radical rap rhyme writer
Pushin' the button, E does the cuttin'
Everything I say amounts to something
More than a simple rap, I'm too deep for that
I lay my lyrics with logic, press the wax
Play it on your tape deck, feel the effect
If you can't take the heat, eject
But I know you can, 'cause you're an ICE-T fan

I carry a axe to tax and wax those who rap

Turn up your stereo,equalize treble
Bass be kickin' stupid hard as metal
On the mic tonight that's right your rhyme opponent
M.C. Ice T just microphonin'
33 and 1/3 revolutions per minute
This record is def because my heart is in it
Vocals laid by the Ice,tempos tight and precise
Special effects will be created by an editor's splice
The funk is in it,ya dig it so stop that frontin'
Bust a move to my groove work your body do somethin'
No way in the world that you can deny my method
As my record rotates,my words get more impressive
I'm an M.C., Evil's my Dj on Sire Records not M.C.A.
C.B.S.,Capitol,cause they move too slow
Now Sire/Warner Bros. clocks all the dough
As the record revolves money's gettin' made
A.S.C.A.P. pays me every time it's played
I chill in def leathers pure silks and suede
And the gold around my neck will never fade
Down with my Syndicate organized rhyme
Kickin' def tempos that I design
And if you can't hear'em that's such a crime
You better wash your dirty ears with some 409

I always rhyme elite,stay on beat
Travel in a posse when I walk the street
Loved to say  my rhymes when I used to max
Now I don't speak much,I save my words for wax
I just want to make a little point in this song
With a little nonsense we can all get along and on and on
Till the break'a break of dawn
This jam will never play out because the grooves too strong
Guys grab a girl,girls grab a guy
If a guy wants a guy,please take it outside
I want to make ya enjoy yourself
On the mic tonight Ice T!!Who else?
Evil's on the cuts,Henry Gee's shot gun
Islam's my producer,Bambattas son
Bronx Style Bob's cold watchin' my back

If you're down with my crew you will be fine
But if you ill we'll get dirty-bring your 409!!

409......",409,1987
Ice-T,"Ya heard the Ice was rockin', ticket sales were high
Bought some fresh Adidas so you could look fly
Broke out from your crib rushin' to get here
Tripped ans stumbled almost broke your neck comin' down the stairs
Jumped into your ride, pushed the speed to the limit
Jumped out of your car faster than you jumped in it
Now you're at the jam but in for a shock
Stupid big line wrapped around the block
Through the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme
Methodically you schemed a way to cut in line
But when you got inside the sight straightened your curls
Cause as you look around all you could see were girls

I love ladies

I think it's time that I tell the truth
I been dissin' females since my early youth
But you know that's a drag and there's no doubt
Cause females are the one thing that I can't do without
Female companionship is my one vice
I love to buy the girls things, love to treat em real nice
Homeboys you must admit the best part of each day
Is when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way
Females possess that one commodity that no man will ever have
Not that hangs around me
They got it, we want it, they move it, and flaunt it
They shake it and sway it, we'll die just to lay it
We try to suppress it until they undress it

I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)

I'm junkie for females and that's a fact
I'm not into havin' my homeboys rubbin' my back
Don't dig goin' to the movies alone
Or talkin' to myself on the telephone
Goin' to a disco that's packed with men
That's like tryin' to get a dance in the federal pen
Walkin' through a park with a gang of the guys
And a beach full of fellas never opened my eyes
And man if females are one thing that you don't need
You better get away from me at a high rate of speed
Cause if you don't like them you must like men
And homeboy that's where our serious problems begin
Because to me women are God's true gift
There's absolutely no question who I'd rather be with

I love ladies

I seen this fly girl walkin' down the street
Jammin' a box rockin' to the beat
The girl looked pretty, she really looked nice
So I said to myself she's got to be with the Ice
Walked over to her, started sayin' my rhyme
She said ""Ice you're so bad, you damn near blew my mind""
I kept on rappin', runnin' my mouth
The next thing I knew I was at her house
Looked at her closely, said for goodness sake
The girl was cut like a diamond, had curves like a snake
Her top half was heaven, the bottom was the hell
I knew tonight that the Ice was gonna rock well
But then she started talkin' mess about love and romance
Until she noticed the bulge growin' in my pants
You should'a seen the girl's eyes as my body expanded
She grabbed for my leg, raw sex she demanded
My knees started knockin', I tried to run
She said ""Please don't leave Ice, I want you to come""
This girl meant business I had no doubt
This is just about the time that the Ice passed out
The next day I woke the girl was through
Room still smokin', my legs black and blue
My eyes bloodshot, my hair pressed straight
My knees still knockin', I knew I lost weight
She was the best y'all, yes on this earth
I would'a paid a million dollars, that's what it was worth
If I had got her name or number it would'a been nice
But I'm here to let you know the girl went off on the Ice

I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)

No when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how
When I ask for a reply they always scream owww!!
It's the homeboys always tryin' to act real chill
Sometimes it's jealous MC's mad cause they ain't on the bill
Maybe they scared if they say ho!
They might lose their cool
But I got some news for you: a fool's a fool
But don't get me wrong, most fellas do rock
They put their hands in the air, they take the show to the top
They start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins
They don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins
They don't lean against the wall like they're I some trance
They did not come with no intention to party or dance
You know what? yo dead beats should just stay home
Leave me, my homeboys, and the ladies alone

Cause my crew don't mess around

Stupid fly,it's got to the F-you-N-K why?
So that you can get loose as I produce sounds hard as the deuce
Manipulate the bass gain give the level's a boost
The lyric layer rhyme sayer,born to be player
If politics were my kick then I'd be your mayor
Governator,Senator,I'm your mentor
Rap rhythm is erratic,time is four, four
I'm the microphone scholar,clockin' long dollars
Here to make the place funky while the fly girls holler
Genius vocalist,rhyme style priceless
Pound of gold around my neck,mic in my first
The microphone virtuoso crazy insane I'm loco
With the speed to exceed,make other MC's look slow mo
Un-lease release words mean as a beast
I eat MC's for lunch and dinner,I can serve for a feast
Their rhymes are elementary,mine deserve a PH D
This beat is F-you-N-Key my name is Ice T 

Make it funky

Undoubtedly you recognize this jam is the ultimate cut
Uncontrollably you motivate and move your butt
It's rough the beat is gangsterous,call it tough
If you're diss'n stop frontin',come on what's up?
Complicated voice gymnastics are all in your face
Vegas got my highs,E.V's got control my bass
My break is comin' get busy no time ta waste
Now's the time do body work here's the place

Make it funky

Make it funky enough so the tracks lay tough
'Cause I'm tossin' it up and the Ice don't bluff
The girl charmer toy Harmer,juice strong as armor
When I stand upon the stage you could call it melodrama
Intense suspense my voice emcee
I wouldn't have you come and see me under false pretense
The girlies do be wild'n'as I'm profilin'
Limos lined around the block for about a mile'n'a half
Autographs the list goes on
If you forgot it ""make it funky"" is the name of this song
Stupid dope and you know it,it rates a ten
You pray my DJ cuts the records so it starts again
'Cause I can keep the mic cookin' for an entire month
My rhymes are always hard hittin' I don't know how to bunt
My DJ cuts like a laser E-V-I-L-E
Put your finger on the records

Ice-T,"Deuce,deuce revolver was my problem solver
Had a def girl,really didn't want to involve her
In the life of a gangster,use to rob bankster
But now I'm locked up,I'm just a punk low rankster
Jail cells know me too damn well
Seems like I've built on earth my own personal hell
No matter how high I climbed,somehow I always fell
I guess a lot of players got this story to tell
No matter how cold you roll you simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But pain in the end

Pain (x4)

Organized crimer,big trouble finder
In and out of institutions ever since I was a minor
But now I'm on the bricks,deep in the mix
Crime smarts searching hard for some new street tricks
I think I'll join a gang,sling a little cane
Put a beeper on my belt and get myself a name
Fresh sneakers,silk shirts,24/7 work
Nine to five to survive,you gotta be a jerki 
I clock two grand a day,yet I was born to play
Who me at micky dee's?It wouldn't work,no way
I'm a  big money haver but not the last laugher
For me infamy makes me no autographer
Custody haunts my dreams,nightmares of capture
Paranoid of surveillance,phobia of cameras
My banks bigger,but so are my fears
Past records proved players live limited years
But I'm unlike the rest,know to be the best
Fast money,true wealth my eternal quest
I hustle all night long,there ain't no gain in rest
12 gauge close range,bloods on my chest
I looked into his face,I thought he was my friend
My boy had me set up,this wound would never mend
No matter who you trust,you simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end

Pain (x4)

Gold rope wearer,neighborhood terror
Can't hang around my mother 'cause she says I scare her
Got a light sunburn from too much pool-side sittin'
Coroless phone keeps me on 'cause there ain't no quittin'
Mind's in a money mode,seems like it should explode
Girlies on my jammie,got a female overload
Young street messiah,professional liar
19 gotta Benz,21 I'll retire
Crazy money it ain't funny,suckers lovin' my jock
But there's some people at my door that didn't even knock
Task force boomin',doggin' my crib out,can't shout
F.B.I. got a gun in my mouth!
Threw me on the floor,called my girl a whore
Pulled ten G's out my mattress and was lookin' for more
Cracked my safe with an axe,then illed out to the max
When they seem my money kickin' it in twenty G stacks
Booked me on ten counts,with bails of different amounts
The charges stuck like glue,some that I couldn't pronounce
They threw my ass the book,my life wa surely took
And then they gave my girl 
Ten years for hangin' out with a crook
She played the game herself,fast lane quick wealth
No respect for the law or the city's health
The sweat of hustlers greed is not reserved for men
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end

You put all my lovers to shame

Then around your neck until you show respect
Then on your cheek until I reach my peak
Then in your mouth girl,no joke,I'll take it out
Don't want to see you choke
I'll run it down your back,might cause a heart attack
I'll put it in your butt until I get enough
And then I'll take it out and put it in my pants

About to unload the ammo,""E"" squeeze the trigger

They say I'm violent,they should watch their T.V.
They say I'm brutal,they should check their P.D.
You made me,now your kids rave me
I rap about the life that the city streets gave me
Murder,intrigue,somebody must bleed
Miami Vice is small time,L.A's the big league
From the rollin' 60's  to the nickerson ""G""
Pueblos,grape street,this is what I see
The jungle,the 30's,the V.N.G.
Life in L.A. ain't no cup of ter
  
Squeeze the trigger

Paid my dues to the streets,took my hard knocks
Disrespected by snobs,damn near trampled by mobs
Persecuted by  squares workin' nine to five jobs
Like a panther I prowl ,like a lion I growl
Learn to see behind my back like the head of an owl
I'm the voice of the youth,the prophet of truth
What I speak is really  though some 
May say ruthless tactics are takin' by me to awaken
People  to life but I feel no fakin'
No jivin',no lyin',no frontin',no playin'
Say exactly what's up,understand what I'm sayin'
Ban me,try it,you might cause a riot
What the radio won't play,the underground will supply it
I'm a MC pirate that's loud not quiet
Radical as they make'em,make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise,some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
But most do respect the words I inject
Kick credit for realism and the truth I project
Because I could bust rhymes for fun,or cut MC's like a knife
But the topic I love is the drama of life

But no matter  the lies we all know who's wrong
Homeless sleep on the city streets
Waitin' to die with nothin' to eat
While rich politicians soak their feet
In the pools at their ten million buck retreats
People hate people for color of face
No one had a choice in the race we were placed
A brother in queens was beaten and chased
Murdered cold in the streets, a goodamn disgrace
Just because of his race,his life went to waste
And no one went to jail when the court heard the case
Justice or corruption?it's all interlaced

I wouldn't be here if I fed my brain
Got knowledge from school books, instead of street crooks
Now all I get is penitentiary hard looks
The joint is like an oven of caged heat
You're just a number, another piece of tough meat

My beat is by ISLAM, the cut's by the great E. 
My heartbeat is kickin', it's kickin' louder and louder
It's gettin' deafer and deafer, I'm feelin' prouder and prouder
Not robbin', killin', just mic illin'
The phone rings, ""we made another million""
Break out the Dom and pop the corks
I catch a flight to New York
Hit the L. Q., watch RED spin, ""it's closed""
Brooklyn strikes again

Once again, my friends, it's time to rock it 'til the party ends
Rhymin' with timin', as EVIL E lets the record spin
Kickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'
'Cause I be layin' rhymes super sly, 'cause this is do or die
Make it or break it, although most emcees do fake it
I'll say the ICE can't take it, time to microphone bake it
Raise the heatin' level, break out your coal shovel
Pump the temp, I'm sweatin' like a devil
Listen to my heartbeat, it's beatin' like a wild man
But that's natural, 'cause you know that I am
No punk, no chump, no fool, no toy
Try to get ill and serve you, boy",Heartbeat,1988
Ice-T,"Speed of life, fast, it's like walkin' barefoot over broken glass
It's like, jumpin' rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick decisions are made
Lifestyle plush, females rush
This high profile personality, who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar, schoolboys admire
Young girls desire, very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme, dress code supreme, vocabulary obscene
Definition-street player, you know who I mean
  
High rollers

Yeah the high rollers, street hustlers
Fast money, fast life
But you don't care, 'til you end up with a bullet in your head, boy
  
People of the city, stop foolin' yourself
Crime rules the streets, who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Look at the cars as they roll by
Benz, Ferraris, trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're livin' proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game, that's why you boast
Because you're high priced, high speed high post
  
High roller
  
That's right, you're high rollin'
You think you got it goin' on right?
You got money, cars, jewelry 
You think you got everything
Lemme tell you, you ain't got nothin'
You ain't got nothin' but a one way ticket to death row
You gotta get out of the game man
Or the game is gonna get you

Now when I say high rollers, I mean the best
Forget the half-steppers, eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood, Scarface runnin' through their veins
Silk shirts, leather suits, hair always fresh
Eelskin boots, large hearts, though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruisin' in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin' ""Pusher Man""
Yes, their fashion's high but hard to beat
They buy their GUCCI at GUCCI'S, not the swap-meet
Eat very well, much clientele
Whatever you need, they probably sell
  
High rollers

Yeah and let me break it down for the ladies
All you girls out there that think you gon' get that quick money and ain't goin' to jail
You better think again
  
Oh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold
Cold as a igloo, or hot as a flame
They'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name
Gangsters to the max, all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferrari's not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded, most men don't understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
They're junkies for fun, love life on the run
And if things get hot, they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame, no shame to the game
And they all seek power, fuck the fame
  
The high rollers
Yeah, the high rollers
Street hustlers, the players
Out there getting that long money, you know what I'm sayin'
But that fast money leads to a fast life and a quick death
This is my word, this is Ice-T
And I ain't got no reason to lie to you
  
Now radio stations probably won't play
This record because of the things I say
They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustlin' hood
And a record like this can do no good
But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
I don't know which side of the law you belong
  
Yes, the game has flash but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake, hard times lurks
And jail's not your only problem, though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from a M-16
But to each his own, choose you mobile phone
Choose a tailored suit, the luxury home
You'll never get caught, 'cause you got nerves of ice
And you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right
You wanna be a high roller
  
You wanna be a high roller",High Rollers,1988
Ice-T,"Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record's revolvin'
Evil's the mixer, I'm the rap trickster
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, coolin', yo colder than ever
Punk executioner, E pull the lever
Rotate the wax, then cut and axe the tracks
Push up the levels 'til the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're on the rise up
We're sellin' dope 'til we're succeeded 
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
I'm sellin' dope in each and every record store
I'm the king pin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high? Let the record play

I know you're lovin' this drugs as it's comin' out your speaker
Bass through the bottoms, highs through the tweeters
But this base you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep you hype
Groovin' like I see you doin'
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high, why? That ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
From sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T

I'll bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up
You want in? I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot'em up
Cops found'em in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean'em up with no Ivory soap
I leave'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope
'Cause you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give, makes me invincible

The cops don't know what to do because my dope breaks through
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut then removes it
IZ checks for purity, then approves it
And then you get it, try it and like it
And if it ain't potent, we remix it and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Because if you're doin' crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope come look in my trunk
The dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit
So get real fool and try some real hit",I'm Your Pusher,1988
Ice-T,"Emcee's no time out, it's time to rhyme out
You've dug your own grave, now you must climb out
Dig out, crawl out, hide from the fallout
'Cause when I get mad I go all out
ICE cooler than the coldest cube, dude
And when I'm micin' boy, I'm known to get rude
Criminal background, it's time to get down
I use a silencer, don't like the loud sound
Of my mic blast, you better run fast
The last punk that popped junk passed
Spit on his grave, laughed, jumped in my stretch
Signed his bitch and autograph
Syndicate boy, I don't fool out
You're full grown, school's out
You try to diss? I think you better cool out
'Cause your butt is smoke, if we ever duel out
This jam is directed, to all of those who expected
For me to cold be rejected but now I'm highly respected 
And now their ears are infected
With dollar signs I've collected
Jealous punks, I said it!

Take it personal
(Personal)

Take it personal punk, I'm talkin' to you
And if they agree with you, then your crew too
I never diss an emcee, I wish'em all good luck
But if you diss me to my face, duck
My style don't ramble, you shouldn't gamble
With your grill, I got a fist like an anvil
I write a record, lock it on the topic
EVIL and IZ dog the track, then we drop it
Record stores rock it, stock it, fans buy it
People that never heard of ICE-T try it
Then you try to diss? You got gall
I got gold on my neck and gold on my wall
Gold on my fingers, gold in my ear
When this jam's spinnin', gold's what you hear
Toy, this ain't Christimas, no time to play
I ain't no child, punk, you'll get sprayed
Illin' on a mega-villan
You must want a pine box to go chill in
Buried deep, creep, no one will weep
'Cause the next night with your bitch I'll sleep

Take it personal
(Personal)

I ain't East Coast, West Coast, new style, or old style
You wanna know about me? Check police files
Get out my face or you might have a bruised one
Brass knuckle prints? Yes, I used some
I ain't here to boast, I don't do that
When I talk it's straight dope, pure facts
I rock hard but still called a new jack
But talk shit, you're sure to get heard cracked
I don't drink or smoke or do dumb drugs
But my posse's still labeled street thugs
L.A.P.D's got all my boy's mugs
Can't use my phone for the damn bugs
I live in privacy, don't like suckers hawking me
News reporters, some think they can talk for me
Lies, misquotes, changin' all my words around
But if I catch 'em on the street they'll get beat down
They get money for hype-type publicity
They don't think twice, about dissin' me
But that's a mistake, with the SYNDICATE you shouldn't mess
I hope those punk reporters wear vests

Take it personal
(Personal)
Take that personal
(Personal)

Now the words I kick to some might sound radical
But I'll explain, it's simply mathematical
You diss, I diss, this creates an equal
You reply to my diss, this is called a sequel
I reply to your diss, this is called a battle
Not intelligent, not very adult
So I don't battle, I just put heads out
A straight line is always the direct route
I write lyrics clear, to leave no doubt
Don't even have to say who I'm speakin' about
You know who you are, you just jealous
'Cause you hear my records, are million sellers
Try to say I'm wack, out on the streets
While your whole crew is jockin' my beats
See me on T.V. and in the papers
See me at a jam, catch vapors

Ice-T,"I'm livin' large as possible, posse unstoppable
Style topical, it's vividly optical
Listen, you'll see 'em sometimes I'll be 'em
Cops, critics and punks, never ever want to see me in power
Well, that's too bad, Apocalypse now I'm back and I'm mad
We're comin', you're runnin' cold and cunning
Ice T on the mic, TopGunning
After your neck, checkin' respect, makin' you sweat
Rhyme Syndicate boy, in effect
The rap motivator, teacher, talker, night rhyme stalker
Words thrillin', so real they're chillin', the hit author
Gettin' louder than a shot gun, you don't want none
Rhyme pays was the name of the album
But that was number one, this is the number two
The posse grew,we're gonna break through

Power

Somebody line up the suckers who refuse to recognize the truth
Tie up the punks who refuse to understand the youth
My posse's growin' and it's gettin' larger every day
Detroit, Chi-Town, Pittsburgh, Houston, L.A.
Come on, come on, come on, toys, let's play
Circle the calendar, perpetrator doomsday
Ice-T fool, man of my own, full grown
I cause havoc when I speak upon the microphone
I'm outspoken, no jokin', get in my face your jaw will get broken
Layin' it, sayin' it, then you're playing it
Lyrics so heavy that you might try weighin' it
Hated by many but I hate 'em back
Loved by troopers who know where it's at
You might like me, might think I'm wack
But don't step to me 'cause the boy stays strapped
I'm taking no shorts, hatin' the courts, hatin' the judges
Punk DA's with their personal grudges
I hate the clubs that think with their butts
No hats, no jeans, no sneakers, no what?
No beepers, no gold? Yo kiss my ass
We'll wait and see who gets the last laugh
We'll have the power

Power
We'll have the power
Power

Power, it starts with P like pussy
She knows she's got it,she doesn't worry,does she?
Spendin' your cash, leavin' you in the trash
While your little head's thinkin', they're gone in a dash
They got it, know it, that's why they show it
The power of sex, if man could overthrow it
He'd be king in a day, no way. We get rich, hard, give it away
We're weak and as we speak, the girls are hawkin'
Sizin' me up straight out as I'm talkin'
But you gotta have control if you want the gold
I don't want to be alone like Stallone
So I keep my mind thinkin' 'bout the green
And stop dwellin' on the in-between
I got power

Power

I'm on a mission mackin' hard as a hammer
Take my picture, I might take your camera
My posse might move, and they move fast
A fool's move could be a punk's last
Ain't no criminal although I used to be
Ain't no new jack rappin' ain't new to me
I been makin' records on wax since 1982
Now it's 1988 finally I'm coming through
That adds up to six years of makin' ok jams, but now I'm mad
Here comes the body slam
Turnin' out concerts, house'n the industry
Lovin' all the fly girls screamin' for Ice-T
Rollin' with the Syndicate my unstoppable battalion
38 Solid gold my medalion
Gainin' velocity, momentum and energy
ICE Capital T
I got the power

Power

So you say that I'm a fake think, you really must be a fool
I been to jail more times than you have probably been in school
Shot at, shot back, hit, and seen my buddies killed
That's the foundation upon the raps of Ice-T are built
I say what I think, the system does stink
Money you walk, you short, you're writin' from the klink
Come on, what's up, you know the laws are full of bull
Prey on the lame, release those with pull
Power! I know you wanta try it
Well check out money can buy it
Control and mold the world to do your wishin'
The knowledge of power is mine, so just listen
Money controls the world and that's it
And once you got it, then you can talk shit

So listen to my words I bring much
Sense, as I commence, my lyrics intense
Your telephoto, break out your big lens
Look, check out the sales charts
My record's kickin', I'm breakin' P.D.'s hearts
They banned me from their shows
'Cause they said I'm too hard
But no sell-out, I guess I'm just barred
I ain't changin' mine for no body
They bleeped words from Doug's LA-DE-DA-DE
I can't get a bleep? What's the deal?
Maybe my words are just too real
It's not profanity, it's just the man and me
He doesn't want you to see what I see
Doesn't want you to be what you can be
Word, censorship of reality

Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me

Suckers don't, but some do
The real troopers bring the ICE to you
And close friends to me, yeah, Public Enemy
These stations have high intellect
They don't pretend to be, too bourgeois to rock a jam raw
Understand what I'm sayin', they're down by law
They play the jams that are right, sometimes not polite
They realize you gotta get some people uptight
Speak the word, your voice will definitely be heard
Lie to yourself, you're destined to be to the curb
Some stations don't care, they'll never put on the air
Nothin' but commercial junk, their brain power's impaired
They don't listen or try to hear what I write
Maybe just think once, or try some school at night
They're makin' radio wack, people have to escape
But even if I'm banned, I'll sell a million tapes

Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me
Radio suckers never play me

I make records for music, not for the money
To some of you that might sound funny
But I ain't broke, and I don't joke
And my lyrics are known to make ears smoke
Clear as a gun scope, I speak the pure dope
Can the radio handle the truth? Nope
Uncut, no edits, no censors
You can get a plastic rapper from any old dispenser
A penny a yard, to make a record ain't hard
But to make it mean something, that's a job
But then we do it, they refuse it
So I tell them duck suckers to cold go screw it
We shouldn't sell out, we should just yell out
And get them wack motherfuckers the hell out

You know the guys will stop wildin' if you stop that crap
But you can't, you want money so bad
You'll jock anything with a Gucci tag
You gotta have it, so the men go get it
Robbin' and stealin', soon to regret it
Livin' in a jail cell, feelin' like a dumbbell
While you jump the next jock, well

Ice-T,"It was a Saturday night on the streets of Cali
Threw on my dope silk suit, brushed off my suede Bally's
Threw on enough gold for any girl's pleasure
Left a pound and a half of that shit still in the dresser
I slapped a clip in my nine, threw a clip in my sock
Picked three grand up off the dresser, it was ten on the dot
Now my beeper started beeping, I threw that shit in the sink
I didn't need it no more, I had more money than Brinks
See, I was quitting the game and tonight was my fling
You see on the streets they're players but only one king
Now that's the title I held but the game is real fast
You gotta get in and get out if you expecting to last
Now my homeboy Evil was downstairs chillin' in his brand new Benz
I had many adversaries but very few close friends
We broke to the set, E parked the car on the grass
High-signin' was his trademark and he did it with class
Hit the door like two titans, the whole jam stopped to stare
And as we walked through the crowd they threw bills in the air
I spied my man Jazz maxin' out with two stone cold freaks
""Yo, what's up Ice, you rich now, man, you too good to speak?""
Now Jazz was a player from the east coast, the Bronx
He was known to be hard on the women and a brother he'd stomp
Smack a bitch in a minute, some say just for fun
And he was known for his chrome-plated pearl-handled gun
""Yo Ice, you my brother and I love you and all
But what's up with that six g's you owe me, man
'Member when your boys took that fall?
And I posted the bail 'cause yo ass was locked up""
Evil gave Jazz ten g's and Jazz shut the fuck up
Just then I saw Donald-D hit the front door
More gold than a Aztec, black leather he wore
Hoes grabbed for they niggas when D hit the set
'Cause what Donald D wanted, is what Donald D get
Donald's eyes hit mine, then a smile across his face
Then a light hit his ring and blinded the whole goddamn place
""Yo Ice you the coolest and Evil you mean
But I got the flyest shit rollin' off gasoline""
Everyone in the party moved quickly outside
To see Donald D's ultimate super fly ride
It was black, it was low, cost twice that of my Porsche
A Testarossa Ferrari, convertible of course
It purred like a jet
""Yo man, I bought it with cash""
It had 'Donald D' written in gold on the dash
Then out of no where came a shot across the street
I felt pain in my chest and my knees got weak
There was blood on my hands and I fell to to the ground
And all I could hear was ""Yo Ice is down!""
Somebody had shot me
The night that I quit
The night that I ended all this hustlin', playin' shit
It's ironic ain't it
The night I retire, would be the same night that my whole life expire",Soul on Ice,1988

You're bitchin' about rock'n'roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get
   
[You have the right to remain silent]
Fuck that right! I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin'
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers deprivin' the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfuckin' apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek
   
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said ""Fuck""
So I thought for a minute and said ""No,
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show""
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's comin', cos I'm mad and I'm gunnin'
Homeboys, and there's no runnin'
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothin' but a piece of fuckin' shit on the damned map
   
Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away
   
What they're trying to do with radio, with this, uh, McCarron-Walter
Act and a lot of other ways, is start by saying that they're
protecting the public from wicked rock bands, or girlie magazines, or
whatever. But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down,
what they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information
itself.
   
If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it.

Ice-T,"Yo! I met this girl the other night
Hype super-dope body and face, her mini-skirt tight
Talkin' 'bout legs and lips, mindblowin' hips
Had to cross my legs just to look at her tits
Said she came out lookin' for some fun
Looked me in my eyes and told me...I was the one
I said ""Why?"", she said I was fly
Grabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die
Said she wanted to take me home to make love
Now that's the kind of rap that brothers dream of
I said, ""Fast, slow, hard or soft, baby?""
She said, ""All the above""

This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life

Now, I ain't no sucker on the weak tip
But let me tell you, she was on some motherfuckin' sex trip
Took me to her crib that night, leather and spikes
Broke out the rope and the dope strobe-light
And started buggin', lightin' candles all over the room
Then she did a backflip, landed on my dick
I knew that I would be dead soon

This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one

Yo, my pants were on, but so what?
She ripped off my shirt and tied my monkey-ass up
Faster than I could say ""No!""
It was like a rodeo, I was with a sex nut
I looked in her face...
She sweated and she grinned with delight
And then she broke out a whip, I said ""Shit!""
This girl had crazy plans for the night
 
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one
This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life

Now whips ain't all that she had
All kinda crazy shit was at this bitch's pad
I'm talkin' about latex suits, spike-heeled boots
Oversized vibrators so that she could get loose
I said, ""Don't...don't...don't whip me!
I'll do anything you ask!""
And then homegirl stripped, 38"" tits
Man you shoulda seen that ass

This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life
This freak tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one

My dick was harder than a bulletproof vest
She started pourin' baby oil on her chest
And then she said, ""Gimme gimme gimme""
Jumped on my Jimmy, and rode me like the Wild West
I almost passed out, then the front door cold bust in
It was her fuckin' husband, six-foot ten
I knew my life would soon end

Homeboy tried to kill me, he didn't use a bomb or a gun
Homeboy tried to kill me, yo...yo, nowhere to run
Homeboy tried to kill me, he didn't use a gun or a knife
Homeboy tried to kill me, cos he had caught me fuckin' his wife
Yo...

Look in my face as my eyeballs roll
Back in my head and the mic glows red

And when I'm finished, you can take this rap apart
Analyze my elements and tactics
First I'm over there, and then I'm back to this
I jumble topics, you won't know where I'll go

I'm in my mode, called the fourth episode
Or the last verse, if you wanna decode
So I gotta raise the heat, hype up the beat
Switch the mic from airtight to elite
Pounce upon the deck, it ain't wet yet
Let me see how hot you can get
Then I'll turn up the amps, blow out the lights
You're in darkness, then the mic ignites
Glowin like it did before, but even more
The room is lit, the raps are hardcore
Evil cuts the records like a psycho with a switchblade
You see a blur -- that's the crossfade
Loud and proud, words bombard the crowd
Look up in the air -- you see a mushroom cloud
I kick flavor to a musical track
Too fast to catch, too complex to match
I'm gettin hyped as hype can get

the head. Street violence is at an all time high) 

No jokin' I'm sleepin' with my eyes open 
Wanted for a homicide ride the gun's still smokin' 
Didn't know what I was doin' but did it anyway 
Now the posse's on my trail they say I'm gonna pay (Run!) 

I had a gun it's mine and I packed it 
Out with my crew the boys caught some static 
Me and this sucker punk went at it 
Bang! Nine automatic 

Hunted Child 
I'm the Hunted Child 

(Sources say the assailant was 17-years old and lives in South-Central

Now I'm on a hideout tip 'cause they're after me 
LAPD says they're gonna capture me 
Was I crazy? I guess I had to be 
'Cause once you kill it's instant catastrophe 

Your whole life is over (Through!) 
Forget about your girl your (Crew!) 
Nowhere to run, so what you gonna do? 
Be glad it's me, homeboy, and not you

I'm only 17, I didn't mean to kill, man 
But I was slangin' and bangin' for the thrill, man 
When they said (Kill!) I felt chill, man 
But once I pulled the trigger, boy, then things got ill, man 

My homeboys dipped out the back fast 
Left me alone in the echo of the gun blast 
Everybody saw my face, I didn't wear a mask

Since I was young I never had a damned thing 
At Christmas time I'd hate to hear the bells ring 

'Cause in the ghetto Santa ain't got a dime 
Your mother's standin' in the welfare line 
The way the youth survive is crime 
My life is over so I might as well speak my mind 

I killed a brother 'cause this system had me geared to kill 
'Cause what I call home you call hell 
My ghetto quarters ain't no better than a jail cell 
But there's a message in this story that I'm tryna tell 

We're just brothers on the streets killin' brothers

Sellin' dope to poison each other

I'm a nigga on the trigger, madder than a pitbull
Just layin for a reason to pull

My dome exploded and I felt my other brothers die
I drink my blood as I fell like shit into the street
My corpse stunk like a burnt out rotten piece of meat
Ten brothers died in this stupid homicidal binge

Dig it, I'm just a brother from L.A.
South Central, I live life the fly way
Used to bang and hustle but I traded for the big game
Infamy got dumped for fame
Now I'm known and respect as creator of the crime rhyme;
but my lyrics are deeper
Because I'm the one that makes you think before make a move
I wrote ""Pusher"", ""High Rollers"", and ""Colors"" just to prove
that I could kick game, and drop knowledge at the same time
But one L.A. station wouldn't play my records one time
I'm tryin to save my community
but these bourgeoise blacks keep on doggin me
They don't care about violence, drugs and gangs
KJLH, you ain't about nuttin
You just a bunch of punk bourgeoise black suckers
and this one's for me

You won't play no Public Enemy
You ain't playin no Boogie Down Productions
You ain't tryin to represent the black community
You just carin about your little ol' R&B +BULL+
you play all day and night
I represent Los Angeles all over the United States
and you ain't did NUTTIN for me
Think about it

Hold up, I ain't finished on the diss tip
There's a few more punks that I got to rip
All you chump MC's who sell out quick
When P.E. was on the top, you rode the tip
But now they got problems and you suckers run
Who's Chuck's real friends, does he really have one?
You yell P.E. this, P.E. that
Fist in the air, proud to be black
Now they got static and you run like punks
I haven't heard an MC stand up for him once
Maybe you suckers are just hopin that they fall off
so you can fill their shoes, nope sorry boss
That's what the matter with black people anyway
We ain't down with nothin, I don't care what you say
yell or lie, don't even bother
How low will a brother go for a dollar?
Public Enemy broke a new rap age
And now you rappers ain't got nuttin to say?
""Yo it's their problem""		""Griff shouldn'ta said it""
E where's my pistol?  (Yo I'll go get it)
Cause it's time for me to enforce some discipline
Are you down or not, are you out or in?
Chuck Flav and Griff are my true friends
I got their backs if it means my career ends

All you so-called down MC's with Public Enemy
I ain't heard nobody out there, tryin to help my man out
YouknowhatI'msayin?  Griff is my man, I don't care WHAT he said
YouknowhatI'msayin?  And I ain't gon' let them go out like that
YouknowhatI'msayin?  Chuck, Ice got your back
Anybody out there got problems with Public Enemy, come talk to me

Once again, I'm back in the diss mode
I gotta speak my mind, it's time to unload
on this so-called government we've got
If I lied like them, I think I'd get shot
They sell drugs to kids and say it's us
And when the cops are crooks, who can you trust?
You only see young brothers in a drug bust
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
My homey got a year for an ounce of weed
while Bush sells weapons to the enemy
You gotta be stone blind not to see
""Our government is honest!""  Nigga, please
Cocaine can't be made in the United States
Kickin facts like this our government hates
The young kids on the streets ain't the enemy
They're just ghetto youth after money
They sell drugs, but who sells drugs to them?
Try the C.I.A. my friend
or the F.B.I. or even Bush
Somebody's gettin rich, damn sure ain't us
We're just killin ourselves while others laugh
Look at the street, it's a cocaine bloodbath
We gotta realize dope is pure death
Mess with drugs, you're breathin your last breath
Sellin drugs is straight up genocide
They're gonna laugh, while we all die

Sittin up there thinkin you're makin that money
Hustlin and all that, you're killin your brothers
YouknowhatI'msayin?  You just stupid, straight up stupid
Puttin dope into your body - c'mon, youknowhatI'msayin?
You gotta get somethin goin out there
Get some brains, youknowhatI'msayin?
We are just playin ourselves cold out of the pocket

This one's for me, I make records for you
but this cut I straight out had to do
There's topics in my mind I have to break
cause so many of you out there are so damn fake
If ya ain't know they're no-one, cutthroats
backstabbers, scheamin for banknotes
And all of you out there know what I'm talkin bout
If you claim you're down then NEVER sell-out
Never sell out, youknowhatI'msayin?
You gotta stay down for yours
You know I want it, sure as I'm Ice-T
I make records for you, but this one's for me

You know what I'm talkin bout out there
There's ways to sell out left and right
But you ain't got to do that
There's things more important than money
I'm talkin bout pride, I'm talkin bout dignity
You got it out there
All you got to do is stand on your own two feet
Don't go out like no sucker
Stay down, youknowhatI'msayin?

Ice-T,"Party!
(Okay party people in the house) 

Yo yo, in the place to be
My name is MC Ice-T
I got the Rhyme Syndicate with me
We about to tear stuff up, y'all feel good?
Yo, what the hell y'all wanna do, Syndicate, tonight, what you wanna do? 
(Party!)
Randy Mac in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Nat The Cat, you're in the house tonight, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Donald-D is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Bronx Style Bob is in the house, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Hen-Gee is in the house, what you wanna do, homeboy? (Party!)

Yo, Toddy Tee is in the house tonight, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Yo, Everlast is in the house, come on, what you wanna do? (Party!)
And MC Taste is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
My man Divine is in the house, what you wanna do, homeboy? (Party!)
Yo yo, I'm about to kick this party up, is that alright?

Yo, Yo, MC Ice on a Syndicate Rhyme spree
You say you wanna be down, you gotta talk to me
You wanna get in? Put a sucker's head out
Sound a little hot for you, boy? Then, toy, get out
Syndicate mob ain't nothin but hardened crooks
You try to diss, your butt is on a meat hook
Want some of me? You're on a mission
Bad move, you end up missin

Let's get it straight for the '89 tip
Randy Mac is clockin a stupid grip
On the party track I'm cold lampin
But when the Syndicate rolls I be jackin
You thought I fell off, I ain't even slipped
The Mac is cuttin records and punks are gettin ripped
Gangster I am, bust the lyrics like a drive-by
You wanna sleep? Well, it's lights out, beddy-bye

Notorious Asiatic, tough, talented
A power entertainer
Catapultin above the top
Nat The Cat, too swift to be stopped
I'm like Jordan, a team player on a solo flight
Lookin down on MC's faces full of fright and fear
I slam dunk a rap through their ear to hear
Heureka! I just struck a platinum fame
In the game things'll never be the same
Because money changes everything

Once again comin at you hyper
Donald D the Syndicate Sniper
Boston Strangler, Charles Manson
No matter what killer I mention, keep dancin
Five Fingers Of Death, Fists Of Fury
St. Valentine's Day Massacre on a jury
Wanna convict me for kickin black on wax
I walk the street with a battle axe

Life ain't nothin but a piece of existence
Cause when you die, you'se a past tense
So I like to live my life like a big carnival
Get drunk, act like an animal
I like the rock'n rolll, the funk, the jazz and hip-hop
Suckers get loud, I drop em
I like 
I'm Bronx Bob, bring the beats and I'm

Black stallion, knockin on concrete walls
Standin tall, rappers in my face, they stall
Stutter, softer than melted butter
There's no other word, go ask your mother
Hard solid as your city 
Born in Brooklyn, can tell by the way that I walk and talk
Strollin with a slight limp
Flyer than any big city pimp

Gold, girls, cold cash
On the mic Shaquel Shabazz
Supreme, the Lord, the G-o-d
Down with the Syndicate posse
It's you we rule without a tool
Mathematics in effect, it's time to school
I'm the principal and knowledge is the key
Shaquel in the place to be

I climb a mountain top with just one rope
Get to the top of the stairs and say a rhyme that's dope
Cause I'm a cliffhanger, no, I ain't a stranger
Yo, I'm Toddy Tee, and I'm a Compton banger
Wanted by the F.B.I. for transport of
Sucker MC's across the Syndicate borders
No, they can't give me no time, cause it's my rhyme
Everlast, get funky for me one time

Everlast is in effect gettin big respect
Then I collect big checks
1's, 5's, 10's and 20's
A 100 g's and I'm pullin honeys
Left and right, day and night
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight
They're all on the tip to get a sip
Of this poetic performer that's fully equipped

Y'all played yourselves right in front of the mic
Moved your body so that the feelin was right
But if you get lost scream out and admit
That the beat's too fast, slow it down or I quit
I'm not the kind to give you a call
To stop on a rap that I lead, so I pause
I give you 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
If that ain't enough, sit down till we're done

Syndicate scorned, you act obedient
Tired of your fish rhyme ingredients
Black on black while styles 
of brothers that's gotta be
Circlin cyphers into molecules
Takin over your space, that's illogical
The vocal chords on a board with 24 tracks
Get away from the break gotta rap

Syndicate posse growin, goin out of control
You say we're weak? This record's shippin gold
Power, strength, my posse got unity
We stick together and we're soon to be
In your town, we gonna bring the roof down
Ice-T and the syndicate underground
No selll-outs, cause it's caps we peelin
Girls we love em, and shows we steal em

Knowledge and wisdom, it's a mystery
I drop science for the ones who know it's me
You say I'm dope, cool, it makes sense
I ain't conceited, I'm just convinced
Strapped for the attack Randy Mac is rollin
The mic, the mixer, then the show is stolen
The pimp, the player, hustler kicker
Watch your girl, cause I stick her

Nat The Cat, my man will rap when I'm playin the back
Some think my stage presence is low, I think it's loud
Enough to see me flowin and showin
Go psycho breakin backs like bolo
Give me the mic, a metamorphis ignite
I break down on a cat stand, I kill ya like a hitman
And come out kickin with the 
Rockin on a rappin rampage
In control of the stage

There's a mouse in my house, so I bought a cat
The cat ran away, cause now there's a rat
I'm on the attack with my baseball bat
That one rap brought many of us back
All through my house I set up traps
It seem like the rats have a map
But nowadays I don't know how to act
So now I feed the rats crack

Back and I'm statin the fact
I know you're waitin for a rap
To make you get up and start to clap
For Bob, a Bronx Syndicate style
More bounce to the ounce and trizzy to the file
'79 the time I was inclined
To get smooth and prove that I can rock a funk rhyme
Hey yo, ice-cube chillin
Cause we got the gats and knack to see the kids top billin

Impressionalist, not a ventriloquist
Don't hang out with suckers worth less than piss
Suckers can all come kiss the tip
Of my knob when I aim I don't miss
Aim it to suckers that come around jockin
On my tip when on the radio my recors be rockin
Don't come frontin askin me for a pound
You ain't invited means you simply ain't down

Wake up it's time to be noticed
I'ma do this, I'm gonna show this
Beat to be mathematical
Syndicate's in the house, let's get radical
Bum rush the show and grab the mic
Syndicate's chilllin out tonight
They let me loose and now it's war
 let the rhymes roar

Grab a partner and hit the dancefloor
Cause I'm back to rock for you once more
I don't worry about what he said or she said
As long as what's said-said is done-done in my bed
The Juvenile Committee's on my side
And I'm kickin knowledge on a natural high
And I'm feeling strong
Yo, take this mic and get the party on

This is mortal combat, there ain't no comeback
You're tryin to get with me but you don't know where I'm at
Cause in this world there's no bombs or guns
Just a microphone, metaphors, words and puns
Sentences and phrases, no clubs or razors
No mercy for a sucker that wages
War, I'll take the floor, even the score
Grab the microphone and proceed to roar

Are y'all set, all prepared to start
Move in close cause here comes the dope part
By the way, I'm the Taste, if tracks
Could talk but they - but here go the facts
Brace yourself, you shoulda grabbed a grip
Protect your clan cause we're about to trip
Bass reflex, the kicks that drive, divide
The weak from the rest can't survive

Syndicate's housin all competition
We paralyze a physical powerful vision
But savage ignorants pop that's ignorant listen
Divine is no time for style
And I rock your grey matter with a smile
Cause I'm the rhyme thriller with dimensions of flavor
The knack - stylistic black

The reason we're bustin these raps are what?
To make all you wack MC's shut up
You're always buyin rap records jammin def beats
Then dissin rap artists out in the streets
You always say our jams are wack but yours'll be tight
But you never been near a studio in your life
You see, disrespect is your last resort
You're like Howard [Name], you never played this sport
But you're always talkin mess bout how it should be done
And when we ask to hear your record you never made one
So this message goes to amateurs and pros alike
We're the MC's that cold be doggin the mic
You may be good but there's no one better
We rock you so cold, you need a cashmere sweater
Fight dirty in the pit when combat is on
We always attack before attacked upon

Yeah, Rhyme Syndicate, we in here
We tossin it up
I got my man Everlast in the house
Tossin it up, youknowwhatimsayin
Kid Jazz and Bango couldn't be here
But we gon' to' it up for them anyhow
Wherever you are you're a star
Rhyme Syndicate blowin up like napalm
I got my man Chilly Dee deejayin on the set
And the one and only DJ Evil-E, we in here
Yo, we outta here like last year
Rhyme Syndicate
We gotta do it like the alphabet and a-b-c ya
Yeah

Everlast
Everlast in full effect
Where's my gold record?
Where's my record?
Where's my record?

Divine Styler with Physical Poets, look out

Microphone King Donald D the notorious, yeah

This is Bronx Style Bob...

Nat The Cat, boy

Randy Mac
One in a million on your back, boy

Yo
So we bout to get outta here
Seems like the police is outside, man
(Yo Ice, man, they got King Tee, Aladdin and Islam)
What, the police, man?
I knew somethin had happened
I was wonderin why King Tee missed the party, man
Yo Randy Mac, you got some money?
(Aw, you know what time it is, man
I got...)
Yeah, for some bail, buddy

Ice-T,"This is it, dope from the fly kid
The Ice mic is back with the high bid
Suckers you've lost cos players you're not, gangstas you ain't
You're faintin', punk, if you ever heard a gunshot
Yo, the pusher, the player, the pimp gangsta, the hustler
High Roller, dead pres folder
Is cold lampin' like a black king on a throne
Evil E...turn up the microphone
So I can ill and break on the rollin' tape
Another album to make? Great
Islam turn the bass kick up a bit
Hype the snare, now I got a place to sit
And ride the track like a black mack in his 'lac
Hit the corner slow where the girls are at
And kick game the way it should be done
How you gonna drop science? You're dumb
Stupid ignorant, don't even talk to me
At school you dropped Math, Science and History
And then you get on the mic and try to act smart
Well let me tell you one thing, you got heart
To perpetrate, you're bait, so just wait
Till the press shove a mic in your face
Or you meet Boogie Down or Chuck D
Stetsasonic or the Big Daddy
And they ask you about the game you claim you got
Drop science now, why not?
You start to sweat and fret, it gets hot
How'd you get into this spot?

You played yourself...
Yo, yo, you played yourself...

I'm no authority but I know the D-E-A-L
When it comes to dealin' with the females
What you got they want, cash is what they need
Slip sucker and they'll break you with speed
But you meet a freak, you try to turn her out
Spendin' money's what I'm talkin' about
But you fool out, your pockets got blew out
And after the date, no boots, you got threw out
Mad and shook cos your duckets got took
Call her up, phone's off the hook
But who told you to front and flaunt your grip?
You can't buy no relationship

You played yourself...
Yo, homeboy, you played yourself...

I'm in the MC game, a lot of MC's front
And for the money they're sell out stunts
But they claim that they're rich and that they keep cash
Yo, let me straighten this out fast
Two hundred thousand records sold
And these brothers start yellin' 'bout gold?
You better double that, then double that again
And still don't get sooped, my friend
You think you've made it, you're just a lucky man
Guess who controls your destiny, fans
But you diss 'em cos you think you're a star
That attitude is rude, you won't get far
Cos they'll turn on you quick, you'll drop like a brick
Unemployment's where you'll sit
No friends cos you dissed 'em too
No money, no crew, you're through

You played yourself...
That's right, you played yourself...
You played yourself...
Yo, yo, you played yourself...

You got problems, you claim you need a break
But every dollar you get you take
Straight to the Dopeman, try to get a beam up
Your idle time is spent tryna scheme up
Another way to get money for a jumbo
When you go to sleep you count Five-O's
Lyin' and cheatin', everybody you're beatin'
Dirty clothes and you're skinny cos you haven't been eatin'
You ripped off all your family and your friends
Nowhere does your larceny end
And then you get an idea for a big move
An armed robbery...smooth
But everything went wrong, somebody got shot
You couldn't get away, the cops roll, you're popped
And now you're locked, yo, lampin' on Death Row

Nobody put the crack into the pipe
Nobody made you smoke off your life
You thought that you could do dope and still stay cool? Fool.

",You Played Yourself,1991
Ice-T,"I once knew this brother
Who I thought was cool with me
Chilled out together
Even went to school with me
Fly nigga, my ace boon coon
Used to low ride together
Shot dice in the bathroom
Ya want trouble?
Well trouble ya found
Cause we diss ya, then issue
The critical beat down
He needed money
I would always come through
Needed a car? He could use mine too
But bust this!
Out on the street
People say he was riffin'
Callin' me a sucker
Talkin' bout how foul I'm livin'
Someone heard him
Poppin' that shit last week
Frontin' for some pussy
>From some big butt freak
Sayin' I'm his worker
I was on his dick!
Talkin' that craazy old weak assed shit
and after all of that
She still walked away
How ya gonna diss your boy
To get some play?
And when I stepped to him about it
He said, ""Who snitched?""

CHORUS
Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' bout you
Cause some of you niggas
Is bitches too!

I knew this brother named Mitch
Stone player
He meet a girl, in five min. he lay her
Trucked crazy jewels
Hands smothered in ice
Been to prison not once, but twice
Kept a stupid thick posse
Made of thugs and
Crooks and hoods
and vet hustlers
Who were up to no good
But they all stood behind him
and watched his back
That's the only way
To roll on  the track
But yo,
Mitch got rushed by feds last week
The snatchbared the runk
Of his white Corniche
Took a look inside
And what did they see?
Two keys, and a gallon of PCP!
Oh shit! The thought crashed
Mitch's subliminal
Three strikes, that's called
Habitual criminal
So insted of goin' under
He snitched on his whole posse
Maxed at the crib
And sipped Martini and Rossi
Sold out his whole crew
That rat named Mitch

CHORUS

I knew this guy
That was never that fly
Couldn't act cool
Even when he tried
When we played rough
He always cried
When he told stories, he always lied
A Black brother
Who was missin' the cool part
He had the color
But was missin' the true heart
When we would fight
He would always go down quick
So he took karate
and he still got his ass kicked
But now he's married
And he kicks his wife's ass
Says it comes from problems
That he had in the past
Doesn't like Blacks
Claims he's upper class
Joined the police, got himself a badge
Now he rolls the streets
and he's cut to jack
Doggin' young brothers
Cause they usually don't fight back
Got a White partner
And he asked for that
and every night
Another head they crack
So now he's big man
But he really ain't shit!

CHORUS

Out one night with my crew
and some new kid
I didn'T know homeboy, but Evil E did
So I thought he was cool
We rode in his ride
Rag top tray on Daytons
Lifted side to side
We hit the party deep
Niggas was hawkin' me
You could feel the vibe
Of thick artillery
Parliament was on, some O.G. shit
I put my back to the wall
And felt my pistol grip
al of a sudden
Niggas started trippin'
Flippin', the record started skippin'
Wildin', fools started locn up
Gats cracked
The room started smokin' up
Me and ""E"" hit the floor
And then the back door
My boys let off an automatic encore
But when we made it out to  the ride
It was gone, we had to shoot it out
Side by side
Punk left us there to die in a ditch!

CHORUS",Bitches 2,1991
Ice-T,"Let me tell ya a little story
Bout my homeboy Ed
Use to drink every day
Straight 40's to the head
You try to snap on him
He'd ask what you said
You still try to break
He'd start given up lead
Love to gamble
On one knee he stayed
Tryin' to hit seven
on one knee he stayed
Worked tees and weights
So he always got paid
Blew on the hoes
Every dollar he made
Crazy friends, crazy friends he had
Superfly drobe, super dope pad
Cars for your ass
and I'm talkin' class
Benz's and better
With his name on  the dash
One night he got drunk
And started drivin' real fast...

Ed's dead",Ed,1991
Ice-T,"Here we go
I'm movin' off death row
Ya gotta keep up hops
Ya can't be slow
Cuse their towers are high
They got the hype gaats
Check the perimeters good
Read the maps
It's night
They might not see us
Cuse if they catch us out there
They'll bleed us
Shoot us, kill us
Dump us in a dark ditch
Clean it up, call it a gang hit
I gotta make my move
Cause I'm a renegade
I recognize
when mind techniques
Are being played
It's a plot they use
To keep down another
Here comes another
Brainwashed brother

Shut up do you know
How dumb you sound?
That mentality
What keeps my people down
No one wants to
Live in an urban war
You live there cause
Your parents were poor
They live there because
Theirs were also

Hit the gates bro!

Are where you die!

Running and running faster
But I ain't runnin' from ya
I'm runnin' at ya

About a mil strong
Too late to make up now
Cause it's on
I'm the one that's got ya
In constant fear
I'm the nigga
You shoulda killed last yeaar
But you played yourself
You let me gain wealth
Now I can change the wy
The cards are dealt
I've schooled my homeboys
Made 'em all understand
The tricks nd twists
Inflicted on the Black man
How ya make me think
to be down
I gotta stay around
Down in the motherfuckin'
Battleground
There'll never be any good
Schools in the hood
There'll never be any cops
That are any good
The hospital is a great place
To go to die
Real estate's cheap
Let me tell ya why?
The man's got a
Sure fire system
A economic prison!

CHORUS

Escape from
The killing fields!",Escape from the Killing Fields,1991
Ice-T,"Upon initial contact with Ice-T's music,
I had envisioned him to be an ill-
Mannered and psychologically
Unstable man with an extremely
Uneducated and barbaric
Frame of mind, whose raps displayed
Nothing but ridiculous jaargon,
Shocking sexual audacity and
Repulsive images of the ghetto.
However, after further analysis of
His music I can deduce
That he is the epitome of
Antidisestblishmentarianism who
Embodies the entire spectrum of the
Urban experience and struggle.
But to make things more plain and
Simple to the lymn, I find Ice-T to be
The dopest, flyist, O.G. pimp hustler
Gangster plyer hardcore
Motherfucker living today.

To be honest I'm totally and
Irrevocably on his dick",First Impression,1991
Ice-T,"Everybody step back from the mic
As I set it off
All playin' the wall
It's time to sweat it off
Anybody with staatic oh please try
I'll do ya like Godfather 3
And do a fly by
Time to rip and hit and strangle
I eat Guardian Angels
And toy emcees
With their names on the front page
I bury in shallow graves
I don't rap to girls on my L.P.
I don't beg for pussy
I love the ladies
aand they love me right back
Now who's the mac?
Mission accomplished
I came to stomp this microphone
And leave suckers unconscious
and if you uthink
Yo got an S on your chest
You better wear two vests
Watch your back, your front
I always hit, don't bunt
Crazy posse
When I'm on a duck hunt
Emcee Ice-T answers to no one
Load my rhymes
And cock 'em like a shotgun
Let off like frags from a pipe bomb
A low stroll
and my mic in my right palm
The cops hate me
And that's right they oughta
Before my crew
Gets to their daughters

Nat the Cat Grandmaster Caz",Fly By,1991
Ice-T,"Yo nigga, yo momma got two feet growing out her titties
Bitch fell down and kept runnin'
Off to the studio late night
Time to cut another track
It's gotta be hype
Got my rhyme book in hand
A blue loose leaf
Anybody move on that
They get loose teeth
Evil's got the funky beat
A stupid dope loop
But the record's kind of old!
(What we gonna do troop?)
We gotta clean it up
Cause it's so dope
Tried the rubbing alcohol
Even the Ivory soap
But no matter what we do
The record keeps clickin'
FUCK IT!
Yo E, gimme some of that damn fried chicken!
Aw yeah (aw yeah)
Aw yeah, this sound kinda nice (definitely got flow)
I don't think niggas gon' hear that crackling, man, we should use this
Yo, fuck that, yeah bro, we can EQ that out
Oh yeah, I'm liking how this going down, word",Fried Chicken,1991
Ice-T,"You know the houe down the street
Where the kids are
and every day
They seem to have a new scar
Something strange is going on
And everybody knows
Doors always shut
Windows always closed
The little girl had a burn
The boy was black and blue
They said it came from play
You know that shit ain't true
The boy's arm's broke
Girl's scared to speak
Their parents drink all day
Couple of dead beats
Some days they go to school
And other days they might
It's hard to stay awake
After you cry all night
You see 'em every daay
Tear tracks on their cheeks
But they will never tell
It goes on weeks and weeks
(But what can they do?
They're only children man!)

You ain't no fuckin' kid
Act like you give a damn!
Won't someone save these kids
Do something, call a cop

The other night I heard gun shots!",The House,1991
Ice-T,"It's eight a.m. I roll out my silk sheets
Get fly crash the limo back seats
Lookin' in the faces
Of some ladies that I never met
On the interview tip, no sweat
They ask me questions
I throw the words back
They say they write facts
I know that's bull crap
They're kickin' drama
But then drama's my middle name
That's the price ya pay for big fame
The cellular phone rings
Dot wanta pick it up
But it's my J-O-be	 I gotta kick it up
Another damn reporter
On the line with a word quiz
I gotta show cause I'm livin' with the show
Biz. Out the llimo, to the plane
In the pourin' rain
I hate flyin'
But there's no time for slow trains
another show to do
I gotta caatch my crew
They left last night
In the bus around two
The plane's a small one
No fun at all
Bouncin' round the air
Like a tennis ball
When it touches down
I want to kiss the ground
But it's time to wreck a new town
Get to the arena, meet up with the crew
They tell me all  the speakers blew
The cordless don't work
Sound man's a jerk
Somebody's gonna get hurt
I'm crazy mad
But my fans want autographs
I turn my angry frowns
Into fake laughs
I can't be rude
Cause they wouldn't understand
I in't human no more, I'm a superman

CHORUS
You can try
But you'll never understand this
You can try
But you'll never understand this
You can try
But you'll never understand this
The lifestyles of the rich a and infamous

Four hours till show time oh well
I might as well check in the hotel
Get a little rest
Before it's time to play
Ten brothers standin' in the hallway
All with demo tapes
They need the hook up
They heard that I was
The one to look up
I can't ditch 'em
Cause they already saw me
I'll put my head down
Maybe they'll ignore me
No chance ""Ice what's goin' on?""
I listened to twenty-five songs
And after thaat
The brothers still wouldn't leave
They started lookin' at my T.V.
I was gonna break down
If they didn't jet soon
Snuck across the hall
And crashed in E's room
But then this freak came in
Thought I was E
Straddled her legs across me
Ripped off her blouse
Pushed her breast against my face
Started girating her waist. Sounds fly,
Like a hype sex thriller?
But see she looked like Godzilla
Pushed her off me
Home girl hit the floor
This is what it's like on tour
I hit the hallway it was crawlin' thick
""Could we take this picture real quick?""
Jumped into a pose
That I used a million times before
Took pictures
With the whole damn floor
I couldn't say no not to my fans
You see they wouldn't understand

CHORUS

Now it's show time, time to flow time
Evil lost the records
But we still gotta go time
The house is packed
Everybody's on their feet
So I say, ""Throw on Rakim's beat.""
E hits the fader and the crowd is lit
I start bustin' off some new shit
The stage is so smokey
That I almost fall off, I start inhalin' it
I'm tryin' not to cough
I'm catchin' problems from every angle
The mic cords are tangled
I try to flow smooth
But my words are mangled
Damn near slipped and broke my ankle
If that ain't enough
The police are hawkin'
Listenin' real close
To the words I'm talkin'
They want to put a brother like me
In the back seat
Just because I curse the beat
They want to tap my phone
want to keep my crib bugged
Call all my homes
Felonist street thugs
You might say
I think this lifestyle sucks?
I wouldn't tade it for a million bucks
Although it's all
Not glamour and gleam
It's still my dream

CHORUS",Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous,1991
Ice-T,"Brainstorm microphone napalm
This is it, words from a timebomb
Attack speed, fast as an F15
Raise the heat, light thhe gasoline
Overload, it might cause a blackout
Dead end
There's no chnce to back out
Hit the tripwire
Duck from the gunfire
Broken glass, screech'n car tires, bodies hit the deck
As I commence to wreck
Eject another clip and drip sweat
Face of danger, increasin' nger
Point blank
I smoke another stranger
Grip the mic tight
I see the brake lights
Hit the back door
I lay down cross the floor
E's on the wheels
He makes the rubber squel
Blood's on my gear
From caps I've peeled
About a block away I sit up
Look back
It wasn't nothin' but a
Microphone contract!
Dressed in black I stalk my prey
Parabellum in a leather attache
Low tones I speak, I speak to few
Just give me the money
and who the fuck to do
Four blocks away my aim's clean
Night scope on a silence carbine
Place my crosshairs on my vic's eye
Squeeze the trigger
Watch the brains fly
Violent? Yeah you could call me that
Insane? You're on the right track
But turn the sounds up
So I can stay amped
Do another crew and breaak camp
The only way I sleep is in a cold sweat
You think I'm crazy?
You ain't see shit yet
Cause I love to kill and kill for fun
The microphone goes off
Like a handgun
It's goin' down now
Grab your girl hops
No excuses when the bodies
begin to drop
Look in my face fool
It look like I'm play'n
Don't become another
Victim of mic slayin'

What's up?
You want your feet in some concrete?
I got some brothers
That'll do you for gold teeth
But most the time I move, I move alone
Take a bat
Break your motherfuckin' dome
Shoot you dead in the face
With a sawed off
One hundred ten degrees
Ice don't get soft
Cause I'm hard as they come
I come correct
You can't handle the vandal hit eject
If not you better get
Out my face sucka
Or else you better be
A good bullet ducker
Cause I'm a rip shop
Tell that ass drop
Five o Ice, yo fuck a damn cop!
Cause I move hard and cold
With a gangster stroll
Five thousand dollar suits
And fly gold
Rolex, you can't fit no more
Diamonds on it
Pinky ring, worth a house
If I decide to own it
What's up now punk?
Yo start to choke up?
You try to move on the Ice
You'll get broke up!

Midnight, time for a homicide
Showtime, somebody's gonna die
E hits the switch
And thouands of volts connect
With the weapon that's in my fist
I see a sucka in the third row
Try'n to riff
A paragraph and a half he's stiff
I start bustin' off barrages ear high
Mothers grab for their children
Tears fly
I'm like a psycho
In the mircrophone zone
Speakers blown, mind gone
I can't be touched
Once my lyrics begin to fly
Simple stage radiation
Could make ya die
Ya got a prob nigga
you think your rep's bigger?
Hold your heard right there
While I squeeze the trigger
Cause I'm a crazy motherfucker
That's no joke
My favorite smell is
The aroma of gunsmoke
I'm bustin' off another
Lyrical nightmare
Parents hate the Ice!
You think that I care?
Well I don't give a fuck
Cause I rhyme tough
Drop science, still bust the ill stuff
So now it's time for crime
And  the rhyme is mine
Track the movement
Hide from the punchline
I rhyme with quickness

Stay off the shit list",Mic Contract,1991
Ice-T,"Midnight chillin' at A.M P.M.
Coolin' drinkin' apple juice
In Evil's BM
The sound's up loud
To attract attention
rmoraled tires
On a lowered suspension
Nardi to steer with
Alpine deck was glowin'
Bumpinn' Big Daddy
And the nigga was definitely flowin'
I was ridin' shotgun
Donald and Hen in back
Look through the tint recognized a jack
Two brothers strolled up
Talkin' bout get out
Donald D blazed
Shot one fool through his fuckin' mouth
Why would they step
When they know we're strapped?
I never cruise L.A.
Without a Gat in my lap
The other fool shot
Caut the E in the shoulder blade
I busted through the ca door
That's where the nigga laid
Hen jumped out
Dropped two nines in his forehead
Evil was bleedin' bad
The car seats were turnin' red
Looked to my left
There were two more carloads
Niggas in hats and hoods
In an attack mode
And they hadn't yet begun to fight
E hit the gas
It was one past midnight!

We boned down Vernon
Right on Normandie
Left on Florence
Gettin' through the E.T.G.'s
Spun out on Vermont
Made a left on Colden
Right on Hoover
E where we goin'?
He didn'T even answer that
Checked the reaar view
They were still out back
Where were these brothers from?
What made these brothers come
Bang! our back window
Was removed by a shotgun
Now Hen G was shot
Don caught a ricochet
These motherfuckers was ill
They didn't come to play
Bust a right turn, parked
and then we got left
Hid in the the bushes
Shot the gas tank to fake death
But would this really
Keep them psyched?
Three of us bleedin'
It was ten past midnight!

I really didn't like
How this shit was goin' down
Wrong night, wrong time
Wrong fuckin' part of town
Ya see we was deep
In the Hoover's hood
Three niggas bleedin'
That shit don't look good!
See over there red don't go
Some places red's all they know
But not our luck
Tonight we was real fucked
Borke down an alley
And we instantly had to duck
Fuckin' police on a gang sweep
No time to deal with one time
So we had to creep
Broke through a back yard
Ran through a vacant lot
E, Hen and Don kept up
To be some niggas shot
Shit was gettin' craazy
So I had to get busy
Hen was bleedin' worse
And Evil was gettin' dizzy
Looked in a parking lot
I needed a snatch bar
Had to hot wire
So I moved on an old car
It was a bucket, but fuck it, it had to do
Started it up
And scooped my whole crew
Two blocks later
We saw fuckin' blue lights
The pigs were behind us
It was half past midnight!

When they pulled us over
Shit got worse
I waited till they got out
And then I hit reverse
Fucked 'em up, I seen one cop fall
Threw it in gear, yo I'm outty y'all
Don't know how
But somehow we got away
Lost the jackers, the cops
Dumped the G.T.A.
Made it back to the hood
Fixed the crew up
And even though Evil's car blew up
We made it home and then I crashed out
Thinkin' bout my all-night death bout
Then somethin' woke me up
From my dark sleep
The sound of fuckin' police
When they're tryin' to creep
Broke through my door
With no goddamn warning
Looked at my watch
It was six in the mornin'!",Midnight,1991
Ice-T,"It's been a long while
Since I hit ya with freestyle
High tech selections
From  the vaults of the Ice files
Kick back relax
And watch as I melt wax
Don't ever let a borther llike me
Ride a dope track
Cause once I hit it with the vocltone
It's mine, have motherfuckers
Rush'n to rewind
Cause I'll flow slow
And still twist your tongues up
Rock the house from night
Till the sun's up
Cause it relly ain't
How much you say
it's what you sy
I got no fuckin' time on the mic
To play
I write rhymes
With addition and algebra
Mental geometry
Don't even come at me
Talk'n that weak and
Popin' that bullshit
Get out my face
A fool could get his head split
A lot of doubters
Said it couldn't be done by me
them same suckers
Are now lookin' from under me
Wonder'n what i did
I didn't play myself kid
I respected my faans
And made the high bid
Sometimes I write my rhymes
At night and fall asleep
Wake up with new techniques
Grab the pen
And place it on some loose leaf
Nothin' soft, always  the tough meat
The white paper and
Blue lines excite my mind
Not allow'n me to stop the rhyme
Until  the whole motherfuckin'
Book's complete
Then I write on the
Back of the sheets
I maade  promise
To my brothers in street crime
We'd get paid with  the use
Of a sweet rhyme
We put our minds together
Made the tracks clever
Now we're checkin'
More bank than ever

CHORUS
Mind over matter

I can drop rhymes in twos,
And threes and fours
nd still have much shit
Left for encores
Cause once my mind locks
In on a dope idea
Mothercukin' ducks
Should stand clear
Cause I'm a hit the topic point blank
It's jail ya better keep your shank
Cause I got mine
And I'm out on a solo creep
(Uggga!) Your face hits the concrete
You want to roll
With the niggas that don't play
I think you got false courge
Get out my damn way
Cause  the car I'm in
Is rollin' full of men
No kids or boys, E got the Mac 10
Islam's got the Zulu Nation back up
DJ Aladdin's who
Hooked the fuckin' track up
Syndicate's make'n the move
With  the ski masks
And I'm house'n the long cash
So now you realize
You underestimated the Ice
You thought that I was OK
But now you realize I'm nice
But that's alright
Cause I knew I'd mke it in the end
Those who like me now
Might not of liked me then
But I'm a keep impressin'
Stressin' my lesson
And keep motherfuckers guessin'
Armor plate my mind
With walls and shields
As I escape from the killing fields
Mind over matter

Wise up
Move the tempo of this hype groove
You know this shit is dope
So what you try'n to prove
Vu's max as Evil E
My niggaa dogs the wax
My brain's a handgrenade-catch
I'm a hit you with an over load
Of bottomless thought
Reversin' all the shit you're taught
Then throw words at you
Syl-la-ble-at-a-time
Your brain recites the rhyme
No matter what you do
The power's over you
when you sleep
You'll be say'n these rhymes too
Cause the brain has the power
To control all
Think positive
You'll be unable to fall
Brain cells swell
Thought process becomes a trance
Makes you feel possessed to dance
I'll say I want a million
My mind is so deep
I'll be bustin' a check for it next week

CHORUS",Mind over Matter,1991
Ice-T,"Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long,
Grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone.
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots,
Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop.
Move like a king when I roll, hops,
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops.
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out,
Why?  Cash money ain't never gonna play out.
I got nothin to lose, much to gain,
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine.
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right.
[something] my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight.
So many hos on my jock, think I'm a movie star.
Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car.
Go to school, I ain't goin for it,
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet.
Cause I don't want to hear that crap,
Why?  I'd rather be a New Jack-----Hustler

(kid drop in)
Yo man you know what I'm sayin?
You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down.
You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels.
Look at that ring right there,
I know it's real, it's gotta be real.
Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life!
Yo man, I just want to roll with you man,
How can I be down?

What's up?  You say you want to be down?
Ease back, or muthafucka get beat down.
Out my face, fool I'm the illest,
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis.
Got my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags,
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags.
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha).
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke,
When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke.
Ya don't like my lifestyle?  Fuck you!
I'm rollin with the New Jack crew.
And I'm a hustler.

H-you-S-T-L-E-are hustler
New Jack, New Jack..........

Here I come, so you better break North,
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth.
I care nothing bout you, and that's evident.
All I love's my dope and dead presidents.
Sound crazy?  Well it isn't.
The ends justifies the means, that's the system.
I learned that in school then I dropped out,
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout.
I had nothing, and I wanted it.
You had everything, and you flaunted it.
Turned the needy into the greedy,
With cocaine, my success came speedy.
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox.
Every dollar I get, another brother drops.
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand,
God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand.
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned,
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn.
With my posse, out on the ave,
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh.
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam,
Is this a nightmare?  Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block,
You want to journey through hell?  Well shit gets hot.
Pregnant teens, children's screams,
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam.
You don't come here much, and ya better not.
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot.
I gotta get more money than you got,
So what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
That's how the game is played,
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
BUT they're givin us a Band Aid.
My education's low but I got long dough,
Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro.
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician,
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician.
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe,
There'll be another one after me!
A hustler.
Hustler.

New Jack, New Jack......",New Jack Hustler,1991
Ice-T,"Ten years ago
I used to listen to rappers flow
Talkin' bout the way
They rocked the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was goin' down
With my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes
Somethin' like them, my boys said,
""That ain't you Ice,

That shit sounds like them.""
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn'T fantasize, kicked the pure
Facts. Motherfuckers got scared
Cause they weas unprepaired
who would tell it how it relly was?
Who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast
L.A. South Central fool
Where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties
It didn't fit
Six in the Mornin'
That was the real shit

O.G. Original Gangster

When I wrote about parties
Someone always died
When I tried to write happy
Yo I knew I lied, I lived a life of crime
Why play ya blind?
A simple look
and anyone with two cents
would know I'm
A hardcore player fromhe streets
Rappin' bout hardcore topics
Over hardcore drum beats
a little different
Than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane
Drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there
Knows that life ain't sho lovely
On the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint
You'll be comin' out feet first
So I blst the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill
The other times buck wild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker
If I acted like I didn'T care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game
In a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move, and you caps peeled
I ain't no super hero
I ain't no Marvel Comic
But when it comes  to game I'm atomic
At droppin' it straight
Point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, cause I lived it
This ain't no fuckin' joke
This shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T

O.G.

Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me
And said
""Hey yo, Ice
We don't think you're down
What set ya claimin'?""
E drew the Glock, yo my set's aimin'!
Dumb motherfucker
Try to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
and hoodlums and hustlers
And bangers with Jeri curls
we won't even count the girls
Cause they got my back
And I got theirs too
Fight for the streets
When I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga
But they just didn'T figure
What my wit's as quick as a hair trigger
""He's not your everyday-type
Prankster.""

I'm Ice-T, the original gangster

So step to me
If you think that you're ready to
Got on your bullet proof?
Well mine's goin' right through
This ain't no game to me
It's hollow fame to me
Without respect frome streets
So I don't claim  be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slippin, I can even get worked
But I don'T slip that often
there's a coffin
Waitin' for the brother
Who comes off soft when
The real fuckin' shit goes down
Take a look around
all them pussies can be found
they talk a mean fight
But fight like hoes
I'm from South Central, fool
Where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast
You'll get whiplash
Numbers on your roof top
For when the copters pass
Gang bangers
Don't carry no switch blades
Every kid's got a Tec 9 or a
Hand grenade
Thirty-seven killed
Last week in a crack war

Hostges tied up
And shot in a liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
""The children have to go to school.""
Well, moms, good luck
Cause the shit's fucked up bad
I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun
andthe goodtimes
But the pen yanks away and explodes
And destroys the rhyme
Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from
L.A. that was a shot gun!

Ice-T,"Watch me flip and rip
On the freedom tip
Open your mind
See the point of  the ice pick
I stand tall
While my brothers
Still choose to crawl
Black power, it7s in effect y'all
But you don't understand
You're still a slave to the man
Prepare for revolution
Some sucker say we're free
I gotta disagree
Half my posse's in the penitentiary
So I'm a drop and kick the science
With defiance
Because I have no alliance
With suckas who choose
Not to act Black
When they are Black
Get out my face with that
You better ease back
Cause Mandela did 27 hard ones
Not in a windowed room
But in a barred one
While his wife had tears in her eyes
The man is a hero
He needs a Nobel Prize
But that will never happen
So I'm gonna keep rappin'
Freein' my brothers' minds
From their entrapment
To silence the Ice, they'll probably
Put a bullet in me
But I'm prepared to die
And Mandela's free!",Prepared to Die,1991
Ice-T,"Just checkin' my microphone once
As I check your audio
Increase the bass response
Hope n the speakers blow
I got no time to sit and flip
And pop bullshit
Turn up your stereo hops
Insert the rhyme clip
Roll your windows up
Make sure it7s air tight
E.Q. the track exact
So shit sounds right
I rhyme of death
And darkness and danger
Your crib or car
Becomes a torture chamber
I write my rhymes with violence
What you expect?
Sounds of pain
The snap of a broken neck
All alone in darkness I sit each night
Write my rhymes
With blood upon a butcher knife
You say the Ice is ill, and ill I am
They try to ban my shit
And I don't give a damn
Roll up, your eye will get swoll up
Suckers who flexed
Yo, their deaths got tolled up
Cause I'm not the nigga to toy with
Boy with the big mouth
Ya got time to riff?
There's time to take you out
Put a couple caps in your ass
Cut your head off

Send it to your mom with flowers
Cause I'm so soft
Lay on your wack crew
Smoke the whole bunch
Bury 'em in my bck yard
And then I'll eat lunch
Cause I don't give a fuck about you
Or him or her
Whenever I'm in the house
A death just might occur
Is this real or fiction
You'll never know

CHORUS
While you're locked to the
Pulse of the rhyme flow!

Once I lock you up, you can't get loose
You put your head inside
And I placed the noose
The mic drips juice slow
From its steel mesh
My words feel like hooks
Underneath your flesh
Makin' you twist and turn
Scorch and burn, when will you learn?
The '90s are my turn
To pitch a vocal fit, like the ultimate
Gangster rhyme, yo, I invented the shit!
Watch me dod it, as I do it
And I do it right
Grab the gauge
Duct tape on  the flashlight
Doin' the black ski mask
And come to your house
Cut off your power
And do you with the lights out!
Is this real or fiction?
You'll never know

CHORUS

A pool of blood
and floating body parts
Would make me grin
A close view of a razor
When it's breaking skin
If you were burnin'
I'd use gasoline to put you out
Cause I walk alone
And choose the dark route
Nightmares gotta be loved by some
And I'm the one
Ya want to come, bring your shotgun
You ever see your partner die?
No? Well I have!
You ever see your father die?
No? Well I have!
You ever see your mother die?
No? Well I have!
So shut the fuck up, punk
And clear the rhyme path!
What would make meel calm and nice
Is a slow slice
Through your jugular and windpipe
Throw me in jail
I won't even try to make bail
Put me in the gas chamber
And watch me inhale!
Is this true or false?
Well you'll never know

CHORUS

Jason, Tales from the Crypt
And the Dark Side
Another fly murder, another suicide
Did these flicks
Have an influence on my brain?
I really doubt that shit
I think that I was born insane
When I was young
I had a lust for knives and guns
Use a magnifying glass
To fry an ant with the sun
And on and on
My lust for death got bigger
At fifteen
I was placed behind a trigger
Although I'm dirty
Not the one to be swept up
step up, I'd love to open your chest up
I've got no concept of life or death
All I want is your last breath
Give me a motherfuckin' break
I should behave
Give me a motherfuckin' shovel
I'll dig graves!
I break ill in extra large portions
where's your parents
I'll make you an orphan
So when you're talkin' crazy
You better think of me
The I, to the see, to the E, to the fuckin' T!
There'll be no tears
No screams or cries, just a laser beam
Between your fuckin' eyes
You feel strange well now you know

CHORUS",Pulse of the Rhyme,1991
Ice-T,"Yo check this out
A lot of people get mad cause I use the word nigga
You know what I'm saying they don't like the fact that I use the word nigga
They say you a black man I tell em I'm a nigga they don't understand that
So I'm a say what I want to say I call myself what I want to call myself
You know what I'm saying
So they can stay off my dick

Damn right I'm a nigga
and I don't care what you are
Cause I'm a Capital N-I double-G-E-are
Black people might get mad
Cause they don't see
That they're looked upon
As a nigga just like me
I'm a nigga, not a Coloured man
Or a Black, or a Negro
Or Afro American, I'm all that
Yes I was born in America true
Does South Central
Look like America to you?
I'm a nigga, a straight up nigga
From a hard school
Whatever you are
I don't care, that is you fool
I'm loud and proud
Well endowed with the big beef
Out on the corner
I hang out like a horse thief
So you can call me dumb or crazy
Ignorant, stupid, inferior or lazy
Silly or foolish
But I'm badder and bigger
And most of all
I'm a straight up nigga

That's right I'm a nigga

my man lord finesse is my motherfucking nigga
you know evil e's my nigga islam's my nigga
that's right they're my niggas

I'm a nigga in America
and that much I flaunt
Cause when I see what I like
Yo I take what I want
I'm not the only one
That's why I'm not bitter
Cause everybody is a nigga to a nigga!
America was stole from he Indians
show and prove, what was that?
A straight up nigga move
A low down shame
Yo it's straight insane
Yet they complain
When a nigga snatch
Their gold chains
What is nigga suppose to do?
Wait around for a handout
From a nigga like you?
That's why a low down nigga gets hyped
But I'm not a nigga of that type
I'm a steak and lobster eatin
Billionaire meetin
Cash money makin, movin shakin
Corporate jet glidin
Limousine ridin
Writin' hits, filthy rich
Straight up nigga!

That's right I'm a nigga

Now I'm a write this song
Though the radio won't play it
But I got freedom of speech
So I'm a say it
She want to be lez he want to be gay
But that's your business I'm straight
So nigga have it your way
Those who hate me I got sumthin for ya
A nigga with cash a nigga with a lawyer
Bot a watermelon eating @#%$ down south
But a nigga that 'll smack the taste from your mouth
A contemplating thinking best champagne drinkin
Ten inch givin extra large livin
Mercedes benz drivin strivin to survivin
All the way livin and kickin hi fivin

Ease back fool cause I'm a trigger nigga
I work real hard for my livin
But I don't sell or brake bullshit thanksgivin
Like some fool and eat turkey
That's the day your forefathers jerked me
Shipped us all over here in locks and chains
Split us up twistin up a nigga's brain
Now you keep me in constant sweat
But I'm a nigga that you'll never forget
A black bad iron clad always mad

Big dick straight up nigga",Straight Up Nigga,1991
Ice-T,"I'm rollin' up in a big gray bus
And I'm shackled down
Myself that's who I trust
The minute I arrived
Some sucker got hit
Shanked ten times
Behind some bullshit
Word in the pen the fool was a snitch
So without hesitatin'
I made a weapon quick
If found a sharp piece of metal
Taped it to a stick
Then a bullhorn sounds
That means it's time for chow
My first prison meal
The whole feeling was foul
It wasn't quite my style
But my stomach growled
So I flushed the shit down
And hit the weight pile
The brothers was swole
The attitudes was cold
Felt the tension on the yard
From the young and the old
But I'm a warrior
I got my ground to hold
So I studied the inmates
To see who hd the power
the Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower!

In a blink of an eye, a riot broke out
Blacks put their backs to the wall
Cause it was north and south
A gun man shouts
And everybody had doubt
Until the bullets started fly'n
Took two men out
Thn they rushed everybody
Back to their cells
Damn the pen is different than
The county jail
I'm in a one man cell
I know my life's on a scale
I wonder if that gunman is goin' to hell
This is my second day
I got a ten year stay
I learned my first lesson
In the pen you don't plaay
I saw a brother kill another
Cause he said he was gay
But that's the way it is
It been that way for years
and when his body hit the ground
I heard a couple of cheers
It kind of hurt me inside
That they were glad he died
and I ask myself
Just who had the power?
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just  the gun tower!

You see the Whites got a thing
The call White pride
The Blacks got the muscle
Mexicans got the knives
You better be wise
You want to stay alive
Go toe to toe with a sucka
No matter wht size
A fool tried to sweat me
Act'n like he was hard
I stuck him twice in  the neck
And left him dead in the yard
It was smooth how I did it
Cause nobody could see
With my jacket on my arm
And my knife on the side of me
Bam bam, it was over
Another one bites the dust
I went crazy in the pen
With nobody to trust
Bench'n ten quarters, so I'm hard to sweat
Used a tat gun, and engrved my set
They call me a lifer
Cause I'm good as dead
I live in the hole, so the floor's my bed
And I ask myself again
Who has the power
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower",The Tower,1991
Ice-T,"Once again I'm back in the place to be
The I, the see, the E, the T
I'll never get a Grammy, so fuck the G
All I need is  crowd, and my M-I-see
Got a gangster ass DJ named Evil E
My record label's called Warner be	
William Morris is my agency
I'll never go broke, I got property
Got a dope pitbull named Felony
Got four gold albums
So what you tell'n me?
Power was two, Iceberg was three
This one here shipped five hundred G
Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep
Benz's, Bemers, and boomin' Jeeps
I'm always strapped
Cause my money I keep
You move on  the Ice
And you're goin' to sleep
But when you see me
Walkin' down the street
You say, ""What's up Ice?""
And I say, ""Peace!""
You give me a dap, I give you one back
Cause I ain't souped
So forget about that
We might take pictures
Sign n utograph
Kick a little flavor
Have some fun and laugh
But step to me wrong
You might get shot
And wind up lookin' out a ziplock!!!",Ziplock,1991
Ice-T,"6 in the morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make a escape
Don't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music, but happy cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told 'em bout my morning cold bugged' em out
Shot a little dice til my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to her, ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a louie interior
Solid gold the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin' off like a high school bell
Looked in the mirror, what did we see?
Fucking blue lights: L.A.P.D
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade
Threw us in the county high power block, no freaks to see no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the shit must fly, squabbled this sucker shanked em in the eye
But just living in the county is a serious task
Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track
Told me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough
Be bop's a pimp, my old freaks a ho
The batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said, man you out early, we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

I bought a Benz with the money the rest went to clothes
Went to the strip started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
I didn't want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew, some punks got loud
Shot gun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit, two punks died
All causalities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask

[Hook]

Swat team leader yelled, hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my .44
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the back door like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn, goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask

[Hook]

The rollers gave chase at a serious speed, one more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di
'Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew, we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun
And all I was thinking was, murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew, we're gone into the night
Broke to my old lady's who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie, a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus as I watched TV
A technician with a mission that's what she was
If there had been a crowd she would of got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
The she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop as I was screaming for more
After she waxed by body she let me crash
She knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

Up the next morning, feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my A.M.G
Ho's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red Some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said he's jumping bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

Fell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C
Called up my posse when I got there, hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devil's nest the rest we passed, back doored the Palladium just for class
About 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce, we never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shoot-out jumped off mine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask

Watch this, the n**** that you didn't think could do
Break through with the rhythm that'll rock your whole crew

What's up? What's up? What's up? You want to try your luck
You move you weave you bob you got stuck

You never seen so much blood pour through one vein
You try to scream, you choke
You try to run, your legs are broke
You're bulletproof I hope..
Yo, I ain't no n**** to flex, but I will flip
F*** up a n**** and dropkick his f***in b****
I love to squabble and I'm good widdit

You punks are jealous cause I'm rollin in fly s***

F*** you, it ain't my fault your a** is on empty
Thought you was it, but you're smooth gettin pimped G..

Got much respect for the new and the old school
But many rappers can rip mics but can't count..

Word and many critics are hot cause hard rap hits
They like to make it all soft that we pop s***
F*** that, I'll die before I let the hardcore go
Cause I'm a n**** from the G-H-E-T-T-O
I got a posse who's airtight, quick to fight
And got the power to continue or end the night
And if you stepped on wrong, then you're a done kid
The yellow tape's in the club because one did
I got no pity so don't ask me for f***in any
I'll break a bum off but you n****z can't get a penny
When I was broke, I stole my gold, I pawned
I lived the life of a hustler off and on
I'm just a brother that lived to tell

F*** that, not the one that's gonna fall on no hoe trap
Ease back b****, before you need all your teeth back..
.. I ain't no f***in mark
Made all my money workin bowcutters in the dark
Snatch bars and cars and vice grips
Long handled sledgehammers, saws and wire snips
I got an ill side that drips from my brain at times
It still thinks of the psycho and brutal crimes
I still remember when I had a low cash flow
No hoes, no cars, no gear no dough
And times got wicked..
.. I even remember havin to sell all my pawn tickets
But suckers spread out and they left me with few friends
But that's who wit me as we f*** up the true ends
So don't be trippin if your luck's gone bad, be glad
It'll empty out the fake f***in friends you had
Then get yourself together, n**** aim straight
Shoot point blank at your goals, work hard and wait
You can do it even if you fell
I brought my a** back from the depths of hell

Why I didn't do no old sex nasty shit
But this year I went down to Miami and got my nigga from 2 Live
Brother Marquis in the house! (Yeah I'm the motherfuckin nigga)
Yeah, we gonna answer the question about girl problems
All these niggas is havin girl problem, Marq
(Huh, tell them man, tell them how it is)
Lemme tell you what time is it

I got a ho from the East, got a ho from the West
Got a ho that likes to jack it off and rub it in her chest
I got a ho from the North, a ho from the South
A ho that likes to suck it long and hold it in her mouth
I got a bitch with hair, a bitch with none
A bitch with a knife, a bitch with a gun
A bitch with a ass big as a TV set
And there's a bitch over there; hey, the one I'm gonna get
But yo but maybe not, she might not like me though
No sweat to a vet; I'll slam her sister, though
Ice in the whole damn herd
I fuck 'em all and leave 'em on the curve
I got a bitch with a mink, who rocks a fat gold link
Who likes to fuck me with her ass up on the kitchen sink
Got a bitch with tits, a bitch with ass
A bitch with none, but hey I give her a pass
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit it..
Nah a bitch ain't one

I got a bitch that's old, a bitch that's new
A bitch who love velvet in the colors blue
I got a bitch who's fat, a bitch who's built
A bitch who all her titties give out powdered milk
I got a bitch who's funny, a bitch who ain't
A bitch who can sing, a bitch who cain't
A bitch who loves fuckin on a airplane..
I even got a bitch off Soul Train
I got a bitch who rolls a rag-top Benz
Long ends
I got a bitch who's broke as a bum
But she's the most fun
I got a bitch who play piano, a bitch who don't
A bitch who dances naked, a bitch who won't
A bitch who's short, a bitch who's tall
A bitch who burns my pager with priority calls
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me

Yo Marquis - you from Miami man why don't you show
These motherfuckers all the over the world; the 2 Live style
Of how the bitches treat a motherfuckin fly nigga like you

I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one of them
I don't trip on hoes, cause I don't need none of them
Pussy's the temptation, dick's the persuasion
All hoes suck cock nigga how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em, I just freak on 'em
Stick dick in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The nigga the one-nighter, the bitch exciter
I only love my hoes when I'm goin up inside her
Problem number one is gettin money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nuttin cause I ain't offerin
I go hard on my bitches, cause I'm never never softenin
Puttin the demand on 'em, fuck 'em and scram on 'em
The ""wham, bam, thank you ma'am"" game is ran on 'em
So fuck how you feel, you fuckin cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Gettin pussy's just another expense
If pussy pays the bills then dick pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to cum
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one!

Ha! Yo Marquis my motherfucker you got problems man?
(A bitch ain't one) Aww shit!
Now let me tell you how to do this shit

I got a bitch that loves to G
She'll fuck you right after she fucks me
I got a bitch who loves both
I got a bitch who loves handcuffs and ropes
I got a bitch that's fast, a bitch that's slow
A bitch that's a virgin and a bitch that's a ho
A bitch that lies
A bitch that's true
A bitch who's a man BECAUSE THEY'RE ""Bitches 2""
I got a bitch that's cool
A bitch that's hot
A bitch who loves rap, a bitch who loves rock
A bitch who's lost and one who knows where it's at
She gets up under me and purrs like a cat
I got a bitch that runs, I got a bitch that walks
I got a bitch that yells, I got a bitch who talks
I got a bitch that's dirty, got a bitch that's neat
I got a super fine bitch that I knocked in the swap meet

And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems, I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me
No a bitch ain't one
(Huh, you know a bitch ain't one!)

Youknahmsayin? I got problems with my motherfuckin rent Marquis
But a bitch ain't one

Man you got yourself nothin man
Fuck them raggedy stank-ass hoes nigga

A bitch ain't one
I got a problems stayin out here on these streets
With the police trying to take a nigga out, y'know?
But a bitch ain't one
Got problems with motherfuckers.. buyin my records
But a bitch ain't one

Fuck 'em all, nigga fuck them motherfuckers

Youknahmsayin? A bitch ain't one
Got problems man

All them motherfuckers can kiss my motherfuckin ass f'real

Really, niggas worryin about bitches
They better, they better find somethin else to worry about",99 Problems,1993
Ice-T,"""Yo what's up man? Yeah I gotta trunk fulla this shit
Word, broads still with me man, comin over to grapevine right now
Yo I can't talk right now man, I gotta get off this phone""

Damn, how'd I get into this scam
Roll in a car with the trunk worth 5000 grand
I came up from the curb, word
First thing it rocks, now my ride's packin crazy birds
I gotta freak in the front seat
She got crazy game, might even have more than me
And that's why I don't trust, I ain't no busta
One wrong move and I'll dust her
But she knows that, keeps a gat
Works much plastic, always stays on phat
She said she loves me
Looks deep in my eyes, sometimes cries, all lies
She only loves my cash flow, long dough
The falso love of a pimp and a hoe
But me and her gotta job to do
Get this luggage back to the crew
She got scanner, I hadta listen to the pigs talk
And if they speakin about us then its jumpin off
But I ain't sweatin them at all
2 cops'll roll up and 2 cops'll fall
The lines on the highway, I'm makin my mind drift away
To my last jail stay
5 years for a 459
I'm never goin back, no matter what the crime
Surrenderin ain't me
Fuck that, I'm holdin court in the street G
For a nigga like me there ain't no ounce
My life filled with drug busts and shoot outs
Pure ghetto anger, pure ghetto anger
Pure ghetto anger, I'm addicted to danger
Some nights I crash clubs
Rollin with the posse made of well-known thugs
Cool out with the freaks
Truckin much jewels, beggin for beef
Thens some niggaz roll up
Lookin for a way to pump the reps up
But I ain't the one
I'm handin out beat downs, no need for guns
Sometimes I gotta ask myself
Is all this buck whylin good for a niggaz health?
I don't know why
Am I suicidal, do I want to die?
The answerin, simple
A headache throbs in my temple
It says it ain't fair, it says it ain't right
It says its goin down tonight
We finally made it to the drop spot
King and Weston Ave, snoody fox
The posse was there, but it ain't right
Fuckin police lights
Its all goin down that road blocks
I never seen that many cops
It was a setup, my whole damn crew's gettin wet up
Big time, some motherfucker dropped a dime
But even in the flurry of gun shots
My adrenaline was boilin hot
I crash down on the floor of the ride
Punch the gas, drove that benz through they punk ass
Hit Vernor doin 90
Looked in the rear-view, no one behind me
I got on the phone
Called up the homies to see what went wrong
But no time to sweat that
I still gotta trunk fulla shit, I was on phat
I just need a cool place to hide
Dumped the benzo, slammed the G ride
Me and a freak hit a motel crash spot
The streets was hot
Rubbed me down, said she adored me
Said the gunfire made her horny
The she pushed me back on the bed
Licked me head to toe, toe to head
Then I closed my eyes real slowly
Is this love? No not me
Then I felt a pain in my chest
The smell of gun powder and burnt flesh
I looked in her face, opened my mouth
And then her badge came out",Addicted to Danger,1993

Ice-T,"Intro:

Yeah!  Right about now motherfuckers is layin for a nigga like me Ice-T
to bust some freestyle shit... but I don't do that
I just cold lounge up here at the Ammo Dump
with my nigga Alladdin, SLJ, LP and my nigga Henry G
Yeah, we do the shit like this

Verse One:

The card after the ace is deuce
So cut the nigga loose on the 3
That's me
The motherfuckin T
I got ride on my surfboard
Rhyme hard
But only buy the shit that I can't afford
That's everything
That's why I truck big fat rings
Cause in the motherland gold is for kings
I got backup
To jack up
Punks who try to act up
Do a world tour
Watch the big bank stack up
Motherfuckers get dropped with the quickness
I got an ill left and a right fist
Make mistakes and you'll lose
Or you might die
Cause I'm the wrong Ice for your bruise
And that's no lie
Meanwhile the penile is stacked to the top with my niggaz
Mostly for squeezin triggas
I call em homies
Pigs call em crooks
So I write and put bucks on they books
I give a fuck about a cop or a G-man
They all talk shit
Their breath smellin like semen
I catch em in the alley all alone
Put em in the prone
Pop! Pop! Pop! To the dome

Chorus:

It's the G-style
Gangsta style

Verse 2:

G Style, The gangsta talk
I got a teflon .9
And it eats vest
I take a motherfucker out quick
Just for talkin shit
Ride Rolls
Catch hoes like a mitt
LA, Atlanta, New York
Yo, my shit rocks
Chi-town, Miami, Detroit
I get much props
Because I roll with the hardcore G
Every street's the same street to me
I don't bullshit
I don't quit
Writin a rhyme fit
KKK pray each day
That I get hit
Motherfuckers try to flip on the Icepick
Move and slip
Close the eyes and catch a fuckin clip
Not in the ghetto no more
But I do hang
Got a black game
And it's sittin on them thangs
I kick the game from the street
Not the slamma
Tighten up my knockas with a big lead hammer

Chorus

Verse Three:

Some of the times
I write my raps with extreme speed
Some of the times
I take the pen and make pads bleed
My mind clicks to Homocide
Bullets fly
Ladies cry
A lot of people die
Some nights I can't right
Stare at the blue lines
I think I'm a go blind
Then the beat becomes me
Sit in the dark
And write a whole fuckin LP
G Style, the gangsta talk
Never near soft
Hard as a knockout bout
It's no sellout
I keep crime in my rhyme
Cause it's my thing
Packed with guns
And drugs
And lots of street slang
A-be	-see-D-E-F, and LAPD
Words from a motherfuckin OG
Ammo Dump pumps the sounds that you bump in your trunk
So turn it up punk
What'cha fraid of?
What'cha made of?
Pull the pin
Set the grenade off
Blastin sounds out ya jeep
On every city street, nigga
Straight gangsta beat

Chorus

Verse Four:

Many like to dress the style, and act hardcore
Many motherfuckers are and they crack jaws
I like to lay in the cut
In a nightclub
Don't smoke bud
Drink suds
But I gets loved, mack, cool
I scope the freak with the mad backs
Hit her with the gangsta style
Cool, relaxed, bam
Put her in the Benz
Bump Too $hort, let her know
Right off the top, what's my sport
You think long
You think wrong
You got it goin on, baby doll?
But I won't sing you no love song
You either love me
Or you don't
You're either rollin tonight
Or you won't
She likes the style
Cause it don't bullshit around
tongue in my ear, real slow
And then it went down
I gotta flip into a ill mode
Pack a clip full of hype tracks
And then unload
Music for the hardcore beatdown
No weak pop shit
Strictly underground
And if you don't like the style, as I get wreck
Ease back nigga, catch a knife through the neck

Chorus",G Style,1993
Ice-T,"[ VERSE 1 ]
Woke up the other mornin, I heard a rumor
They said the gang wars was over
I told em they was bullshittin, they said it's real as hell
Can't explain the way I felt
Too many years I seen my brothers die
And I can't say that shit was really that fly
But I used to gangbang when I was younger
So it's really hard to tell a kid that he's goin under
I never thought I lived to see us chill
Crips and Bloods holdin hands, the shit is ill
But I love it, I can't help it
Too much death on the streets, and we dealt it
Van Ness Boys, The Hoovers, The 60s
Bounty Hunters, 8-Treys, all coolin out, gee
I pray the shit'll never stop
You used to see the wrong colors, and the gats went pop-pop
But now the kids got a chance to live
And the O.G.'s got something to give
That's love, black on black, that's how they made it
And if any busters flip, they get faded
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 2 ]
I got a lotta love, cause you're all my brothers
Red or blue, black's the color
We got a chance, so we can really sweat the real fools
Show those muthafuckas the real tools
Check the enemy, it ain't the family
Not 1-11, try L.A.P.D.
They gotta understand, they beat on a blackman
There's gonna be drama, know what I'm sayin?
And if we flip, let's all flip together
Cause I'm prepared, kid, for rough weather
And we gotta realize, the boys on the east side
You call em S-A's, I call em allies
Because the day that we all unite
Watch the pigs get real polite
Punk muthafuckas gotta learn quick
That we ain't takin no more shit
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 3 ]
Crenshaw Boulevard, Sunday afternoon
Folks sittin on things, mad systems boom
The girls are lookin better
The gang truce is on, so you wear whatever
At Venice by the ocean
Rag-top Trey hits the three-wheel motion
There's gangsters all around
Still crazy sets, but you just don't clown
I pray L.A. can stay this way
It's the first summer I can really say
I felt cool, we all chilled
Went to the park, and nobody got killed
Now if you got a problem, it's man on man
You don't need a gang to solve em
I seen the greatest thing I seen in my life
Two brothers in a straight up fist fight
Nobody pulled a gat, nobody jumped in
Nobody pulled a knife, nobody got done in
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to my city, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 4 ]
G-a-t-e-s, I hope you wear a vest
Even after you're out the fuckin office
Cause we're on a totally different tip
Fuck that pig brutality shit
This unity is gettin to me
Every brother on the street is my homie
I'm rollin through a hood that I never been
And every brother steps to me as a friend
I love it, I love it
And nothin in my life will ever be above it
We want to see our kids all grown up
We're tired of seein our hoods get blown up
L.A. is a great place
Fly girls, dope cars, life at a fast pace
But gangbanging was killin it quick
Another child got hit - bullshit
Pop-pop-pop, 10 on a weekend
We was goin off to deep end
But now we got a chance, my friend
To mend, and make the colors blend
Let's all go out on a picnic, kick shit
And squash all the static
Last year I lost about five homies
This shit is real to me
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

run a totally independent organization and operation.

Quick to flip if our group don't hit
They don't make you nothin but a pop ho bitch
And I don't need ya
I love to bleed ya
All I ever wanted was a real nigga's praise
But the sad motherfuckin' fact
Is that ain't that many real motherfuckers these days
Game knows game I know too many who plays the name
And I can make it in the music or the street game
I still got hoes that'll work, still got crews that'll hit
Still roll with an extra clip
And those who think they'll stop me, doubt it
Those motherfuckers better think about it
You'd best to let me rap
Ice back on the streets?
You don't want that
Cause I break ill
And you really after body count the caps I peel, it's on

[chorus: Ice-T]
It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed
Bang! Bang! Bang! Cause it ain't no thing
To put in work and watch your body jerk
It's on

[Ice-T]
It's on motherfucker you goddamn right
It's on, my royalty cheque, yeah, fool, I write my own
I own my own label put my own shit out
So no one tells me what the fuck to talk about
And all the suckas that said I was through
You need to wake up to my view
I'm fallen off
Ha! Ha!  That's a joke!
You motherfuckers are still unknown and broke
And I'm stankin' rich
My fuckin maid lives better than you, bitch
So shut your trap
When it comes to this level of game, you don't know jacks
CIA, FBI, IRS
Try to flip us out for sweat
But they'll never sweat you son
Cause you're broke and you're dumb and you're no threat to no one
Them fools don't play
I gotta deal with those motherfuckers every day
They'd love to get me behind bars
They hawk a nigga like I'm Carlos Escobar
But in a way I am
Been puttin dope on the street for years and don't give a damn
So I'm thinkin about them, friend
The real motherfuckin gangstas want to see me end
It's gonna end up in a bloodbath, no doubt
That's the only way I'm going out, it's on

[Chorus: Ice-T]
It's on
It's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off
Catch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed
Bang! Bang! Bang! Cause it ain't no thing
To put in work and watch your head burst
It's on",It's On,1993
Ice-T,"Yo shut up, this is Ice muthafuckin' T
And I've been listenin' to a lotta DJ's
Get on the mike and tryin' to get busy
You know what I'm sayin'?

But can't no DJ get rap like my muthafuckin' nigga Evil E
So right about now I'ma give him the muthafuckin' microphone
I'ma get behind the wheels and we gon' do this
Yo, Evil tell where the fuck it's comin' from

It's comin' from the mouth of the pimp behind the wheels
I make a bitch kneel, Evil E the gray steel
Shows, ho's, junior pimp sweat out, punk
So I can give your bitch the Evil E jump

I love you honey, sure, listen up, listen clear
After the show, yo ho' hit the rear
Backstage pass, lick stick tied on the right tit
My hopes of gettin' licked, grab that ass and then hit

Hit, hard movin' wall security will be knockin'
While Evil E's rockin', charlie jam and try blockin'
I'm a fuckin' mack that comes up by playin' the back
Ask my nigga, I'll be shony shony shony mack

Cynical weapon Evil E and I'm kept in the back

Where I supply the sounds on stage
Cops in the race that's why we're always on the front page
Rippin' shit up, me and my yellow nigga
The mike is the gat and the wheels is the trigger

Grab a haze, knowin' every city that I rip
Got crazy dollars 'cause I always keep a grip
Get down with the cynic and rippin shit up at will

And who are you? And I'm the pimp behind the wheels

Yo, what's goin on Ice?
[ Ice-T ]
Yo what's up Shawnie Shawn?
Man, just trippin off this girl, man
[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Girls?
You?
The Iceberg?
Aw man, come on, spill it, man

She was a swinger
Talkin 'bout high post
She was the most
Knew she was fine, dope, fly
She didn't have to try
She brought a eye on my eye in a crowded club
I tried to stare the girl down, but she didn't budge
She moved through the crowd in a straight line
The closer she got, mad thoughts ran through my mind
Yo, what would I say, yo, how would I chill?
My mind drew a blank, the whole scene was ill
She stepped in the light, she was dynamite
Her eyes said, ""I wanna be with you all night
I wanna rub you down, I wanna kiss, caress your soul
Make your body warm and cold
Do everything sexually you ever heard""
And she hadn't said a single word..
I said, ""Damn, what the hell am I gonna do?""
But my eyes said the same things too
I tried to speak, she put a finger across my lips
Followed it with a kiss
She said, ""I want you bad,"" and she moved in next to me
This woman spelled out ecstacy
Said, ""I've seen on the movies and TV
I love your records, but I ain't no groupie
Just wanna love ya, cause you're a real man
And you deserve this lovin like only I can""
I wanted her bad, and I am a man
That night the shit hit the fan

[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Damn, man
Keep on with it, man
Come on now kick it, man
You gotta kick it right, though
Let me know what's up

She had a 500 S-E-L airtight
Cellular phone, brand-new, it was white on white
As we walked to the car, I couldn't help but recognize
Her small waist and sexy thighs
She had a beach house she owned and a restaurant
Took me in her crib and put Sade on
As the waves hit the rocks in the moonlight
She came up behind me and squeezed me real tight
My mind started to trip, flip, roll, and roam
What about my girl who's at sleep at home?
But before I could lock in on that thought
She broke out with a new men's watch that she had bought
She put it round my wrist, it was a perfect fit
And said in my ear, ""Want you to have it""
Then she unzipped her dress, dropped it to the ground
My mind was totally blown by now
She gazed at me nude in the moonlight
Pumps still on, her body was firm and tight
I looked at her breasts as they glistened and rised
Right before my eyes
And all I could say to myself was, ""Damn..""
The night the shit hit the fan

[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Man, man, man
I understand...
(The night the shit hit the fan)
Come on now
I feel it
Come on
(The night the shit hit the fan)
Damn, man
It's all that
Shit
Come on, Ice
Kick that shit

Now I'm a player, I been all around the world
Made love to many girls
But tonight this was the big league
And I was worryin about fatigue
I wanna do this girl, so she won't forget me
And I knew that she'd let me
She moved close and took my shirt off
She said my skin was soft
Then slipped her hand
Between my stomach and my waist band
Man, I couldn't take it no more
Fuck the bedroom, we use the kitchen floor
We hit skins all weekend
We didn't even eat, we just hit em again
I love to think about how it went down
But she's no longer around
Left town with some fly guy
She's on some island drinkin D'Acqueray's and Mai Thai's
But she gave me the keys to the beach house
She knows what I'm about, at least now she figured out
I ain't nothin but a straight up man
And I might need those keys the next time the shit hits the fan

Yeah

Uh!

Yeah

Uh..

Yeah

Uh

I want her

[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Damn
All that, all that
And after all that
You know?
You always know, man
In the long run
You meet another one like the other one 

",Shit Hit the Fan,1993
Ice-T,"I was born in new jersey, I said it before
But I guess nobody heard me
My mother died young
No sistas or brothas, I was the only son
When I was twelve my pops died too
What a brotha was supposed to do?
They sent me out West
To live with my aunt
I guess they though it was the best
But there was no love there
Growin' with no moms 
I guess I was prepared to live in a vacuum
The bedroom the kitchen, the hall and the bathroom
I didn't leave home much, didn't like L.A.
Didn't have no friends to trust
Got busted to a school
Blacks and whites, I guess the shit was cool
But in highschool I changed
Didn't want to bust, didn't want to play the game
I walked to Crenshaw high, shit was fly
I hooked up with new cru
Some brothas that knew what the fuck to do
You might call it gang but we called it a set
And it was our own thang
The whole school was down
And one way or another everybody fucked around
When the hardcore or not
you wore the right color or your ass got shot
That's how i'm livin'...
I did three years in and made close friends
Havin' no love my homies came my only
I was glad: a family I never had
But I grew up fast got a girl on 10th grade pregnant
Needin' cash, I had to change my style
Switched from bangin' to hustlin'
No more goin' buckwild
Had to get a cashflow
But my hustle was weak, it was a no go
I join the army, four years in that shit
Be all fucked you can be
Came back to the hood
My homies had done good
Had elevated their game
About 100 gees a lick, no mothafuckin' shame
Passed for the jewels
Baby sledgehammers with the tools
I speak on this with a hesitation
Even though it passed the statue of limitation...
I checked the bank
Bought a porsche and gear, earn high streetrank
But as I grew my whole crew fell through
Cops had us on the books as innerstate crooks
Murder robbery rape escape, the whole damn nine
You robbed a nigga blind
I had too much juice, I cut my boosters loose
I was intread with the pimpgame
Took on the ice-name
But the pimpgame moved too slow
Especially for a nigga who was hooked on quick dough
In one night late I was in a carwreck
And I was lucky to escape
Hospital for teen weeks, in bed almost dead
And when I got well, I got gaught in a cross
And got locked in a jailcell
That's how I'm livin'...
They cutted me loose
And I had to change troops
This time they didn't catch me
Next time they'll strecth me
Cause my time was gettin' short
All my homies was in court
Or locked in a hole, this shit was gettin' old
So I changed my life
Putted down the gun and picked up the mic
It took ten years to get from there to here
But I still keep a gun, cops got me on the run
And they hate me more now
Than they ever did before
My homies came back from pen
And we all worked together 
True friends but every once and while
Some punk mistakes me as a junk
And he gets in my face
Wrong mothafuckin' place
And I ain't lyin', that's how you dyin'...",That's How I'm Livin',1993
Ice-T,"It's goin down
From the Ammo Dump
I got my nigga SLJ and DJ Aladdin
Droppin the fat tracks
Hit em with it
Syndicate's in the muthafuckin house
All duck MC's get flat, muthfuckas
Yeah

1993
And it's still me
A rappin brother from L.A., the cool T
Diss a brother, hate a brother, I still come back
With the fat tracks, fuck the pop crap
I got a mind to cold diss a fool
Wack rappers sellin out urge me to pull tools
For no reason
Pop suckers hookin for hits like hoes skeezin
Prostitutes that can't shoot, yet you clock loot
Dancesteps with the weak styles, but you look cute
Bitch, that shit's wack
Let Hammer dance, and you other fools ease back
The microphone in some twist in a clenched fist
Mind locked on ???? load of my hit list
And make duck rappers pray
Many talk shit, but none step this way
Cause I'm quick to beat down a weak clown
Clock crazy juice from L.A. to the Boogie Down
I play the whole map
Got hoes locked like a muthafuckin bear trap
Ice muthafuckin T
Before hoes gee they need two forms of I.D.
Never fess, not the best, but I'm hard to shake
Huh, watch the Ice break

Watch the Ice break

Yo, let's see now who's tryin to diss me
Say I sold out cause I rocked with the B.C.
y'all are bitches, you're straight wack
Quick to talk shit, but always behind the back
I do whatever I want to do, punk hoe
I rock a perm, you rock an afro
I wear khakis, while y'all wear silk
y'all drink forties, and I drink milk
Cause that's my muthafuckin biz
I never sell out, cause it's no sale, kid
Hardcore to my heart from the fuckin start
Whether done over beats or loud guitars
I drop the dope hits
Case you forgot, I invented this gangsta shit
You want to step to me? New jack, walk
Come back in five LP's, then we can talk
You're just new, kid, you got a hit out
In interviews you talk a lotta shit out
You got paid, you really made out
You went broke when your one jam played out
Now you're searchin for that one more hit
Shhhiiit
I ain't new to this, I got gangs of gold
I come original, then I break the mold
Too many MC's hit, then fold
They're just fakes
Hah, watch the Ice break

Watch the Ice break

Yeah
Syndicate jumpin off 1993
On some old fly smooth shit
All the muthfuckas out there down with us
You know what I'm sayin?
We're rollin strong
All the busters out there that got some static to say
We're settin this shit off physically this year
Like KRS-One says:
Sucker MC's duck down
Muthafuckas ain't takin no shit
I'm swingin on busters, point-blank
Diss me and it's on
Straight up

Now it's the break of dawn
And the mic is still on
All hoes are fuckin and the rhymes are damn strong
Many MC's that choke from the mic smoke
Those who tried to get with me
Lost in rhyme infinity
Or they lost breath
Try to step to the Ice equals sure death
Cause ??it's then I begin?? than you ever assume
Drop the mic, go rap in your living room
I love the quick kill
Swing on a nigga sometimes just to break ill
Knuckle up, buster, fool, in his fuckin eye
All hands, I need no gun, yo punk, why?
Cause if I pull my gun, you die
No second try
I gotta cool out now, so I don't over-freeze
Nut up and start murderin MC's
Start catchin bodies from state to state
Throw on a ski mask and walk the streets late
And do me up a whole damn crew
The Geto Boys was trippin, but my mind's trickin me too
Cause diss me, and I meet you one day
And bet your life it won't be a fun day
I hope, nigga, it's not your fate
That you're around when the Ice breaks

And make a man understand where she's comin' from.

She just breaks and bring drama to the situation,
Ejaculation of my projectile, she's buck wild.
Better recognize when she comes she comes correct.
Collects respect and if not, you catch a broken neck.

Buddy look down and your shirts all bloody,
Looks like she caught you with a bad one for messin with da mad one.
Told you bout this girl before, you didn't listen to me.
As I talk, now you're stalked by the hunter of the fronter,

Who's size five and sexy. 
Quick, they catch your body and another one next week.

She says she had enough of men and now she's lookin for payback.

She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.
She walks softly but she carries a big gun.

The most venomous feminist, homie, she ain't soft.
You give her trouble then she might cut your head off. 
Or something that you like to think's the best: 
She'll blow big holes in your chest. 

She says she gotta 'cause she says a lotta ladies won't 
She says she gotta 'cause she says a lotta ladies don't 
She says she gotta 'cause she says a lotta ladies can't 
She says she gotta 'cause she knows a lotta ladies 

Romance the thoughts of giving men their own medicine. 
Electrocute 'em light 'em up like Con Edison, 
She got no fear five rings in their ear, 
Holes in their nose, way-out clothes. 

Living life to the fullest buck shot and bullets. 
Triggers she'll pull it, Earth she want to rule it. 
Maybe she will 'cause she's quick to kill. 
The city lights make her dresses tight, yes she bites. 

You never know where she'll come from. 
She walks softly but she carries a big gun 

[Chorus] 

You got no time to trip or argue, you're through. 
I'll bet she gets ya. Homeboy you'll catch a stretcher like so many before. 
She's on a bodycount tour. But not rock, she's puttin sucker punks in cops.
You say she's nothin but a woman then you come up shot.

You say ""Why you want to kill me?"" and she says ""why not?""
Pop she got a body that'll make you cry. 
Pop she got a shotty that'll make you die. 
Don't bring drama to her homie, 'cause you'll wind up flat.

She'll put your ass horizontal then she'll peel your cap.
She got no lovin', love is something that she never had.
She loved her mother but she hate her motherfucking dad.
So stay the hell out her way, 'cause the girl don't play, 
None!

Ice-T,"Hey, boy!

Once upon a time a DJ's task
Was just to play records, what more could you ask?
But then came remixes, scratching and cuts
Which was too much for many, drove some DJ's nuts
But the DJ named Glove has reigned supreme
As the turntable wizard of the hip-hop scene
So listen to him, check him out, but remember this
When the Glove's on the wheels of steel he's reckless

This high-powered music is truly unique
As the Glove cuts the rhythm to the hip-hop beat
He moves like a madman as he spins his disc
He's the number one scratcher on the DJ list, he's reckless

Now I've seen DJ's, too many to name
Some gained recognition and even fame
But when you talk of MC's, Ice-T is the best
And when you talk of DJ's, forget the rest, Glove's reckless

So listen very closely as the Glove throws down
He cuts like a razor to the big beat sound
Dave's layin' down a groove that we know you'll like
With the Glove on the turntables and Ice-T on the mic, we're reckless

So listen to the music, let your mind feel free
Realize you're with the master G-L-O-V-E
Dave and MC Ice-T, you know you're with the best
Because when we're in the mix you know the groove is fresh

Why don't we just use body language
Let our bodies do all the talking
And just kick back and enjoy the erotic conversation

Hello Sunshine, now you did quite fine
Shall we rewind, relive these good times?
I feel your body gettin hot again
Girl, don't you know I'm 'bout to dive on in?

And kiss you on the grill, squeeze your headlights
Rub your bumper kitten, gettin nasty like a triple x-rated flick

When they come they gots to come correct
Because they know I catch wreck
A well-known wild street vet
Step into the kill zone, baby, it's on
I pack the twin nine-mills that'll lift your dome
Chrome pump with double-eyed slots and such
A fully-auto Mac-dime that is sure to touch
Ya, bust you with the Desert Eagle

And the Ice gets evil
Hit you with the .44 Smith & Wes-
Son, you're best to run cause my Tec eats pests
I got a glock with the laser, hot police taser
Step in real close, I hit your throat with the razor
You want to live or die, it's your decision
Talk shit, you're dissin, i got you in my night vision
Brain fragments on the street released
Another nigga fronts hard, another nigga deceased

I know your bein' treated right
No more worries
Plus you're bein heard G 
I guess you know niggaz is still trippin
I don't know why, they see a future in it 
We're headed for self-destruction 
Can't function
Only thing I can do is pray 
And thank God, for another day 
Yes Homie, it's rough down here. I gotta watch my back 
'cause it's hard being black 
If it ain't the other
It's my own colour 
Tryin to work me 
Tryin to hurt me 
Ain't no L-O-V-E 
Please tell me why, Dear Homie

Dear Homie, gang-bangin ain't joke 
And I'm lookin over ya loc 
Always knew there was fools out to get me 
I didn't even hear the gunshots till after the slugs hit me 
I grabbed for my chest and my neck, hopin
When my head hit the ground my skull busted open 
You used to ask for my advice
Well Dear Homie, dyin ain't nothin nice
And the place I'm at is overpacked
With young blacks who crash crack and gats 
I can only pray 
You don't come this way
You gotta stay alive, you got a kid G
I feel ya partner but I worry a lot 
Bust shots
I know you're tryin' to comfort me 
But I don't want no company, Homie 

Dear Homie, even though you're gone
I still fell your presence 
Sometimes I can sleep 
'cause I just can't see
Reality like it really should be seen
I still reminisce on how we used to kick it 
Strollin' the yard, just hangin' out together 
Down for whatever, whenever 
And now I'm hopin, you're seeing a true friend in me 
We where meant to be

Dear Homie, you used to call me O.G. 
Now ya really gotta look up to me 
'cause the place I'm at, is way high in the sky
I didn't want to die 
But the life I lived was just to reckless 
Too many bad marks on God's checklist
And many many brothers will go out
Just tryin to get that hard-core street clout 
But a street reps final test, is when you're lying in a coffin 
With you're hands folded on your chest. 
Then ya hear the girls cry
Then ya hear the brothers lie 
Talkin' about how down you was 
Then the next week the back on the street, they cold forgot ya 'cause'. 
Don't wanna see ya on your back, 
So for me stay sucka free, 'cause you don't need that, Homie.

Niggas on the streets ain't really got a muthafuckin choice
Muthafucka

(So niggas is forced to do dirt)	--> Prodigy

Born hustler

I only run with real niggas who wear gold and jewels
Diamond rings, strapped with tools
I take no shorts cause I been in it for the long one, the strong one
Gotta tell the truth, yo, half my niggas is on the run
Street giant defiant to the laws
That the white man made, nigga
That's why we play, nigga
A/k/a the street hustler from the Westside
Too damn fly, too much finesse for the hoo ride
I rather take a mark off smooth
Cause the skilll of a hustler is to stick and move
And make you say: ""Damn, what's his name?
Got to give a nigga props cause the kid got game""
Mad game, fool, I base my hustle not on strength
But think, you say 'the liqor store', I say 'brinks'
Cause my mind's on the massive roll of the dice
The magnitude of my game's insane, precise

So now you're mad cause I got money and you don't
The hustlers win, the busters won't
What can I say, you can't come out and play
With the real ones, dig this
You'll get broke with the quickness
I don't gamble, I cheat when it's on
Two g's on the table, two in my palm
And if I spill up, I pull the nickel .25 strap
Then the place gets flat and then I'm out the back
With my niggas and them 4's on thangs
And if I really want to floss I flex my Bentley wings
Damn, over your head, got a problem
Keepin lyrics down to earth so normal niggas can solve em
But the game's extreme so quit your high beams
And increase the light, now can you see me, you might
If you ever been to jail or shot, sold rocks
I'm talkin 'bout weight down like movin ki's and pounds
But every nigga in the hood ain't fly
Light-skinned or dark, they're 90% marks
Straight vics and they got money to give
Then without em tell, me how the hell a hustler lives..

I got no love for a lame
I use my strategy from crack to rap, no shame
And now instead of cooking some ki's
I'm flippin million dollar ??? call em wack MC's
But suckers got it twisted, they missed it
Wastin they life when yo, they mentally gifted
The streets ain't the only fuckin hustle in town
You gotta get in where you fit in, gotta stay way down
But a buster is a buster for life
He makes excuses why his ass ain't pay
That shit's played
Cash rules everything around me, kid
I hit a 50'000 lick and never did no bid
Cause I'm bent on a come-up and my shit stays tight
How many fake gangsta rappers will I hear tonight?
It don't matter cause the real don't care
You know I'ma gonna get mine, so I'ma let em get theirs
But I know in the heart what's true
So if you listen very closely, maybe you will too
My mind's blown off Armani suits
Pavet medaillons, [Name] boots
Cristal and steak, shrimp big as your hand
I bought a silk robe and it's from Siam
This jam's for the hoods and thugs
Pimps and hoes, the slingers of drugs
Hustlers and thieves, cons and crooks
Bookers and sharks, muthafuck the marks

Pops died, eleven, what's up with heaven?
It's hell when you're an orphan at a early age
This impressionable stage, no love breeds rage
In the heart of a child who never knew his roots
Looked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eel-skin boots
Parkin Caddies on the sidewalk, gangsta talk
Truckin diamonds and gold
Rubberbands around the bankrolls
Fly girls to make your head spin
Seemed they partied all night long
I was like, ""Put me on""
But they said, ""Little fellow, run and go play
Take your butt to school or else you'll have to be like us one day""
I didn't understand, but I tried to get a job
While all the players got the girls cause they'd hustle and rob
I was like makin 'bout 1-50 a week
And after taxes, you know what that is - lunch meat

And I know I can be better than this
I gotta get me a car, man
I gotta get a girl

I know I can do it out there, man
I'm finna go for it, man
I gotta get some money

Streets of anger, trouble and crime
I had it hard, had to sleep in my car sometime
But I never let another player see me down
I kept my front up, my gear clean
Even when checkin minor green
Brothers knew my game was true
So I hooked up with the real crew
That knew excactly what to do
Bank jobs and jewels, quick to flex with tools
Pimpin hoes on the block
Checkin cash non-stop
Crack spots, armor with interior bars
No lie, I used to own 'bout 15 cars
Every piece Fila made
Drape my women in suede
Pavet Piaget, Cesar's Palace holidays
It was on, crazy out of control
We made up the word 'ballin', that was how we rolled
But the FBI had a-whole-nother idea
It's called multiple indictments for hundreds of years

What
Daff is dead?
Carter got 25 years?
Nah..
Spike 35 to life?
Nah, don't tell me B.O.'s dead, man
I don't want to hear that, man
I was just with him

[ VERSE 3 ]
The game is vicious, no retirement, you die young
Listen to a fake, he might tell you to grab a gun
I get phone calls from condemned row
Brothers I ran with, brothers I really know
They tell me, ""Ice you got much love in the pen
You're the one that got away, don't want to see you in""
They tell me, ""Tell the little homies the deal
Don't let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel""
I marched two million strong in D.C.
Lookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me
Damn, my mind was twisted in my hustlin days
But God spared me, I got a baby son to raise
And bein black ain't easy, prejudice is real
But health and liberty is all we need for us to build
We gotta come together, unseparated

His homie dies, you might see him shed a tear
But mostly hardcore feelings are all you see
'Cause you gotta be raw to be called a gee
But every man slows down
You'll see this side when there's probably no one around
And there's no safer place
Than if you ever are some gee's homebase
But it ain't easy, these brothers got barricades around the hearts
It's gonna take time before the trust starts
But girl, you must be true
'Cause if your man's a gee, he'll definitely die for you
Look him deep in his eyes, let him know you're there
Show him that you really care

And that's why I guess my feelings will have to show
How can you hide somethin' that's in your soul?
'Cause there's more to the l-o-see
Than all the violence, baby, that ain't who I be
I know my dogs and me can still pull straps
But I rather have you rollin' in my Cadillac

Don't check the rear view, there's no turnin back

Ah shit
Ice-T back
Representin, nigga, once again
That real shit, nigga
I thought you knew, bitch
Better recognize

[ CHORUS ]
Players, check your grip before you get popped
Bitches, get my money before you get dropped
Gotcha - buggin off the words I say
Because this type of pimpin happens every day

[ VERSE 1 ]
Niggas want to know my steelo
Bitches want to get with the baddest
Hustlin apparatus
It's the LA cash flow master-roller
No one gets colder, I  used to flip boulders
Of caine, on my brain, it's outta control, crime plot
A dead-ass cop and muthafuckas get got
In the game it ain't safe for the weak or the timid
Known to break a bitch but barely rarely slide up in it
So you see me in a club, grab your woman like you want to
Blink your eyes and the freak is out there freezin on the corner
She got caught by the curls and the jewels
Lookin for a nigga that is quick to pull tools
Now she's breakin herself, makin herself
Respect my technique of pimpin, minus all simpin
Check it bitches, it ain't nothin nice
You're gonna seal or sell pussy if you roll with the Ice

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Oh my God, the nigga rolls hard..
Every player mentions me
The hustler of the century
(Ice, that nigga ain't nothin nice!)
I got more freaks than Heff', my bankroll's off vice
Commandin straight pimp tactics
None of y'all can match this
Meet a freak in a week, her workplace a matress
Really though, recognize the pimp type flow
I don't smoke endo, I count cash on my patio
So much love on the streets, don't need no bodyguard
Big up to my homies with the pimp type nod
I'm off the hook, checkin traps in Vegas [Name]
Full link mink with the matchin borsalino
I change cars like you change drawers, bitch
I got a stable full of thoroughbreds that make me rich
Niggas hate me, cause they can't control they roll
They see that fat old ass and start givin me cash

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]	
My mind's blown off fine champagne
So bent on currency, got green in my vein
So damn smooth that every woman want to touch me
So much sexuality that nuns want to fuck me
I kick back with my pimpin ballin brothers
Stand over the bed, dump the cash on the covers
The game's got me, I'm a slave to the roll
Hoes belong on the track and I belong in gold
Silk and satin, I deserve a pimpin pattin
Been in the life so long cause I stomp bitches who start rattin
Mostly friendly, but do got that gorilla in me
Save it for the player-hater niggas with the envy
Lot of niggas talk it, but they can't hold a hooker
Ice took her, she was too long a looker
It's strictly straight-lace hustlin on mine
I been pimpin all my life and I don't mind dyin

[ CHORUS ]",Pimp Anthem,1996
Ice-T,"Yeah
Too many hardcore mothafuckas out here in this business
Ain't gettin their proper loot
You know what I'm sayin?
(Right)
Check the technique
(Aha)

Everybody talkin' 'bout the way hip-hop ain't the same
Suckers kidnapped the game
I know the biggest in the business, and no joke
Half of 'em broke, and none of 'em smoke
(Bust the facts, loc)
I got into this hip-hop game
Just to try to get a girl and get some light-weight fame
There'd never been no cash made in it
So who thought you could get paid with it?

Just crash the club with my crew and then I'm outta there
Hit some skins, act bugged, that was a rap career
Then Run D.M.C. jumped the fuck off
Got mad paid, word, kicked the bucks off
There wasn't many rappers out there rockin the streets
When hip-hop was just cuts and beats
I seen Wildstyle, dug the scene
I want to be an MC, rock, rock on, know what I mean?

I started crashin' rap contests
Shootin' hardcore rhymes through wack MC's chests
I signed on the lines of a wack contract
Didn't even read it, fuck that
They gonna put my record out
I'm gonna be large, know what I'm talkin' about?

In the first 2 years I made about 300 bucks
Yo, this business sucks
But I got another chance and I came correct
Got a lawyer and accountant, now my shit's legit
But many won't get no second chance
And get fucked in this biz without a kiss or a dance
The game is to exploit young ghetto kids
A straight pimp game, and there ain't no shame
And the shit's gone too far
100 hip-hop labels with all white A&R's
The game's hijacked
The rap game's hijacked
Let me tell you how it happened

Now while every MC in the game
Was worryin' about a white boy gettin' the fame
They dug out the foundation
Now let me give a demonstration
Say you got a dope group from the hood
Talkin' mad shit like they're up to no good
You take 'em to a label
Now who sits behind the table?

Some jewish mothafucka that don't know shit
Tryin' to tell y'all what's a fuckin' street hit
The shit's way off course
It's like me tellin' Johnny Cash how to sing about his horse
You go on tour, the white agency says you're wild
Tone down your style
The radio jocks are all pop
So how the fuck this nigga know what shit to rock?

The shit that make your face turn green
Is when you get dissed by a kidnap magazine
I give a fuck about these mothafuckas
I'm doin' this jam to save my hip-hop brothers
Get your paperwork straight, kid
Get a lawyer and accountant just like I did
Don't blow your dough, 'cause you will see g's
But this game has no guarantees
Learn about publishing points, so you won't be blind
Learn to read everything you sign
Then you might have a chance
If not, bend over, pull down your pants
The game's hijacked

(Yeah don't they hear you, brother)
Yo, the rap game's hijacked
(Word)
I'm talkin 'bout a hijack
(Say it one more time, baby)
The rap game's hijacked
Check it
(Break it down for these niggas)

You can go gold and still owe the record label cash
Yo kid, check the math
Learn about the word 'recoup', troop
And stop walkin' round all hyped and souped
You ain't nothin' but somethin' to be used and worked
You ain't nothin' but a sucker to be duped and jerked
'Cause the fuckin' record label don't love ya, pal
They didn't love ya on the street and don't love ya now
They're out to make an end, friend
'Cause every dollar you make, they damn near make 10
They'll take you for everything you got
Or else they'll sign you and they put on the shelf to rot

I'm tryin to tell you what's up
You best to listen to this record even if you hate my fucking guts
'Cause I just can't stand around and watch rap get done
And my brothers ain't gettin' none
A nigga like me has gotta spit game
Nigga, get that cash flow. 
Fuck that muthafuckin fame
'Cause the white man's rippin' us off once again

Real hip-hop, my man
Fool, the rap game's hijacked
You need to listen, nigga
The rap game's hijacked
Need to play this record about ten times
The rap game's hijacked
Black people don't own shit
The rap game's hijacked
Check it
R&B's hijacked
Black acting is hijacked
Just being black is hijacked
(Build, my nigga, build, my nigga)
Nigga

Stupid mothafuckas, they rippin' us off
You better get an end...
While the money's there, boy
Silly-ass bitch runnin' around with a gold chain
All niggas gotta get some real estate
Mothafucka
Come up
Fuck a bitch
Better get somethin' you can own, asshole
White man ain't givin up shit

But he's gettin' minimum wage

Peace to my street niggas movin that weight
Much love to my comrads who's out in upstate

Got a overload of guns to unload on a lame nigga trippin
Wake up my posse, interrup the Rémy-sippin

Listen to the HK wailin and your vital signs failin
Everyone that ever met me knows
I work bitches like niggas, pimp niggas like hoes
Command a mack that's immaculate, your girl's naked
You think she ain't been hit, kid yo, you best to check it
For ten years I been connected to the top of this
Hold your breath, kid, I'm never droppin this
Too busy rollin off them fat chrome rims
And niggas who trip get sung hymns
We crash clubs and security shits
Cause they know they got size but they know we keep clips
Crazy muthafuckas lickin shots in doors
Leavin suckers' bodies bleedin over nightclub floors
You don't want none, son, stay gone
Break north when I come and you might live long
Yeah, my face kickin treble, you're just a pebble
You're gettin rocked, yo E, cock the glock

Fire shoots out of my strap like a ray-gun
You broke ill and you cold fucked up
Now you're bleedin through your fingers while you're holdin your gut

And if I fall I fall on cushions, ???

I see your videos, a 100 niggas in it you don't know
Framed in the lens, bought friends
Who really got your back, nigga, check it out
You really possess like zero street clout (think about)
The only place you're safe is in the studio
Yellin in the mic, you'se a bitch, that's right
I take a nigga like you and make him prostitute cute
So what you got a gun, punk, you're scared to shoot
You front hardcore, but I don't feel ya
Kids from my hood'll take your punk ass and peel ya
Let me check my Rolex quick because time's money
Squintin from the Pavet face because it's kinda sunny
Skinnin the top back, flossin the rag and the thing

Saturday night in L.A., time to play
My peoples hummin like a vibrator, gotta make crime pay
I'm packin two gats and I wish I could carry more
Might sound crazy, but I ran out of slugs before
Yeah, I know the feds watch me
But my vest clashes hard with the Versace
So I'm just rollin in the black five hun'
I used to lowride, now it's just for fun
I had 5 cars, but now I got one
Hard to keep up ballin when you're on the run
I got two ki's in my trunk and a shovel
Stepped on the one, so now I gots double
The shovel's for drama, need I say more?
Got the fat stash spot under my passenger floor
That's for the other strap, the automatic type
I gotta keep it close in case shit gets hype
Got a bitch in jail, she didn't snitch, she did three
I'ma have to roll solo till they set her free
Cause I got some other crimeys down, true gees
But they got all day, so now it's just me
And I'ma kick this slang until the day I die
I can't go straight, I won't even try
I'm stuck in the game, so don't ask me why
It's life in L.A.

I cover my face with the rag and bust

Now niggas like they credit and they like to get they loans on
So I hooked up with my boy who turns them phones on
He told me bout this nigga who won't pay
He also said he knew excactly where the muthafucka stay
So I went and got some homies I hang with
Some crazy muthafuckas who I used to bang with
We took a trip to his crib
I snatched his hoe and his kids, and this is what we did
I tied they punk ass up
I cracked the safe with an axe, and then the phones we cut
I didn't hurt his wife
But I promised next time that I would take her life
I shot a nigga in his neck for disrespect, caught a body
Got a murder in Miami for a shoot-out at a party
Got blood in my trunk from a punk who squealed
Had a partner tried to play me and his cap I peeled
Now I rest with my finger on my heater
Hand on my beeper, a light sleeper

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
New York and Philly are some down-ass towns

I use to sling enough water you could float a boat
You could ski on the mountains of fuckin coke
But now most niggas serve chronic
So I let em check the bank, and then I'm all up on it
I serve em with a cute hoe
In a week they tell my bitches 'bout all they dough
Then I jack and I kill
The jack's for the money, the kill's for thrills
I got 9'000 blacks that still serve crack
Got a bitch who works the Plaza too on the track
Got a GTA connection and I fence for jewels
Got some little kids that move my fuckin dope in schools
Got warrants for arrest in about 20 states
Got a bigger body count than fuckin Norman Bates
I'm a killer, jacker, dealer, pimp supreme

Some think he's cool, I think he's DEA
He said he want it bad, he heard that I got it good
I bagged up ten ki's of flour and met him in the hood
I met him at my spot, cause I know it's cool
Pat him down on sight to remove his tool
I made him name 10 niggas he should know
But that still ain't shit in the game of blow
He asked to see the dope, I asked to see the cash
He reached for that briefcase too fast
A fuckin pig, yo, he thought he had the chump

and mold me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said, we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it, or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart, with the million man march

[KAM]
Damn that's how you know the world about to end
Rain hail snow earthquakes and a million black men
Upon the God indivisible
With liberty and justice for all cause why'all done made us miserable
With this AmeriKKKan nightmare
That's why October 16th we gon be right there like yeah
The same niggaz that you want gone
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
It's goin on from here to Abraham Lincoln's statue
And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness
With the Black Muslim, Christian Jew and Jehovah Witness
To get this out in the open the only way
Is for us to declare a black holy day
The homies say that they rollin
Plus we got family, forty miles up, controllin

featuring Ice-T 

Verse 1: Brother Marquis 
Only the realest can feel us, cap-peelers and killers 
Hundred-dollar billers and real niggas 
Bitches with dime figures, telekenesis in my mind 
Make my diamonds shine, then I blind niggas 
Pussy punk perpatrators and playa haters - 
They can't fade us 'cause we two of the greatest 
Back out to let 'em have it, fake fucks and faggots 
Bow down in the presence of players and kiss the karats 
A wrist full of (?) for all the maggots 
Back up and get embarrassed, bitch, get off my carriage 
Uncut, no lactose, hear the raw dose 
Straight off the key, 100% G 
Who's puttin' it down on Miami's behalf 
Home of the nickel (?) and the raw half 
Everywhere we go, the impression's felt 
The real is stamped on the bag and the dope is dealt 

Chorus (2x): 
Gat in the back, sunroof top, 
Real one on the scene with the gangsta lean 
[The real one! Huh? Whut? 
The real one! Huh, nigga whut?] 

Verse 2: Ice-T 
It's '98, playa, check your game 
Make sure them young boys respect your name 
Keep your heed at arms, reached, cocked and ready 
'Cause the streets'll catch you slippin' and rock you steady 
Watch your back with your homies that you feel is real 
Your homeboys from your crew, yeah, they're the ones who do 
Yeah, the suckas that got the playa hater venom, 
I want to take 'em outside and lay slugs up in 'em 
But that's trippin', and that ain't my sport 
I'd rather lamp up my cirb and flip to rob a port 
I sip my v-dozen on the street, bump my beats 
When I'm twistin' my dub, can't nobody compete 
(Imagine this) Hundred-g Lex on your wrist 
(Imagine this) About 10 karats on your fist 
(Imagine this) All dime hoes on your list 
Huh, that shit would be nice, but your name ain't Ice 
(Nigga trip) And screw the style and so on, rock you softly 
How you gonna step to me, kid, you grew up off me 
TV, movies and records and tours 
So many buses in Versace I don't wear it no more 
Called my nigga in Miami, ""Marquis, wussup?"" 
He said, ""Playa, chop some game on this bubblin' cut!"" 
I said, ""Shoot me the track, or you can come too, 
Or if y'all want to ball in Cali, I'll fly in your whole Crew."" 

Chorus 

Verse 3: Brother Marquis 
I'ma stay in the field, on a quest for the mil's 
And try to keep it real till I die or get killed 
So I can sit back and kick it, write my own ticket 
And live this lavish lifestyle of trickin' and big-dickin' 
Seein' that the West and the South's connected 
Formulatin', plottin' game to perfection 
Down with the Syndicate, bossin' new tennis shit 
Crimes cold defended, get caught, do the sin 
There's politickin' in the 600, drunk and blunted 
That's how we front it, but you don't want to run up on it 
Inside the club packin', actin', 
Got my bitch at home see-sackin', got my ones stackin' 
Parlay, playin' diamond link, cubin' cable 
Baddest bitches in the stable, mo' money on the table 
I'm back in the game to show 'em how it's done 
Ice-T and Marquis, you're fuckin' with the real one!

",The Real One,1998
Ice-T,"[Chorus:]
It's 99 players check your game
Make sure them young boys respect your name 
Keep your heaters at close reach cocked and ready 
Cause the streets will catch you slipping, rock ya steady 
Watch your back with your homies that you feel is real
Your homeboys from your crew, yeah them the ones that do you 
The suckas that got the player hater venom
I want to take 'em outside and lay some slugs up in em

[King T]
When they need work
They call the cali drug expert
Smashing in a six hundred dollar bill burnt
Looking flossy living costly
Off the edge, out of state 
They gots to break bread, for sho 
I needs mo' ice drops for the lexo
Briggetts sets blow when I'm sipping the mo'
Freelancing, trying to build a mansion 
And stay faded
Have hoes walk around my crib butt naked... 

[Ice-T]
True, pop the remy kick back and let the players represent 
High floss true boss game and take aim
These sucka wannabe's
Nigga please - you're green
I'll bend hoes on the downlow - banks obscene 
want to chill with these niggas, bet you wish you could 
And suck game out my ass like sponges 
I run this 
You can't fuck with the steelo
You niggas want to be low
When I'm on the east I play ceelo 
Cash flow 
One track mind serial hustler 
Quick to break a buster ya snitch bitch? 
I'll dust ya 
Bentley ballin' bastard 
No hustler faster 
Game maker 
I knock a white bitch and break her

[King T]
But Ice, Chronic got me bruising my brain 
But soothing my pain, I'm true to the game
I got my mind made I gotta be that rich motherfucker
Set it up so my grandkids don't suffer 
The phat hummer 
The phat drummer - what's your choice? 
Trying to find a sister with a voice 
Make her moist 
I'm throwing up the W 
Bringing trouble to 
Those in sight
King T and Big Ice 

[Chorus:]
[Ice-T] 
But T that's trippin' and that ain't my sport
I'd rather lamp in my crib and flip the Robb report
And set my v-dozen on the streets
Bump my beats
Cause when I'm twisting my dubs
Can't nobody compete
Imagine this: 
A hundred G 'lex on your wrist 
Imagine this: 
About ten karrots on your fist
Imagine this: 
All dime hoes on your list
Ha - that shit would be nice
But your name ain't ""Ice"" - kid... 
I'll screw the silencer on - rock you softly
How you gonna step to me kid? You grew up off me 
TV, Movies, and Records and Tours
So many busters wearing Versace I don't wear it no more... 

[King T]
But this will be a classic 
Many facets to get that ass kicked 
The alcoholic Don, call me King Tragic 
Watch me speak the magic
Watch me teach that old habit - full of havoc 
And Ice'll tweak the mix when it statics
People pay
Just to have me stay 
And say a verse 
I'll freak a couple words unrehearsed 
Then I burst 
I mean I bust
From all angles 
Guarunteed platium on your single

[Ice-T]
Yo T, I really must admit I'm blessed 
Master V does some other shit TV's in the head rests 
Never wear no vests because I got mad love 
I catch respect when other niggas catch slugs 
1, 2 I bust shit to load guns to
Beats for the hoodlums 
Somebody's gotta do'em
Fed's screw 'em
Faggot's got my whole crib bugged 
Mad tapps on the phone cause I deal with the thugs 
Drugs? never
No, the Ice is too clever 
I'm overseas
Checkin G's
Nigga please 
Ballin' since the 70's - yeah baby 
Blew up in the 80's 
Now you niggas hate me
You can't see me motherfucker your focus is off
You can't be me motherfucker, you're broke and you're soft 
Too many niggas try to pert my lifestyle - romancing 
I was kickin game while them kids was breakdancing 
Overlord - so why the wack niggas ain't dead?
Probably because my aim is over nigga's heads/ 
East coast - west coast, I play the whole map and bounce/ 
They got a benz but live in their mom's house... 

[Chorus]
[King T]
To all my G's rock on
get your ride on - when you hear it
The forbidden Gangland lyric
Player Haters fear it
Get you right up close near it
Possessed by the Eazy-E spirit
Ice-T set the limit
And niggas won't cross this line
suicide - and niggas won't cross this nine
in your mouth
puffin' with my niggas down south
what the fuck this really all about? man..
I'm coming out
front and back, 98 brougham
All you fake G's stay home
Leave that shit alone
King Tee's back on the throne
And that nigga on the mic - straight gone
Cra-zy, why'all niggas want to know the real deal?
I'll freestyle and smack you in your grill
Bomb lyrics, no special effects or gimmicks
The Syndicate will put you in the mix - biatch...",Check Your Game,1999
Ice-T,"It starts like this 
Gats hit harder than fists 
Just cock and lick it 
The aftermath's wicked 
Brass gets evicted 
Another crew shot 
Can't put your strap back in your waist 
Cause your barrel's too hot 
You did it kid 
The more dead 
The more weight on your head 
Plus you ganked a suitcase 
Full of black tar H 
Baby boy, twenty keys 
Dead Colombian Gs 
Now you're ballin full speed 
One slip you bleed 
You had your nigga with you 
Hard rock street gorilla hitter 
He took a hot one in the shoulder 
Now he's bendin over 
Mad illegal 
Nigga flipped harder than Buggsy Segal 
He wet the room up with the rocket launchin 
Desert eagle 
Blood oozin through his black dickies 
Ya nigga say he's getting dizzy 
The car seat's fuckin getting sticky 
He leaned back, his whole chest plate's cracked 
You thought they hit him once 
He must of got double clapped 
Your niggas dyin but he ain't cryin 
Soldier no doubt 
He looked you dead in the eye 
Said ""get that money"" checked out 
Ballin bent him back in the black 
S T S but where he's going no stress 
Your niggas dead, but you're thinkin bout head 
Fly hoes and condos 
Once you flip the kilos 
The fact your niggas out ain't shit to ya 
More profit for your greedy ass 
No one to split the grip wit ya 

Chorus: 
Common sense will keep you safer than vests 
Ambulance, cots, cause real niggas give head shots 
LA streets will make your guts leak 
Player no doubt 
Young killers live for drug wars and shoot outs 

You flipped your chip 
Motorola, called your hooker 
Said you had a little foul up 
Told the ho to wet some towels up 
She didn't even talk 
Clicked the phone off 
Might a new some weak niggas 
But this bitch ain't soft 
Make your next call 
Straight to your chicano connect 
Said they would flip the boy for girl 
Up the weight, give you Peruvian flake 
You had to dump the body, 
Burned it beyond recognition 
Back back in commission 
Scooped your hooker, cleaned your seats off 
Squeezed off 
Two in her head 
Now the fuckin bitch is dead 
You're all alone just how you liked it 
Straight laced hustler from hell 
Street life you spiked it
It's time to hook up with the mexicanos 
Layin in the Dooly parking lot of a McDonalds 
Hit the corner they was there 
You're prepared 
Circled the block, screwed your silencer on 
Rock the esse they had 
Kickin back to get ya 
Crept on the dropped truck 
Double crossin ducks got bucked 
Check the back of the cab 
Suckas had the fuckin math 
Ten more keys of uncut pure cash (Yes!) 
Now your weighin thirty full keys 
Of girl and the pony 
Jumped for your lack 
Hit the yack threw your head back 
The big time is what you wanted 
And now you got it 
The devil put the strap in your palm 
And you shot it 

Chorus 

It's going down now 
On forever 
Square life is never 
Buck wildin is your life stylin 
Mashed out 
Hit a motel room 
Crashed out 
Called up a ho to get your dick sucked though 
Bad bitch phat backs green contacts 
Real hair, kept her feet all night in the air 
Kind of square 
Said she only worked the streets a week 
Said her boyfriend kicked her out 
And she needed to eat 
She cuddled to you like a baby 
Keep the girl mabey 
The pussy was tighter than fuck drove you crazy 
She kissed you on your chest and legs 
Asked you to fuck her in the ass 
Then she started to beg 
It kind of got you open, no doubt 
When baby doll fell asleep, with your dick in her mouth 
Now you're layin there, lookin at the motel door 
Hand on your strap, some beautiful whore 
You fuckin relaxed, fell a fuckin sleep bad move 
Big game take little game, show and prove 
Baby jumped up, went for the strap 
Dumped off 
Three shots in your face
Grabbed the sutcase 
Don't forget, grab the blow then jet 
Before that ho hit the door she sipped a glass of Moet 
Street life sabatoge 
Niggas want to live large 
Demon ho out for cheddar 
Capped you with your own Berreta

Chorus",Common Sense,1999
Ice-T,"Yeah, This is Ice-T 
You've just been listening to the Seventh Deadly Sin 
To me the Seventh Deadly Sin is hardcore rap
And I'm very proud to have been a part of that throughout the years 
I'd like to send peace out to all my homeboys that kept it real
And love to all my niggas that have died out here 
In this bullshit that we call the streets 
You know? What can I say? Hip Hops been good to a nigga 
I got mad love for the East coast, West coast, North and South 
I got my niggas The Top Guns here
We gonna sign this one off like this:

My life's been a great story in the ultimate war
Should I ill or do right? Make peace or go raw? 
I can't explain the true penalties of fame and the wealth 
Tell me who can I trust? I can't trust myself
Got the devil got me thinking 'bout them ill moves 
Every damn kid on the street, they got something to prove 
Push a bullet through my heart, why not? That's a start
They could push their reps quicker, kill a well known nigga 
And if you say you're going to kill me, should I blast you first? 
Being black is kinda like being born with a curse 
Do or Die, that's the code of the streets I didn't invent 
Niggas sketch my life out with malicious intent
My skin color's got me trapped in a never ending ghetto 
I move to the hills, but I can never let go
The gun shots and the homicides just don't stop
And just because I came up, I can always drop

Yo.. we come prepared for guerilla warfare  
Never scared soldiers to the heart 
And hose them body parts with the hardwear
You spark a dun with Bizzaro or sequel
When you catch a link on the wings of this desert eagle 
Flappin, we splittin caps friend 
remember when niggas would shoot joints 
Now niggas be wildin' placing hollow points
Cause in this rat race, shit be moving at a murderous pace  
Mad sons got slugs to the face, OG packs kilos 
Over sore losers and cilo, prepare like a scout 
I hold the burner on the delo 
In this age of idolatry, mad niggas worship you vanity
If Five ?? you nigga maintain humanity - insanity 
Hope you see the light ­ like the prism's true colors
Only a few remain brothers, fuck the others
In this cold world ­ the war that's controlled by the trigger 
Revelation or the scripture got to be that live nigga 

So if niggas want to bite the sound like Tyson 
Deck him in the left eye, murder sit down like ryerson 
You want to dis, don't even try son 
Hey yo, Pizzone ­ I'm the prodigy you need to keep ya eyes on 
Yo who the don, who plays it all night long? 
50 mill strong, Handle like napalm. Word is bond 
Who get it on when it's time to drop a bomb? 
Sadq keep it cool and calm with the niapalm 
Droppin emcee's to their knees and make them pie straight 
Dust and take and serve niggas on my hot plate 
So cats who got beef, we can take it to the streets 
Cause shit these niggas talk to the grave with they teeth 
It's time to meet your maker step into the new millennium 
I analyze data like intel Pentium 
So follow me, I blame sovereignty for God we bust 
Top Gun, move bright, smooth as Ice, sex and dust 

Ante up the goods, Top Gun Ice-T in your neck of the woods 
I'm 15 blocks deep in the foreign neighborhood 
Street of my styles, no smiles, trying to gun down the golden child
Still on trial for my old endeavors
Cold weather got catched trying to buck wholes in my fucking sweater 
Niggas is soft like butter, leathers and felt 
Time to heat it up and melt
Felt the welts from brass belt buckles to brass knuckles 
Kill all the jokes and chuckles ­ let's all get together 
My fam stay thick together 
Trick off and lick off together
No matter the weather
Lets ease on down to the bow and to the bricks 
When I start to squeeze, I won't ease off a bit 
Won't be no teams up in here with no clashes 
Just bunk mile sleds boot shines up in the masses 

Life got no guarantees, I'm looking for the long lease 
When I'm in LA, it ain't hard to find me 
21st floor eating shrimp at Belonte's
Every time you see me I'm connected to a dime piece 
I check your styles, although you rhyme quicker 
No matter what you do, I'll always lace mine thicker 
Jealousy will make a fool die quicker than liquor 
Watch your back with your niggas 
Cause that's right where they'll stick ya 
You see me in the club jeweled up, all alone 
I give love to my homies, then I bounce the fuck home 
Bodyguards are something that I just don't do
Cause if I'm after you black, I'm gonna clap them too
Money makes all my homies look brand new 
I don't fuck with the fakes, I make moves with the true 
Ice ­ baby chopping that real, thought you knew 
I might sound hard, but nigga I can die too

Cause I'm as real as you",Exodus,1999

Ice-T,"Ride as my jabos, cocked my straps watcha back
You know where you at? You in urban combat
So stay alert, use the attack of the tactical expert
Puttin' in work, and leavin' your troops with wet shirts
Your causality rate is high, I'm closin in
Prepare for your ultimate end, tell your family bye
Better cool like Egon, and shine like veegon
Pissin' on your beons, for decades and eons
You squad has no muscle plus you, my new hustle
Fuck scuffing up my knuckles, rather buck you and watch you buckle
I can't stand a snitch, a switch real bitch
I got some transcripts to say you been runnin ya lips
Now its on, on site, if I see you I'mma sin ya
If I catch you in traffic I'ma gift ya somethin' in ya
Letcha battle with death for the prize of life
I learned ta never come empty handed to a gun fight
My adversaries feel fright, his last sight
Was a flash of light, you said lightning could strike
From the same place twice, I have your head on my deat
Fifteen hundred, tonight's your last night gettin' blunted

The voices could not be stopped it began to morph
And reinvent them self I grew like a black blade
Moving like a tornado from the west to the east coast
Leaving behind a path of destruction and mayhem

Thick's ice fix ghosts infrared no remorse
And low from the exchange, psycho deranged
Playa lay no feel pain, killa coca main
I'm top framing the game, use muscle for the hustle
I zip duffel bags to muffle fags
Scuffle my knuckles bad on niggas that think that they running shit
They feel the punishment, uh, blood bath, the wrath
Aftermath, at least the guns in shit

Too under fallin charum leads to send up on the earth
Mix things with daughters with men
Since poured from birth the worth for the others
Go to war with my brothers
I'm unstable like Kane did to Abel
I'm out the stable sinning from the beginning
Leavin' daddy's little girl pretty linen bloody red
What's said in the book of dead is now all forgotten
My soul's rotten, still the blood's spilled I feel
Chills, I'm still plotting, I'm ill norm
Take life forms like light storms I laugh at the wrath
Of the guys comin on, visions of the antichrist is risen
The question is now, am I unforgiven?

Legends tells that the creator of this poison's name was ice
Although, others have told different stories, no matter
Who or what invented the monster, their souls would be forever
Damned to Hell

Enter the death chamber, cash richer, leave ya nutless
Cutless with the raw scope, double ya dope
Feel my back lash, body cash your whole fame and media
Greedy shit, tag ya out the rag Jag, speedy shit
Look in the sky, the four horsemen busting no discussion
No stopping its apocalypse, lock and load ya clips
Gonna be rich and dead, copa said don't matter cats scatter
Suckas get touched, niggas get rushed
Watch 'em transform into animal form, wicked hell born
Lord of the flies, cry and ya die
Mechanama come masses soul snatcher, fallen angel
All angles covered for you fucking God lovers
Possession, good suggestion run cuddle your funds
Double your guns, watch your kids grow, stay out my flow
Be wise, the magnificence, evidence, decadence mind
Seven sins, the abomination, I'm
That nigga, last nigga, street mack
Hot is my strap, wet is your back
Understand I never forgive, leaving bodies like sieve
Clap gats til my fuckin shit's clip less

We gonna do it for all the hardcore niggas out there like this...

(Radzay)
A hard hit makes a soft ass, that's what they told me huh!
I'm totally gone, I'm in another zone nigga put me on this
We layin' stick, my lyrics is heat
Havin' visions of ritual mirrors inside my sleep - nigga peep
I remember watchin' the news, dead people in jimmy bag
I got a Nine nigga get me mad
And watch me throw up razorblades and get to trippin'
I'm cats and crippin', lickin' is civil like Jack the Ripper
I'm on a mission drippin'-a-fog
An when it sees a million motherfuckers deceased
some of police are brutal hog, I'm actor-baitin'
No hesitation to slice a motherfucker in thirty places
Fuck a case - ain't leavin' traces here to Redder-Dip
I'm aimin' a - automatic find a bitch I'm hangin' up
Protainin' up, boss strangler, better save my mother
Flat packs will end as brothers - the bloody covers
Bloody gloves like Yo-J, AK's my brainwaves
I'll strung a nigga all day to my dear play you won't be comin' back
I put that on my dear pops when I blast a fierce drop
My bloody mask revealin' Jason it's non-stop
The cemetery is what you facin'
My steel shot is smokin' like chainsaws, brains call
recommend that you get your homies and watch your motherfuckin' game fall

Prepare for the night that you never wanted
These streets is taunted, blacked out impala with the big rims on it
Hit'cha corner with the lights out, bitch it's on
Duck down wit'cha kids, you know what you did
Motherfuck what your niggas say, watch for the ricochet

That's neither here nor there, just beware
Cause when I bust off my gat flings like a roll flair
You now listenin' to - the most hated and most loved at the same time 'cause
Ice nigga what the fuck you want to do about a T
Most'cha bitch niggas can't fuck with me
Cause your chin-chalked talk I can see through
Like you're rollin' in a phat V-12
Bulllshit - pull quick and have your shit cocked or dropped
Keep a spare clip cause sometimes the shots don't stop
It's motherfuckin' game to rap about, shits' for real
Double action, ain't gotta cock back no more
Got you bitch-ass niggas sweatin' like Taibo
Rather lookin', in my face, I'm just checkin' my flow
So, I advise you to keep it in the studio
Your attittude, you don't want to meet me dude

You need the whip, cluck it kid, I'm furious
Leavin' your crew delirious so you don't take it serious
I'm guessin' you was serious about the West, none test
I got the rep for my niggas on the shaw
Got the ball, fuck the law and yep I wet 'em out
As I proceed to spread 'em out and dead 'em out
Spray 'em out, lay 'em out

How many motherfuckers gonna die this summer
Gunshots from the hummer
Now the sawed-off riot pumps lead across your beds

I ain't mad at them though, they dumps the ammo
In you, suspend you in here, hell yeah
It's the time that the real niggas live for retaliation
Move on 'em, show, improve on 'em

I gots no love, for them busters, who put the work in
I can still see my fuckin' boys' body jerkin'
I ran over to him, put my hand on his chest
Hole like an apple in the side of his neck
His eyes glanced up, his body jerked once more
There's nothin' else to do but to go to war
Slide the hollow-tips in the chrome four-four
Roll down the windows, hang the heat out the door
Catch all the fuckin' bodies that I can tonight

Now it's on bitches, guys are darker than shit

You might just want to turn yourself into me
To save your hood pain of my crews' treachery
You fucked up, we know who you are, where ya live
We got your place ran up to a cop on the tick
We'll hit your block so hard, you'll swear it was an earthquake
Squeeze off the fully-auto, make your whole crib shake
I know you're breathin' hard, livin' on your last day
Or maybe, you're laughin', thinkin' that you got away
I don't give a fuck, I won't sleep
Till one of us lays me and my nigga

As this marks the day that
3 of America's most notorious outlaws
Will be executed for their crimes
Together the states of Michigan and California
Will conduct the executions behind prison walls
The 3 prisoners are set to be executed by 3 separate methods
Electric chair, hanging, and firing squad
Midnight tonight will mark the first execution
Death waits in my cell I can smell him
Somebody tell him that I still breathe, leave
I'm alive I'll never see 25 
Yet still I can feel, I'm real
When it all happened I was in the lime light
News, camera, gaven killer stamina
Another year I'm here but forgotten
Skin is rotting feeling old, cold
Motherfucker in a robe gonna sentence me to die in a metal chair
Fizzle my nut hair
Bad enough I'll be dead
Yet I'm tryin to figure out a way
To keep my eyes from poppin out my head
Oh they'll remember my ass
Twitchin, with my eyes drippin down the glass
Shaggy I think they're tryin to start a riot
And then it's Ice T but he don't seem fazed by it
I know the devil's waitin on me
But does God like him playin his role in killin me though
Lock me up until I die maybe
But you can never tell 
We might sharing a cell in hell
Cause, my last request was
Let my homies smoke my ashes and catch a Violent J buzz
One more thing before you hit that switch
Please tell my momma that I'm sorry, I never

The lights dimmed in my cell block
Cause all the power they got surged into one spot
J's chair hear him screamin, fully loaded
It was funny at first till his head exploded
It's something else for me 
Another kill just as wicked 
But cheaper on the light bill
It all starts with a thick rope
Make a noose and I'm gone
Stretch out my neck bone
Minutes left I think about my brother
When we was young...
Wait I don't have a brother
What the fuck?
My minds in a tangle
I wish somebody was here that I could strangle
I keep waking up on the floor
Cause I strangle myself but what the fuck for?
Haha starin at the cracks on the walls
Whistlin necks, fidgetin my balls
Kill me it'll still all be the same
Wicked clown juggalo phantom of the night train
What if I drop, but don't die
Tie weights to my legs 
And give it another try
Still coming think of something, I speak
I'm not feelin so hot let's go for it next week
Didn't work, I pulled down my collar
At least they won't be hearin me holla
My neck shut

To the designated spot on prison grounds
Where he will be executed by way of firing squad

My backs against the wall
If I only had my strap then I could plug 'em all
Watch 'em fall
But they got my ass tied up behind this wall
So the homies can't ride up
Known killer in fact I killed the most
At random though some of them I planned 'em
Fuck it, I kicked your bucket for you, floor you
Got more guns if there's more of ya
War with the cops no prob 
They shouldn't took the job
Blow holes throught they heads like donuts
Grown-ups, kids and girls
Gather round and get gunned down
I do it for the fun of it, adrenaline rush
Coked up quick to bust 
Plus I love my dust
Gun son, watch the blood run son
I'm on one, muthafuckas
But check it this time I'll be the one dissected
I can't wait to feel the heat when lead and flesh meets
Bitter sweet baby, I been waiting for this
Go straight to hell kick it with the rest of my clique
Fuck a blindfold I want to look 'em deep in they eyes
So they can see the fool's face of a dog as he dies
Plus I want to see the muthafuckas squeeze
I got a hot date with my soul mate
Bust I can't wait

I used to walk in stores and yell: ""Lay down!""
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back

Se tu non ci sei più, se tu non ci sei più

E vi saluto a tutti e salto su
Prendo il treno e non ci penso più

Se non in volo
Senza fermate nè confini
Solo orizzonti neanche troppo lontani

Mi dirai destinazione paradiso

But their attack would be repelled
And though the center batteed
The Anglo-Dutch line would be held

And army moves in from the east

Would soon spell his defeat

Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five but I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide and with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed but I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around I will always be around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide and when I reach the other side
I will find a place to rest my spirit if I can perhaps I may become a highwayman again

So tell me where are you now
Now you know the way it feels
Was always easy for you
They never let you down before
I saw you turning to go
I saw you walk away from me

I don't have to play your game

Now you listen to me 'cause I'm
Standing on the outside
Watching it all come down on you
I've got to break these chains
No you never could hold me down
I've got to break these chains
It doesn't matter to me
Now I can leave it all behind
Well it's the anger in me
You put the anger in me
And I remember a time
You know it's not so long ago
I
Was always on the other side
And I knew there must be more
Hearing all your empty words
Your promises but now
I'm standing on the outside
Watching it all come down on you

'Cause I've loved you so long 
And my love is so strong 
But you know a certain party's missing 

I'll sit by the window 
Now you sit anywhere that you want to 
Sitting in the sunshine now we're hoping, 
As we're supposed to do 

If I get down on my knees 
Would you forgive me, please 
It's only that my heart is aching 
And it's all over you not a thing 

I can do little pieces of my world are falling,

The others are sleeping, there's always tomorrow""

You wander alone
On your way down the same old road
Stand at the corner
Watch as the world goes by
Living on the outside you don't understand them
There's something that tells you
It isn't meant to be this way
Out in the wasteland
You have to face another day
Are you living in heaven or hell
Going over the line
On the limit and standing alone
Going over the line
Are you living in heaven or hell
Going over the line
Are you living in heaven or hell
Going over the line
On the limit and standing alone
Going over the line
You gaze out the window
Faces that pass by
Like yesterday's papers
The words have no meaning but
Is it any wonder that you look and don't see them
There's something that tells you
It isn't meant to be this way
Out in the wasteland
You have to face another day

On the open plains, where the river runs dry

And a hot wind blows over sacred ground

And a new day brekas
On the mountainside
Reaching out, reaching out
Over the great divide
It?s a long, long road
Stretching out ahead
Step by step, step by step
Over the great divide

On a dead end street in a border town
Where the stray dog sleeps in the midday sun
Now the headline news is old and worn
The pages stained with blood and rain,
And cheap red wine

And his skin is black
The last of his tribe
And he turns his back, turns his back
On the great divide
And a new day breaks
On the mountainside
Reaching out, reaching out
Over the great divide

Solid rock and burning sand
Weathered by the hand of time
Standing high above the storm
Cutting deep against the grain
And the years have come and gone
Leaving all their scars behind
Where the hills begin to climb
there's a legend carved in stone

And a new day breaks
On the mountainside
Reaching out, reaching out
Over the great divide
It?s a long, long road
Stretching out ahead
Step by step, step by step
Over the great divide
And his skin is black

And he turns his back, turns his back

Everyday through all frustration and despair
Love and hate fight with burning hearts
'til legends live and man is god again

The templars and the saracens

Opening telegrams
Torture comes and torture goes

They bear the cross of coeuf de leon
Salvation for the mirror blind
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan

We caked out; we all got cars so when we wake up in the mornin'
We race out; but first blow the place out
It gets outrageous; to all my thug n****s - throw your sets up
And spit y'all razors
I hop in to spin out; I'm the opposite of H2O
So in the year two thousand, the lights would a never went out
Plus I rock ice, it drips on my boot; I shake it off
'Cause I'm fire, so every few seconds I take it off
I'm lightweight; I let y'all throw them dumbbells
I just throw back them dumb dumb shells to make y'all run well
I shoot dummies, blast backs
Money ga**ed up while I'm a open this tank
Yo, pa** me the shank
I blackout, swipe 'em like a credit card till I max out
And that's just to let y'all know that Drag is back now

[Chorus x 2]
Now all my motherf***in' peoples say yeah, yeah
Now all my motherf***in' thugs say yeah, yeah
Now all my motherf***in' ladies say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, throw your hands in the air, c'mon

Y'all keep pushin' that whack s*** out there; y'all unable
Drag's like jumper cables, negative and a positive
Y'all ain't gon' feel s*** till y'all get a lot of this
I don't care about y'all hatin' n****s; my moms is part of this
She looks at herself and says I got all this
'Cause I drop them hits that make y'all chumps don't drop s***
Drag straps up when he get up in his women
Put somethin' long in the booty have 'em switchin' different
I snatch n****s wife to show 'em the light
Give 'em dick, then I'm hittin' the switch
And while she snorin', she don't know I'm gone by the mornin'
Back to the corner till that blue van come up; my hands is cuffed, uh
Whose fingers stay numb from rollin' up
Who finger f***s chicks till they throwin' up
Whose fingerprints cops keep showin' up
'Cause who that kid always ride and is throwin' truck

[Chorus x 2]

Yo, yo, I just take a strong pull and strike the match on n****s
I spit lit candles and drop hot wax on n****s
My middle name Jason
That means I'm capable of throwin' a ma** on and axe n****s
Y'all better ask n****s
First name: Mel 
I mean that's what them checks say
When they come in the mail, make bank tellers cum on they self
Count it fast, ma; we all professionals here
How's it feel knowin' I'm walkin' outta here
With what you get in a year?
I'm rude to a b****, but y'all n****s get out the street
Act like you don't see this black jeep, and get some flat feet
Y'all rock gators; we straight problems
We rock our Timbs half O's, laces like our dogs got 'em
F*** it, for two minutes, let 'em play wit' a new pair
I got enough spares to flood the block with footwear
Pockets like a blimp; s***, it's been a good year
Where my Ruff Ryders? 
We still in here

Holla at me, yo, yo, ice water, yo, yo, yo, yo

Fuck a hole, my bullets'll dig a ditch in a nigga
Listen, I've been reppin', only pack big weapons
One shot to the stomach, you missin' ya midsection

I'm off the wall, dog, I could off ya balls
Stick his ass to the rooftop, toss 'em off
Hit the ave with the rooftop off the porch
I get money 'cause it costs to floss, nigga you feelin' me?

And if not then fuck what you gotta deal with me
I'm only here for a minute but haters wanna get rid of me

Eh yo the cards are dealt, the words are spoken
Nigga, welcome to the hell, the gates is open
Gatekeeper, first degree murder through the speaker
Who deep enough to flow with the reaper?

Stuck in the middle, I spit a little riddle
Leavin' niggas crippled, my niggas ball 'em like Kerry Kittles
You niggas makin' it hard, it's really kinda simple
If a nigga gotta pull it out I'm puttin' it in ya temple

I use the rugers to keep the bullets movin' through ya
Weak anatomy, fuck the small talk and flattery
Ya power is weak, to beef you need much more batteries

Keep it genetic, or dead it, ice water inc we said it

Fake it or front it, get ambushed and confronted
With slugs in ya head, back, chest and stomach

Ich + Ich,"Ich hab gehört wenn man ganz lange sucht findet man genau das Buch in dem die Antwort steht,
ich hab gehört es gibt da eine Karte auf der steht immer wie es weiter geht,
ich hab gehört I'm gesamten Universum erklingt der absolut stille Akkord,
ich hab gehört man kann einen Menschen retten nur mit einem Wort.

Ich hab gehört, dass do mich noch liebst
und meinen Namen nennst,
dass dein Herz noch für mich schlägt
und do immernoch an mich denkst.
Ich hab gehört dass do mich noch liebst,
dass do mich nicht vergessen kannst.
Dass do glücklich bist stimmt vielleicht nicht ganz.

Ich hab gehört wir sollen uns nicht beeilen, die ersten werden die letzten sein,
und wenn man jemand ganz lange Zeit nicht berührt wird, verwandelt er sich zu Stein.
Ich hab gehört wenn man sich anstrengt kriegt man einfach alles, jeder ist seines Glückes Schmied,
ich hab gehört das Schicksal ist erblindet, denn es erkennt keinen Unterschied.

Ich hab gehört, dass do mich noch liebst
und meinen Namen nennst,
dass dein Herz noch für mich schlägt
und do immernoch an mich denkst.
Ich hab gehört dass do mich noch liebst,
dass do mich nicht vergessen kannst.
Dass do glücklich bist stimmt vielleicht nicht ganz.

Isses wahr oder nur ein Gerücht,
ist es wahr oder stimmt es nicht,
ist es Phantasie pur?
Kann es überhaupt möglich sein,
wird denn Wasser zu Wein,
oder wünsch ich es nur?

Sees the sun going down

Burning with the hope of insight
Feathered, look they're covered with a bright elation

Take us forever, a whisper to a scream

Broken at the bitter end
Wasted sacrificed for a new nirvana
Nighttime sends us on our way

As the lily-pads drift softly through a night
In the musty halls, where invention calls
With the voice of indecision filling fright

Give it, take it, as the dragonfly flies

We found a way
To tie a bond between our hearts
In the open field should there we lay

Found a sharp stone, found a big tree
Found a clear space in the bark
Laughing louder chance a fine thing
Moving slowly off the mark

Out of season given reason
Could we see inclement weather?

Will you want me as I want you as you are?
The autumn is the finest time, the finest of them all
Will you need me as I need you as I did?
As I always should've done, tell me when we're there

Not too long and not too far
My dreams and I were wondering
If we harbor, if we labor
Sweet the fruit that fortune brings

Who will help us through these cold years?
Could I glimpse a rising sun?

Will you want me as I want you as you are?
The autumn is the finest time, the finest of them all
Will you need me as I need you as I did?
As I always should've done, tell me when we're there

Will you love me as I love you constantly?
Wasted in the downpour
Whatever we believe, whatever we believe

Take them under, take them over
Crack the bullwhip, chop the tree

Icicle Works,"(McNabb)

It rolls in like a cold wind,
It fills me up with fear,
The icy fingers clutch me,
With each motion that I hear,
Though dilligence caress me,
Deliverence unfold,
The distant bells are ringing,
In a small town in my soul

Chorus: Dream up, dream up,
Let me fill your cup,
I promise you the world
I promise you the world,
I'll love you as a factory in the desert

While trying to obsess me,
Her confidence falls down,
I hav to steal this moment to,
Observe her wistful frown,
But her logic is a jungle,
Insecurity roams wild,
The laughter's ever present,
In the camp of the beguiled.

Repeat Chorus

Come to me, come to me, come to me,

With confidence, how could we fail,
Fingers can pass through fire,
And somehow not get burned,
Hang your hopes upon, all you've learned,

Will I use your lines for guidance,
Will I subsequently fumble,
Through the reasons to be gained,
Bind me up with promises, lend me to the wisdom of your ways,
Will you find it in yourself,

With wisdom worn,
And it was here,

Spend my time running around this town
Don't know if I'm up or down
Turning my back on another blue day
Fifteen dreamers off to see the world
One by one they all return
Its hard to know just what they're after

When sweet Thursday comes
All you know will have changed
The rains will pour down
On the heartache you've found
May you never be lonely again

At twenty-four you thought you'd have it all
Now your will won't work at all
Ten years pass you by so quickly
When all your friends have left you standing still
And you can't recall the thrill
Of being wanted by another

When sweet Thursday comes
You receive what you're owed
We're tired of chasing rainbows
That fall short of reach
We can touch them when sweet Thursday comes

You're not the same girl that I used to know
Are you dying inside from this endless waiting game?

I'll make my weary way home
To the promise of your kiss

As to what can happen when you lose

You get somewhere to find that it's behind you
Leave your dreams where they are
They last a while that way
Save wasted time
Spend it

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

I'm so lonely I could cry.

Ida,"Summer snapped in half and half flippin' coffee creamers
Twenty times, that's a good sign, like a four-leaf clover
Downtown was filled with the sounds of the full and the part time losers
And when we stepped up to the bar, you asked for a cigarette 
And the years just melted away right then
And I saw all the ways that we've changed and the decisions that we made
And I wasn't hurt or afraid

Some gifts go unrequited

Smashing up a bottle
Trying to be Rudie
In a tourist town

We were so aimless
But so filled with purpose
And I got so nervous
On your wedding day

It's great to see you now
To see your eyes
You know that they're

To be the first one to notice the dawn
Don't give it the weight 
When you're so far out of it
You're so far out of it

Lighting up the night sky
Flicker in your eye
Ladybugs crawl across your hand
In plain sight, broad daylight
I don't mind

But in the dark
Invisible and beautiful

They're back again

Am I still the one you wanted me to be ?
When we were talking
Did I hear you say
That you still love me

Would you still look right through me then
What if you could make another life
(What if you could make another life)
Would you still have me by your side

Everything was clear I wanted you to see
But don't answer with a word
Only with your eyes

Ida,"After you gave up on the world
For the first time I understood
Your words were as good to me as gold
But it's all getting old already

I care about what you see
Even though you try to take the best of me apart
And punish me for trying

I watched you hit the ground
With the luckiest smile around
With your stupid guile and your chain
I couldn't have missed you hailing cabs in the rain

I care about what you see
Even though you try to take the best of me apart
And punish me trying

Everyday the nausea hits you
You face the mirror
Wonder if you'll ever get out of here
We'll never get past the past
Staring a hole through the bottom of a dirty shot glass
I listen well to your rage
And search your face for a spark
For something shimmering in the dark",Past the Past,2000
Ida,"What is this weariness that waits for you?
Shrug
You press your ankle against my arm
This is the pressure that I love
You always recommended it

It could be the door
Could be the phone
For any intent or purpose
You're not home

You're up against the wall
No real impression like breath on glass

I've got the apple in me too
People are bluer than they ever imagined they might be
Looking through the boxes in the basement
Who were you then?

Your restlessness is emptier than the room we used to lived in
Here's wishing you the best
The rest is always better left unsaid",Shrug,2000
Ida,"Did we give away too much or was it right?
I just wanna go back home and hold you tight
I can't face another crowd and feel this way
Oh no, oh no

I'm falling into every little trap that I can find
Reading too much into every single sign
I can't face you with the others all around
Oh no, oh no
I need some time to breathe
I can't fix what's wrong

Well the world I see is only two lanes wide
From this midnight van to Georgia that we ride
And the toll booths become markers of the time
Oh no, oh no

We come and go so fast
Looking for what lasts",Triptych,2000
Ida,"Fixing an eye on the hopeful
In a heartless room you'll be done soon
The snow is falling down
And the whole damn town is covered with white
It's obvious that trust is the catch and the magnet
That could pull you through this braille night
Where nothing's free and you just can't see
How to sacrifice what you need to be

You can't shake this silence still
In your heart you're just not there
You're a thousand miles from here
You just want to disappear

Winter went out with a whimper
Such a lonely sound to try to get around
Imagine yourself as a little kid
In your parents arms and then it's gone
You step to the mic almost petrified
'cause everything you feel is in your eyes
You cannot hide but you're haunted
By the early frost
By the ones you've lost

Beauty shines so bright
Vanishes from sight
Wrap yourself in the night
Love with all your might

You can't shake this silence still
In your heart you're just not there
You're a thousand miles from here
You just want to disappear
You're a thousand miles away
You're a thousand miles away
You're a thousand miles away
You're a thousand miles away",Blizzard of '78,2001
Ida,"You wake to the sound of the night crashing down
Sucked out of dream
Face to face with your makers
And the facts of a fall
And your faith seems so small

There's an ocean of glass
And you're moving above it
Stretching out in the sky
And your body is weightless
You're an acrobat
No one can deny it
Now we have to try to do all we can
To find you

You know that he's gone with the sun through your window
Everyday is a world that you'd never choose to visit
No one wants to cry or say their goodbyes
Looking in dreams for you
Looking in dreams for you",Ocean of Glass,2001

Ida Corr,"Early morn 7 9, I was born on time
Mama singing my my side
Daddy there standing by
Took a while for I to see
Exactly what your giving me
Now that I'm woman grown making
Heads turn on my own

And nobody's gonna bring me down
Ain't nobody who can touch me now
'cause nobody else has got what I've got
Nobody else gonna make it this hot
My words, my rhythm, have you heard what I'm giving

Uh uh you on the dancefloor
Can you ride on my tempo
Uh uh you in the yard
Are we making you sweat
Uh uh up on the pavement
Are you feeling this tempo
Uh uh it ain't hard
We gonna ride it trough the night

So now your feeling my style
Is breaking down for a while
We got you running for miles and I'll tell you why
Taking you for a trip so let you back bone slip
Lick your lip double dip baby moove your hip
Wanna take you away
From the pain let me say everyday
Ain't the same as yesterday
'cause life is gritty and dark in the city
Uh ah what a pitty
Better leave I all behind

Chorus and nobody...

Uh uh...

Ida Corr,"I ain't gonna be your baby

knowing what I just know about you (about you)
You go from everything to nothing

within a second not a minutes gone by
Promises of a twosome future

when I know tomorrow won't last no
You say that love is kinda endless

so why not share love with any girl there

I don't want nobody baby

who can't see the light in me
I can be the sweetest lady

if you treat me how I should be
Ohh ohh you are all I need a man to be
If only you'd be loving all of me

Weeks and weeks are being wasted

only waiting for that glories day
You can love me how I want it we'll fit

togetherness in every way
But infinity's a long way I'm not sure

I'll make it can't take it
I'll just end up breaking
Uh but for now you have me hoping

'cause you promised you'd come by this Saturday

I don't want nobody baby

who can't see the light in me
I can be the sweetest lady

if you treat me how I should be
Ohh ohh you are all I need a man to be
If only you'd be loving all of me

My heart is breaking (my heart is breaking)

into thousand pieces
'cause I know that it's a known fact

you are the best thing I never had

I don't want nobody baby

who can't see the light in me
I can be the sweetest lady

Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love

Love is pure gold and time a thief

Could this be a dream or is it real tonight 
Tell me why  oh why

With another man, I don't understand 
I saw you holding his hand 

Repeat 1 

I remember the first time that I laid eyes on you 
You were the only one for me, I thought I knew 
Now my heart is filled with pain

Garde tes amis près de toi et tes ennemis encore plus près
Je t'ai tendu la main, t'as voulu me bouffer le bras
D'abord m'as infiltré puis infecté, brisé ma famiglia
J'aurais un chien, il ne porterait même pas ton nom
Car le chien est plus fidèle au maître que tu ne l'es à tes opinions
Te comparer à moi est ton passe-temps préféré
J'en suis désolé, tu finiras par devenir cinglé

Idina Menzel,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door

Let it go (go, go, go go, go go, go go, go, go, go go)

Let it go

Let it go

Let it go

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day

Idina Menzel,"It's true you sold your guitar and bought a car?
It's true, I'm leaving now for Santa Fe
It's true, you're with this yuppie scum?
You said you'd never speak to him again

Not now
Who said that you have any say in who she says things to at all?
Yeah
Who said that you should stick your nose in other people's
Who said I was talking to you?
We used to have this fight each night (calm down)
She'd never admit I existed (everyone please)

He was the same way
He was always, run away, hit the road, don't commit
You're full of shit

She's in denial (He's in denial)
Don't give an inch
When I gave a mile (come on)
I gave a mile
Gave a mile to who?
Come on guys, chill

I'd be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had
Someone to live for, unafraid to say I love you
All your words are nice, Mimi
But love's not a three way street
You'll never share real love
Until you love yourself, I should know
You all said you'd be cool today
So please, for my sake

I can't believe he's gone
I can't believe you're going
I can't believe this family must die
Angel helped us believe in love
I can't believe you disagree
I can't believe this is goodbye

I hear there are great restaurants out west
Some of the best, how could she?
How could you let her go?
You just don't know
How could we lose Angel?
Maybe you'll see why when you stop escaping your pain

At least now if you try, Angel's death won't be in vain
His death is in vain
Are you insane?
There's so much to care about

There's me, there's Mimi
Mimi's got her baggage too
So do you
Who are you to tell me what I know
What to do
A friend

But who, Mark, are you?
Mark has got his work
They say, ""Mark lives for his work""
And, ""Mark's in love with his work""
Mark hides in his work

But from what?
From facing your failure
Facing your loneliness
Facing the fact that you live a lie

Yes, you live a lie, tell you why
You're always preaching not to be numb
When that's how you thrive
You pretend to create and observe
When you really detach from feeling alive
Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive
Poor baby

Mimi still loves you
Are you really jealous
Or afraid that Mimi's weak?
Mimi did look pale
Mimi's gotten thin
Mimi's running out of time

And you're running out the door
No more, I've gotta go
Hey, for somebody who's always been let down who's heading out of town?
For someone who longs for a community of his own
Who's with his camera, alone?
I'll call, I hate the fall
You heard?
Every word

You don't want baggage without lifetime guarantees
You don't want to watch me die?
I just came to say goodbye love
Goodbye love

Came to say goodbye love, goodbye
Just came to say goodbye love (glory) 
Goodbye love (one blaze of)
Goodbye love
I have to find

Please don't touch me, understand
I'm scared, I need to go away
I know a place, a clinic
A rehab?
Maybe, could you?

Like to have maybe two

They can be antisocial just like us and 
They can choose their very own religion 
They can climb into bed in the 
Middle of the night and 
Sleep in your arms, as if hypnotized

Alright,
Everything's gonna be alright 
So if all the things we want 
Are just out of reach

I'm pretty sure we'll be okay

Idina Menzel,"Well I don't believe in god 
But she talks to me all the time 
And I banish my mother 
But she holds me when I cry 
And I have been unfaithful but 
With me he'll spend the rest of his life 
Yes I have been forgiven 
By all whom I've betrayed and loved 
And I have everything I want 
Is it ever enough?

Still I can't be still 
Still I can't be silent 
Still I can't be still 
Still I can't be saved 
Still I can't be still 
I can't be silent 
Still I, still 
 
Well I don't believe I'm beautiful but 
At least I've got my sister's smile 
And I resist the muses yet 
They sing to me in exile 
And destiny is not deafening 
But it hushed me like a child 
And every time I feel as though 
I'm closer to the eye 
The storm winds blow 
I run inside, and though I feel revived- 
 
[Chorus]
 
The insatiable peace 
Of my quest for true serenity 
No matter how hard the rain 
The thirst is never ending 
No matter how many friends 
Or angels been sent down to take me away 
They can't make it okay 
And every time I feel as though I'm 
Closer to the eye 
The storm winds blow 
I run inside, and though I feel revived- 
Yes every time I feel as though I'm 
Closer to the eye 
The storm winds blow 
I run inside, and though I feel revived-

Idina Menzel,"I wonder if you sleep right now 
Do you realize I'm clinging to 
The edge of this bed I have 
Nowhere to go, I have nowhere 

If I leave, you'll call me quitter 
If I stay, you'll punish me with silence and somehow 
You'll fall asleep... You'll fall asleep 

[Chorus:]
Well do you know that I won't sleep, 
No I won't sleep all night long 
As your silhouette turns its back on my spoon 
I'm mesmerized by the ricochet moon 
Leaping this leprechaun's (Rumplestiltskin's) wall 

I'm so disenchanting 
Intoxicated by my own tear's soul 
And come tomorrow 
When my beauty is old 
Like a speckled princess 
I'll try to cash in clovers for gold 
So I'll light a candle and begin to 
Write, turn to my work as refuge 

Though my womb is a rush hour taxi 
Ride, but I will try 
To metamorphose pain along my plight 
But I'll despise each word I write 
So I am clinging to the 
Edge, like some soap-opera star 
With her ten second fade 
As the light cascades 
Do you love me anymore? 

[Chorus]
 
I'll try to spin straw into gold 
Straw into gold... Straw into gold... Straw into gold 
Spinning for mercy 
Spinning for hope 
Spinning for love 
Spinning for gold",Straw into Gold,1998
Idina Menzel,"Do you think about the moon? 
Made you feel real special 'cause 
It followed you everywhere 
Do you think about the sun showers? 
The way you like to run naked in them and 
Shampoo your hair 
Do you think about why we sneeze in the sun? 
Wish my freckles would just leave us alone 
Do you think about when you're older 
Will they make a Sunday night movie 
About your life? 
You think you got tattoos 
Your grandkids are gonna like? 

[Chorus:]
Well is your cup half empty? 
Is your cup half full? 
Whatcha gonna be 
When you grow up? 
Are you a gym teacher, 
Rock star, or superhero 
In a major motion picture 
Action feature, creature? 
Over and over figure it out 
Maybe today we'll find the message in the clouds 
Maybe tomorrow we'll crush a 
Nickel on a railroad track 
Time is running out, I think I think too much 

Do you think about the guy 
That you first kissed? 
Yeah his tongue went in circles 
Practically missed your lips 
Do you think he's now the world's greatest lover? 
Or sitting at home 
Watching CNN on TNT or TV? 
Do you think about your past life? 
Were you a countess, or 
A vagabond or James Bond or 
Yeah, but bisexual 
Do you think I should care what you think? 

[Chorus]

Do you think about all the books 
You haven't read? 
Are you a street smart cat 
Or are you just an intellect? 
Do you think about this now,
The girl who made you miserable 
In junior high, made you cry? 
Do you thinks she's smoking 
Like five packs of cigarettes a day 
And going to therapy... 
Wait I wasn't finished 

[Chorus]

Do you think it's normal 
For white people to wear dreadlocks? 
Are you a barefoot earthling 
Or a hermit in socks 
Guys in tuxedos are 
Kind of deceiving 
But you know, you see them in the park, jogging along 
It's a little more revealing 

Do you think about your funeral? 
If you died how many people 
Are gonna show up? 
Do you think we're capable of change 
Or we're just gonna, oh screw up our children? 
Do you think about fires,
Who do you rescue first 
Your kids or your sleeping husband?",Think Too Much,1998
Idina Menzel,"Who needs money? Not me
Who needs fortune or fame?
I don't need a new career
A sympathetic ear, a name

All I need is time to play
Only want the game
Point me to the Mike
I know what I like

Don't you wanna be, the life of the party?
Don't you wanna be, the cream of the crop?
Don't you wanna feel those shivering hits
'Til someone calls it quits or someone calls a cop?

Don't you wanna land the role of a lifetime?
Well, you better get down on one knee
'Cause you could play the life of the party
If you can pray with me

Who needs lovers? Not I
Who needs heaven above?
Don't have time for things unsaid
For baking bread for love

All I need is room to fight
Hand in fisted glove
Point me to the sky
It's my turn to fly

Don't you wanna be, the life of the party?
Don't you wanna be, the top of the heap?
This is where the jamboree never ends
Why not be counting friends instead of counting sheep?

If you wanna join, the heavenly choir
Hurry up and get yourself in line
But don't you pass the life of the party
Until you pass the wine

Let the drinks pour
Let the crowds roar
Let the Heavens wildly cheer

'Til the sunrise
Brings the goodbyes
I'll be here
Never fear

Who's it gonna be, the life of the party?
Who's it gonna be, the king of the hill?
Don't you wanna be there, running the show
Until it's time to go or 'til it's time to kill?

Don't you ever wanna be, somebody to envy
Don't you wanna be, footloose and free?
Well, you could be the life of the party
If you were more like me

To the land of what-might-have-been

Idina Menzel,"Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
From wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back, I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments, who can tell?
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know, I know him well

Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back, I could have played it differently
Learned about the man before I fell
But I was ever so much younger then

Wasn't it good (oh so good), 
Wasn't it fine (so fine)
Isn't it madness he can't be mine

Didn't I know how it would go
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart

Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
It took some to understand him
Hoo ooh I know him so well",I Know Him So Well,2009
Idina Menzel,"This is the one situation
I wanted most to avoid
Nothing I say will convince him
This isn't a trick.

A drink on clear moonlit night
I relax, she smiles,
There's something peculiar
Going on.

So through no fault of my own
I'm stuck here to carry the can.
Embarrassed, uncertain, marooned.

Now she can't be working for them
I mean us
She seems to know what she's doing,
But where is he?

He has to turn up,
He wanted this meeting,
Didn't he?

Maybe he's scared,
But he didn't seem scared
In the game.

Oh, I just couldn't care less.
He can go right ahead,
Go and wreck his career,
I know I've done my best.

Well, at least
She's a good looking spy.

What if my Russian friend
Thinks that my plans
Are more of an intimate kind?
If I don't say something
And soon
He'll go.
Maybe I'm on nobody's side!

Listen, I hate to break up the mood.
Get to the point,
Begin the beguine.
Haven't you noticed
We are a protagonist short,
In this idyllic,
Well-produced scene?

He couldn't wait
To join you up here.
Maybe he walked
Cable cars scare him.

Never mind him,
I haven't missed him so far.

Maybe it won't do any harm
To struggle on without his charm.
Funny how all at one I feel
That he can go jump off the mountain
I won't care!

This is the one situation
I wanted most to avoid.

My dear opponent
I really can't imagine why.

So I am not dangerous then?
What a shame.

No, you're not dangerous.			
Who could think that of you?	
You	

You are so strange.
Why can't you be
What you want to be?
You should be scheming,
Intriguing,
Too clever by half!

I have to hand it to you
For you've managed
To make me forget
Why I ever agreed on this farce.			
I don't know why
Know why					

I can't think of anything
I would rather do
Than be wasting my time
On mountains with you.

Who'd ever think it?
Such a very pretty setting.
Tell me what's the betting,
Very pretty plotting, too.
No matter
I've done all your work for you.

Freddie.

Who'd ever guess it?
Daughter in collaboration
With the very nation
Gave her father third degree.
Where's Daddy, dead,
Or in the KGB?

While my second has been curling up with my
Opponent, I have agreed to new terms with
Global Television, which in short means more money
For you as well, but that can't be helped. Therefore,
This meeting is unnecessary. The match can continue
And we don't have to be friends.",Mountain Duet,2009
Idina Menzel,"This is an all too familiar scene.

Life imperceptibly coming between.

Those whose love is as strong as it could or should be.

Nothing has altered 

Yet everything's changed.

No one stands still 

Still I love you completely
And hope I always will.
Each day we get through
Means one less mistake
Left for the making.

And there's no return
As we slowly learn
Of the chances we're taking.

I'd give the world
To stay just as we are
It's better by far
Not to be too wise

Not to realize
Where there's truth
There will be lies.

You and I,
We've seen it all
Been down this road before,
Yet we go on believing.

You

You

And I,
We've seen it all
Chasing our hearts' desire,
Yet I still think I'm certain
This time it will be
My happy ending.

Thank you. It's from Molokov You were right.

Idina Menzel,"In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat

Someone keeps saying, I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps
And burning' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Banned all the music with a phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag

With the re-run shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
I slap the turkey neck and it's hanging' from a pigeon wing

You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax, falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy, soy, soy

I'm a driver, I'm the winner
Things are gonna change, I can feel it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
