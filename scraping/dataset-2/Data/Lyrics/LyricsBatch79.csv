Conte Candoli,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

To the eyes of Dinah Lee!

Conte Candoli,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Conte Candoli Quintet,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight

I'd give my soul just to call you my own

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet

Contemporary Gospel Chorus,"I've seen the lightning flashing and heard the thunder roll
I've felt sin's breakers dashing, my trying to conquer my soul
I've heard the voice of Jesus when telling me to fight on

He promised never to leave me, no, never alone
Never alone, never alone, oh, never
Never alone, never alone
He'll never leave you alone

The world's fierce winds are blowing, temptations sharp and keen
I felt a peace in knowing my Savior stands between
He stands to shield me from danger when earthly friends are gone

Never alone, never alone, oh, never
Never alone, never alone

Continental Drifters,"Daddy was the eldest of ten
And my mama was an only child
She must've represented back then
The part of him that couldn't go wild
She was free
Something he could never be
'Cause daddy was the one
Who always took responsibility.

They met at a USO dance hall
At the start of the Second World War
She was gentle, kind and intelligent
Something daddy'd never known before
And they danced
Later on came the romance
'Cause daddy shipped out
Before he had the chance to ask for her hand.

But it all turned out all right
And he would lay in his hammock at night
Dreaming of a family and home
With the woman that he left behind
At night, his shipmates would go check out the bars
But daddy'd just stare at the stars
And dream of her
'Til he thought he might lose his mind.

They got married on V.E. Day
By the preacher from my mama's church
Mama'd always dreamed of a honeymoon
But daddy had to go back to work
He plowed those fields
Since the Navy never tought him a trade
Mama'd make his lunch
And they'd eat it out in the shade.


The boys were born in the fifties
Georgie, Herman and me
And we grew up wanting for nothing
'Til Georgie saw his first TV
It was the Christmas of 1959
There was a console in the living room
Well, mama and the boys watched variety shows
And daddy just stared out at the moon.

The drought hit hard in the sixties
And the irrigation couldn't control
Mama sighed when they sold the farm
But daddy lost a piece of his soul
He said ""Hard work is a virtue
And you should always work as hard as you can""
He said ""Hard work will never hurt you""
But he never said nothing about the land.

Yeah, but mama always told us boys
""You should follow the Golden Rule
Always look for the good in the other guy
But never be anyone's fool""
Then daddy'd laugh a little
Then he'd look out at his weather vane
Oh mama wants a rainbow
Daddy just wants it to rain.

They moved in with Herman's family
In the nice part of the city
Mama'd help Gina with the grandchildren
And tried to make the house look pretty
But daddy'd sit at his window
From when he got up 'til he went to bed
Just knowing that he'd failed his family
He couldn't get it out of his head.

It was the summer of 1978
When mama caught pneumonia and died
Daddy lost his will to live that fall
Now they're buried side by side
And in the midst of all our grief
Georgie said to our relief
""Well, mama got her rainbow
And it's starting to rain"".

He said ""Mama got her rainbow
And it's starting to rain"".

And it's starting to rain
It's starting to rain
It's starting to rain
It's starting to rain
It's starting to rain.

This heart needs a home
To keep it from stumbling
Out in the street
To keep it from suffering
A night without sleep
To keep it from dying.

Just a home with a room
To keep out the lightening
When it's thundering down
And the words grab the anger
And come dancing around
This shattered foundation.

When I close my eyes
I dream through the night
I dream I'm an angel just learning to fly
Brought up by the winds
And I'm taught by the clouds
When I open my eyes
I'm still on the ground.

This heart needs a home.

Hell, when I close my eyes
I dream through the night
I dream I'm an angel just learning to fly
Brought up by the winds
And I'm taught by the clouds
When I open my eyes
I'm still on the ground.

To keep it from stumbling
Out in the street
To keep it from suffering
A night without sleeping
To keep it from dying.

These wounds won't keep us down, we'll fight and we'll crawl because this grave was dug for you // You're the one that put me here // Left me in this case with fear // You dig these graves to get what you want.

Continuum,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

And I won't give up this dream 
Of life that keeps me alive 
I gotta be me, I gotta be me 
The dream that I see makes me what I am 

That far away prize, a world of success 
Is waiting for me if I heed the call 
I won't settle down, won't settle for less 
As long as there's a chance that I can have it all 

I'll go it alone, that's how it must be

Control,"Acaba de una vez con esta historia
A puntéame directo al corazón
Dispara fríamente a quema ropa
Te juro que me haces un favor

Después de ti no existe nada nuevo
Si todo cuanto tuve te lo di
Queriendo con tú amor tocar el cielo
Resulta que el infierno me gane

Y sólo porque tú
Me cambiaste por unas monedas
Y sólo porque tú
No supiste soportar mi pobreza

Y sólo porque tú
Te vendiste por unas monedas
Y sólo porque tú
No supiste soportar mi pobreza

Pensándolo mejor, porque morirme
Realmente cuanto puedes merecer
Si tú te mueves sólo por dinero
Quizás mañana vuelvas otra vez

Y tampoco me a me avergüenzo yo de mi galán

Me saca como reina

Lo que importa es que voy con él
Tampoco será el más guapo
Pero sí es mi novio fiel

Te extraño en futuro, presente why pasado
Te extraño en la tarde why te extraño temprano
Talvez no rima, pero te necesito
Es que realmente me has convertido en la otra mitad
De mi vida, olvida tus heridas why cúrame esta herida
He venido a suplicarte que tomes mis manos
Que me abrases muy fuerte why me digas te amo
Porque yo soy tu dueno aunque quieras negarlo
Aunque te aya perdido why no estés a mi lado
Que no me eches al olvido que extraño tu cuerpo
Cuando estoy dormido, cuando estoy despierto
Why cada mañana que ya no te tengo, me miro al espejo
Why me estoy muriendo, por que no estas aquí???

Tengo negativos de dias positivos
Al verte sonriendo en mis fotografias
Sino no lo recuerdas, tu vida era mia
Es que vivir sin tu presencia es querer
Esperar bajo en agua, si tu no estas conmigo
El aire se me acaba

Que me abrases muy fuerte why me digas te amo
Porque yo soy tu dueno aunque quieras negarlo
Aunque te aya perdido why no estés a mi lado
Que no me eches al olvido que extraño tu cuerpo
Cuando estoy dormido, cuando estoy despierto

Why me estoy muriendo, why es que no puedo

Porque si tu no estas no quiero respirar
Why hoy he venido a arrodillármele a tu amor
Why si no vuelves tú ya nada será igual

Control Denied,"Do you believe what some might say can't be could be reality
Let seven be the one for me; six chapters of life laced with mystery
Awaiting discovery

Immune you become a war to be won the soul of a voice
Let the voice of the soul be free

For most it does not come easily
For some it comes with pain
From a thought to a living sight
For some it's a life for some a game

There are things in life worth fighting for
And some things are better off let go
A dream secured long ago or yesterday
Close to the top there's no looking down

When you believe

Control Denied,"I saw you, you saw me, you hid your fangs so well
I should have known better but it is hard to tell
In beauty the evil is waiting for possession
Deep inside reflections just a glimpse away

Your faithful servents, they bow to you
Together they're breaking the broken
We were set free, what is to be?
When its all said and done what is left to really say?
To be one turns to none now we are just yesterday

You speak in killing words, the kind that crush and kill
No mercy your pleasure to taste the blood you bled
The chase has ended in denial of glory
To trap and add to your servant souls",Breaking the Broken,1999
Control Denied,"Your face is hiding deep inside my mind
Your touch is on my tongue
Your face is the deepest depths of my eyes
The eyes inside my soul

Once I was free, but now I am trapped
Once I was trapped, but now I am free

I taste the tears you bled
I felt the fears you shed
You thought I did not feel
You thought I could not taste

Consumed, escape through dreams
Consumed, trapped by dreams
Consumed, forever it seems

Do you feel the pain that I feel?
The pain that lives inside
Do you wear the chains that I wear
The ones that rub me raw

Every time the number speaks
And when you see me and you think I am there
You will know that it is just a dream",Consumed,1999

I see your kind, I know your game
Surviving on the soul of a song

Please tell me how you escape
From the guilt that should eat at your mind
When you lay down to sleep
So many precious lives lost
Picking up the shattered dreams broken by you

You'll be cut down to size when we're done with you
When you're cut down to size we will look down on you

Why is life a game where we are forced to play
I think it's safe to assume
Don't feed off a loss or a win
The reward is to survive

And you will save yourself a state of shock
A waiting game, waiting to see
Expect the unexpected

Control Machete,"Verse 1: Pato

Como el humo voy, como el humo vengo
Salgo de la noche, marco el pavimento
why es que sin razón viajo en el tiempo
Pienso why planeo lo que vengo haciendo
Marca en el día, busco la salida
Toma lo que quieras más no la que es mía
Todo es parte de la Grossa familia
Aunque no comprendas, así son mis días

Chorus: x1

Así son mis días...
why es que así son mis días

Verse 2: Pato

(Si ve usted algún pelado parado en la esquina, no lo moleste)
Me la paso armando todo el día
Cortando why pegando sino a la deriva
Terror con la raza paséame Carranza
Da vueltas la cuadra (Hey)
¿Qué es lo que pasa? sabor...
Siempre ando con son
En todo el día no hay ni un bajón
Siempre acudo, arribo, a tiempo admiro
Todo el panorama que hay en un giro
Porque así son mis días complejo María
Agarro el vuelo como si fuera mía
La mira está puesta sobre la mesa
La tarde se presta pa' andar con la mera artillera
why responde con una mentira
Pa' salir del momento why encontrar la salida
Completo termino con cierta paciencia
Así son mis días cuando piso la tierra

Chorus: x1

Verse 3: Pato

Como todo voy, mucho es lo que tengo
Coméis, carnales, todos son mis maestros
why es que nunca soy lo que prefirieron
Soy lo que soy, no lo eligieron
Pasa la vida la sigo sin prisa
Simplemente observo, lo que requería
Pasa mi vida why no es tan vacía
Siento... que más necesitaría
Fue tan bueno hoy como después lo presiento
Fiestas con coméis, barrios why lamentos
(Esto no es bajón, es hasta el firmamento
golpes why golpes why nunca reviento)
Sombra de día, duro hasta arriba
Ando tranquilo, no hay melancolía
Mientras haya cuerda, saco la espina
Sigo con la banda, gastando la esquina

(Yo vivo en la mañana)
Este dolor de cabeza yo no lo traía
Todo me da vueltas pero que tal el tequila
Anoche estuvimos con toda la raza
Cerveza, tequila, volteando algunas jarras
Empezamos buscando una pinche boda
Quien se casaba, sepa la madre hicimos bola
La cheve era gratis, la música repinche
No voy a reclamar, era de grapo esta comadre
Desmadre, hasta que nos corrieron
Nomás porque empezaste a gritarle al mesero
Pasteleros quiero corriendo volando
why este cabrón del carro del lado estaba duro
Estaba ligando a la pinche novia
Si hubiera andado hasta la esquina
Me conseguía una movida
Salimos directo al depo de la esquina
Yo traía las botellas en la droga pero vacías

Cheve cheve cheve cheve
Cheve cheve cheve cheve cheve cheve

Una de la madrugada
Sin cheve, todo está de la chingada
Salimos prendidos directo a la rotonda
Pa' ver si conseguimos mejor vino pa' una ronda
¿Canjeada o prestada? la queremos bien helada
why aunque esté cachonda pero no será comprada
Llegamos al depo, seguro que está abierto
A huevo como es que sacan el dinero
Silencio señores, sacan otra rueda
Hay que hacer un plan para seguirla peda
Unos en la droga quiso papelarnos
Nosotros buscamos una forma para armarnos
Con unos cartones, botellas de tequila
Cigarros, botanas, de libre la salida
Mientras yo distraigo al dueño del depo
Ustedes tranquilos no hagan mucho fuego

Chorus

Una para ti dos para mí 
tres pa' seguir con la cheve hasta el fin (x2)

Verse 3: Fermín IV & Pato

Cuatro de la madrugada 
Bien pedos, todo está bien Alabama
Dime compadre si la cheve me hare daño
Pa' ver si le sigo por lo menos otro año
Tranquilo, sólo te altera la cabeza
Dale otro trago why pasa la cerveza
Todo me da vueltas, parezco marioneta
Me da ganas de mear pero no se me abre la bragueta
Chupando se olvidan los problemas
Se sube con madre a la taberna
Todo se mueve why ya veo doble
La duda que me espera 
No va a ser ningún problema
Mientras tenga mi cheve en la mano
Todo está muy bien no hay pedo mi hermano
Nos vemos carnales yo ya me voy a clavar
why espero que mañana nos juntemos a chupar

Le gusta que la besen unos de color rosado

Sabe ser una putita cuando se lo propone
Arpone toda la raza está extrañada

Ahora si que vienes nomás porque te conviene
Por lana, comida, mi machete no te detiene

Después me contaron, que se la encontraron
En las piernas de una güera allá en el otro lado
Muy buena la güera, como la pantera
La mejor ruquita que había hecho mies vieja
Que se la toparon casi en cualquier antro
Este cuidado se roba el mandado
Le gusta la Josefa, de cualquier cosecha
Sea buena, sea negra ella si que se entrega
La entresega si le encanta en la merienda o en la cena
Para desayunar, solamente una botella
Dicen que la arma que carga su escopeta
Adonde se dirija ella entra por la puerta
Principal o la de atrás no importa que tenga llave
De seguro sabe abrirla ella sabe como le hare

Un cada padre no las hacen como antes
Ahora hay lesbianas why hasta tienen sus aguantes
Anclan el rancho les llaman más churras
Marimachas quizás pero son más chorras
Se ponen pantalón why se salen a los bailes
A ver a quién atrapan a quien no le guste el sable
Pinche Lupita si fue que me rolabas
Como aquí padezco desde que la mataras
Por tu culpa los balazos se arman en cualquier parte 
Porque quieres a las viejas bajarles un faje
Viejas casadas, solteras o divorciadas
No te importa el estado mientras tengas tu bombache
Armas el desmadre pinche Lupita
Cuando le hechas humo a cualquier conchita
Si que te mamaste cuando me dejaste 
Por una pinche vieja que ni me presentaste

Verse 1: Fermín IV
Si crees que se le está acabando el vuelo, no
Esto está comenzando
El danzón ya empezó a tocar (pararara) 
why no ha terminado, no
El paso del tiempo va imponiendo el respeto
why la calidad va mano a mano con la cantidad, viene 
(Viene) viene marcando la pauta why el sentimiento
Mi vida empieza desde adentro
Siempre brota lo que siento
Es verdad lo digo why me comprometo
Responsable soy why lo lamento
Pero creo que es el crecimiento
Por ahora está en el mejor momento
El amanecer siempre aparece corrigiendo al anochecer
why las cosas que se ven nacer
Hay que verlas madurar why crecer

Verse 2: Pato
Viviendo por suerte why clandestinamente
Más no estaba muerto solamente ausente
Si paré de pronto, nunca indiferente
No acabó el danzón why sigue igual que siempre
Si continúa el corazón
Ritmos unidos sobre ilusión
Noche a noche se escucha la voz
Los de tambores, acordes why son

Chorus: (Ruben Albarran from Café Tacvba)
Mandar obedeciendo en el danzón
Songoro cosongo songe be
Songoro cosongo de mamey
Que se está bailando en cada rincón
Que está sonando en tu corazón

Verse 3: Fermín IV
Suena que suena las cartas sobre la mesa
No hay quien detenga esto nadie se mueva
Así es, todo tiene su tiempo why si estás dispuesto
A sembrar why cultivar hay que ver el fruto madurar
Hasta donde puede llegar sólo hay que desarrollar
Ampliar, solamente crear es inmenso el lugar
Espacio suficiente como para cohabitar
Escucha mi tierra hare eco
Entre las montañas se hare camino el concreto
Señales de humo que van creciendo cada día más
Tratando de comunicar
Exponiendo los adentros a la luz como van
Sin borrar nada sin tapar nada sin ocultar nada
Se presentan testimonios reales
El sentimiento no es más que puras verdades

Verse 4: Pato
Reuniendo por suerte why discretamente
Más no estaba lejos respectivamente
Si lo que se mueve proviene del vientre
No acabó el danzón why ha de seguir pa' siempre
Si se ha dado la ocasión
Ciertos sonidos de imaginación
Día a día que visita el sol
Los de tambores, acordes why son

Chorus: (Rubén Albarran from Café Tacvba)
Mandar obedeciendo en el danzón
Songoro cosongo songe be

Es guardar silencio de movimiento
Ayunar de color why sonido
Ser mujer viejo why niño

Fesco como de madrugada

No es sencillo en un sismo despertar
Sin otra que la cruda realidad
Cuando reacciono me da por gritar cantar

Por que hay un algo, interno, en rocio
Como un cirio que vela por su crio
No ha regresado, no andaba perdido

Entre broches descansa la agonia

Es que esto no es lo que es
Tal vez no es realidad

Es que todo lo que brilla no es oro

Este rollo no detendran, rap ataca sin piedad

Como una maquina real dinamica
Rieles transportando alma informatica
No hay estatica materia organica
Unos haciendo y llevando melodia romantica

Toma el micro y pon tu voz al ritmo
No importa no habra ridiculos
Dibujarte una sonrisa es un estimulo
Parpados caidos 4 am trabajo continuo

Mi crew pone su nombre
Año 9-7 en Gómez
Solo es pulir mi sonido y burlar tus horizontes
Es r-a-p el ritmo tener

El luchar por un genero y lo echan a perder
El vivir al 100
Y cada quien a lo suyo
Enfocar mi vida por un camino mas seguro

Caballero que cabalga
Sobre un ritmo y sin espada
Vivo el dia a dia y ver el sol salir mañana

Y si no esta
Brindare por la luna
Buscare lo mio
Y nada importa

Si no esta buscare
Hasta encontrar
Si no se atraviesa
Algun otro bar

No me importa, que si tengo estilo
No me importa, si soy el mismo tipo
No me importa, mis habitos distintos

Sigo aqui p-h-i-l tengo el plan
No me importa que tan dificil sea
Tendre el gusto por presea
Sigue la amistad estrecha

Y haz lo tuyo en mi receta

Programar en m-p-c
Embriagarte de hip hop

Es Serco Fuentes para que lo cuentes
Haciendo otro tema, siendo elocuente

Sigo por el mismo camino con mis 6 amigos
Aunque no puedo quejarme ha sido muy divertido
Algun disco vendido, salir de lios
Pelear con tipos, dormir en el piso
Es vivir hip hop 24/7

Ser yo y no aparentar lo que no se tiene
Me agrada eso de jugar chueco a la vida
Y con rap conectar del estudio a tu esquina
No me importa tu discurso de real
Solo deposito versos
Cabalgo la instrumental

Es lo mio sin duda, es cronico sin cura

No le pongas stop al estereo

Desde los cerros hasta el palacio carbon y vapor desplazando espacio

Inclinación que no se lava
Clara acción desorientada

No es el reflejo, resultando de esto
Cuando se ha perdido completo el resto
Frente a frente encuentro el momento
Preferido una vez más dentro

Palabras, textos del diario encuentro
Desde las afueras a el centro
Imágenes de él siempre encuentro
Siento viento intenso

Una ocasión para reflexionar
Necesitado no ha respirar
Desde el fondo uno ha de empezar
Uno a uno, dos a dialogar

Rondando con pasos el vaivén
Llena de espacios, malabares

Hay iónicas mágicas simples cuestiones
Entre regulares cuestiones

Aunque con poco sigo siendo el rey

Resulta que sigo siendo un ser

Resulta que siempre vendrá después
Lluvia hubo, hubo lluvia ayer

A veces creo que no daré más
He mantenido caliente mi hogar
Tal vez no tenga monedas de oro
Pero todo lo que tengo lo añoro

Lunas y lunas de nostalgia plena
Mañana sin sombra, tarde serena
¿Quién ha de ser el bendecido dueño?
El que trabaja y alimenta un sueño

Hubo lluvia el día de ayer
Resulta que siempre vendrá después
Lluvia hubo, hubo lluvia ayer

Es cierto que de noche en desierto
Juega la luna entre espacio y viento
Como es cierto que este momento
Resulta parte de un balance eterno

Cuando piso la tierra  así son mis días

Y es que nunca soy
Lo que prefirieron, soy lo que soy

No lo eligieron. pasa la vida, la sigo sin prisa
Simplemente observo lo que requería, pasa mi vida
Y no es tan vacía, siento que más necesitaría

Fué tan bueno hoy como después lo presiento
Fiesta con homies, barrio sin lamento
Esto no es bajón, es hasta el firmamento
Golpes y golpes y nunca reviento

Sombra de día, duro hasta arriba
Ando tranquilo, no hay melancolía
Mientras haya cuerdas, saco la espina
Sigo con la banda gastando la esquina

With these eyes I cannot see
And this cold heart never bleeds, never

Sweet smell this poison, the colour you bring
Tongue swollen venoms, to touch, to love
I want to steal your heart, I want to eat your heart
I reach for the sky but never can touch

Still I cannot, will not take this thing

Constant failure was the only friend I had
Taking everything for granted
This pity party in my head
Without You I'm as good as dead
Always playing victim
Always feeling sorry for myself
And blaming everyone else 
I teeter on this soapbox, the tilt before the fall
My precipice of selfishness, I keep hitting a wall

Always falling off this beaten path, I'm tired of fading away
Trying to shed this weight, on my own
And it isn't working out, I'm tired of fading away
From the grace You set in place

On my own, sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
Help me not hate myself for having my doubts
Sinking in the guilt I'm still running from
Lost in the lies I haven't repented of
Memories like bullets, fired from a gun
Cracking me open

That you're made to carry His love

How He painted the skies, how He gave us new life

You remember that He stays the same, that your only hope is in His face
That Dad loved a woman with grace

You came and went and took a piece of me

Exhausted and waiting for my turn to speak

I need to get this off my chest
I need to gain some self-respect
I need to listen to my friends
I need to learn to love like Him

This weight on my conscience has left me self-conscious
I don’t want to go through this again
I just want to get used to the silence
Stop acting like I've been dealt a bad hand
No more longing for her love in my bloodstream
I swear I'll never place my faith there again

I'm giving this to the cross for the last time
For some apparent peace of mind that I can't find
You're still the only thing I see when I sleep
You're still the only thing I pray I can keep
But now I see, you're not a thing

Not designed to belong to me, to medicate my uncertainty
You're made to fill empty graves with His love
Remind His daughters that His heart is enough

But when I dream we both pray together",Daughter,2015
Conveyer,"I made my choice a long time ago
My purpose set in stone
Pardoned and cleared, no longer adhering to the grave
Cut off from the atrocities I've made
To separate myself from a world to which I can't relate
Souls segregated from Your sustainment
We all deserve to die alone
Free me from the spirit of malignancy, from the big nothing
The human condition that I know

With the clock closing out on existence, my downfall will be my resistance
We all deserve to die, but I don't want to fade away
Living behind this mask I've made has only left me bound in chains

Will You please carry me across the void?
Can You fill this hole inside my heart?
This is a dead-end crossing without Your voice
I've heard Your calling and I've made my own choice
The gaping nothing has my soul in a vice
Can You take this death from me and then replace it with life?

There's nothing good here left for me on this earth
But a six-by-three, six feet down in the dirt
The longer I'm here, the light fades away
And as far as I am concerned, the worms can eat today

End my life, I'll give up the ghost
No longer bound to the fire

You have captivated this dead man
I will sing praises to show them
A chorus carried up on high

Ignoring importance, ignoring the critical
Existential urgency
Ignoring our purpose, ignoring the vital
Bled dry by apathy

Avoiding moral imperative
Death without life, an end with no means

Living in a constant spiral of moral disregard

That one to know that I'm at fault
But never take it out on me
If the two of us were both the same
I wouldn't know where I need to be
You're the bigger picture I can't see
This one goes out to You
Solitude, at least that’s what I call it
Keeping those streets of gold on my mind
I don’t know why, as the years they pass me by
It gets harder just to take my time
No one to keep me from You
No one to stay my hand from seeking the truth
From reaching up for the only hope I ever knew
For every time I wasn't honest, kind, or true

I used to think I was lucky, but I've realized now I'm just blessed that I found some sort of home in a heart even though I lived so long in selfishness. Because I've learned you know my heart more than you know my routine and most nights it’s all I need to be able to fall asleep. Because I've learned running away from home is like finding strength in weakness, but I always come back around knowing that I can't continue to live like this. So thank you for your honesty, I've found that love has gone from just being sobering to being so refreshing. And even if pain doesn't go away, I just thank God you decided to stay. Because I know I have purpose when you purposefully tell me you that see something in me, even when I can't see myself.

If this hasn't been waiting in vain, I could consider this monogamy
Living devoted and betrothed to the One
Who believed in me and wouldn't give up
If the clock looks like it ticks too slow
Even when its given time to grow
I'll know for sure that it was my own impatience
That I'd feel better if my ego was vacant

In closing, I'd like to thank You for her
For every word she spoke to help me rest assured
That I'm not lonely, that I'm not falling away
For every time she reminds me of You and lives up to her name
Thank you for everything, thank you for having patience with me

Removal from everything

I’ll avoid conversation
Every time you ask me how I’ve been, I’ll say what you want to hear
Half-heartedly concerned and insincere

No longer plagued with the fear of dying young
A culture bred to turn away, I know I’m not the only one

If this is all I can be, the wind between Your trees
Then carry me away
The new low’s in love with me

So every time you look my way, a forced smile is all you see
I’ll avoid conversation
Every time you ask me how I’ve been, I’ll say what you want to hear
Half-heartedly concerned and insincere",New Low,2017
Conveyer,"Empty hearts and muted voices are the fabric of this world
With spirits sunk so low you can see the bottom
There’s a hole deep within us all, never fulfilled
Let us say a prayer for those who walk the earth when we’re no longer here
Destroy our indifference and burn with despair
Forgive my ignorance, this is all I can bear

No grace, no love, no light, no future, no hope

With your hands removed from the equation
And no sign of your hedge of protection
We’ve destroyed all you’ve created
Never fulfilled

A constant reminder that this world is not my home
No future for the wicked
No future without hope",No Future,2017
Conveyer,"I quiver at the thought of your departure
The constant whisper of a life without your grace
I just wish it could be me in your place
To bless the world with a sense of relief

For every moment I spent sleeping away the guilt,
I’d die a thousand times to bring you back
And keep you safe from what bodes you ill
Shed your form and drift away
Seek the comfort of weightlessness

I lost myself when you found the Lord
But I believe that death can’t keep us apart
We’re either on the wrong side of the earth,
Or separated by the absence of a heartbeat

Shed your form and drift away
Seek the comfort of weightlessness

I wish I’d taken this time to grow,
But we all feel like giving up eventually
All I have left is the hope that I’ll see you again
All I have left is the faith that I’ll see you again
So you might know love when you hear them,
Let these words ring out forever
I’ll scream until my last breath",Parting Words,2017
Conveyer,"I never thought I’d find myself in this nightmare
Lead astray by your embrace, I need to decompress
I’m not strong enough to resist,
No matter how long I’ve suffered through it
It never goes away

Your memory’s fading now
The recollection of your warmth,
A pyre dying out
You were the torch I used to light my way,
But we watched the embers flicker off into the cold dark

I built a coffin made for two
Addicted to the thought of you
I swore this time would be different
Bury me, drown me in the dirt before this can get worse
Bound by habit, I am weaker than I think
Break this pattern before it swallows me
It never brings relief
Bound by habit, we are weaker than we think

I’m not strong enough to resist,
No matter how long I’ve suffered through it
It never goes away

Your memory’s fading now
The recollection of your warmth,
A pyre dying out
You were the torch I used to light my way,
But we watched the embers flicker off into the cold dark

Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever makes this easier to live with",Tunnel Vision,2017
Conveyer,"It took this long to figure out how you stole my confidence
With the tact and spite you taught to me, I’ll show you my lament
Is there still room for me in your head?

Every day I’m reminded of how I’ve never truly felt good enough for someone else
Holding on to the hope that I can conquer this fear
So help me filter through the thought of looking perfect instead of feeling whole
This love isn’t patient or kind
Cut away at the source - a blade through my stubborn soul
Lance away at everything I’ve come to know
I pray you’ll take what’s left of a hardened heart
I am an open wound
I’ve cut away what’s left of you

You don’t need me
We don’t need anyone to feel complete
The true lessons of life are learned alone
Lets not become dust on the shelf",Whetstone,2017

Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there

You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

Some day if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door

And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""

Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.

Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows

They say I'm master on the draw of any livin' man
They call me a bad man, they say I kill for fun
They say the only thing I know is how to use a gun
But they don't know the reason they branded me as bad
It started many years ago when I was just a lad

I rode into a cattle town, a boy of twenty-three
So young and yet that very day I carved my destiny
I walked into the town saloon that sad and faithful day
Then I began to gamble to pass the time away
I thought I played a hand or two then hit the thrill again
But Lady Luck was with me and I began to win

The dealer kept on dealin', the stakes were gettin' high
And pretty soon there was no one left but an old cowboy and I
The minutes seemed like hours, you couldn't hear a sound
We've been in race until we'd lay all our money down
The cowboy smiled and showed his hands, three aces he did hold
But I laid down the royal flush and reached to claim my gold

The cowboy stood and faced me, his hands hung on his hips
A look of hate was in his eyes and the smile had left his lips
He said, ""Young man, slap leather, I'm known for miles around
To keep my reputation about I got to gun you down""
White lightnin' speeded through that fire, one life will be the cost
The cowboy crumbled to the floor, his reputation lost

Now years have come and years have gone and many men have died
He's tried his luck and hoped he'd be the fastest gun alive
And in my many fights to live, I wondered if I'd won
I'm known by all the bad men, they think I kill for fun
Someday I'll meet the cowboy who's speed will meet the test
And that will in the saga of the bad man of the west",Bad Man,1969

I guess I oughta go and watch 'em put him down but I don't own the suit
And anyway when they start talkin' bout the fire and hell well I get spooked
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass
And anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass

Well here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine
Hm look at all that chrome I do believe that that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his great uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm

Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black
He's not even in the ground and they say his track is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil

And us kids were just too young to realize

Way back up in the woods neath the evergreens
There stands a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a little country boy named Johnny be Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
He could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go go Johnny go go Johnny be Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' through the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passin' by they would stop and say
My how that little country boy can play
Go go go Johnny go go...

Well his mama told him someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a country band

My pillow still wet 
From last nights tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee cup
Keeps crying out 
And ringing in my ears.

Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me, Jimmy and Johnny
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry.

Why must children be the first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst

And ev'ry time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight?

He walked into the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall bar stool
With a long soft southern drawl said I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool
A barroom girl with wise and knowing eyes slowly looked me up and down
And she said I wonder how on earth that country bumpkin found his way to town
And she said hello country bumpkin how's the frost out on the pumpkin
I've seen some sights but man you're somethin'
Where'd you come from country bumpkin

Just a short year later in a bed of joy filled tears and death like pain
Into this wondrous world of many wonders another wonder came
That same woman's face was wrapped up in a raptured look of love and tenderness
As I marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy child feeding at her breast
And she said hello country bumpkin fresh as frost out on the pumpkins
I've seen some sights but babe you're somethin' mommy loves her country bumpkin

Forty years of hard work later in a simple quiet and peaceful country place
The heavy hand of time had not erased the raptured wonder from my woman's face
She was lying on her death bed knowing fully well her race was nearly run
Byt she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes of her husband and her son
And I said so long country bumpkins the frost is gone now from the pumpkins

When we first fell in love the sun shined bright above
And everything we ever did was right
Love was all we ever knew clouds above were always blue
And all the time we never had a fight
But time together made a change the love we have is not the same
It seems that we keep goin' round and round
We try so hard to build our love and make it just the way it was
But everytime we build it up it all falls down
Yes it falls down our love gets halfway to heaven then falls to the ground
Yes it falls down it's so hard to make love strong

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

My leading lady is gone
And it's so hard to go on
Without the part she played
My life's just an empty stage.

I thought I'd find somebody by now

Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing

Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing

I see the sparkling little diamond on your hand

It's plain to see that you've already got a man

I can see you're not about to fall for any of my lines

I see the want to in your eyes


Deep in your smile there's a quiet, soft desire

Like the embers of a once raging fire

You know I could light that fire again,

you know it isn't wise

I see the want to in your eyes


How strong's a band of gold

Is it strong enough to hold,

when a love has grown cold

and A woman wants a love, sweet

and warm

How many women just like you have

silent schemes.

How many men like me do they sleep

with in their dreams

You can stay or you can go and

although I sympathize

I still see the want to in your eyes

I see the want to in your eyes

Conway Twitty,"Well, I was working this joint in Dallas
To make the payment on my car
Just a weekend stand with a local band
They had me playin' rhythm guitar.

Well, I was singin' some old cheatin' song
When this blue-eyed blonde came by
She said, I'm a table over in the corner
Why don't you drop around and say hi
So, I did.

Well, she was dressed like a million dollars
But she was way up outta my class
She whispered into my ear, honey I hear
A honky tonk man moves fast.

All of the sudden my body went numb
I had enough sense to see
That everything I ever wanted in life
Was coming to easy for me.

So I said, ""Wait just a minute,
Wait, just a cotton-pickin' minute.""

You better not get caught in the desert
Without your snake boots on
You don't lay down on the railroad tracks
'Til after the train is gone.

You don't swim out in deep water
With your pockets full of stone
You don't get caught in the desert, son,
Without your snake boots on.

Well, she was quicker that a boys good judgment
So, we were headed for the parkin' lot
When a guy in the band said, ""Wait a minute, man
Lord, are you crazy or what?""

""Well, ole big bad Tex is her lover
And, he's terribly skilled with a knife
He's real particular 'bout who rides his horse
And, nobody fools with his wife.""

So, I said, ""Wait just a minute,
Wait just a dang minute.""

Like walkin' on a high wire, Lord, it scares me half to death

And I'll do tricks for you, just like you want me to 
I'll do anything it takes just to hang around 
I'll paint a smile for you to cover up my frown 
'Cause our loves a circus and I'm just the clown 

Everyone's in love with you, but they just look at me and laugh 
And I'll bet when they see me cry, they think it's just an act

And only been in love a night or two
They see a beautiful woman in the shadows with a man
And all they see is a weekend rendezvous

Lovers lyin' low
We must be deceivers
'Cause baby they don't know

I've been fallin' for you for years
Can't get over the feel of you
Something in the way you make your moves

I've been fallin' for you for years
Runnin' deep, runnin' strong
It's been goin' on and on and on and on for years

You make it easy to be a one woman man
Just look at you sitting there
Your eyes are talkin' in that soft and sexy way
Sayin' let's slip away, slip away somewhere

It don't take a rainy night
Or music in the dark
But baby when your body sends
A message to my heart

I've been fallin' for you for years
Can't get over the feel of you
Something in the way you make your moves

Conway Twitty,"We step out on the dance floor, the band starts to play
Holding you close I get carried away
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you

Time standing still as I whirl you around
We're dancing without even touching the ground
Finding that falling is easy to do
Lost in the feeling with you

No words are spoken
That don't need to be said
You and the music
Have gone to my head

But I'll just go on when the music is through
Lost in the feeling with you
Lost in the feeling with you

Conway Twitty,"Some say love, it is a river
And that it drowns the tender reed
And some say love, it's like a razor
And that it leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember, in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose",The Rose,1988
Conway Twitty,"Someone somewhere's fallin' asleep

And right down the hall someone's in there feelin'
Like cryin', 'cause they're livin' all alone

Somebody's needin' somebody, the way I do
Somebody's wantin' somebody, they can hold on to
To be loved by somebody, that's the way it should be
Oh, there's got to be somebody, somewhere waitin' for me

Late at night, it's lonely and I wonder how I'll ever get through
There's got to be somebody, somewhere who's feelin' it too
Hurtin' inside, goin' through the motions, it's so hard to live
So many feelin' so lonely, when they got so much to give

How could we know we'd grow up and grow apart?
All we really wanted was each other in the night
But, it's plain to see we've had a change of heart

I wish we could find that love again but I'm afraid we won't

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard;
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her; 
Everybody wants to take your baby home;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her; 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem; 
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies; 
'Cause everybody tempts her, 
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;

Conway Twitty,"I saw you through a cafe window down on second avenue
The passage of time sure has been good to you
I was tempted for just a moment to run out in the street
But what do you say when two old lovers meet

You say, hello
(Hello)
How are you
You’re doing well it seems
I wish I was better at bein’ alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

I spent a lot of lonely hours staring at this phone of mine
Knowing your just a heart beat down the line
Once I even dialed your number, but I couldn’t let it ring
What do you say to a sweet memory

You say, hello
(Hello)
How are you
You’re doing well it seems
I wish I was better at bein’ alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

In my favorite fantasy
You’re the one who’s missing me
It all comes back so easily
When I hear you say

You say, hello
(Hello)
How are you
You’re doing well it seems
I wish I was better at bein’ alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

I wish I was better at bein’ alone
I wish I was still in your dreams

And I leave work at five-o-five
Been doing my best to forget about her
But she's driving me out of my mind

When I get home, I know what I'll find
How I wish that it wasn't so
There'll be no one there to hold me tonight
In that house on old lonesome road

I recall how we laughed
When we read the name
In the paper before we moved in
And after we did our friends all asked
If that house was lonesome back then

We were so young, our dreams were so new
There's just no way that we could have known
The irony of the place where we loved
That house on old lonesome road

It's only shingles and shutters
And a case of worn out stairs
Just like my old heart they need repair
Maybe I should sell it
Yeah, maybe that would be the best
Maybe then someone else could find
Some love at that address

I used to love that old house so much
Back before she went away
Now everything there is just gathering dust
I should clean it up if I'm gonna stay

But I don't have too much time anymore
I'm too busy talking to ghosts
'Cause her memory, keeps me company

Conway Twitty,"I was there to buy a pistol. She was there to hock her ring.
The broker in that pawnshop deals in almost anything.
He'll pay you for your misery 
or he'll sell you someone's pain,
And that twinkle in his greedy eyes says your loss will be his gain.

She stood back in the shadows as the broker dealt with me.
Her eyes were dark and desperate from some private misery.
His word was so prophetic when he said, 
You've got a steal.
I said, ""Throw in one bullet, and you've got yourself a deal.""

A Saturday night special is an easy thing to buy.
All you've got to be is 21, or 15 if you lie.
Just hand the man the money, and if someone's got to die,
The broker in the pawnshop won't even blink an eye.

He handed me the pistol, and I was almost to the door,
When I heard him tell the lady, ""Seven dollars, nothing more.""
The lady started crying as he took her wedding band.
My hand was in my pocket, and the gun was in my hand.
I had planned to use that bullet on myself, to end my life.

I was once somebody's husband. She was once somebody's wife.
I usually mind my business but I could not walk away,
His dollars just weren't making sense, and I knew I had to stay.
The broker's face turned pasty when he caught my icy stare.
It would never leave my pocket, but he knew the gun was there.
I asked him what his life was worth, and he opened up that drawer.
For a simple golden wedding band, he paid two thousand more.

That Saturday night was special even though it wasn't planned.
As we walked down the sidewalk, she reached and took my hand.
We crossed a bridge, and I took that gun and sailed it through the air.
I said, ""Ever been to Texas?"" she said, ""I think I'd love it there.""

Don't all the dreams we've seen come true

Mean anything

And you keep staring at the door
How can you walk away

Is worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late
For love to change your mind

Our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts
The hurt of wasted years

Well it's been fun

When I was very young.
I had dreamed my father
Had passed away and gone.

My world revolved around him
I couldn't lay there anymore.
So I made my way down the mirrored hall
And tapped upon his door.

And I said ""Daddy, I'm so afraid
How will I go on with you gone that way?
Don't want to cry anymore
So may I stay with you?""

That's what I do.

This teenage boy and he.
Most of the fights it seems
Were over different dreams,
We each held for me.

I wanted to fly out west.
Said, ""I could make it out there
If I just had the fare.
I got half, will you loan me the rest?""

And I said ""Daddy, I'm so afraid,
There's no guarantee in the plans
I've made and if I should fail,
Who will pay my way back home?""

And fills the hole with light.
And I pray someday I might
Light as bright as he.

To spread the tragic news.
After all my travel, I settled down
Within a mile or two.

I make my living with words and rhyme
And all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead
As bits of poetry.

But I say ""Daddy, I'm so afraid,
How will I go on with you gone this way?
How can I come up with a song to say
I love you?""

So I'm gonna get down on my knees and I'm gonna say to my baby

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
I was the first man to ever
Hold you in a special kind of way

And those unfamiliar feelings that caused you to tremble
I know you remember today
Before you decide that you're gonna leave me 
And do things you've never done before

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
The two lips that once held sweet surprises 
Surprised me and said goodbye today

And those two lovin' arms that use to reach for me
Just reached out and pushed me away
I know you believe you don't love me
Before you walk out that door

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore",Touch the Hand [#],1991
Conway Twitty,"Each time I dial your number
I never get an answer
It seems like you're avoiding me

I can't take unhappy endings
So I just keep pretending
You'll see the light eventually

Can't stop my heart from breaking
Can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying
Can't believe your love is dying

Can't stop the rain from falling
No answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing
It's such a heartache losing you

Feels like some tragic movie
Please say you'll come back to me
Dreaming of you night after night

I'm having trouble sleeping
Your memory is keeping
These feelings running through my mind

Can't stop my heart from breaking

No answer when I'm calling

It's such a heartache
I don't know what to do
It's such a heartache

I wanted more than anything

Conway Twitty,"Tonight she dances all alone
She sways and the jukebox plays on and on
It's into the music, she's gone

Someone let her down, oh, I understand
Me, I'd be happy just holdin' her hand
People, step aside, let the pretty lady dance

Oh, I wonder what I could say
A word to help take the hurt away
I feel what she feels as she sways

Someone let her down, oh, I understand
Me, I'd be happy just holdin' her hand
People, step aside, let the pretty lady dance

Her eyes, I see a teardrop fall
Her dream was only a dream, that's all
She turns her face to the wall

Someone let her down, oh, I understand
Me, I'd be happy just holdin' her hand

Sometimes just dancin's the best we can do

Conway Twitty,"See that far away look on her face
Twisting her hair, staring out into space
There's no talking to her, don't even try
Better save your breath and just walk on by

But now she can't see enough of that guy
Her head is spinning like a carnival wheel
It's getting scary but she loves how it feels

'Cause she's got a man on her mind
Stirring in her soul, taking up all her time
She's got all the symptoms, she's showing all the signs
She's got a man on her mind

She's seeing less and less and less of the girls
Can't seem to fit 'em into her new world
Always the first to say that love wouldn't last
Now she's the one that's falling and she's falling pretty fast

She's got a man on her mind
Stirring in her soul, taking up all her time
She's got all the symptoms, she's showing all the signs

Even harder understanding why she needs him so much
She's not herself when he's not around
Why he's even got her thinking 'bout settlin' down

How my heart was filled with her memory
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me

Fills his trembling hand

All the records pressed in gold
But he lost what really matters
What he really wanted most

They'll feel the pleasure of his songs
But they won't feel his pain

And though my heart is hurting so
The one I love will never know
As long as I stay

In this big town I find the peace of mind
That only losers in the game of love can find
The years have gone crawling by
This hurt I feel will never die
Somehow I know deep down inside
I'll never get away from this big town
From this big town

In this big town there's a street of misery
And on the street there's a dwelling place for me
In the darkness of my room I try
To sleep but all I do is cry
And still I realize that
I am ever lucky to be here

In this big town so no one else can see
Just what your cheating heart has done to me
The glimmer of the city lights
The shadows of the lonely nights
Will help to hide me while I cry
A hundred dreaded tears

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky-tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights.

Lights that say forget her name in a glass of sherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights.

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
But God who put the stars above I don't believe made those lights
For it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights",City Lights,1997

That each soldier boy had died fighting with a smile upon his face

The truth that's even more thrillin' and that's when

To come home for it's suppertime when all

And on the street there's a dwelling place for me
In the darkness of my room I try
To sleep but all I do is cry
And still I realize that
I am ever lucky to be here

In this big town so no one else can see
Just what your cheating heart has done to me
The glimmer of the city lights
The shadows of the lonely nights
Will help to hide me while I cry
A hundred dreaded tears

Conway Twitty,"I thought I've never seen a girl like her in here before
And I could see her watching me as I walk across the floor
I asked her if she'd like to dance when the band starts up again
She said, ""I never danced with strangers, I don't even know your name""

I said, ""We're not exactly strangers, you and I
My thoughts were running wild and free as I watched you tonight
Just think about it and you'll find
We're not exactly strangers, I've already loved you in my mind""

The band started playing a slow moving song
She got up and easily moved into my arms
I kept on saying the things a girl likes to hear
And when the dance was over she whispered in my ear

And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone

Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John

Conway Twitty,"Today I heard my woman say something I never heard her say before
She just told me that she was going to leave me and that she didn't love me anymore
But I know that the loving kindness and the understanding is still there somewhere
So I'm gonna get down on my knees and I'm gonna say to my baby

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
I was the first man to ever
Hold you in a special kind of way

And those unfamiliar feelings that caused you to tremble
I know you remember today
Before you decide that your gonna leave me 
And do things you've never done before

Touch the hand of the man that made you a woman 
Then tell me you don't love me anymore
The two lips that once held sweet surprises 
Surprised me and said goodbye today

And those two lovin' arms that use to reach for me
Just reached out and pushed me away

Then tell me you don't love me anymore",Touch the Hand [Original Recording],2006

They think you really care
But myself I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe.

My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care,
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you.
No one will ever know how much I love you so
My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me
But it's o-only make believe.

My hopes, my dreams come true, my life I'd give for you,
My heart, a wedding ring, my all, my everything.
My heart I can't control, you rule my very soul,
My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me
But it's o-only make believe.

My one and only prayer, is that some day you'll care,

Take me back to yesterday
Let me see, cotton growing, in the fields
Let me hear, my momma calling
Look a-yonder ya-all who's coming
Down the road, he's coming home
But they know I never will

I left them living with that awful thing I done
I didn't tell them I just packed my clothes and run

Help me make another dollar, before I go
We got time, for one more song
Then we'll have to move along
Another town, another crowd

Can they read between the lines in my song

And as I taste your tender kisses
I can tell you've never been this far before

And as I take the love you're giveing
A can feel the tension building in your mind
And you're wondering if tomorrow
I'll still love you like I'm loving you tonight

But tonight will only make me love you more
And I hope that you'll believe me

Most men would give their right off or anything they own
To have a woman just like you to be waitin' when they come home
But the devil made me cheat on you one too many times
And honey, I'm sorry but she left heaven on my mind

Georgia, sweet Georgia keeps pulling on my ring
I need her and I love her, Lord, she's a sweet and precious thing
Her sweet and easy loving, Lord, beats all I've ever seen

I didn't wanna fall in love with anybody else
But when I tasted heaven, Lord, I just couldn't help myself
I pray someday that you'll forget and forgive me for all these things

Conway Twitty,"I woke up crying late at night
When I was very young.
I had dreamed my father
Had passed away and gone.

My world revolved around him
I couldn't lay there anymore.
So I made my way down the mirrored hall
And tapped upon his door.

And I said ""Daddy, I'm so afraid
How will I go on with you gone that way?
Don't want to cry anymore
So may I stay with you?""

And he said ""That's my job,
That's what I do.
Everything I do is because of you,
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.""

Later we barely got along
This teenage boy and he.
Most of the fights it seems
Were over different dreams,
We each held for me.

He wanted knowledge and learning.
I wanted to fly out west.
Said, ""I could make it out there
If I just had the fare.
I got half, will you loan me the rest?""

And I said ""Daddy, I'm so afraid,
There's no guarantee in the plans
I've made and if I should fail,
Who will pay my way back home?""

And he said ""That's my job
That's what I do.
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.""

Every person carves his spot
And fills the hole with light.
And I pray someday I might
Light as bright as he.

Woke up early one bright fall day
To spread the tragic news.
After all my travel, I settled down
Within a mile or two.

I make my living with words and rhyme
And all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead
As bits of poetry.

But I say ""Daddy, I'm so afraid,
How will I go on with you gone this way?
How can I come up with a song to say
I love you?""

First time
With you

Last night, you bought something special
Out of me
And for the first time
You made my dream a reality

I never though love was meant for me
For I was blind and could not see
You bought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the 
Difference
Now love is so sincere

And I can't stop (Can't stop)

Hey Hey

[Verse 1: Coo Coo Cal]
Can you picture this?
It's bout that time we got the tunes
Hot on the block sippin' on 'yac like some damn fools
Consumin' liquor by the ounce
Ya guys is rollin' up to get their grub on,
wit the dubs on and the car that bounce
Help at the park, barbaques wit roasted pig
And can nobody eat until the meat is done and we feed the kids
Nieces, nephews, uncles and aunties
Yea, you ride wit plenty of folks but ain't got nothin' up on these
Seeds from the weed, up out the bangs of optimos
A bunch of pimps, playas, and hustlaz to fock the hoes
Pros comin' off, when the barbaques done
ain't really focus on that, but hell a playa bound to get some
Kids runnin' back-and-fourth cryin' on who pushed them now
We all fam, but I be damned if they push my seat down
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

[Chorus:1x] *background chorus vocals - Koffee Brown
How does it feel to ya
Roll up the Swisher baby if it's real to ya
Gangstas, where we from (?) to ya
Leg breakin', cake bakin', is it trill to ya
How does it feel to ya
That's how we do it
Hop in the heavy Chevy, corner bend to it
Shine up the candy and the twenty-twins to it
Get drunk, fill up your cup again to it
How does it feel to ya...feel me now

[Hook: be	-12]
M-dub, three thugs sittin' on duece dueces
Hennessy and gin, need some orange and apple juices
barbaques and half-ounce, bounce wit the music
Wide-identical pipes (?) wit dukeys

[Verse 2: Coo Coo Cal]
Midwest is the timezone
When it gets hot,
We go block-to-block, open up shop, and get our grind on
Now I ain't lyin' homes to whoever make a playa change
To release the tension, mention basketball and play a game
Wit dames on the sideline cheerin' you on
And haters that can't play on the side while,
cryin' foul, screwin' you on
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

A lot of them cut the top, hookin' up decks and sounds to roll to
It ain't the old two-hundred twenty twins
Mack-10, boss jackin' at the lakefront in the city I'm in
Bendin' corners in an orderly fashion
Twenty cars deep,
creepin' up the street, beatin' dawg so it be mashin'
Flashin' bread at them chickenhead
Yea they jumpin' in to sin dawg,
'cause-it's-about the only thing that'll get 'em fed
Hear what I just said
Pick 'em up in the presidential rento limo, TV's and (?)
Ghetto celeb is the gear we wear
Naw ya'll don't hear it there
But by the end of this year you gonna feel the player
Sippin' on Henn, and Cris is gettin' plenty drunk
Which switches from the candy-coupe dawg, an empty front
That's how we kick it up in the Mil-town
It's real now, but can you feel how we kick-it-up-on these steal grounds

Cookie Coleman,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

A little patience, the time we pray

Gotta run for shade

We gotta cool this anger

So long ago you were my love
Oh my love

To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me
I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl and in our minds

All up when I'm feelin' cold 
'Cause pain up on my soul seems to be all I feel 
Watchin' my family fall apart, was all I never wanted to see 
'Cause I got love for one another 
I'd kill for my only brother, even though he might be wrong 
At times I'm gon' do what I got to do to come through every scary moment 
Just brought us closer which kept us down 
Remember them days when southwest Atlanta wasn't even 'round 
So out the reds to wet it 
And say they actin' brains, relaxin' 
And steady stackin' and pistol packin' 
And trackin' is tired

I wear Calhoun jeans 'cause I don't like Calvin 
I relate to my folks 
To make you think this 'bout my third album 
This supposed to be the times when the moon and the sky turn purple 
So watch this full circle 
Black wire touch red 
Red wire touch black

Back on the grind, did that time, got that hide-away

On cotton, one apple sport the whole 
Barrel rotten

Got me trapped in this world under this moon and sun

I'm tryin' to take better care of my body this quarter 
Docter say drink more water, but Bacardi got you bent in this bitch

You betta learn this southern slang

I said ""Now which one of why'll suppose to take me to school?""

I'm from Eats Point, Atlanta, we don't fight by rules
You don't know Cool Breeze or lil Freddy Calhoun
In this place, the dirty south, we'll hit ya for a lick
Sell you dreams, nice things, and it be a box of bricks
Most haters, imitators, think they know Cool Breeze
Ain't jack but a rat on my East Point cheese
I know it irritates yo' ears, how I chop these trees
You nothin' but a lame 'round these EPV's
All my enemies who don't know what they jumped in
If the doctor came through once, he'll come through again
And when look and he ask me where everybody is
They didn't believe in your return so they ran for the hills
And I still got that same pain in my chest
My prescription stress, no cess, and wear a Teflon vest
And these niggas still try and test
Don't even know me or these Georgia plains

Get some nights on beaver, made her way through the damm
Down stream, two crabs, a set of twins, three fins
One main pain was for soldiers to feel
Warriors don't take orders, ain't no serial killers in Georgia
The culprit is blue words in pink skin, so listen our daughters
Daddy's little girl, dialling 1-800-Earl
Cause she want to do what men do

Let's hit the damm, where all the beavers go chill
If you trill you betta not squeal
Cause if you squeal, you will disappear
Now that's for trill

How I wish, you was the last fish, I would have to catch
It was a mess, how the last one, jumped back in the sea
Of Goddesses, from the SWAT it is
A poor playa with skills to build nations of people
Not giving a fuck bout no color, we all brothers that ball
While others get manipulated and fall
Nose wide open to that beast, like it was yo' first
To cash in your V-club, is it really love
That you feel for her, you a betta man than me
To think I can't keep a girl that I like around me
And so there's many that await, stay after plate
My stomach full after I take a pull

Yeah, uh-huh, many gon' come, many gon' go
Some thinkin, I'mma overwhelm, fuck the foes
Some wanna little time, wanna conversate
Some too impatient to wait so we can fully relate
Some Bouvier, and you bout fall clean through thin ice tryin to skate
Your girl and I all playin the game, y'all just don't play the same
Don't give a fuck and brush up off me, tick, tick, shawty Lo be
At a piece of being broken for emotion at F-O-E's
So she know it's gon' be a strike three
But you gotta strike two, huh
But at the damn I could find another just like you
At The Damm I could find another just like you
Huh, goodnight boo",The Damm,1998

I had the strangest dream 
I was in this place called butta 
You wouldn't believe what I seen 
Ooh  you got that butta 

My name Cool Breeze I got that country crock 
All the girls on the block they call me chop  chop  chop 
I cuts em up baby and my cuts be very precise 
And  uh  right before they melt  i put em back in ice 
And every now and then I take em out for a test 
Then it's back to the cooler to make sure they stay fresh 
They always scream my name at my heavyweight bout 
I like grits, girls raised in the South 
Hanging out for a night and she'll never forget 
How I showed her respect and I'm a East Point vet 
She stay on Old Nat'l, she wants to see me today 
And when she see me tonight she gon be college parkay 

[Chorus 2x] 

OK, first let me tell you how I tell how I tell 
When i first walk in the room I check for the smell 
And if it's on and popping I won't be saying nothing 
We can begin on the sofa where the parts jumping 
I know she telling all her friends about this butta she get 
And tonight she gon submit to the greatest hit 
Now we done done a lot of talking and enough has been said 
Girl get up on this toast and let me see how you spread 
I said paper, scissors, young cool cutter 
Toss em up in the air and cut em up like butter 
She said she never heard of nothing like that in her whole life 
That's when I pulled off my shirt and then I took out my knofe 

[Chorus 2x] 

Take you to get yo nails done, play that song ""The Player's Ball"" 
Run you over Kiesha house, drop you off by Greenbrown Mall 
It don't matter how long you try to keep me out 
I'm a still chop and dice you up like we were at the Waffle House 
Girls always asking me like what do I mean 
When I say butter berry cream when I'm floating downstream 
See this type of butter ain't like Land-O-Lakes 
it's just moist in the middle like some hot pancakes 
When I go over her house she always sitting alone 
And be playing my songs, I mean like all night long 
If i, Cool Cutter, gave one reply 
When I wake up in the morning, my cholestorol high

See where I'm from I was taught that
Two wrongs don't make a right but it'll damn sure get your money back
So best believe you got's to watch folks
You hit cho' lights, they have they face off in yo place
Just like a cockroach
Tryin' to hit chu' for yo index
Tear some paper out the back and re-arrange your whole contents
That's why you gotta keep yo history
In a book so when they look it'll never be a mystery
I've seen people come and leave, comeback and leave
Come back and still ain't stack no G's
So everybody won't be pushin' buttons
Just the ones who gave they all when you know they didn't have nothin'
We comin' what chu' gonna do when we run
In a pack against a pit and lay up under the sun

See growin' up is like a girlfriend
Ya keep ya cool, take ya time, and when ya day come you put it in
That's a reflection on ya whole life
From the moments you wake up to those minutes that you pray at night
Like when they pushed you at the playground
And all ya friends would wonder
Why you yelled 'the field' before you threw down
 
That's just yo instincts tryin' to tell ya heart
That is ya mother wished the best for you
You'd be tested it from the jump start
So that's when people come around and wonder
What make you tick, how you do it, but you keep ya business on the under
I ask my folks question every season
They say the Lord blessed every child, boy he blessed you with a reason
So with that I go for years and years
On a quest to return and reveal to my peers

[Chorus]

What if yo life story was in a book
And they left certain words that only you could say
Because they knew you looked
That's like your future bein' planned for you
You know who real and who fake and who ya friends and who gon' be loyal
You keep yo thoughts on a level
That don't nobody know what chu' be doin' next
Cause you change like the weather
You the chosen, the one who reveal
Every battle that we battled and every hill that we build
Your life is their forever burnin' torch
So the messages you carry reach and travel importance
See in the book you was this place that people actually lived
They disappeared in the mists of the hemispheres
But when they return they speak of travelin' on their journey back home
We shall rise once again and let it be known

Cool Breeze,"Hey, I remember when I came, came
I didn't have to ask nobody in the streets
To scream my name, name
'Cause we got a lock on this whole city
And got a key to the Dirty South
And the South coast, now play with me

So bring your semi thirty, art thirty
If you put your hands on a Calhoun player
It's gon' get dirty, dirty
And everybody trying to claim boss
But that's just talk
You don't really wanna turn these mics off

They trying to slick us with our own slang
Using our words like back and forth
Just calling us up out our name
See and for that they gonna pay, pay
Everything they did in one week, I'ma do in one day

You can say that it's about to start
Don't call us rappers
'Cause nowadays a rapper ain't considered smart
So I just stay away from those haters
And anybody in my clique who roll with me, you a creator

So it's like, who do you believe in?
Just like the hustler came back once
The clock is gon' strike twelve again
And I'm most requested in my old hood
From Martel to Springdale and all through Club Candlewood

You can ask Cool Cane or Dre-High
Either Po-boy, Dirty Red, or they gon' cut? I'm fire, fire
And they consider me that raw, raw
And your partners where you represent
They say you got that flaw, flaw

And Cool Breeze, he got that hard, hard
And ain't nobody taking nothing
And don't want nothing to start, start
So when I'm riding through the hood, hood
They respect me when they see me
'Cause they know I got that good, good

That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood
That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood

That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood
That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood

And can't nobody touch my team, team
Just like EJ from Southwest ATL
My partner got that green, green
And we gon' come through kicking the most game
Taking fo' sho' routes and pointing out the lane, lanes

So when you come and you ride through
It won't be no mystery, who everybody listening to
That's right 'cause all we do is stack, stack
And Organize this Noize and everybody know that

Plus we testing out this new sound
Everybody done put down
Now we breaking up some new ground
'Cause we serve 'em up that real, real
And be forever Dirty South in this place we live, live

That's what make the brothers hawk, hawk
Trying to step up and showcase
All that is is talk, talk
See Cool Breeze, he ain't your fool, fool
So don't ask me no questions
Like what makes me so cool, cool

They'd rather see me in the Chain Gang
Than rolling a V-12, riding on them thang, thangs
I get respect out to Alabama
To the West Coast to the East
Then right back to Atlanta

And that's how we keep it tight, tight
I come through busting the door first
Then we ship it out the same night
So when I'm riding through the hood, hood
They respect me when they see me
'Cause they know I got that good, good

That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood
That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood

That's right, we got that good, good
From every street to every borough
And back to every hood, hood

How for my folks, and for mine, I forever stay down
And represent this town, and for that, I'll be crowned
It's been known that my attitude'll reach it's peak
That's right
But never has it once stopped the way that I think
I know the speakers addin' bricks to the path you lay
And to be is to live everything you say
I read once that if you die, the people couldn't forget
That your eternal flame will forever stay lit
One day I'll leave this place and add another star to the sky
But all of my creations, they never would die
I told you dirty jed clampett tried to front me some weight
This time he pushed me in his house, and had it laid on the plate
He had stacks of it packed all down in these crates
Stampin' bdf, nothin' but that flake
See, the only way the southcoast will ever become
We gotta all come together, and become as one

Never lost loyalty, it's Organized Noize and be
You bitch, you already know the remainin
Let us jealousy, I don't entertain it (nope)
I got a cave bitch (white girl), she's a cheerleader (pom pom)
I split a 12 with her (Miller Lite), she licked this here penis
Snatched her from a ballplayer, that wasn't playin ball
He paid for it all, but she wouldn't take it off (ha)
So I'ma take it off his hands, I know you heard of that
And I'ma murder that furry cat for a fact

Floss, comin through L or Tampa on vogues (on vogues)

She got three kids and about four goals (four goals)
She serve her pop ex and fuck other hoes
She used to fuck with this nigga named Tone, that was on
Even frontin her the zones, 'til he died in born homes (*laughing*)
He was killed by a young nigga creepin with the chrome
Took the money out the trunk and like sixteen zones
But fuck that, let's take it back to the 'lac

And I'll meet you in a week at the Claremont Lounge (yeah)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Cool Breeze]
Hey look, I chillin in the lounge and this girl gonna walk in the bathroom

And damn you look cute, why you ain't got no butt (butt, ooooo)
Hey, walk back to my seat, I guess shorty felt dissed

See I could of got you a bitch at the video shoot
But you to busy out here lookin cute tryna take your shirt off
If we was in a group, I'd have your microphone turned off

Cool Crooners of Bulawayo,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

Cool for August,"Big nights are black and blue, they get cold and they get wet
They calling out for you, like no one you've ever met
No one dreams in the hours around me
The more I lose, the more you'll find me
I lose track with every kiss, we shouldn't be isolated by this

Yeah, you're my friend, and when we're lost I'll still
Hold your hand
Revealing white when the shadows fail
And any shadow that you can name
I'll be the shadow of your name...

Hold the prize close to your heart
Prizes made for those who fail
Hold the prize away from you, so maybe you can hold me as well
Time peels off your statued skin, I'll still be fooled by what remains
And whatever's left of you, you'll be my dream

Yeah, you're my friend, and when we're drunk I'll still
Hold your hand
Revealing white when the shadows fail
And any shadow that you can name
I'll be the shadow of your name...",Big Night,1997
Cool for August,"I crawled out of my skin, looking at my pain and self
But it seems I've fallen in denial
The truth I admit, something I long to find
And it always comes in denial
The longest I lived, and sectioned the river passes through
And the margins way hours, half past tomorrow
And I will hanging from the line, and my head in magic
Take you to another time, like a child that passes away
Ohh, take me right back to a grand world
Ohh, take me right back to a grand world
Life is what you imagine, powerless descent
And I've lost myself
The future is certain that the rain will divide us
Will a new shade that will force it's way out
Half past the silence
And I will hanging from the time, with crashes and province
They can see right and come to find, why the time has carried me away
Ohh, take me right back to a grand world
Ohh, take me right back to a grand world
Life is what you imagine, powerless descent
And I've lost myself
I crawled out of my skin, looking at my pain and self

Cool for August,"I've been away 10,000 times and still I look in the mirror
What do I see?
An owl tryin' to fly in the light of day
Unaware of what's in my way
I can only find my place and I hope I'm wrong
I hope I'm wrong
By step by step....
CHORUS
Ooh here they come
Destroying my youth
And the other side's the same
When the rain pours
They'll cut us a loop and another nail
I've been asleep for most of my life and still it looks familiar
The people I meet are callous,
Taking life in another way,
Contrived in the words they say,
Keeping time with the wolves at prey and I hope I'm wrong
I hope I'm wrong

They will pay for
All the times we've come through
In the eyes of hate
When will I make it?
And is the world worth taking?
When will I make it?

Cool for August,"Faded lens and broken scar, feels no compassion
Pale blue car with tales of gold, in the wrong direction
And I stand the prison floor, my thoughts are changing
Locked in silence, and I see forever now, there's nothing left of you
Time has crashed again, fading promises remain
And the times that pass have changed, needless conversation makes me
Crazy
And I can't seem to find that looking glass, of you
When the ages come and go, like sees the passage
The empty threat has poised us all to see the madness
Just hand the table flow, his ever hand to guide the soldiers
As I try reason it all, calling out to you
My eyes crashing blank, visons of you have betrayed me
Try to pass the mate, knowing if all that's he's missed and hated
And I can't seem to find that looking glass
Maybe that's only made to last
When my fingers and thumb start to scatter fade
Of you... of you
Time has crashed again, fading promises remain
And the times that pass have changed, needless conversation makes me
Crazy
And I can't seem to find that looking glass
Maybe that's only made to last
When my fingers and thumb start to scatter fade
Of you... of you
",Of You,1997
Cool for August,"Hey, if you were right I'd chase away
All the reason for my old desire to change
But the right words, don't improvise the ideals
My body sails into a passage waiting in vain
It might just be so uninviting, is it comical
From until now I've gone to something else
I'll never forget how I once saw myself
If not for the way I'd changed, if not for the way
Say, every hour is always the same
Gazing endlessly to the usual clouds I'd always collect
As the town slips with the hatfull by the sunset
And paralyze the aspirations of the day
The rightous become the silenced
The fallen ones, they'll never find that road that's fallen them
I'll never forget how I once saw myself
If not for the way I'd changed, if not for the way
It's not quite the same
I'll never forget how I once saw myself
If not for the way I'd changed, if not for the way
It's not quite the same

Cool for August,"I made a breakout just the other day
I thought it was time to make it right
Taking a train to nowhere looking back at the past
Living a life of destruction as my fate
As a world that I love to hate

But I'm saved again
Saved by a little realizing and a whole lot of pain
And all the time that I spent
And all the time that slipped away ain't over
Trials fade away
I made a breakout just the other day
This time I knew that it wasn't right
Three people torn to pieces from a child's past
And the tears like rain pourin' down this broken face
It was all that I could take
CHORUS
I made a breakout just the other day
And you know then, that's the way life goes on
'Till somebody came to me and everybody showed me
That everybody lived and everybody won't
She was lost at sea, it was destined to be
That life goes on without you.

Cool for August,"Living in a cast iron chain to an eight legged monster
The bonds that surround my home, they look like flies
Love to prevent thyself from getting any colder
And all I see is the dirt behind your shadow tongues
I will resolve the reason I'm stuck here,
And I see the door and its all I ever needed
And the time that you hate to walk away
Because the time that you regret, you walk away
They say that I live like a dog, but I think I'm bitten
A kitchen full of nothing, but there'll be something soon
I see a light above me, could it be my angel?
Could it be my love, to keep this struggle on
I will resolve the reason I'm stuck here,
And I see the door and its all I ever needed
And the time that you hate to walk away

Bring me away to something I cannot hold
Fadin' to find me, but before that

Save my child life

For what You mean to me
I would only say it once
In hushed tones
So it would not grow old
But all I have
Is ""I love You""

You're my Jesus, You're my hero
Everything I wish that I could be

You're the one who comforts me
When everyone is gone away
I can't stand alone
Here I am
Waiting for You to take me home

And I will keep on singing
Because You hear me
And I will keep on smiling
Because You're near me

I'll sleep well on a promise tonight.",Rest for the Weary,2004
Cool Hand Luke,"There's a man on the roof
Ignoring the fireworks
The city walks by unmoved
Their laughter looks like tears

On top of a skyscraper 
With a foundation of fears
Hopes deferred and dreams
He thinks can't come true

The city keeps hurting him
He crawls to it for medicine
All the answers are here
He's asking the wrong questions

On top of a skyscraper
With a foundation of fears
Empty works and dreams
He thinks can't come true
For what can he do?
What has he to offer to You?

Your Majesty, he's jumping
He's jumping

He's falling
Into Your arms",Skydive,2004
Cool Hand Luke,"Singing with the windows down
I'm driving down the street
And I hope that I'm the only one
Who doesn't have a/c
'Cause my voice is often cracking
And even sometimes laughing
As I lift my voice to Jesus
And fight the Friday traffic
I sing, ""amazing love,
How can it be?""
My voice flows out the window
Into the summer heat
Like the heat my voice is rising
Breaking through the pink horizon
Winking at the sun and flying home
And I don't mind the weather
'Cause my seats aren't made of leather
If my car would keep on going
I could sing this song forever
Lord, lead this vehicle
Lord, lead this vehicle
I can't drive forever
The song is almost over
The sun is setting
The needle approaches empty
Despite the heat
My feel are getting cold
From where they've been
And where they'll go
They'll go
Something tells me
That they should be poised
And ready to
Kick the window
I heard you
And I found myself
In a field one day
I'll stop the car
In rainwater
I'll go by foot from here




",10 or 40,2007
Cool Hand Luke,"This night should last forever
By myself but not alone
Reality will stab me

Will I have the strength to carry on
Will I bow to the world
Will I be chained by my flesh
Will I bow to this world

Without the help of something self
The pain of waking form a dream
I must believe
I think I saw your hands
I think I almost reached your outstretched arms
With the sun comes the fear
Lighting all things unseen
And wisping me away fro You
Why do I have to embrace the love of Christ




",Case of Emergency,2007
Cool Hand Luke,"Last night my shadow ran from me
It bowed its head in shame
I can't bear my reflection
I can't even write my name
Sometimes I choose to forget about you
Sometimes I choose to ignore the truth
Just like the man from chapter three
I tried to hide
From fleeing, familiar
White light
Sometimes I choose to forget about you
Sometimes I choose to ignore the truth
How sweet the name
How sweet the face
That I long to touch with dirty hands
I'm seeing sideways
Because I've fallen down again
And it's so hard to find my way




",Sideways,2007
Cool Hand Luke,"You've gone and done it again
Taken everything I have and multiplied by ten
Here I'm the lepper you washed clean
1/9 of the citizens who never stopped to say a single thing
And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything
I count my blessings
But never turn to see their origin
Here I stand a blessed man
Back turned to my benefactor
And my only friend
How does it feel to be denied The friendship that you wanted so much
You would bow to me and even die
And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything
I count my blessings
But never turn to see their origin
Who Am I?
Who am I that you would bow and put your knees to dirty ground?
Who am I to meet the king and have him wash my soiled feet?
You met me here, whispered in my ear
Now I melt into you (x2)
And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything
I count my blessings
But never turn to see their origin
Jesus, I feel you changing me

This is a thank you
This is a thank you
This is a thank you
This is I'm sorry

Strapped like a beeper on my hip

Hop in the Lac with Axl Foley

And some bitches know me

Them bitches love holding pockets
Get out a pocket
I'll knock your jaw out your socket
Then squash this
Fold up a little S-see

Which nigga gonna meet Elvis Presley
Best be like what up my niggas let up like a Nestles Crunch
And start to punch niggas
Soon they gonna crunch
Fall on the dance floor

Penitentiary chances for my cash advances

Brings this to your hood late night for the trip gold hund's
I want my fetty in tons
Gangs and guns
Five thousand stash what the sum
A nickel slick nigga and I'm up with the sun
So what you got for me cooking in the kitchen
Two birds hella sift got my motherfucking palms itching
So scandalous and my east coast dunns
Shit foaming and bubbling
For my money and the doubling
Respect that the Yak track got me caught up
All this ""D"" and the scrilla ain't never enough

I had some confrontation with some cocky-ass Cuban
He said some black squabbling for some cheddar
And then he had to deepen and dict the vendetta
Well anyway I gave my baby mamma my Buretta
And told her that some Cubans might try to come get her
But meanwhile I'm a try to peel them first
But if they invade let your heater disperse
Cock it back bang, bang and do your thing girl

Why I should play 
Yeah you hurt me
Desert me I just can't take
The loneliness you give me
I just can't go

Cooli Blaze,"It's been a long time, since you and I got together 
Like old times, say the next time is way even better
We should reinvent, no wait
My casa nawl your place
And when you throw it back, I'm going to handle up
On a Tuesday we be going up
'Cause it's going down and you like it, so enticing
Got you mind gone and that body party inviting, and I'm liking
Everything I see, 
No limits to your Master P and I'm bout it bout it
But I make you say, Uh 
When I'm going in and in and out it
And that's real shit, flashbacks of us sweating
My body all over your body, be the answer to all these questions
I got you, cause you're into me and I'm into you
Can't say what I will and what I won't do, ain't much for words I'll rather show you so

I hope you're, ready,
For what I, got in store
Tonight's gone, be so
Epic, if you let me
It's gone be an epic night, taking advantage of you
It's gone be an epic night, got you doing things you'll say you never do
It's gone be an epic night, it's gone be an epic night
It's gone be an epic night, a night to remember

You bad as hell and you know it girl
'Cause that thang there is so potent girl
When dress it up now model in it, damn, see I need a minute
Just to admire you and your silhouette, stop, this may take a sec
Got your photograph in my memory
See the mood is right now it's time we make new memories
Straddle me like a surfboard, drunk in love now brace for it
What I got in store you can't pay for, and when you squirt you're going to want more
Another round you whispering in my ear, and I'll take you there 
From the bed to the floor to the couch, as long as I get you there
You know how it goes, scratching, curled toes
It's an epic night full of role play with head board knocking and 12 play
If you like the shit then I love it
Later on you can think about it, I know fucking well you'll think about it
Let it soak in, now you're hoping that we stay the night
'Cause a nigga like me in the morning, I'm beat, beat, beat it more than twice, nice

I hope you're, ready
For what I, got in store
Tonight's gone, be so
Epic, if you let me
It's gone be an epic night, taking advantage of you
It's gone be an epic night, got you doing things you'll say you never do
It's gone be an epic night, it's gone be an epic night
It's gone be an epic night, a night to remember

It's gone be,
An epic night
It's gone be
An epic night
I'm gone give you everything you desire
Bring your love and passion baby I'm give you that fire
Enjoy yourself, I'm gone enjoy myself
Let's make it a rememberable night

And I ate everything momma put on my plate
Niggaz walked around packin be	-be	 guns
Knock on yo' door and run, just for fun

We went to the sto' and sold bottles fo' a nickel
To feast upon a big bag of Cheetos and a pickle
You could get a soda foe less than quarter, and
People used to speak even if they didn't know ya

We fought in the streets like little black soldiers
Shake hands, and still be friends when it was over
We used to play tag and, hide and go seek, or
Hide and go get it if we had a few freaks, but

Now thangs changed, kids ain't the same
They bang, and slang, and blow out brains
I wish I could go back but, wishin is for suckers
Life was so simple then

When we used to hang
On the porch, drinkin brew
And now they drive-by (bay-bee)
I remember (I remember) ohhhhhhh

Runnin through the streets of Onessa P-A
I take you through my childhood step by step
Daddy always told me to maintain my rep though

Daddy was a dawg he ain't raise no punks
In the midst of the trees we learned how to thump
At the tender age of nine momma put us on a plane
Next stop -- the land of the insane

Compton California where the killers grow
Forced to live a life that I didn't know
Wore the wrong colors cause I didn't know the facts
Call her bitch, caught a case, caught a slug in my back

But I adapted quickly, suckers tried to get me
Now the fools better run cause this just driveby Billy
Little black boy from the East
Forced to be a killer, but I can still remember

I remember (I remember) ohhhhhhh
When we used to play
Domino, on the porch

Army fights, in the smog
But now they gang-bang (bay-bee)

 Get a piece of paper, ball that motherfucker up
 and play with it! Hahahaha

I got Tha Alkaholik juice to wake ya up like a rooster
Back when I was young, I used to be a booster
Stealin candy from the sto', go to school, come up
I had the whole playground, chewin all my gum up

You know what I'm sayin? Playin still to the chest
And I was the best, playin kickball at recess
I play Pop Warner, golden pairs for the losers
We used to hop corners on the fresh deuce cruisers

Playin Galaga, Space Invaders, eatin Reese's
I had all the women cause my tough skins had creases
And it's been that way since day one
Girls of the world ain't nothin but fun

I used to watch Dr. J, come through in the clutch
Remember New Zoo Review, and Starsky and Hutch
I remember lunchtime, we used to rhyme out loud

Ohhh, my life, no no
I do remember ohhhhhhhh

I remember yesterday

I remember when we played
I remember yesterday, aoowwwwwww!

Coolio,"Back in the days when I was a young buck
Stuck like a truck gettin shit outta luck
Times was rough and I didn't have a plan
I was barely on the edge of my life as a man
It's really fucked up when there's dope in the crib
No food in the kitchen for the motherfuckin kids
That's why a young nigga learned how to steal,see
Shopliftin laid me a whole lotta meals
But I remember days when the cupboard was bare and
Life was unfair but who the fuck cares?
I still hear Momma,what she used to tell me
That you don't get shit in this life for free
And even if I never ever make it to the mountain top
Fuck it!I fight for my hip-hop
Not everybody can relate to what I been through
Even though some front and they try to pretend to
Know about the life of a kid and the strife
Where he has to live in the shadow of a base-pipe
Good goes to bad,bad goes to worse
And pretty soon he's stealin from his own Momma's purse
So clean out ya ears and open up your eyes
I reach out to touch but somebody moved the sky
My stomach is growlin,word is born
'cause all I had for dinner was a can-o-corn

BRIDGE
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
All I had for dinner was a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
Before I went to school I had a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
I tried to get full off a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn,a can-o-corn
That's all the fuck that we had in the kitchen

A few years later,I pledge a legions to the set
I'm growin up but I ain't grown yet
It's funny how the strain in a life filled with pain
Can sometimes leave a bitch stained on the brain
I'm sittin in the restaurant,guardin my food like a eagle
Pickin up scraps like a seagull
Waitin on the people at the next table to leave a tip
So I can put it in my pocket
Phoney Easter Bunny,Santa Claus and the stork
We was poor as fuck so we ate a lot of pork
And it ain't no motherfuckin way no how
When it come up I let you bring me down
So I stick to the boots and I'm down with a MAAD group
Of gangstas and hoodlums,but you can call em 'scroops'
Give me liberty or give me death
'cause a man without pride ain't got shit left,huh
And now that I'm older with kids of my own 
I put me in the pot where it used to be a bone
Get'cha self together,word is born
'cause a man can't live on a can-o-corn",Can-O-Corn,1994
Coolio,"Once upon a time in a land called fuck 
Lived a duck named Donald and his mother was a cluck 
Mickey Mouse wore a rag  pants in a sag 
Neighborhood kingpin  but his brother was a fag 

Donald had beef  so Mickey couldn't sleep 
They was hootin' for a while  and it was gettin' kinda deep 
Bugs Bunny had the props on the Eastside spots 
Known to hit a five from a mile with a shot 

Goofy was Mickey Mouse right hand man 
One day smoked a stick, and came up with a brand 
Called Pixie and Dixie, two killers from Chicago 
A game of 5K, to eliminate Donald 

But what they didn't know, is Donald was a G 
Had big time respect, from the West to the East 
Haps up see, and listen to the funk 
First chapter in the funky cartoon from the ghetto 

Huey and Duey and Louie with a 
Shot down Mickey Mouse made .. Minnie 
Everybody know Minnie got shot down 
And the cop on the case was Huckleberry Hound 

Huckleberry had a Deputy, by the name of Dog 
Eye-witness to the crime was Kermit the Frog 
But Kermit was scared and he wouldn't testify 
Pixie and Dixie just did a drive by 

On Donald Duck, but they shot and they missed 
And now Bugs Bunny is gettin' kind of pissed 
'Cause the shot that they missed hit his homeboy Elmer 
Bugs sellin' drugs on the motherfuckin' corner 

The future's lookin' shitty in fuck city 
So they called in the Feds, Beetlejuice and Miss Piggy 
Shit's on the street, no that's how it goes 
Scene two in the funky cartoon from the ghetto 

Now the war is on and Mickey Mouse is dead 
Quick Draw McGraw took two to the head 
Huey and Duey and Louie got caught

Bugs Bunny got popped, in a bar gettin' drunk 
Bullet fucked up Beetlejuice, while Miss Piggy had a pump 

Donald got the word that his nephews was snitchin' 
So Tom and Jerry stuck em on they way to the kitchen 
Goofy was a punk and everybody knew 
Him and Huckleberry Hound was spotted drinkin' brew

There's a buster on the West Side, I heard he gotta grip
And he's outta town on business so I'm schemin' on his shit
I heard he got ki's and Gs and deeds
And guns and big trash bags full o' weed
I stole a brand new fresh shaft telephone van
So now I guess I'm the telephone man
The bathroom window ain't got no alarm
I gotta skeleton brick that works like a charm
It didn't take long to find what I was lookin' for
I was damned near finished when I heard a key in the door
I jumped in the closet and checked my clip
Pulled my ski mask down, I can't believe this shit
I counted to five and the front door opened up
I counted three more and the front door was shut
I counted five more to give me some space
Then I jumped out the closet and bucked him in the face
I loaded up the van in broad daylight

Keep cryin and tell em I'll be home soon
Oh baby I'm goin crazy
'cause I keep seein shit that amaze me
Still I had to kill a motherfucker last week
He thought I was a punk and tried to creep up on me in my sleep
I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch or buck ya

Verse 2: LeShaun
The kids keep askin where's their papa?
I had to tell em daddy got caught by the coppers
It's time for me to raise em up proper by myself
It's a goddamn struggle when a bitch ain't got no help
Now everybody tellin me that you ain't shit black
and when you get out, you'll jack and probably go right the fuck back
Damn, the pressure's gettin hot and heavy
and yeah, I'm gettin sweated by your homey in the blue and white Chevy
But now he's got a condo and a brand new Lexus
Wants me to take a trip with him down to Texas
The ends don't justify the means
and in another life he might've been the man of my dreams

Don't you make me break up outta this motherfucker
and start killin motherfuckers, SHIT!
I know it's rough, I know it's tough
but when you fumble in the game sometimes you get locked up
You better stay away punk ass bitch, he ain't shit
I don't want to have to kill him
'cause think about the times that we used to have
Don't make me reach out and touch that ass
You put yourself in danger when you fuck with a buster
Like shootin dice without a pistol in a circle of murderers
You got more class than the average-type hooker bitch
Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich
Now I gotta check but if you've got the cheque
Give a nigga a look and put somethin on my books

Verse 4: LeShaun
Aiyo remember the homey with the Lexus, he took the trip to Texas
now he's wearin the fuckin Lexus like a necklace
So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a bitch to do?
My nigga's stretched in the pen since '92
Them visits ain't doin the trick, drop fucks make me sick
'cause this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip
And that motherfucker representin you, I think he resents you
He got evidence he never presents to
the people in court, I heard witnesses abortin
What's he doin about gettin you out to hold the fort?
I got some ends, I'ma send you a dime and two doves
Mama hates you but damn I got love for a gangsta

Southern California, LA is where it's at
I'm smokin like a motherfuckin choo-choo train
Big cocaine inside my brain, aah
But nobody knows that I'm on the hype
Use to be in CREAM, well now I hit the pipe

No bitches, no friends, no ends to spend

Daddy's in the pen doin life
Sister gotta husband, she's a wife
And I'm in the backyard hittin the pipe
It's been three or four months since I started usin
It's a uphill battle and now I know I'm losin
I go to the spots where my face ain't familiar
and I cook here jack 'cause I don't know these niggas

Disgusted because my own mama don't trust me
My sister's on the trip 'cause she knows I'm on the hit
And I can't take this shit
There's a rumour goin round that I'm puffin heavily
and my neighbours is lookin at me crazy, G
I guess they figured out that I broke in they house
and stole all they shit while they was out
My sister told my aunt and my aunt told Pam
and Pam let it slip to that bitch Roxanne
Roxanne told Bill and Bill told Duke
Now the whole hood knows that I play the flute
But before I lost my respect
I didda lick your dumb ass on a jet, SHIT!
Now I'm back to life, yeah I'm back to reality
Ain't no side effects or technicalities
There's one thing about it when your life is fucked
At the bottom the only way to go is up, aah

Coolio,"Verse 1:

I know a place where the trees don't grow
Just another place where niggaz live low
I know a place where life is fucked up
Make a wrong move and your ass get stuck up
Time ain't nothin but a frame of mind
And life is like a mountain or a steep ass climb
I've been lookin for a place to leave
The only free place is inside of me
So let's take a trip, and you don't need a grip
But you better be equipped cause it might be some shit
African-American, nothin but a nigga
Had our fingers on the trigger, but I pulled mine quicker
I know a place where there ain't no calm and
You better stay away if you're soft like Charmin
South Central, Los Angeles, Watts, and Compton
A nigga on the west coast on his way to Harlem

Verse 2:

Now it's time to step into the light (Light)
Put up your dukes, there's gonna be a fight (Fight)
And when it's time to fight, you better fight right
Cause if it don't fight right, out goes the light
Take a close look at what I'm freakin on
Niggaz think I'm tweekin, but I'm speakin on
Subject matter, data
Information that I gather
Through my travels
Cause the hardest of the hard, hit hardcore killer
Can't stop the slug of a nine millimeter
Everybody thinks they know, but they know not
If they haven't caught a cap on the block *gunshot*
So shine up your boots and pick up the pieces
Grab a fresh pair of khakis with the sharp ass creases
Ring the alarm, here comes the storm
I got a firearm on my way to Harlem

Verse 3:

I know a place where the sun don't shine
Everybody is a victim of neighborhood crime
I know a place where niggaz walk the line
One false step and they must do time
Since I'm in the same boat 
I must stay afloat
And sing every note
From the quotes that they wrote
So, I look into the past and walk the path of the greats
So I won't make the same mistakes that sealed my ancestors fates
If I had to be a slave I'd rather be in my grave
If I get in how many lives could I save?
One, two, three, a hundred, a thousand
My heart is poundin, the devil keeps soundin
But he don't want my money, he wants my soul
So I reach like a tree, and like a weed I grow
My stomach is full, but my mind is starvin

Coolio,"Brainiac, with a zany act, cleptomaniac
Before I go to work I smoke me a fat sack
Of indo, then climb through the window
And eye the VCR, and load it in the Pinto, huh!
Yes I'm on my way to the bait
or should I say the pawn shop, but I don't smoke rocks
Some people say I'm crazy and they think I'm on crack
Cause I hock all the shit and I never get it back
Coolio loco, you better call Bronco
Stole a link from my auntie, and sold it to my uncle
Took the flowers from a hearse, romanced a nurse
Put the girl to sleep then I went through her purse
Bandit, underhanded, yes I'm skanless
Snake in the grass fool, I'm taking chances
If the price is right, you can call me a killer

Coolio call me shady, janky, slick right
You and your crew better duck from my gunshots
I takes no shit, carryin no drama
If I can't get you I bust a cap on your momma
I never had a grip, so I learn how to shoplift
My trenchcoat is long and now I got some fresh shit
Yeah, buddy, sht's lookin good
Gets much props and respect from the hood
Caps from my raps and a trunk full of hubcaps
Step to the crew, and you're bound to catch a pimp slap
But I don't pimp no bitch for my dough
They got somethin I want, I just rob the hoe
Early birds catch the worm so I crow like a rooster
They follow me round the store because they know that I'm a booster
Tell me what you want and I'll be the stealer
Call me Coolio, or call me Sticky Fingers

Turn out the lights and get ready for the sock up
One plus three equals four for the knockout
Got circles on that ass like a Mike Tyson PunchOut
You better hide your shit if you want to keep it
I'm driving down the street in your 'llac while you're sleepin
I was born with a sickness, that they call brokeness
Never said I was the best, but I'm damn sure the loc'est
Up, up, and away, like a rocket
Some fool got shot, now I'm goin through his pockets
He won't be needin no dollars where he's goin
And when I get to hell I'ma act like I don't know him
I'm takin everything that ain't bolted to the floor

and Hekkyl & Jekkyl wit some saggy ass titties
A big fat flagrant hoodrat hooker
and the nigga got the nerve to pretend she's a hooker
Sportin that down from your arm like a Simpson
Talk about bitches that you wish you was pimpin
Come around the homies and you swear that she's playin
But everytime I see her, you're beggin

When I was young I used to have fun
fuckin with ugly bitches

look like buckwheat mixed with opi
Toe up, toe up, straight from the floor
and her bad ass breath is about to make me throw up
Niggas started dissin and you blamed it on the gin
but the very next day you was with the bitch again
Now your ass is gettin clowned like Bozo
but that's what you get for fuckin with that ugly ho
I don't know what possessed you, nigga
Stand that hooker in front of a trigger
Spendin your time with a big goony-goo-goo

Holdin her hand as he walks through the plaza
I try to play it off but I couldn't hold my laughter

Put her on a BOOM and send her back to the covent
Cookin up a plan in a big, black cauldron
And the dumb ass nigga don't know that he's fallin
into a trap 'cause now the whore is pregnant
9 months later and she's squirted on an insect
He don't want to claim it, she went and got a test
Now he's sendin child support in a big fat cheque
My nigga got depressed and he started drinkin liquor
One night he got drunk, went to her house and killed her
Riches to rags and rags to riches
but that's what'cha get when you fuck with ugly bitches

Then I bust a left for the 121
Pull it into park and lay it on the grass
I roll back the ride, so I can see some ass

Pop in the tape and a match
West when I fly I take the exit o'

Two fools at the light, they stared me up
But I just look 'em in the eye and I say, ""whats up?""
And even though I really don't want no trouble
I got thirty-one replies to bust your bubble
I don't really wanna hurt nobody

I just wanna kick it, yeah, that's the ticket

There's a whole pack o' rats' ass standin' in the front
So I drops the ass and let the sistas bump
Here comes one now, she's on the tip
She says she likes the way my woofers kick
But I don't fall in love with every girl I see
So I pass up two and go straight to three
She got a ass like the back of a bus, 'cause
And that's why I say
I let her hit my twenty, got straight to the point
Whats up? Do you wanna kick it or what?
I ain't got time to be frontin',

We fought in the streets like little black soldiers 
Shake hands, and still be friends when it was over 
We used to play tag and, hide and go seek, or 
Hide and go get it if we had a few freaks, but 
Now thangs changed, kids ain't the same 
They bang, and slang, and blow out brains 
I wish I could go back but, wishin is for suckers 
Life was so simple then 

[Chorus:]
I remember (I remember) ohh 
When we used to hang 
On the porch, drinkin brew 
And now they drive-by (bay-bee) 
I remember (I remember) ohh
When we used to play 
Shoot-em-up, up and down 
But now they gang-bang (bay-bee) 

[Billy Boy]
Well I remember yesteryear like it was yesterday 
Runnin through the streets of Onessa P-A 
I take you through my childhood step by step 
Daddy always told me to maintain my rep though 
Daddy was a dog he ain't raise no punks 
In the midst of the trees we learned how to thump 
At the tender age of nine momma put us on a plane 
Next stop -- the land of the insane 
Compton California where the killers grow 
Forced to live a life that I didn't know 
Wore the wrong colors cause I didn't know the facts 
Call her bitch, caught a case, caught a slug in my back 
But I adapted quickly, suckers tried to get me 
Now the fools better run cause this just drive-by Billy 
Little black boy from the East 
Forced to be a killer, but I can still remember 

[Chorus]

[Coolio]
Back when I was a kid nigga 
We used to have this game called paperball 
(Paperball? What the fuck is that?) 
Get a piece of paper, ball that motherfucker up 
And play with it! Hahahaha 

[J-Ro]
I got the alcoholic juice to wake ya up like a rooster 
Back when I was young, I used to be a booster 
Stealin candy from the sto', go to school, come up 
I had the whole playground, chewin all my gum up 
You know what I'm sayin? Playin still to the chest 
And I was the best, playin kickball at recess 
I play Pop Warner, golden pairs for the losers 
We used to hop corners on the fresh deuce cruisers 
Playin Galaga, Space Invaders, eatin Reese's 
I had all the women cause my tough skins had creases 
And it's been that way since day one 
Girls of the world ain't nothin but fun 
I used to watch Dr. J, come through in the clutch 
Remember New Zoo Review, and Starsky and Hutch 
I remember lunchtime, we used to rhyme out loud 
Peace to the Wop and the hip-hop crowd, I remember 

[Chorus] 

Ohhh, my life, no no 
I do remember ohhhhhhhh 
I know you do 
I remember yesterday 
I remember when we played 
I remember yesterday, aoowww! 
I remember, hell, when we used to play 
In ghetto blocks through the dark 
I remember 
Yeah yeah yeah 
We used to play dominoes all night long 
Dominoes all night long 
Yesterday, yesterday 
Do you remember yesterday? I remember yesterday 
You remember remember remember remember...",I Remember,1995

Blockin' up the street
Flossin' back on your keys
An' everybody's sayin' you're the man loc
Never broke
An' high off that pream old smoke
Sippin' in the seat
Rollin' in the ragtop Chevy '63
The p.i.m.p.
On top of the game
But now you're gettin' laid
'cause that gak weed o' yay is playin' tricks on your brain
You're lookin' for a way out
Before your game play out
'cause once you game play out
Ya lose all ya' kriz out
Late one night you was rollin' down the block
With a half a pint of yat and the twenty dollar rock
One-time got behind you and they told you to stop
But you kept rollin' 'cause ya said you wasn't broke
Out like a sucka
You dumb mothafucka

How the hell do you think you can run

Well he betta catch her quick

Nine is his waist
That's the new game loc, 'cause
If you ain't heated then you might get smoked
He was walkin' down the street
Mindin' his business
Just happy to be free
And what do we see?
From the corner of his house
Here come one-time
So off he dashed
Like they set fire to his ass
'cause if he get caught
It's strike number three
An' this might be his last day on the street
I bet next time you'll listen when I tell ya son

Sunbeamin' this weekend; heading down that beach way
Messin' with my girl's hair; one of them games that we play
Braids bouncin' to the beat; feel me coming down the street
She gotta be a freak if she's sittin' next to me, so
Shine up your hoopty and fall in line
Bring your honey if she's fine, and we gon' have a good time
To the outskirts of first, buzzin' off the erky jerks
Swoopin' while I puts in work; now watch me skirt

Park up at the spot; I ain't gonna front; I'm tryin' to mess around

And to get where you go ya got to push an' shove
Around the way girl with hope in your heart
Do his five in the purse an' five in the start
She's the kinda woman ya take home to momma
The only kind you ever let get past the drama

And it's time to put you up on a pedestal seat

And you know how I know that you were put here first

And use your God-given talents and abilities
No matta where ya from ya get much respect
From the top of your neck to your county check
I see ya waitin' for the bus in the early morn

I ain't no cap to save a ho

An' should be down wit' your ass when your poor and broke
And um uh
Every time ya need I'll owe ya
Gotta do is make a phone call, 'cause
When ya say 'come' ya know she's on her way
Wit' no hesitance
An' any type of the leg
I talk about my granny

Hold up just a sec Coolio I'm on deck (Malika) 
Yep the diction is on point 
'Causin'  friction when I flex up the jaw to hit the joint 

That can actually give a blood mob like Gotti 
Like the body cool  keep the strap up by the naughties 
Niggie trippin' why you beam us I don't step up with no bullshit 
See that there it's clip for this stickup on the hip 

Peep the correct way to get your pimp on 
Let me hit the bong oh and my mind's quite strong 
Wreck it nice and proper if it's on I'm finsta to stop her 
If I'm swingin' for the knockout, best believe I'm fits to drop her 

Ninety-five's on poppin', representin' I keep stompin' 
Throw up my fists just like this when I'm mobbin'

I'm deep like Denzel with my Crimson Tide, nigga

I'm Hi-see like Spike Lee within Tales From the Hood 

You need it, I'll feed it, baby check the size 
Have you Goin' Down like Mary J. Blige

Don't none of y'all niggaz want to fuck with us 
So what's the time? It's time to get real 
Why you bust your rhyme? Cause that's how I bail 

Watch me, swallow this nickel and shit five pennies 
I'm the loc'est of them all though the rat is kinda skinny 
How many linny and squidgy think they can see me? 
I'm from Compton where even in the summer niggaz wear beanies 

Bustin' lyrics sharper than razor blades catch it from head to toe 
if you're shocked, then amazed, when you see me at my stage show 
For my stage show beat em up 
40 Thevz gettin' busy rockin' coast to coast 

Dogs the most rap the hoes then rocks em up 
Givin' it up for hip-hop vicitims how should I drop em and then pop em 
for poppin' like to get what I got, and I ain't got a whole lot of 
Nothin' 

'Cause I been ruffin' and scuffin' so give it up when I'm bustin' or get to duckin' 
'Cause I ain't given em nothin'

Mental plus my gene equals nasty young bastard 

The raps be lung mastered takin' vinyl's virginity 
Coincidentally I run shit like Walter Payton 
Niggaz player hatin' cause I spoke like a Dayton 
I kick the bass like Ron Carter at the Carter when 

C and B came strollin' 
Blowin' niggaz up like when Mookie's stupid ass got caught smokin' 
Figure, your stigma is lack of enigma 
So bitch-ass niggaz better step, like the Delta Sigma Thetas 

We don't give a fuck, fools better duck 
39 deep in the back of Wino's truck 
Like robbin' in the paint, fool think I ain't? 
Your crew is on stank, that's why I'm pullin' rank 

I rev like a motor float ON like a boat to 
kick a style like Tical from here to North Dakota 
The ambassador of funk with amps in the trunk 
And when it's time to rock a mic I won't be no punk 

I bring death to the evil and power to the people 
My name ain't Steve Miller but I Fly Like an Eagle 
Don't play me for a chump, I get around like Gump 
And I, got more con in my verse than Chuck 

And you don't want no motherfuckin' problems here 
'Cause I can round up a posse like Paul Revere 
Your whole crew'll get took out, turned out, shook out 
Burned up like a cookout, so fools better look out 

Fresh out the penalty box 
Sportin' a stockin' cap, cut off dickies, and some high-top striped socks 
The freestyle finatic pyschosomatic back at it causin' static 
With lyrics still as tight as a straight jacket 

The last in line but one of the first to get wit cha 
Bringin' more terror to MC's than a Michigan militia 
Click click boom, nigga fuck your crew 
It's the chanky hip-hopper, takin' over pissin' in your stage monitor 

socket you think that you can fuck with mine in your wildest dreams 
You best to wake up and apologize 
Niggaz penitentiary yearn me 'cause I, burn like Parker 
but anyway, half of y'all couldn't see me with a pair of Blu Blockers 

The lyrical night stalker stalkin' at night in a pair of creased Khakis 
Chuck Taylors, my pistol grip tight 
Dub-see, that nigga from Westside MAAD Circle 
Ay man! Ay ay. 

What's up Wino? 
Uh like loc, it's like late, let's get the fuck up out of here 
Are we out?

So Coolio loco gonna put you up on game
We got homies who sell straps
Homies who sell crack
Homies who sell the bomb chronic sacks that's a fact
Cause, you from the neighborhood niggas love
Pimps, players, suckers, hoes, forty thieves, ganstas, and thugs
To unwrap the strap before you know what
The loudmouth one loced up in front of the icecream truck
And broke all of the sills where the big G's live
The little homie be gettin' out on account
This time he might get stuck attempted
One eight seven and he's a minor  with pride
So the DA want him tried as an adult
The big homey just had a son no joking
I think his baby's mom is smoking cause she always broke
And the young girls is dressing more and more sleazy
And everybody and their momma talking bout OJ defense

To the hoochies in the Hondas and Sentras
Young niggas fightin' their case with public defenders

Dead cats in the street playing craps

The nosy bitch up the street called 9-1-1 now
One time his d jacked a nigga and old bitch

""All I got is a drivers permit""
Niggas can't have shit we got dogs that rip but don't even trip
Welcome to Southern California
Liquor stores and churches on every other corner
Your little brother plays pop warner
Darks raided the dope spot
Eight year old kid got shot 'cause they mistook his BB gun for a glok
And I ain't forgot about the homey Lano
He got killed by a sucker way back in the eighties oh
I heard the homies mighties is ballin' out of state
He got himself off unemployment checks in Section 8

Hey the homiez kickin' it real
Yeh I hear what he's sayin' loc
Sometimes it's just like that in the hood

Who got jacked he tried to pull out his gat
Pulling sex in through his back

And niggas is going to the barber to get a fade
They carried their dead homey to his grave
Pour out a little liquor
Homegirl down the street with the green eyes and big titties is getting 
thicker
Neighborhood clubs beat him up and crackheads be selling tvs and vcrs
For forty bucks so what's up
Yesterday the homey committed a bank caper
Saw the chase on the news and read the story in today's paper
His little girl's just now taking training wheels off her bike
While her daddy's got twenty-five to life at Fort Strike
The little homey just tripped and stripped
Because he didn't realize that the joint was dipped
That's right
OG's joining the nation and it's all good
Big G's is retaliating cause they enemies are crossed out the hood

Crackhead momma's smoking whole accounting checks

Forty-five let me tell you how I learned my lesson
House party in the hood at some niggas I don't know
But I had to go they had a house full of hos

I stepped into that party with my nigga high off that head
The hos is looking good so we try to make a friend for night
Let's get it right let's get it straight
But now these punkass niggas in the party want to play a hate

I'd bust a cap to save a rat so what's up with that
It's 1996 so these bustas get no kinda of doubt
Like American Express here we go again
I never leave home without it so don't even think about it

Just let me leave and I won't have to make you bleed
But if you make an offensive move then I'm gonna have to show a groove
Back up off let's keep it soft
Don't make me have to show you who these 16 bosses be

This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside

This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside

Way back in the days we dudes don't forget a name
Now everybody wants the fame but things change ain't the same
All these sucker set-trippin killin for no reason
That's why I never leave the house without my nina

I love my baby carry my baby wherever I go
For these suckers get in a twist they say I beat their pimpin
Stop wishin you was in my shoes
And learn to be yourself stop acting like somebody else

It's ninety-six and most of the homeys thinking of six feet
The six I found out if you wear partners where the friends go
Every week you don't see me I gotta put at work 
I guess the shit don't stop till my gaskets drop

Stop hating my life and get your own
Be true to this game or this game will do you cold
Everywhere I go I got my back
I hate to do my all black but I must stay strapped

This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside

This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside

No no oooo I can't escape this life
I been trying to live in piece but these fools won't cease
They insist with their bullshit so I got a full clip
Chitty-chitty bang-bang doin it's a new thing

One shot from a Jake .38 can make your brain ache
I'm the kinda nigga that don't believe in frontin'
But if you run up on me trippin you best believe I'm dumpin'
I got bills to pay and kids to raise

And a whole generation of lost niggas to save
So I ain't got time for that yip yap
If you start some static I'm gonna have to blow your mind back
Believe that nigga daisy if you do it's true

Fuck with Coo you get done that's how we do it to it
Don't start no shit and it won't be none son
But if you do I'm going for my gun
Like Doc Holliday a nigga ain't scary

So if you want to trip then I'll be your huckleberry

Beer drinkin beer beer drinkin eight ball

[Chorus: x4]
Got kinda high and uhh kinda drunk
Beer drinkin beer beer drinkin eight ball

I'm sittin' at the bar with a hundred dollar bill
The homies is runnin' late so I got some time to kill
I'm peepin' out this freak in the booth in the corner
I think I seen her rollin a Noble nosin under and moanin

Two hookers walked in and they was lookin' for a vic
But they, kept on passin' me by coz they can recognize a trick
Twenty minutes later and two double shots of yak
I take a look up at the clock, now where the FUCK the homies at

I feel my pagers on my hipbone, who could it be
'Cause I done talked to everybody that I was 'sposed to see
Hahaa! Now I know, the story is told
And I don't even call 'em back cuz they don't know the homie cold

I received a page my niggas from the phone in the back
I got a wink from a fine ass sista dressed in black
Another double shout of yak and now the room is spinnin'
But that's only the beginning, god damn!

[Chorus]

I take a walk out to the front to get myself some air and
see if I see the homies, but they still ain't there
There's a fool outside drunk and he want to get into it
I was strapped I coulda killed him, but I didn't do it

I opted for the walk-away, watch the busta talk away
So mister policeman, you can put your chalk away
I mobb back in the club, and, kick it at my table
'Cause, niggaz be acting stupid, and stupid shit is fatal

The homies is hella late, and now I'm startin' to think
Homegirl that gave me the wink from earlier just bought me a drink
She's sittin' at a stool at the other side of the bar
Doing tricks with her tounge and a cherry like a porno star

The club is gettin' packed and the party is jumpin
Another double shot of yak and I'm on the dancefloor bumpin'
She's licking in my ear and, now I'm feeling faded
It's 11:35 and the homies still ain't made it

[Chorus]

Now I'm on the dance floor with baby and, shit is gettin' hectic
The big homey done erected, damn I've been affected
By the funk in the boom and the booty in the room
This ain't the Commodores but this Brick House got me on zoom

Now I'm mackin' and struttin' and asking baby wassup
My name ain't Everlast, but I can still make you jump
let's, hope in the Q and go somewhere and kick it like some Trojans
We can do a little drinkin', and do a little smoking

When all of a sudden I start sweatin', my stomach starts bubblin'
I hear earl coming, I think I'm in trouble *vomit sounds*
Ahh shit, I got baby on her titties
I guess there go my chances of gettin with her kitty

I turn around and stumble away and there go the homies with
long ass trenchcoats on, laughing, sippin on 40's
Now I'm in the back of my own car curled up like a punk
'Cause I got too high and uhh, got too drunk

From the shores of Maine all the way to Compton Cali

Take a real close at what it look like

The first thing momma told him was don't take no shit
Playin tag with body bag,
Bullets,
And bloody rag
And did you put the dodge on the toe tag?
Whoever the man today, might not be the man tomarrow
'cause life is full of hardships, pimpslaps, and sorrow
Ya gotta believe in something, but whatever ya do
Make sure what you believe is real and true
Fuck the liez an' alibiez an' come to realize
My vision won't assault of wasted on blind lil' eyes
Like A T an' T ya gotta make a switch
O' get pushed to the side like a lil' ol' bitch....

With my finga on the trigga of a Mossburgh Pump
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be right there
With my nine in my hand and braids in my hair

I've been hollerin' and hoopin' yeah
Lootin' an' shootin'
I'm doin' some recruitin' to bring mo' troops in
Niggaz don't be doin' what they 'posed to do
They betta post on the corna with the busta crew
Playin' games I used to play back in '79
With the same bullshit an' the same ol' lie
If you want some respect ya won't be individual
On the nigga nuts 'cause he rollin' in the Sixty-fo'
Yo favorite line is fuck all a y'all
But one day there's gonna be a final call
That's why I'm rollin' deep in the motherfuckin' Jeep
Always on the peep an' my crew don't fall asleep
So pull your money outa your pocket an' put it in the middle
This ain't no roosta ass Chicken George nigga on a fiddle, huh
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In my mothafuckin' self I trust....

-Chorus-

Way back in the dayz we used to sling 'em in the street
But now when niggaz get beat
They want to go an' get their heat
Everybody know that you know how to kill
But tell me do you how to let a nigga live
I gotta dream that maybe one day
Niggaz can't fight then walk away
I'm talkin' fist to cuff with them pistols up, an'
Shoot 'em from the shoulders
To show them you can hold your
I sing the song of the fight of the black man
In America
In a state of hysteria
No longa will I accept the second rate
I plan to set the record straight be	'fore I disobey
Its the one - two combination punch to the throat
There's a hole in ya boat bitch

One night of pleasure nine months of pain
three days later and that's when you came
two arms two legs ten fingers ten toes
brown eyes like mom, with your grandmothers nose
even though you're momma's baby
and daddy's little baby
my love is unconditional to one of us is swayze
day or night, roll the light
no matter what you do,
like the Jackson 5 said I'll be there for you coz
my life is your life and your life is mine
to thinkin'en I'm your friend 'til the end of time
I'll make sure you get your props
you can call me pops
and anything you need I'll pull it out of the stops
even though we're not together like we used to be
D A D D why, you can count on me
coz when I'm feelin' down every now and then
I take a look into your eyes and then smile again

Rhyme 2:

Forget about Batman, Superman and the Power Rangers
coz I'ma be your hero if you ever in some danger

daddy don't take no mess
and I ain't gone settle for nothing less than your very best
when I do what I do coz you did what you did
It's coz I ain't the kind of father that be raising no dumb-ass kids
You gosta be a leader, it's my responsiblity to teach ya

together so and ever

when you's a grown woman and you's a grown man
I got open ears when the world ain't tryin' hear
when I can't be there in the flesh I be there in the spir-it
I'm tryina make an impression on the things that you care for
the knowledge that I give, you could teach your kids
I know it's hard growing up coz I used to be a youngsta
so we don't work as a team, saw the liquor take us under

coz I'm down with the children all the way 'til the end

Skin had a satin texture
The feeling she gave me was
More than I could measure and 
Right away I 
Knew I had to have her with me
If not with me then maybe just to hit me 
She got pin point skill and percision in the walk
And the way that she talk 
Make my mouth turn to chalk

Deep down inside we know that we can never be

When all of a sudden right out of the blue my
Ladie got a clue on
What what we was up to and
Wait a minute, damn 
From what I understand
It seems that my woman's been talking to her man
Since we both in love with the people at home
It looks like, we just gone have to leave it alone
Coz I got a woman and she got a man so
That's how it goes, and that's how it is

Bite to eat, with a movie and a drink at the bar

When all of a sudden right out of the blue
My lady got a clue on what we was up to
And wait a minute, damn, from what I understand
It seems that my woman's been talking to her man

Since we both in love with the people at home
It looks like, we just gone have to leave it alone
'Cause I got a woman and she's got a man
So that's how it goes and that's how it is

Me and Mrs., Mrs., Mrs., Mrs. Jones
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Me and Mrs., Mrs., Mrs., Mrs. Jones
Mrs. Jones, oh yeah

We used to meet at the same place, same time
Used to sit and talk it over, talk it over

Me and Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones

Coolio,"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

I take a look through the window and all I see is pain
burnin on my brain like some weird type of acid rain
or a virus, it's something that I can't explain
I use to be different but now it seems that I'm the same
as the rest of these hard heads in my hood
I'm livin foul even though momma raised me good
Everywhere I turn it and everywhere I look 
everybody that I know is, livin like a crook, and the
The cops want to throw the book
the kitchen sink, a upper cut and a left hook
How can I explain this battering that we caught, it
wasn't the way I was raised, it was the way I was taught
And the streets is a motherfucker (motherfucker)
But I be growin up like another sucker ('nother sucker)
I say the bomb be the last as I reflect on the past
with my face, pressed against the glass

In nightfall through the window, a silhouette
Beads of sweat and the palm of my hand is still wet
So put the safety on the Tek because this ??? ??? started yet
So many yesterdays I can't forget
And now it's nighttime but it seem like daytime
Helicopter lights makin the bud light like sunshine on my mind
Crack addicts, kids with automatics
Thugs who want static and those who already had it
Manifestations of a spirit, trapped in a flesh cage
Mind in fifth gear, imagination rampage
 
My brothers is walking through night like a thief in the night
Three strikes you're out because the color's not right
And all I axe is 'Why we jack and fight?' and try to save enough right
and I'm wrapped too tiiiight, uhh
Blowin in the pistol, suckin on some indo, lookin through the window
and that's all I see, uhh

I'm hittin corners on the boulevard, lookin hard
Rims are shinin, sound is bumpin, I'm a superstar, yeah
Rollin in the ride and it's not mine but
that's alright 'cause I still feel fine

[Billy Boy]
Now I'm strapped with nothin but my mind and a screwdriver
Gimme twenty seconds at your skills like MacGyver (who?)
And I can take anything that I want to take
but when you slip and push your fate, I'm parlayin off your paper like when
