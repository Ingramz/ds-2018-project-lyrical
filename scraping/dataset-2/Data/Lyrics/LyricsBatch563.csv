Kristin Hersh,"Oh no don't you put me in that box
You know what you can do with those locks
Bet your life I'll come crawling out again
You'll have to deal with me then
You'll hear me in the wind.
I been on the other side of the Blue Ridge
Seen the Shenandoah rolling there
I stepped off the mountain's edge
Just to climb the golden stair
I seen the streets up there
I been on the mount transfiguration
Been there with my ma and my pa
On the mountain of commandment
I been handed down the law
You should have seen what I saw.

I fell to the bottom of Thales' well
Caught like a thief with a lamb
You know those stars they can cast a spell
I been caught with red hands.

I scaled the mountains skied the valleys
I've done the highs and the lows
I don't feel like work today
Hell I won't go.
Bess I won't go.

Just let me at their locks
We should all be free
Oh Bess I swear I'll call
When I'm free from me
We should all be free.",Houdini Blues,1994
Kristin Hersh,"Some store I'm not going back there any more
Wandered in don't think I'll do that again
No I don't think I'll do that again.

I swear you look at me cross-eyed
And I don't know what to do
No I don't know what to do crazy loon.

There's a room in his pallet
There's a pillow for his head
Sees an offshoot in his bottle
When he wants to see me dead
Heirlooms a loon.
Never thought I'd see that silly grin
Never thought I'd see that fool again
Never thought I'd like that lunatic.

Nothing left to dance around
What a hero
What a black and blue bird
What a loon a loon
What a loon a loon.",A Loon,1994
Kristin Hersh,"You can come back when you want to
Just know that I'll be here
I haven't left this step
And when the lights go out
I pick the angel up
I only have two hands

Is she here? is she here right now?
Drive her off; don't bother to call
I'm checking out today

Me and My charms
When I kiss the angel I have a taste of you
When I take the angel I have a piece of you
I have a piece

You can come back
I haven't left you yet
And when the lights go out
I pick the angel up
I only have two left feet
All I have in my hands, me and my charms

When I kiss the angel I have a taste of me and my charms
Me and my charms down on the ground
You can't leave me now
I haven't left you yet",Me and My Charms,1994
Kristin Hersh,"You can't get any more sunshine
I can't get over how it rains down
Oh no no no.

You can't get any more sunshine
you can't get any more broken down
Oh no no no.

Is the car parked downtown
leave it while the sun beats down
we can walk and walk and walk
walk and walk and walk.

You can't get any more sunshine 
barefoot while the heat rains down
Oh no no no.

There's nothing I forgot
I left that paper heart where it belonged
who it belonged to,
I never knew I never never knew.

Paper burns and my heart melts
when I tear at you.

Sun drops down down now now now now.",Sundrops,1994
Kristin Hersh,"Lying all night, screaming in pain
Defending the cross in the Belfast rain
The billy saw me at the end of the street
So I lit up my torch and embraced him with heat 

Town of Aintab in 340 A.D.
Threw me in a quarry, no way to get free
I called on Hate to give me my life
And he came on his black horse, obsidian knife 

Happened one night, I was lying in bed
Eyes wide open, I could have been dead
The sky lady came with her eyes shining bright
And the bears and the billies and the bullies took flight 

But I called them all back
And the sky lady too
The bears and the billies and the bullies
Me and you
We laid down our bombs and bows
And drank to their health on the Anatolian plateau 

From New Scotland to Calgary
The geese are high and so are we
We don't even need a map
We're way too fast for the highway trap 

So hit the road and shine a light
I think we're gonna find the path tonight
Shooting star and the moon is bad
It's the best damn omen that we ever had",Uncle June and Aunt Kiyoti,1994
Kristin Hersh,"If I walk down this hallway, tonight,
It's too quiet,
So I Pad through the dark
And call you on the phone
Push your old numbers
And let your house ring
Til I wake you ghost.
Let him walk down your hallway
It's not this quiet
Slide down your receiver
Sprint across the wire
Follow my number
Slide into my hand.

It's the blaze across my nightgown
It's the phone's ring.

I think last night
You were driving circles around me.

I can't drink this coffee
Til I put you in my closet
Let him shoot me down
Let him call me off
I take it from his whisper
You're not that tough.",Your Ghost,1994
Kristin Hersh,"Start with your fingers they finger the change
That carries you home in our evening
You're bee stung there.
Press your palm to your snow-coated thought cage
Carries me over your thinking
You're bee stung there.

Between the tall buildings are snow-coated alleys
Between us is nothing but grace
Snow rides the wind down and drives past the window
Falling over your face I fly out the window
And then ride the wind down
You fit me into my place
You're bee stung here.

Start with your eyes when they eye me in twilight
Picking up pieces of mine
Tie me up with twine in your eye light
String me from heaven to time you bee stung.

Between the tall buildings are snow-coated alleys
Between us is nothing but grace
Help me up when you hear me behind you falling
All over the place it's not too late.",Beestung,1994
Kristin Hersh,"Lightning and foam make a pelican fly
Copper and snow make a dusky blue boy
Your hair looks like copper
Your eyes look the same 

We dance all night
We dance all night 

You don't inspire a metric ton of trust
'Cause I'm on fire and so is all my stuff 

And we dance all night
And we dance all night 

Lightning and foam make a pelican fly
Copper and snow make a dusky blue boy
Your hair looks like copper
Your eyes look the same 

We dance all night
We dance all night 

If I lived in a pumpkin shell
I'd have the key
And if I had a daughter
She'd look a lot like me 

And we dance all night (dance all night)
And we dance all night
And we dance all night (dance all night)
And we dance all night
And we dance all night (dance all night)
And we dance all night
And we dance all night (dance all night)
And we dance all night

Kristin Hersh,"Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me 

I was once lost
But now am found
Was blind but now I see 

'Tis Grace that taught
My heart to fear
And Grace my fears relieved 

Now precious dear
That Grace appear
The hour I first believed 

Through many dangers
Toils and snares
I have already come

Me safe this far

Kristin Hersh,"(One, two) 

I was standing
By the window
On a dark and cloudy day
When I saw the
Hearse come rolling
For to take my mother away 

Can the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Undertaker,

Please drive slow
For the body you are taking

Close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not
Hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Fine and pure of voice

Kristin Hersh,"Well it's sundown in the sinkhole,
It's sunrise up on the hill.
The thieves are sleeping in Hades palm,
And they're keeping very still.
It's summer in Winterhaven,
And the earth, she's caving in.
There's no water on the land, 
And it's all because of sin.

Mae Rose Owens lost her bedroom
When the porches all fell in.
Guy LaGuarde kissed his yard goodbye
And it's all because of sin.
No one must be told 
About this thieving in the night,
Satan stole the landscape,
It was gone with the morning light.

It's sundown in the sinkhole,
It's sunrise up on the hill.
The thieves are sleeping in Hades palm,
And they're keeping very still.
It's summer in Winterhaven,
And the earth, she's caving in.
There's no water on the land, 
And it's all because of sin.

Seven recreational vehicles buried underground.
Seven cranes went after them,
Six could not be found.
A Porsche and half a swimming pool
Are lost I am afeared.
The seventh crane approached the hole,
Then it disappeared.

It's sundown in the sinkhole,
It's sunrise up on the hill.
The thieves are sleeping in Hades palm,
And they're keeping very still.

St. Augustine in his slumber,
Feels the depths of his own soul.
St. Bernadette in her vision,
Feels her body beyond control.
The flowers of Narcissus,
Are nailed to the underworld door,
And Hades has the medicine,
And he keeps down on the floor.

Kristin Hersh,"Together we are, a powerful force, as one, mind, body and soul
Let no evil enter nor attempt to reduce us because of the beliefs we hold
And with this love, combined with our strength, we ward off pain and stress
Technician I am, whole heartidely, in life and in death

Okay I get it, I'm an F.O.N Freak of Nature
But the pen is gonna heat the paper
Was a problem in a incubator
Mom and dad was a creature maker
I never need the shaker
The beef from table, the teacher later
Now you're the beast awakener
I don't think the streets are safer
My misery seepin' through my delivery
Bitter we givers and they keep my figures, don't try to nigger me
The grave digger is hither, he is no kidder, see
Consider the dark energy, sinner be inner me
Black diamonds all around callin' all the down definites
Who saw the clown and now steppin' with that tall amount of big tech and shit
Aah-ooh - 3 times
My people they know what that defines
When the people are lovin' and that's T-9
He rhyme and make 'em make a B-line
They 'bout to hate, make out the great
They 'bout to break if they don't pay off the cake
Stay out my face, you don't want me to lay out the fake
Flip the sick and pray thou relate
Damned and incredible straight out the gate

You see the face of EBAH on Tech Nina
Evil Brain, Angel Heart I remain in the dark and anointed
With holy they console me when they know we
Sin got a hold of me, why they let go of me? I’m double jointed
I’m wicked and I represent the sickness
All you fraudulents feeling I’m falling offending the father
I place you in the deepest darkest part of abyss
Nobody but you and without any food and no agua
I blackened the sun on you bitches
Sat in the dungeons and ditches
Yappin is one of your glitches - halt it
The Kraken has come with the quickness
Back and I’m plundering chicks
And laughing you dummies trip with Exalted

I am the public enemy #1
Fuck your fame, I became the name of a gun
Now they parents say Aaron because they sons
And daughters wanna be martyrs believing in my art, ain't it young?
All I got is my balls and rap,
I'm appalled that y'all want me to fall calling craps
Suckers hate it, now they crawlin' back cause I'm tall as Shaq
And I'm always up for brawlin' bats
Strange music saved my life
I was fuckin' it then the music became my wife
Nobody on this planet can tame my mic
Call me crazy, don't matter, fucking insane I like

When the sun's beam melts
Everyone screams help
Then only one king's felt
When telling all survivors welcome to Something Else

And I say Kansas City
Will always stay Kansas City
Yeah
This is Something Else baby!
Lets Go!

Kristin Hersh,"My love asked me, to take a walk
Just to walk, a little way
And as we walked along we talked
Of when would be our wedding day

We walked beneath the whispering pines
His heart was filled with love divine
And as we neared the riverside
He asked me when I'd be his bride

Oh no your bride, I'll never be
Another one's prepared for me
And as I drew my hand from his
His heart was filled with fire divine

He drew his knife across my breast
And in his arms I gently pressed
Willy dear, don't murder me
For I am not prepared to die

He took me by my golden curls
He drug me down to the riverside
And as he threw me into drown
He watched me as I floated down

Murdered just the one he loved
Because I would not be his bride",Banks of the Ohio,1998

There we sat a courtin'

Under the flank below
I stabbed her with my dagger
An ugly bloody knife
I threw her into the river
An ugly bloody sight

That money would set me free
If I would murder thar deal little girl

Wiping his tear-dimmed eyes

The wind it did whistle and the water did roar
I heard a young girl make a pitiful sound
As she closed her pretty blue eyes
In the water to drown
I never will marry, I'll be no man's wife
I will live single all the day's of my life
The shells in the ocean will be my deathbed
The fish in deep water swim over my head
My love's gone and left me
He's the one I adore
He's gone and I never shall see him anymore

She closed her pretty blue eyes in the water to sleep

When my dreams have fallen
And I can't sleep
When the rivers are running
Down both my cheeks
When I'm small and I'm shaking
Will you come and rescue me?

Carry me to your safety
I'll die in your caress
Wash my body, lay me down
And brush my knotted hair, I'll let you

I won't fight back tonight

When I've held so long
And I must let go
When I'm driving the wrong way
Down a one way road
When I can't find my answers
Will you come and rescue me?

When my touch is cold
And I'm filled with dread
I'm tearing hairs out of my head
When I'm that little girl
Crawling into your bed

Endlich wieder Sonne pur
Für ein paar Wochen nur
Bei Antonio.
Dolce vita am nachtblauen Meer
Und Gitarren von irgendwo her
Und wir tun so als ob unser Leben ein Sommer wär.
Bald sind wir alle wieder da

Sind der Sonne nah

Und do weißt genau
Antonio
Dein amore mio fehlt mir so.
Es ist nicht nur der roter Wein
Antonio
Schon wegen dir allein
Antonio
Wegen ti amore und romantica
Bin ich jeden Sommer wieder da.
Mit dem Sommerwind I'm Haar
Noch abends in der Bar
Bei Antonio
Bis der Mond das Meer berührt
Hat mancher sich verirrt
Zu Antonio.
Da sind Nächte aus Träumen gemacht
Seine Sonne scheint hier Tag und Nacht.
Und ich hör noch sein Arrividerci bis nächstes Jahr.

Champagner kam dazu

Kristina Cornell,"Her mama took her shoppin'
Said, ""Anything you please
They got dolls with pretty dresses
How 'bout one of these?""
She said, 'All I want is a little red balloon""

""And a box of Magic Markers
The permanent kind
All the colors of the rainbow
That's what I had in mind
And a little ball of string
Then we can go home""

She was sittin' on the window sill
Lookin' at the sky
She said a little prayer
And let it fly

“I miss you, Dad
How are things in Heaven?
I wish you could have been here
For my birthday
You know I just turned seven”

“I'm sendin' you this message
I hope you get it soon
I wrote it in big letters on my
Little red balloon”

Four years ago last Sunday
The angels came to call
The family gathered in the kitchen
She sat cryin' in the hall
Holdin' on tight to her favorite teddy bear

He loved to tell her stories
He'd sit her on his knee
He taught her how to ride her bike
When she was barely three
Now she only gets to see him
In her dreams

Now she talks to him as if he's there
From the window of her room
Says, ""Daddy, when you comin' home?
Did you get my last balloon?""

“I miss you, Dad
How are things in Heaven?
I wish you could have been here
For my birthday
I just turned eleven”

“I wonder if you've ever met
The man in the moon
Is he the one who helps you find my
Little red balloons?”

Now that little girl
Is all grown up
But she still finds the time
To keep in touch

“I miss you, Dad
How are things in Heaven?
I'm gettin' married next July
I wish you could'a met him”

“What I'd give to have you here
To see my dreams come true
I guess I'll just keep sendin' you these
Little red balloons”

But it'll be worth all the while
With me its a slow kinda style
And when you feel your intentions stray
Remember that love is the reason
The good things in life don't come easy

And though I spend a few Saturday nights
On the telephone when I could be touching your face
For me emotion takes a mighty long time
But soon the light will shine in
And you will start to understand

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.

What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

Then he says dance for me
He gives me smiles for free

It will be coming back to you

And he'd let love reign
Reach out don't be afraid

It's coming back to you
There's a kingdom of kindness where love is
And a rainbow will come with the rain's kiss

To dry the tears from my eyes
Yes you always cared and I do believe
That you were sent from heaven above

Because you taught me about love
I feel you up there somewhere
Someone watching over me
You gave me joy

You eased my pain
You showed me how to love again
And I thank you 'cause you always knew you'd be
Watching over me

Hallelujah, you came my way
Hallelujah, for your birthday
Hallelujah, now I see
You're watching over me

I hear your voice in the wind
When I'm needing a friend
The autumn leaves in the breeze
Bring a love that you send

And I do believe that
You are dancin', dancin' on clouds
I hear you laughing
Laughing out loud
And I know you're up there somewhere

I thought I'd never let you go
But all you've given me
Is all misery and pain
You don't love me
You took my heart and love in vain

At first I was a fool
I never thought you'd be this cruel
You turned around and hurt me
The things you made me do
And all heartache I went through
This love of ours is ending

[Chorus]
If you want some lovin'
Gotta get some lovin'
Well you need some lovin'
Gotta' share your lovin'
Gotta' feel that lovin'
Inside my heart 
Know that you are mine

Get some lovin' 
You want some
Get some
Get some lovin'
You need some
Get some

You want some
Get some
Get some lovin'
You need some
Get some 
Get some lovin' 
You want some
Get some
Get some lovin'
You need some
Get some 

You tried to play me
But I wouldn't play your games
You tried to tell me
That everything is still the same
I'm going crazy
I don't know whatever to do
Don't think its easy
No its not easy leavin' you

Just like my momma said
If you ever get misled
Forget about your lover
You must always keep your pride
If you want to survive
There will always be another

If I could change your heart the way you change your mind
How am I supposed to live without your love?
Tell me how

Letting go's not easy, it breaks your heart
And if I set you free, will you come back to me?
How am I supposed to live without your love?
Tell me how

Tell me, tell me, hey, come on, tell me
Tell me, tell me, hey, come on, tell me

Release me from this prison that I built inside my mind
Been holding on to you but you were never really mine
And when the night falls down around, I'm chasing shadows of doubt
I'm letting go of love and there is just no easy way out
And so I say

Letting go's not easy, it takes some time
If I could change your heart the way you change your mind
How am I supposed to live without your love?

How am I supposed to live without your love?
Tell me, tell me

Hey, come on, tell me how
Hey, come on, tell me how

Can't mend these open wounds, your words no longer heal
You've left me empty hearted and now I no longer feel
And I believed that we were real with a heart so full of faith
I'm letting go of love and now my fears I'll have to face
And I say

Letting go's not easy, it takes some time
If I could change your heart the way you change your mind
How am I supposed to live without your love?
Tell me, tell me how

How am I supposed to live without your love?
Tell me how

Tell me, tell me, hey, come on, tell me
Tell me, tell me, hey, come on, tell me

Don't understand, I only want what's best for us
And to think 'bout the road ahead could be so dangerous
The winds of change have blown the future I can't see, no
And now there's anger that I feel just poisons me
And I gotta say

Letting go's not easy, it takes some time
If I could change your heart the way you change your mind
How am I supposed to live without your love?

Letting go's not easy, it breaks your heart
If I set you free, will you come back to me?

Kristine W,"The sun rises at nine, departs at five 
Ain't doing overtime no more 
Because in this world of color 
The brightest picture is plugged right into your wall 
And maybe there's a million people singing shoeshine blues 
To no one that they've ever met before and 
Indifference is a drug that I see people buy 
At the local store, local store 
You, you, you think a little love is all you need 
But love is such a small thing can't you see 
I think you'll find it sits in a book and 
Changes the words that you read 

You just feel what you want it to be 
What you want it to feel 
What you want it to be 
Oh 
You just feel what you want it to be 
What you want it to feel 
What you want it to be 

The man in the moon has a cold in the back of his head today 
So dark is the river as the old bridge of lovers 
Finds it's getting washed all away 
There are three wise men in the darkness of the desert 
Still trying to be finding their way 
The tables have been laid and the food has been served 
But the cost of eating is too much for most to pay 

You think a little love is all you need 
But love is such a small thing can't you see 
I think you'll find it sits in a book and 
Changes the words that you read

I cried me a sea,I cried me an ocean,I cried me a stream,

Im outta emotion got nothin' in me,
And I would have done anything in the world for you 
I would have done anything that you told me too,
I cried me a river, I cried me a sea and I ain't got nothin' left in me

You cant have my number don't wanna be friends 
I don't care to see you now and then its not that im bitter 
Its just that I'm done my heart finally said enough is enough

So now you are sorry like your all in love 
But you wasn't sorry when you messed it all up

Theres no way your gettin' near this or have me again 
Until hell has frozen over you need to understand you'll never get with me again

But she keeps looking, with wondering eyes
I got an angel on the left screaming get away
But the devil on the right saying time to play
Whoa

And I can't take it anymore
It's sabotage now

Each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try to hard to fight the bad girl,
But shes here to stay
It's sabotage now, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
Now my heart is broken all over again

Sabotage now,
Where to fall in love,
Caused myself so much pain
I sabotaged my heart and, and I don't know how to change,
It doesn't matter what I say or what I do
Cause in the end
She always wins, I always loose
I need to get her out of my life, oh

Each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try so hard to fight the bad girl,
She's here to stay

It's sabotage now, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
It's sabotage all, over and over again
Now my heart is broken all over again

Kristo Numpuby,"C'est à travers de larges grilles
Que les femelles du canton
Contemplaient un puissant gorille
Sans souci du qu'en-dira-t-on

Avec impudeur, ces commères
Lorgnaient même un endroit précis
Que, rigoureusement ma mère
M'a défendu dénommer ici gare au gorille

Tout à coup, la prise bien close
Où vivait le bel animal
S'ouvre on ne sait pourquoi
(Je suppose qu'on avait du la fermer mal)

Le singe, en sortant de sa cage
Dit ""c'est aujourd'hui que je le perds""
Il parlait de son pucelage
Vous avez deviné, j'espère gare au gorille

Le patron de la ménagerie
Criait, éperdu, ""Nom de nom
C'est assommant car le gorille
N'a jamais connu de guenon""

Dès que la féminine engeance
Sut que le singe était puceau
Au lieu de profiter de la chance
Elle fit feu des deux fuseaux gare au gorille

Celles là même qui, naguère
Le couvaient d'un œil décidé
Fuirent, prouvant qu'elles n'avaient guère
De la suite dans les idées

D'autant plus vaine était leur crainte
Que le gorille est un luron
Supérieur à l'homme dans l'étreinte
Bien des femmes vous le diront gare au gorille

Tout le monde se précipite
Hors d'atteinte du singe en rut
Sauf une vielle décrépite
Et un jeune juge en bois brut

Voyant que toutes se dérobent
Le quadrumane accéléra
Son dandinement vers les robes
De la vielle et du magistrat gare au gorille

""Bah, soupirait la centiare
Qu'on puisse encore me désirer
Ce serait extraordinaire
Et, pour tout dire, inespéré""

Le juge pensait, impassible
""Qu'on me prenne pour une guenon
C'est complètement impossible""
La suite lui prouva que non gare au gorille

Supposez que l'un de vous puisse être
Comme le singe, obligé de
Violer un juge ou une ancêtre
Lequel choisirait-il des deux?

Qu'une alternative pareille
Un de ces quatres jours, m'échoie
C'est, j'en suis convaincu, la vielle
Qui sera l'objet de mon choix gare au gorille

Mais, par malheur, si le gorille
Aux jeux de l'amour vaut son prix
On sait qu'en revanche il ne brille
Ni par le goût, ni par l'esprit

Lors, au lieu d'opter pour la vielle
Comme aurait fait n'importe qui
Il saisit le juge à l'oreille
Et l'entraîna dans un maquis gare au gorille

La suite serait délectable
Malheureusement, je ne peux
Pas la dire, et c'est regrettable
Ça nous aurait fait rire un peu

Car le juge, au moment suprême
Criait, ""Maman"" pleurait beaucoup
Comme l'homme auquel, le jour même
Il avait fait trancher le cou gare au gorille

Kristofer Åström,"I'm not the first to sleep beside you in this bed
Its poisoned with some other idiotic guys smell
And even though you tell me that your love for him is dead
I always keep preparing to go through all lovers hell

I gotta start believing that you really love me
I gotta start believing that you really want what's me
I gotta start believing that you really love me
I gotta start believing that you really want what's me

she told the news to me, a planted part of me
Not to fully grow to show a way of what could be
I asked het to be true;she said ""I love you too""
Her eyes were sad and I recall somebody asked ""do you""?

This is my song to you
You say that it will never be the same

But I knew it the first time that I saw you
That I wanted you to be mine

Kristolyn Lloyd,"Guys like you and me we're just the losers
Who keep waiting to be seen, right?
I mean no one seems to care or stops to notice that we're there
So we get lost in the in-between

But
If you can somehow keep them thinking of me
And make me more than an abandoned memory
That means we matter too
It means someone will see that you are there

No one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to fade away
No one should come and go
And have no one know he was ever even here
No one deserves to disappear
To disappear
Disappear

It's true
Even if you've always been that barely-in-the-background kind of guy
You still matter

And even if you're somebody who can't escape the feeling
That the world's passed you by
You still matter

If you never get around to doing some remarkable thing
That doesn't mean that you're not worth remembering
Think of the people who need to know

They need to know

So you need ​to show them (I need to show them)
That no one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to be forgotten

No one deserves to fade away
To fade away

No one should flicker out or have any doubt
That it matters that they are here

No one deserves (no one deserves)

And there's nobody around
All you want is for somebody to find you
When you're falling in a forest
And when you hit the ground
All you need is for somebody to find you

I'm calling it the Connor project

The Connor project?

A student group dedicated to keeping Connor's memory alive
To showing that everybody should matter

We have to do this. Not just for Connor, for everyone​

'Cause no one deserves to be forgotten

No one deserves ​To fade away 
We're calling it the Connor project
The Connor project?

Imagine a major online presence 
A massive fundraising drive

And for the kickoff event: an all-school memorial assembly

I didn't realize Connor meant this much to people

Oh Evan, this is wonderful!

Yeah, I hope it's all that you want and more
Now you're free from the agonizing life you were living before

Was it fun?
Well I hope you had a blast while you dragged me along

And you say what you need to say
And you play who you need to play
And if somebody's in your way
Crush them and leave them behind

Well I guess if I'm not of use
Go ahead, you can cut me loose
Go ahead now, I won't mind

I'll shut my mouth and I'll let you go
Is that good for you?
Would that be good for you, you, you?

I'll just sit back while you run the show
Is that good for you?
Would that be good for you, you, you?

All I need is some time to think
But the boat is about to sink
Can't erase what I wrote in ink
Tell me how could you change the story?

All the words that I can't take back
Like a train coming off the track
'Cause the rails and my bones all crack
I've got to find a way to
Stop it, stop it! Just let me off!

In the drunk tank
An old man said to me, won't see another one
And then he sang a song
The Rare Old Mountain Dew
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So happy Christmas

They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold

It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging,
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse

Kristy Thirsk,"To others the pain was obvious The colours of shame a bruise -
Unjust
Abuse of trust can't be wiped
I can't remember why I chose to say goodbye I'm terrified of
What I
Might have severed
I tried to forget the drowning truth Lashing inside my sea of

Youth
Life seemed a fair sacrifice for peace

Kristy Thirsk,"No one wins at this game
Throwing knives in your pain
And even though you're lying down now
You're fighting in a war zone
Between the world and your brain

You hide your pride
Why can't you see
Can't you see, can't you see
You are your own worst enemy

You are what you despise
Blame is only a compromise
Anger is your bow and arrow
It's better than a shield for your sorrow
But nothing's hurting inside

You hide your pride
Why can't you see
Can't you see, can't you see
You are your own worst enemy

All the good things you have
Always end up with someone else
And you blame that they are stealing
All the big plans you made
Will explode and you'll suffocate
From the anger you are feeling

You hide your pride
Why can't you see
Can't you see, can't you see
You are your own worst enemy

You hide your pride
Why can't you see
Can't you see, can't you see
You are your own worst enemy

You hide your pride
You are your own worst enemy
You hide your pride
You are your own worst enemy

Kristyn Getty,"In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
'Til on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the pow'r of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home
Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.",In Christ Alone,2006

You're my angel, you are always on my mind
Angel, your love is like a dream
I feel, love is changing everything
Turn the winter into spring, angel

And when I close my eyes
I feel those butterflies
I need your smile, all the time
You light my darkest night
When you are by my side
I need your love, all the time

Vers 1:
Hope you are always mine
I never would turn back the time
You are my destiny
My heart is in your hands
I pray to God above
Please never stop this perfect love
You are the best of me
Your love can set me free

Vers 2:
Your heart is like my home
You never walk this road alone
I'll never let you down
The best is yet to come
Love changes everything
With you I'm living in a dream
And when you're far away
Your love will make my day

Mid-part:
I would never let you go
As long as feelings glow
I wouldn't change a thing on you
You are always in my heart
We'll never be apart
Don't let the sun go down on me

We shall prevail 
Muthafuckas fear what they do not understand
And what they do not understand they try and destroy
Come on now

I hear 'em whisperin' in corners speakin' dirty talk on us
Bout how we too grown up, that we unknowners 
And my persona is rock 'n rollish yo' nigga told us
Every word that you quoted 

Said I wouldn't be the one that sold it, but ha we exploded
I'm that rap nigga that you heard with 2Pac, Sole
Lynch and Bo, Wake Up Show wit King Tech and Sway
Yukmouth, Thicker Than Water, Gang Related, Eminem

Roger Trout, MC Ren, nigga Spice-1 and them
Hit 'em wit a venom send 'em down kill 'em when I spit
When I get a bit of scrilla Tech is givin niggas shit
Love 'em love us but the playa hatin niggas betta split

It'll neva be another Tecca Nina when I quit
You better kneel when you hear a nigga that's real 
I feel 18 when I bust from the grill 
Because, (if you keep it young)

Yo song is always sung 
So street life taught me to keep 'em sprung
God sent me to kill, lyrical scripts
The miracle whipped you demons and hatas who tripped

Listen I really feel, my Villainty real when he spit
Fuck them plus anybody they go get, and shit

You can pray and pray on my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on, keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on

The storm consumes all the sun and moon fall 
When you saw the mega morion dregorian Jet and are you Paul's
Extreme case of blue balls cuz you bang
Got fruit all in his veins 

What I'm sayin' is I will reign murder you all in his name
Biss malla wit the fist in a pistola 
Dismiss the kiss from a hiss giva
Wrist slita male bitch or witch wit a twist

A glitch man abyss swimma, trick
I will never slide, never fall, never fail
Never the devils side, ever call, never hell
But I got these muthafuckas prayin' for my downfall

But the orange hair means time to clown y'all
Thanks to Jenny I'll get the message to many
The circus is comin' and gunnin' wit plenty
I heard that Bakari got a poster of me burnin'

To get his earnin' concernin' not I killed him but he ain't learnin'
Nigga you couldn't burn me wit acid or in a fiery pit
You couldn't burn in a volcano were lava is spit 
You couldn't burn me if you damned me to hell where Satan sit
The only way you can burn me is wit ya bitch nigga

Why don't you niggas keep ya mouth shut 
Without us you clout sucks you doubt us and get ya mouth bust
We veterans and better then you young cheesy cheddar men
Bouncin' across the nation and you home watchin' Letterman

I'm the nigga that got 'em listenin' I know its sickenin'
To know I'm the nigga got girlies coochie glistenin'
From listenin' to my shit and when I get her for christenin'
She splits again cuz I made her spit the nitro glycerin

I'm on you, callin' me a old negro
But I don't know a young nigga that could hold me though 
Plus the dough be low, average and I hold the glow
But they want me to fall so they can say ""I told you so""

But if I'm mutli punks would say I just lucked up
Keep talkin' that shit might getcha fucked up
You some Jimmy Rucker Tommy Tucker type of muthafuckas
Glamorize and specialize in gettin' butt fucked

Niggas think they dope then gonna try to check me
I'm here to let yo ass know you need to respect me
Although you ain't sayin shit you gettin' on my nerves
I'ma keep on keepin' on mufucka that's word

They say I don't fit in
But I won't listen

You can say what you wanna 
I'ma come up on a 
Life from livin' gutta 
I have to be no otha

Krizz Kaliko,"I hate you
Can't stand you
Despise you
Detest you

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

I can't stand yo persona, the drama, yo marijuana, or yo momma
I really despise yo am a so comma I disapo who you honor
I see what you people can offer, I wonder what mommy taught ya
If it was up to me the G, I wanna sought ya, caught ya and then offed ya

I hate what you become, hate you have your freedom
Hate watchin' your reruns, hate givin' you refunds
I call 'em, how I see 'em, when I see scum, I free from the legions
Cerebrum, I see none, see your just really dumb

Hate seein' your whores, hate cleanin' your floors
Hate doin' your chores, won't be in your awards
Funk bein' your whore, hunks bein' of course, you punks being endorsed Chumps being assured, dumped being divorced

To test you like a sickness, I bet you'd like to lick this
From Texas right to Memphis, built with ex dykes and glimpses
Of everything I hate, it would be great for you to skate off in a lake
A beautiful fate, I hope nobody is at yo wake

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

We're livin' in the cold age, road rage
Dark no sole, no way
Jose Cuearvo, there goes yo day
Every scare, everywhere, knows bogay

This life is too soft, haters more true talk
I hate the way that you cough, hate you when you blew off
You coofa, your crueler, so cool off
If we were arm and arm in handcuffs my arm I would rather chew off

So many reasons why I can't stand you
The man who's scam is to ban you
Cram you in the can under land in Grand View
Damn you if you stand near my farm, I slam you
Sammain', champaign your family and you

I'm a monster when it comes to you, conquer every one of you
Trade tours, paid for, your neighbor
'Cause they whores, pray for, decor
'Cause your state will create race wars

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

I hate you when you destroy buildings and kill millions of children
From black white Chinese Sicilian, I thrill
When you feel sin, dealin' drugs to billions
Awaiting your death, miserable until then

I wanna put my Rebox and get on top of his esophagus
And watch the Appocolypse drop him in Necropolis
Never was menogamus, doggin' is, you're botherin' all of us
Gotta get loose from those to ex to soddomus

I hate what you stand for, hate all your scandals
When your life's baned for, I will not burn a candle
The way you live is not easy to handle
You vandals toss 666 in your blood sample

Yo, the world is very different now, no more hugs
Just shrugs and crips and bloods and drugs
Not see show no love, never we be equal
My name is The Grinch, this song is dedicated to the evil people

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

Images of blood and pus and I ain't looking for nothing but trouble
Thinking of murdering you when I'm just lounging
(That's just the devil, just the devil)
Block it out and keep it moving
I'm evil and it's pussy that I'm pursuing
Gimme the Bible, yes I need it 'cause Tecca Nina's in ruin
Mentally I'm fuckin' up when really I don't know what I'm doin'
My tolerance for physical pain has gained rapidly
I'm gobbling more thizzles then thangs but it came back at me
The holy father must have flipped and became mad at me
Because I'm pondering a wicked insane strategy
How to end it all (Yeah), many men will fall (Yeah)
Any sin I saw (Yeah), Nina been involved (Yeah)
You don't really want it with me punk you don't have the gall
The taste of blood on my tongue makin' me want to brawl
No sentimental shit, death is the penalty
For any bitch you try to re-kindle this
It'll get your temple hit
'Bout to bubble, about to pop just like a pimple get
Send it something so insane I'm so not for simple shit
So teeter totter mothafucka if you want it
But just keep it to the left of me, crazy 'til the death of me
Pussy money more money blood and guts is the recipe
Half and hell of drama for Nina is a necessity
Good and bad is fightin' within me and I'm the referee
Shit is looking like it is evil getting the best of me
Bitches think I'm pleasant and really wantin' the sex with me
I'm promisin' you I'm losing it, you don't really want to mess with me

You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)

Damage anybody when I see they really want it with me

And never been dumby
Shit on a nigga when he comin' funny with me
Follow the beat follow your feet
Gimme the weed keys G's
And a quarter pound of bullets with a machete

You niggas be droppin'
And when you do your albums be floppin'
When ever I spit it
Man better yet when ever I drop it
Your wifies gone cop it
She even tell you nigga go cop it
You don't want it with me

I'm hauntin' your dreams

You don't want it with me

And you don't want it from me
See I'm believing that people are really angels and demons
Instead of human beings
I'm havin' feelings of wanting to be the cause of you bleeding
Causin' your family to be grieving now your soul is leaving
Entered in my mind the raw holy words and religious battles
Keep 'em mutilated like cannibal over serpent rattles
I'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin' from gallows
As I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles
My eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums
It's time to hit the streets with guns
I'm bustin' seventy shots laughin' as the people run
I plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done
Until the pain coincides with my violence and agony
Oh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me
But it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds
The Hitchcock of hip-hop, the end is comin' soon

You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)
If you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)

You wake up to find no cereal inside of your box
You got a problem, them Strange rhymers out on your block
So good morning, get it in like it's 30 below
Another ¡MURSDAY! is here to come and dirty your soul
You see the haters get the genitals
Back up off the minerals
Rolling with the general and high off that medical
Rolling all around the world and still rocking a flip phone
Hip hop to the death, two-stepping in every zip code

Pull up in the lot without my [??]
Bitch we on the clock and this is all official business
I been on the radio and shit has got ridiculous
Got me in the mood to cause some motherfucking mischief
Override the system, drugs with some sick kids
You know what we on, we tryna make the fucking hit list
Write a couple songs and live forever in your pictures
Pick another fight before the kick us out the exit

Walk up in the party with our guns drawn
Might just leave a body on your front lawn
I don't give a fuck if they say we wrong
You better keep your hands up when they play this song
And keep your hands in the air
If you know the government don't care
If you got on $5 underwear
But you're feeling like a fucking millionaire
And can I get a hell yea?
Do It Big, Keep It Strange, don't care
Keep your eyes on the prize, don't share
Cuz we bout to take the crown this year

Second batter up, I never had a fuck
To give, if I did, shit, you was out of luck
I'm laser focused with mine like Scott Summers is
The Cyclops, X-Men, for you dumber kids
I read them funny books, they got the pictures in them
Still pull the thickest chick in the sickest denim
Then I spit this venom, like Eddie Brock does
Had the crowd raising eyebrows like The Rock does
Blood, Cuhs, it's all in the same gang
Just brothers in different colors, we need to change things
And this is Strange gang, talking 'bout my chain again
Mine's fine, I got it shined by my Asian friend
At the swap meet in the wrong hood
I'm the bad member but still make the song good
Good enough they had to sign me, better ask Trav
I'm fucking with these strong genetics like I'm in the lab

Gun is out, everybody running out
Hearing people scream and shout (""OH MY GOD HE'S GOT A GUN!!"")
'Cause they run their mouth, 
they throwing this tongue about like having some candy clout (It's negros, we better run)
He'on't want (he'ont want it)
He'on't need it (he'on't need it)
If they try to put a case on this, we gon' beat it (we gon' beat it)
Interrupted a groovy movie, so we said fuck it left it and ate at Ruby Tuesday's
Snotty white waitress said sorry, I'm so blunt
One of the homies singing YG's ""Fuck Donald Trump""
And she said ""Fuck Obama""
And we said ""Fuck yo mama""
And your granny too, 'cause we would never touch your nana, bitch
Manager say we gotta leave
Not before I get a shot, I get it then I appease
And he said ""No""
So I got somebody shot off the bar quick, lifted it up and said 
""Here's to you sucking my dick""

Krizz Kaliko,"[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
And I was told in school I was a fool and money, I'd never gain none
But I used my flow as a tool, they was cruel
Said I'd be no rapper, but I did work and became one
Now it's a cryin' shame, I'm buyin' things and they got debts they got to pay back
I think I know why my teachers would look in my eye and say that
And whys that?

[Chorus: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Cause I'm a Blackboy
Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin'
Yall don't think I see them purses yall clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little white-boys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through
True definition of a Blackboy

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
It must be the way that my pants sag
Or the sparklin' diamonds on the watch my left hand has
I know my appearance is looking like I am bad
In your department store all I wanna do is pop a damn tag
Made it honest, that's why the blacks get mad at you
Even foreigners shop and got big gratitude
I make more than you, but you got the attitude
Like I can't be shoppin' at Saks Fifth Avenue
I'm just tryin' to buy my baby some creed spring flower
But they don't know that the Tecca Nina cheese means power
So they look at me like none of my breed brings valor
Thats why when you see us in passing we seem sour
Last time I checked, my power shockeras
I was on top of the indy charts and not a slotera
But I'm the author of darkness and I like the opera
So why when I'm at Macbeth they wont treat me more propera?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Brother J]
Frontline, shoot, soldiers represent that
Frontline, shoot, Grand Verb, it's the snatch back
Head wrapped in the desert, boombox on the camel back
Escape from the clone lab, fugitives spook black
With finesse in you, its the knowledge from way back
The prophet of the page don't eat right till it all cracks
Blackboy rappin' from the pages torn
Street scriptures more classic than the Jimmy Cracked Corn
A spawn of the movement, keep the music movement
So my purpose stays clear and my music stays groovin'
I do it for the real, I don't need Jena Six
For me to know America is still on that bullshit
So people think that black are just ball players and singers
That massa complex is what fuels the street bangers
And street soldiers to stand up
No choice to get it right, so these Blackboys can finally get they man up

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ice Cube]
I'm a Blackboy and always gettin' underestimated
But when I move next door, I know you hate it
You had my whole family investigated
And when they didn't find no crack, you said I ate it
Uh-uh, a motherfucker just elevated
Over ghetto life that was designated
You see this Blackboy, you know heaven made it
I don't want to go if I got to integrate it
You know pellot boy, be happy you made it
Just take what you got, and stop complainin'
OK, weather man will stop the rainin'
On my people head, and start explainin'
What your people said, believe in the bible
But you still act barbaric and psycho
My name is Ice Cube, bitch, it ain't Michael
I'll never bleach my own skin just to be like you

She ain't know I grab the mic and light it (up), light it (up)
She say, ""she don't know me""
But I'm the number one independent in the country
Man, she the only one acting funky
And the people at the summer jam, they want me
She say, ""she ain't goin on before somebody that's local""
And she went postal and loco
Saying, ""her not closing, is a no-go""
Down talked me real low though
About how she got more doe and just did a tv promo
No show better than the mo. bro with the s & m logo
Damn baby, much success is sitting in your favor
Slam the n9na tech before considering the data
Fans waited, so we went, so she'd get it for later
But frankie said, ""excuse my daughter, she's a bit of a hater""
Damn!

Hey, hey, check it
I understand senor already
But in this case, on this show, I'm a top priority
In Lawrence, your minority and I'm the majority
Check it, I was young and broke
But I'd fetch it, if it was freshest
Shelf the store for the Eric B. and Rakim record
Promoters called us and said,
""We got this show and want you to close us""
Ghostface and brother Ali rocking with a band in 'sota
We couldn't wait to see Rakim rock
But he never ever showed up
He swole up cause he didn't wanna go up before us
Man, what's wrong with these people?
Think that the world gotta kiss their asses
Five hundred capacity but you wanna get two hundred passes
Thought it was about gouda
Forty water told me,
""N9na, get ya cabbage, stay savage and ravage the average""
Y'all better hope radio and video
Keep me from slithering, into they circle
I'll change it, that's why they shivering
Rakim the god? he just miss the king's delivering
'Cause they know they'll fall
And I'll blow them all to smithereens

They may be platinum
But they know I blow 'em all away (i blow 'em all away)

I know I ain't the only one that know you could be bitchy
You know what I'm sizzling?

I know I ain't the only one that know you could be bitchy

Yeah, don't you bring me nothing stupid
If you don't want me to lose it
Step back if you don't want me to attack
I'm a beast, better give me the deuces
I have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
Me wanna get dollars
Don't wanna holler but you makin' me
I'm a little dysfunctional
You're the problem, please don't awaken me
And I'm that way cause back in
The day most have forsaken me
La-di-da-di, I'm at the party
On a drunk night with a punk, might dude
Wanna pick a fight because he's sorry
That he ain't Gotti, like I be, cause he
Sloppy, not me, costly rocks be spot free
But he don't know I'm roguish
Surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded
Will explode if you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo
Listen, they call me genius, I run the show
Woman be on my penis, it's wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the floor
Little bit sick, don't you know?

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
You could fool around and make me mad

Get a little emotional, don't you know?

Don't make me mad

Born to hustle, I'm a product of environment
The game done changed, so I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues and I got common sense
Since I can't lose and I can't choose, then I'll come back to spit
I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Kneeled at the throne, but can’t get on, so I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need, I hope it's comin' quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down, it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in, I gets emotional
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
So please don't push to play me, pussy, on some real shit
Won't be defeated if I'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

I ain't no killer but don't push me
Goody-goody choir boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoody
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
Now I wanna be peaceful, but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
Emotions get the best of me, messed up
And then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me, cause I'm always sick
And I can't let it be, pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me, I need depakote
Just to cope, while I keep throwin' them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin' Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui, but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me
Tryin' to pray for change, but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses, probably be fine

A mouth full of cheddar make a greedy setter
Got a mean vendetta, my team is too clever
Never ever gonna stop, 'cause I rock forever (forever)
You ain't never gonna see me when I be me
When it comes to the rhymes, can't beat me
All the girls say, you complete me
Even some 'em weekly wanna meet me (haha)
Bust on the scene like Jeezy (yeeeah)
And everybody want a Potluck CD
After the show, collect the dough

And a lock in the do' like a fo-fo at a show
Man I'm never so-so
Under syllable criminal won't forget it but let it go
In the stereo, sure up and gettin' high
Motherfuckers starin' but pity for 'em baring
But when they lyric go and if you wanna bet 'em they gonna die

Hanging up the colder bitches (don't cry)
Gotta stand in the street with my hand on my dick
Cause I wanna be sayin', I'm rich bitch (bitch!)

But you gotta be ready to get up and go
If you wanna start up a fight over raggedy ho's
Me and Potluck, put the cocks up, in a hot slut
Tryin' to bust a nut before the slot locks up

Nigga you better be steadily bringin' the melody,
Readily, 'cause every nigga's thinkin' ahead of me
We'll never be fetty because I bring it like a bullet from a gun
So what you really wanna do?
Get back on the road, get a sack, crack a brew
Put a bitch in the back and I give her what she really
Want a motherfucker to makin' it do, what it do

I like to watch her move slow (Uh oh)
Don't move it too fast, take it slow
I like to watch her move slow {Slow}
Slow like siz-erp, but like the way you wiz-erp
Wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz, I like to watch her move slow (She is)
She make it move just my speed
I-I-I-I

But don't stop
Make the body rock
Rock-rock-rock, rock

Peep game, that girl movin' like baked bread
Neck row turned ring row, great head
Skin tone seems smoother than a water stone
Don't move, girl, let-let me grab my camera phone
Talk to me, baby, you ain't got no man yet
Weekend in the Bahamas, you got plans yet
I'll tell you anythang if I could see that coochie rang
Lay-lay it down like Ballin G {Up on that California cage}
I like to watch her move her body like a rattlesnake
Ass vibrate the room like an earthquake
Slow-slow motion, her body screwed up
It must be some purple in the cup
Cause she movin' so slow {Slow, slow}

I kept sippin' on Jemima, sippin' on that molasses
See how big that ass is, I'm higher than {Giraffe tits}
I'm-I'm just checkin' out my draft picks, ass is mad shit
Can slow mo through {3D with no glasses}
Slower than a turtle, a tortoise, harder than rigor mortis {No}
Is there none before us, I'm a Libra, she a-she a Taurus
Re-replay
Grind it out, baby, feed me
Then can call your rear phone, girl, let's have a threeway
I'm-I'm into foreplay, we can do it your way
Just grease your body down, girl, Oil Of Olay
{So} Tell me how you pop that P, win it like a lottery
In and out like a robbery {Baby-baby, get on top of me}

I like the way she move slow, baby making me hot
Call me Usher, she got me like ""Oh my God!"" (Kali, baby)
I like the way you do that thang
Slow it down, baby, I ain't going nowhere

Too fast, baby, slow it (Slow it)
I need the T for it (For it)
You the baddest chick in here, and everybody know it (Okay)
Let me see you move it like you got it stuck, a new trick different the one I've been used to
First
Get you over the hotel balcony, rip out the ?
First
She movin' sluggish like a snail do
Bringin' out the beast in me, I'm a mess up your hairdo
Pour me somethin' sur-pic, when we finished, don't desert me
I might want some more of your sippin', you're like a slurpee

They in a mess bind and yes I sever decay 'em and define pressure

Life can treat you really coldly

When the music and the show stops
Security keep my bus door locked
That way I’m not receiving no shots
MJ, our little bro dropped and that’s why they keep me so blocked
I’m in the star coach now
In the back by myself, I listen to our dope sounds
But there was no women to round up
This hound just sleeps deeply, anticipatin' the next town’s luck
It’s glitz and glamour when you’re on stage
Happy ‘cause you and your homies paid

Kicked it with me up to the 24th, then they go home

A storm cloud stalks me making what should be a sunny day
Shed tears of lonesome despair in the form of rain
I've devoted my life to rid you of your pain
For feelings of acceptance which reveal themselves feigned
Do not mind that, scream the voices in my brain
But if I stop giving, only I remain
Though I know not of misery
For I lack the company it needs to be entertained
But misery would be a nice change
This solitude drives me insane

Yeah, I think it’s my fault, y’all, ‘cause I’m reclusive
And I’m thinking I lost brauds like Y! Exclusive
And I know that I might fall, ‘cause life is stupid
‘Cause cupid shoots it and I fight off but it might produce its

Little shitter and like in P.E. O-N-C's
And if they different than me
Then they can be eat me in season
Ah uh, I'm ripping my mouth off
And the niggas that mouth off
I'm taking they top off
I'm the dope, and you are the drop-off
My niggas are not soft, ignorants pop off, hot sauce
I'm coming from the planet of Barbie
When niggas are niggas are awfully, I feel like keeping my car keys
Spreadin that spark, and pick up a clip in a heartbeat
Sit in the star seat, then I'm getting back to killing 'em softly
Why you gotta do it on me on the c-c-choppers when I did it in the beginning
I hit it on it,just the type of me to show 'em im a c-c-c-c
Just put put em in a blender and hit it on it
See they be shaking the fact
Put a snake into the record for the sake of the bat
Uh,maybe stare at ya act
Put the safety from rabies,and maybe that they never had
That Krizz cray
Better yet,call me Kali baby
Really will deliver it in any kind of way
I slow it down for it to be easier to say
Totally awesome dude
I'm a predator and you're awesome food
It's better than when I was offin you
From up here there's a pretty damn awesome view
And a moment of silence, we just lost a few
Ah uh, bring that back now

[Chorus]
You already know the outcome
How 'bout turnin up the volume
And watch me kill shit
You already know what I'm talking 'bout
If you don't understand the words that's coming out my mouth
Then watch me kill shit

Twista! They call me Mr. Malevolent
With a style to show that I'm another pistol that's elegant
Kaliko to cut the throat of me no patrollin me
Nickin every syllable that's strong enough to lift up an elephant
I consist that you're as soft as a moccasin
I can send niggas at you and have em take away your oxygen
I could then murder you in another dimension
Of diabolical proportions as I find a portal and lock them in
Eat the key up then re-up I'm gone
See the way that I re-up a G up, I'm on
Now I'mma hang my feet up from reeboks, it's on
Niggas this ain't a game put your wii up, I'm grown
I'm general militia and you be feelin every person
Though everybody can spit it but we still a very
Packin so much artillery we are like a military
And no tellin how many bodies we bout kill and bury
Gimme the block then I'mma ball
Because I be tippin
Spending the money when I'm in the mall like tryna be different
Different kinda clothes
Other kinda shoes
When the hoes see the swag they be askin if they can come and kick it
Shorty what you talkin bout just get your homies and come with it I'm over here Gettin drunk up the limousine
Now I got a drunken fast flow
But it don't matter I can still blow the whole party to smithereens
Splittin' words in the middle like kali-
Ko we Killin em cause you put together a team
As if you were Pat Riley
Cus ain't nobody compara-
Ble to us if you want it then you know what it means

Death and destruction it is they fate
Because when I get up on a track, it'll be like wait
Sick em deliver, get to flipping
You be the victim and I’mma pick em off
Fix em with a quick, and I’mma knock division off of niggas
No living giving or igging on the rigorous
Look at this, will somebody look at this
I be killing em
Put up or shut up, get up be cut up
It's animosity
Foot in ya gut up, bullet for colors
I’m an atrocity, wicked
I went around, arrange one off, I rip it
I’d rather be red and ready then running with the rigits
Don’t be stupid, if you got a minute better run away
You better jump im slumping you cause
Never gonna put the gun away
You better back up off of me or get it
Admit it, I’m killing off everybody and then it
Acquitted
And we knocking, he stopping
Never can beat the cleverness
She joshing, me cocking
Coming to get the head of the Chula
I shoot her because lots a Gouda
That dude'll be foolery, because I socked the ruler
Ay yay yay yay yay yay
Yank em, when he thinking he better then Nina
I gotta spank em, shank em with the thang
For thinking that we'll come & give up the game
We hang the really bane in my sanctum
They don’t really wanna see me
Tecca Nina eating your whole supper like Ziti
When I get to going, I smoke a nigga like a beady
I’m leaving em all dead lips blacker than Miss Sealy

We sing clinge the thing is I am sterilized
He sing sing and scare and they terrified

Ball to the fall every fall in a hole and
I won't stop even at all till I'm am known
The world so cold I make them fall with a quote (okay)

Spider K's a rhyme vet I'm next (okay)
But only pretty boys would get laid but I'm sex (okay)

Maybe they bust spin out the bus
So we cause the leakage

Thought I would be some charity case
The industry would be scared of my face

Krizz Kaliko,"This is my haiku

The sick pedophile
Touching beautiful kiddies
Really gonna die

I think the world needs more light
'Cause what they do in the dark too heinous for your sight
And mine is dark all the time
A sign to design true crime
But I'm blessed to have the platform for this rhyme

Damn, why wasn't the light on baby girl
Grown men touch her, she 4, livin' in this crazy world
That's gonna affect her way longer than the lightest life span
If I was there, I'd be sparking way more than a light, man
But if we shine em' all, together we can run them off
Gonna hardslide on everyone he come across
Molotovs go to slavery in the Holocaust
Lotta chalk, you ain't lit up, then you not a boss
Light the darker alleys, it might just spark a rally
For right these hearts are rowdy, tonight we spark the valleys
In flatlands stoppin' the bad man, with grab hands
Girl he groping, go in the trash can
Nowhere to hide I must say places ain't light enough
You try to cut the bright of us an idol might just erupt
The fine of dusk would light as the night adjust
If you got em' then light them up

If there was a lighter in everybody's hand
The world would seem brighter
The sky would be fire
We'd raise our hands and burn the world
So raise your hands and burn the world

Hey
Why did Adam shoot the school up?
Maybe cause the way he grew up
Maybe cause of loose screws
Scratch all that, cause mama loved to pick the tool up
Now a marathon blew up
And it's by the hands of two nuts
When Castro took the kids for about ten years and what he'd done, I almost threw up

If them was my youngins I'd try to bring the sun in
Closer to 'em, turn it up a hundred and hold it to 'em
Take a bite and chew 'em
Some of they baby life they ruined
I'd be going crazy on the daily
Daily I'd pursue them
Don't need more reasons to turn this to a fire pit
Barbecue, I would do, right find without all of it
It's awful and off to no resolving it
Molotovs make the night brighter

If there was a lighter in everybody's hand
The world would seem brighter
The sky would be fire
We'd raise our hands and burn the world
So raise your hands and burn the world

Yeah
Depresin' to seeing them
Was heaven cause we had sinned
The reverend is begging brethren to be sevens and being friends
Tecca don't wanna see kiddies die
Minors in the stretcher, so what you gonna do with them 25 lighters on your dresser
Yessir, shine them bright so they see us off in Mecca
Lessen the threats of them steppin' with death impress us
To mess a good will, divide up a fight
Being right and polite, come and help me light up the night
Shine your light bright, but I finally can't rape her
People stand together, make the place safer
No time to play when I weigh the straight haters
Cause they fakers and doing evil is they nature
This is for [censored] that once and often go through my head, then I wanna run then off them
I don't want no second opin's, so I'm asking her friend
""Just keep it lit so this don't happen again""

To break it up and sever for the better

But she kiss me, now I can’t eat for sho
And you know…

[Chorus]
You love is like schizophrenia
And I be like a-ya-ya-ya
Don’t know what done got into you
Maybe I try ya-ya-ya
You love is like schizophrenia
And I be like a-ya-ya-ya
I’ll be your strait jacket, hold you tight
I really think you’ll be alright now

You make me mad, you make me
You make me (cray cray) crazy
You make me mad, you make me
Make me say

This is the drug I will be talkin' about,

I see so many titties when I'm touring in Tulsa
They show me cause they dream of me cause I'm on her poster
She fine enough she'll get a chance to get a little closer
Then I'm gonna be in her belly like a motherfucking ulcer
She can't fit 'em in Victoria's Secret
Cause baby is an H, so her cups is the deepest
If you with your girl and she walk by, can't act like you don't see shit
Not only you, but your lady gonna ask her, ""Yo, can I peep it?""

Krizz Kaliko,"It all started yesterday, and now I can't think about nothing
Is it real, I know this can't be heaven sent
Wish I could dream it all away
And now all I need is a drug
That can help me make it through another day
Maybe its just me it won't let me be
And I don't really know what it is that keeps bothering me
But I'm saying

(Why me?) I wanna know how it is
To see the sun shining even if it isn't
(Why me?) I don't wanna know how it is
To hear me say it's all love when it isn't
(Why me?) I wanna know how it feels
To hear you laughing in my ear
(Why me?) I don't wanna know how it feels
If you didn't cheer
How can he handle this... Too many damages
He hit the nail on the head but never knew right where the hammer was
Don't think so loud, don't let them hear you scream
Baby it's even bigger than it seems

Now, now, now crazy is an act alike
Getting better in the after life or maybe not
Maybe I can ask her why the normality passed me by why when I'm a titan
Continue to breathe it dependent on people to get my mental state
Am I meant for this?
The Christian Krizz just have to wait
Pictures getting clearer it ain't me in the mirror
See its that other nigga only his egos bigger
And he'll pull the tigger when I usually hesitate
And he'll go on 'em when I'm steadily saying wait
Now I'm just a shell of myself
I don't want anybodies help
Maybe I do maybe I do this for you
This is my own hell
Is there a bottle some kind type posion that can end it
A different god I can pray to
Some type of doctor to fix it
Maybe its just me it won't let me be
And I'm to helpless, I guess

(Why me?)
I wanna know how it is to see the sun shining even if it isn't
(Why me?)
I don't wanna know how it is to hear me say it's all love when it isn't
(Why me?)
I wanna know how it feels to hear you laughing in my ear
(Why me?)
I don't wanna know how it feels if you didn't cheer
How can he handle this
Too many damages
He hit the nail on the head but never knew right where the hammer was
Don't think so loud, don't let them hear you scream
Baby it's even bigger than it seems

How big is the fight in me
Frightfully fighting night to be day
I'm wishing that wifey would knife me for spiteful things that I say
Excuse me for thinking this way, I'm a little bit pessimistic
They sending blessing this way I guess I must of missed 'em
See my teary eyes through my Ray-Bans
Turning off the world and still looking for some amens
The girlies pee-pee when they see me, fans, they dance
Look in the mirror wanna see me
Here's their chance

Hope you like what you see
Okay
Hope you like what you see

Krizz Kaliko,"Is it true, I can only fly so high?
Then, then without wings, I truly die

If you trace it back to the beginnin'
I never sold a single piece of music before Mitch Bade
This laid, the foundation for me to get paid
This day, you can still hear that gangster on a sick page
Now I'm flyin' high but dyin's, my
Fans that were buyin' I
They're cryin', ""Why
Does he have to get bigger and flow with artists from mainstream?""
Good music reaches all and he's creating a strange scene

How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?
You love me?
You love me not?
I'm flying but I'm dying faster
Hoping you won't go away

How the hell are you sayin' that all the records I'm playin'
Since 2010 are not obeyin' the Strange Law
Remain raw, give your happy and pain all
Spit with a flame jaw with the teeth of a chainsaw
This what I do when I'm flyin' right off the shelf
And when something musical helps
You can't keep it all to yourself
It grows and grows, always hard never tryin' soft
So how in the world you fix your face to say that you dyin' off

How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?
You love me?
You love me not?
I'm flying but I'm dying faster
Hoping you won't go away

Ah
Frustrated, cause I'm thinkin' that if enough hate it
It'll make remaining fans start feelin' their trust faded

I don't wanna die (I don't wanna die)
I just wanna keep my lifeline
And that's the family who recite N9ne's passages
And back it just cause ain't no other like mine (tight rhymes)
And even the people applaud
They still wanna bury hard, cause they don't wanna be a god
I'm higher than the stars now
The bottom is too far down
Whoever throws sand at the Nina
Yeah it kinda cuts but it ain't enough to take me down
I've been so true, so things I do will go my way
With the power of the pen, the paper, the people do as I say

How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?

My fans are my lifeline, so it kills me to think how they can just cut off

There can only be one

Thou shall only be me
When the whole world's changing
All shall remain

I'm flying higher more and more everyday
But lately, I've been feelin' like I should just fly away",Dyin' Flyin',2015
Krizz Kaliko,"I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

Yep, I'm the one ya heard
Reppin rojo on Jimmy Kimmel had some disturbed
But niggas know that we ruff and rugged so mums the word
Tech N9na face painted look like he come ta purge!
Real scorpio, shoot this thing like a Torpedo
Rock the rip, no remorse we go
Dummy like Mork from Ork, we know
And I say that with the utmost respect
I bust low to death, I must bode the check
It's never enough, no for Tech
So I get sick with it, I make a bitch dig it
Even when I wanna speed it up and I quick-spit it
I get a bit wicked up in a battle
Tryin to bite a buck, I blabber in his fitted
Killin' music get me spiff sitted, I can't piss when it become hard
So I need a chick to hit it when I kick a lyric
And I'mma murder 'til I'm on the yard (Murder)
My verbs are like birds that jerk up and merk the weak twerps
You can't hurt the durka
First to, insert the work inside of the earth
I disperse the curse to reverse ya to the worst of ya venomous
Squirt ya mercer (Ugh)
Trip not, you see I got the advantage in hip hop
Cause rappers sound identical so when N9na's shit drop
I do numbers, I'm the pinnacle so never will it stop
Y'all can't beat me doin' nothing, except for
Stalkin' these thoughts I spew and suckin'
We run this independent game, it ain't no screwin' us
When we runnin' everything except our mouth while they blue and sufferin'
This on the Bible, I kill any life with a script from this rhyme
Music's done divine, this is my rifle
There aren't any like it cause this one is N9ne, is a gift from his mind

I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

Yo, I Got the call from Tech N9ne
He needed assistance from the group with the best rhymes
That spit the heat up off of yo ass and grind
Fuck all of them flex rhymes
I get love in every city I sack in cause I rep mine
Around the world, the girls give me head on tour cause I headline
I gotta get fed, I'm fed up, my homies is doin' fair time
I look at that clock and all I see is ""Go get that bread"" time
Lost too many soldiers so tears, I gotta shed mine
Turn on the radio, hear yo shit, and oh, it's bedtime
I fall asleep, it all is weak, most y'all shouldn't be called MCs
Bro, ya discography, you ain't sale cause all of ya talk is cheap
Smoke up all the tree, my whip look like it got a fog machine
My crib look like a pharmacy, that's prolly why you wanna haul my team

Livin' facetious, what the hell, why the weed lit
I make change where I see fit
I don't play like I don't see shit
Yeah, one hunnit, one hunnit, keep it that way and it's a poem
And stay away from the hate and keep all yo plays right in motion
Bust it, I'm down after the sun and up before it, better know it
MVP, most valuable poet, been the coldest, kept it focused
Cause you miss every goal that you don't shoot for
And every time you cut a corner, you make two more
The rich is in my life, so I don't have to have the things
And listen for the whispers so I don't have to hear the screams
And I go hard for what I want, so it's just colors when I dream
And then you realize, it's not as scary as it seems
Molly's for pussies

I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

Ain't nobody handle me, heated like a candle be
Kissin' dirt, ya man'll be for tryin' to dismantle me
Music is my weapon, true, loud enough to deafen you
Never trip with Tech and crew, be careful who you steppin' to
I remember when I was young and I got scars through
Right in back of the paddy-wagons and cop cars too
Now that I'm flyin' high from a rockstar view
Security level let Allahu Akbar through, ooh",Give It All,2015
Krizz Kaliko,"I won't look back anymore, after this
Pitch black, star bright, yeah that's my life
A bit of fire and ice
Watch friends, plot foes, stock ends and pot holes
'Cause when the tank hit the bank, it just got closed
Don't be stank in the paint cause the yak froze

Wish I knew back when I was strugglin'
If I plugged in and kept bustin'
I'd be buzzin', that'd make me super rich
Never knew my sufferin' over but
Cousin, I keep it up and gushin'
And tell all of my family, aunts and uncles, cousins to do the shit
Just gain power through all of the rain showers
No different, remain sour cause someone else's lame hours
Wish I woulda known to tell 'em all to start they own business
Make long digits instead of havin' a boss who talk at the wrong pitches
To fake friends, cause it's never enough
At hostile situations with folks, I learned it's better to bust
First, and you still a nigga no matter how much ya stuff's worth
You love who love you, do hug who does true
Connect the true blood to cuzz blue
So keep hopin' the Lord does show up
'Cause it'll never be no peace on earth for all of us
'Till this mug blow up

Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Ponderin' these thoughts while sittin' idle in this mezzanine
Feel my feelin's boilin' up, I'm simmerin' on everything
Goin' for the gold because it's shimmerin', but everything
That you encounter seems to be devoured, need a better team
Every thought and every dream, every plot and every scheme
Lurkin' around the corner is a hater waiting like a fiend
And choice of drug is negative, and they use it like a sedative
Success becomes the cause of this effect, abuse the medicine
You thinkin' you can let 'em in, partake in buildin' excellence
The serpents come in twos and they meticulous with they meddlin'
The feathers flock together, see the relationships we settle in
Got consequences so it's best to let 'em go, we blessed again
Disloyalty unfoiled, trynna justify they pestilence
I don't understand why they so demanding manic pessimists
I guess if I had to guess, I'd make an estimate, I guess that they
Was just afraid so watch us levitate 'till I'm at heaven's gate

Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Mmm, life sentence for fallin' out ya physical body
Illuminate my soul, officially became godly
I be the one, all of these demons runnin' from
Dumped a gun, lifted spirits, niggas deem me the chosen one
Phony family in my crowd, rappin' gap and loud
Facin' twelve in the pen, none of them niggas made a sound
None of them niggas round
Now the fame close and the name boasts
I'm 'posed to break bread bitch, taste toast
I should smoke them ungrateful bitches
They doin' the most to see what make you choke
It actually leave ya throat missin'
I'm on a mission to revisit kin and
My prime been hidden, trynna dine with women
Dipped and find this linen, try and find a business
I love who love Gee, fuck you if it's fuck me
That's just how it gotta be, cause I'm paper routin'
Tame nuisance, insane view and check on my lawn
Strange recruit me, guess when the god speakin' Strange Music

We on this Earth as we hell raisers
We crave good life but born into this dead-zone

In the cemetery but they never produced her headstone

Black as ever like shabba

When I'm ripping the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him pretty hot
'Cause he knowin that Tecca Ninna's a dirty chopper
He's handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hovering having hella go H.A.M. Though?
I said to Seven, ""Richard Havens'll be the man""
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, ""what we doin'?,"" I said to I'm, let's chop
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin' so let's rock, nigga
You're on, people got to wondering if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling, you're gone!

Nobody can catch up, meet the Speedy Gonzalez
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I've got to audibly body them
And this is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
Then I let 'em melt
They never heard of us, but look at me, I'm turning up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flipping niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
We bleed ‘em, beat 'em 'til they be gone feed 'em

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstasy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in the Vic's
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy's wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
You've been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity

That I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I'm picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run

Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife

I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over

You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down

If anybody come at the hound, don't wanna be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I'm hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em, and we killing 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it

If ya know me then ya know I gotta make feet step to the beat of my own damn drum
On some grown man stuff, never weak cause I beat you to the fleet all along ran come
Get ya funk ass up, get my secretary thirty dollars and I’m hallow I’m living in the dirty water
Me and forty Water only fat niggas that’ll remain
Music, Strange Orangutan

Oh, let 'em out, let 'em out
Animal and he's circling about
Keep us free and it won't come out the mouth
Monkey do, monkey see, it's about to go south
He never did no harm to me
'Cause I could get free easily
Enough to make your heart go bad
Ferocious orangutan

No destroying what can't be destroyed

Ain't nobody here ready for the beheading
I'm bringing the Armageddon
They killing dead and then let 'em in
We put the pedal to the metal
It's W-T-F ever whenever they wanted you to edit in
Don't really matter what I say or what I be on
They knowing they can take it to infinity and beyond
They prayin' on my death, hoping that it wouldn't be long
But it could take an eon, no B-S so we gone

But we on speed, you couldn't get a lead on
I keep calm, rap fast and feast on
I heard, everybody gotta play the fool
In the jungle, nobody safe from the chain of food - you dig?
And I been cooking in the kitchen waiting on a couple things
That didn't come to fruition that we're doing this spring
You wouldn't think that rappers are really bitches
Strip 'em of all their riches and see what they can do in the ring
Scooby is big if you can consider both of us represent for the middle
Keep it Strange and doing it big
You be the king, orangutan, usually
Hanging, one-handed, from a branch where you couldn't swing
Ha, and the view is insane
You never see it but believe it's a beautiful thing
I sped up speed, you seen I make it sin upstream
Live in a cage until the day they gotta give us free
I'm out

Oh, let 'em out, let 'em out
Animal and he's circling about
Keep us free and it won't come out the mouth
Monkey do, monkey see, it's about to go south
He never did no harm to me
Cause I could get free easily
Enough to make your heart go bad
Ferocious orangutan

Evolution is saying I come from monkeys
I don't know but what I do know is people get super jumpy
In every part of the country, they look at a nigga funky
Like I'm an alien baby and I get 'em all really grumpy
When I spit it, they don't want to admit it, but I shit it
Whenever I get to pivot up on the mic and I lit it
I get 'em livid, I do the impossible, fuck a critic
I tell 'em to kid-iss my did-dick you bid-itch

Come and witness the animals on exhibit
We taking over the planet and all of the outer limits
They hand me they will and really ain't gotta be reinvented
With the pen and some picture being plotted
You couldn't mimic
I'm p-equitable, service I'm in a tin and let him out like Krizz
Hanging off of the tree, but I'm hanging
Chest banging indestructable
Diamonds on display and see us swinging
On the monkey bars, who let an orangutan in?

Hongo, banging on the bass of the bongos
Even the Congo strapped up with a longbow
Soon as we get to rockin', I be up in the Times bro
'Cause I'm an animal, happy to damage the stronghold
Why you gotta be knocking the ooo-wee switch?
We get it poppin', more than often and you do eat shit
Hit the drop and motherfuckers chop-suey prick
This our planet goddammit, King Louie, bitch

Somebody better tell 'em watch the throne
I come outta nowhere with a knockout like Holly Holm
You on top now, not for long
The name's Strange, rang bells worldwide
But you hardly known
I'm balling on 'em like I'm Karl Malone
My swisher looking like a waffle cone
But know my homies know I came to drain
These rappers thinking we the same, we ain't
I might jack the track while you just back up

Yeah, when life gives you lemon give me lemonade
And I could surely be up but I been afraid
You are the one, you are the one
So what you want, can you get it done?

Tell me which one of you gonna come now
And you got them boys fighting for you

And I'm so blind, so blind
Tell me how does it feel for you to win every time

You know the ladies they love me psych
They needed me just like a Sunday school must need Christ
Always down on my luck, please life
Can you give me something brighter when I uncuss these dykes
Rolled 'em, pressed a lot of records and then I sold 'em
Then it screwed how I posed and turned Lamar Odom
Dollars I can't fold them, guess I showed 'em
Those who never chose him got holes all on my scrotum
Shut off, closed out, all of them get the synonym
Do you remember them two squares in school, 
You know Aaron and Chris and now they blew up and rapping with Eminem?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I 'member them

Until I raced for home and I slid
For my labels flown where I lived
But the Yates was growin' in my biz
And I couldn't even afford Reebok's
It was Payless shoes and holy socks
Then I started to earn G-knots

Still I'm livin' it by street codes

That's what they identify with, not with a nigga with the clown paint on his face
I get it that I'm wicked
When I spit it they be comin' to get 'em a ticket
Talk a lot of shit at the gate and they got to zip it
When I'm bustin', they open up to somethin' different and dig it
I get it, I never looked like the average black dude
Track shoes, gold teeth, and covered in tattoos
Yak, booze, reeking and chiefing the sack through
Speakin' about reaching them hardened hat screws
Jack move
Yes I've become a big boss
But I'll never be cool as Rick Ross
That's okay, N9ne's been rhyming
And now he's shining
Perfect timing

You ain't with it
Sit it down
I'm a vicious
Wicked clown
And I'm livid when the critics give us frowns
Trippin' with this nigga's sound
Yup, I get it now
Get it, me and you, we are not the same
We unequal and the people is to blame, get it?
I get it now
I guess I got the wrong pants on
And I don't really make no dance songs, get it?
I get it now

To these pop up, when they tryna penetrate it we boss up
Don't wanna have to do it but indeed shot you
How many people gonna fall from this evil?
And it'll never stop 'cause we don't care if it's illegal
But the weapons charges violent fecal

I can turn 'em right and around and turn death fear to it

Thanks for yanking the breaks off a gangster hate officers
Got a lot of mo', I got a lot of mo'
I see Trump's got a lot of votes
America is a salad bowl
And you can put the dressin' on it, chop it up and fool a lot of folks

Winners are not people who never fail
But people who never quit
All I ever wanted was to sell

I'm gonna go and do it, I'm never gonna fail
Yeah, but first I gotta make it out of Hell

Wake up and I see crime
All of us we on it's eat time
My homies love me yelling ""Peace N9ne""
At the same time, throwing B signs
Throwing 'em back and repping the street, I'm
Doing music and I'm writing beast rhymes
But my V-Slimes, had no weak minds
Got with the music, started a group and we shine
Music gave us hella hope
Made it up out of the bangin' and sellin' dope
We were stronger than a bottle of Yoke
'Till one of our members found a kid to grope
Then your honor gave the peddy the rope
Losing a man, the band began to slope
Never did think a plan was damned to croak
So doing it solo-dolo stands the G.O.A.T
Started making hella LP's

Because of the hand the label dealt me
But in ‘06 Fontana helped us melt cheese
Number one independent gonna be spending a ton of funds, in a minute
That's when the government want the sums, then I send it
In a couple of months I'm done and replenished

Everywhere I go, I'm selling out the show
Around the world I kill 'em and everybody know
Whenever we hit the studio and Tecca Nina drop, hot
Even though I will go toe to toe if somebody bang on me
But I'm rolling in the dough and I'm really respected and protected
Chances of me getting shot, not

Everyone loving the Tech
Publishin', I get a check
Loving the cities that with me, the people that call me the best
I don't have any regret, but it's a bit of neglect
Missing my babies I love 'em and none of 'em leaving me yet
Feeling good like a villain should
In a mansion, but I'm still in hoods
Not like Trayvon, J's on
Khaki shorts with a red tee like I will and could
I can conceal it my permits say

Hope nobody deserves quick spray
I feel an angelic surge this day

Been doing it long
They want me to sell 'em my CD right outta my home
'Cause I'm in the zone
I'm putting 'em on in front of the store when a couple of police won't leave me alone
Why they tripping?
I fit the description
It's two of them rushing me I'm on a solo mission
To get people to listen, but they pushing and kicking me
I'm on the ground when they telling me, ""Cause of a gun suspicion""
It was in my pocket, ain't trying pop it
When they scared of a brother with a gun no one can stop it
Then one of 'em lost it, and then I was shot quick
Officers took me to heaven, I'm dead and with multiple rockets
Didn't matter I was good and living inside a mansion next to ball players
'Cause of the move he made was drastic now I lay in a casket carried by my pallbearers
Fears what I see, making 'em kill a G
Rotten apple in the batch; don't tell the rest to flee
This happened in Baton, R-O-U-G-E, even I fit the description

What if it was me
What if I never got the one chance to be
Everything and everywhere I go, I wouldn't see
If by your hand you took that from me
But what if it were me?

I'll never get up again, it's so unfair

You never cared
Things that we do make each other so scared
So what if it was you there?

Cocky like a boxing champ
Do excuse me 'cause my mind is kinda like a lava lamp
Savage like the Macho Man
Go induce a level on the side of my Versace lens
Swinging like I should be singing in a Mariachi band

You should really watch the way you stepping to me
Fuck around and now you lost a leg
And now you look like Drake in his Degrassi days
Crippled, lame as fuck, and it ain't tough for me to spot a rotting egg
Had to SWAT you, homie I'm a dragon I'm colossal
You a cartoon drawer, motherfucker I'm Picasso
I just need a Xannie bar, couple shots inside my nostril
When I'm Michael coming harder than Lamar inside a brothel

Laugh loud when that boom hit you

Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Krokodil,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Krokus,"The show is over, you got to go home again
Late in the night, you're dreamin' of the guitar man
The radio station plays his latest song
It says your way of life is kinda wrong

Do you hear your bedside radio?
Do you hear your bedside radio?

You wake up early in the morning to the radio news
But in your blood is still this dose of blues, yeah
The sound of the band has turned you upside down
Instead of going to the office, you're leavin' town

Do you hear your bedside radio?

Down the road that took me here to you
I travelled down those everlasting highways
You lit the candle to start this love anew
Just couldn't wait, life was a desert

Can't wait to see your face again
Only you can stop the pain
Girl my love has never been so true
An open fire, a great desire
It's an open fire in my heart
Open fire, burning desire
Open fire in my heart
Can't wait to see ya
Let's find a place where we can be alone
Somewhere to share the passion, free our feelings
I want to touch and hold you for my own
I've waited long for this love
To unfold the secrets from within
Under the moon, the stars, the sky
So alone that I could die

Krokus,"Last night when I was laying in my bed 
Had a dream of a flag in white & red 
Swiss cross turned into the japan dot 
A yellow girl appeared and made me hot

She took me to her place - a Geisha house 
There was tea rice-booze & ceremony 
I got undressed she had me washed 
I felt her body and I was lost

Tokyo nights hot burning lights 
Tokyo nights you took my mind away 
Made me obsessed by loving fights

Soon I remembered I stayed in a dream 
And I could make a try to change the scene 
The geisha girl was just too hot for me 
I tried to wake up unsuccessfully

And even as the big alarm-clock rang 
Outside my window the first blackbird sang 
My yellow girlfriend didn't leave my head 
Got to stay forever in her bed

Tokyo nights hot burning lights 
Tokyo nights you took my mind away 
I'm in the spell of your delights

Drinkin' beaujoulais wine

You're with your favourite girl
And you're passin' the time



Well, you look through the paper

Five bottles later
Holocaust in the roxy



You're lovin' your lady


I can see

I can see
Burning bones of war



Ashes on the floor


There stands a soldier
In a barbed-wire land


The fear of death in his eyes

And a bottle in his hand

But, now the wine he's drinking

It's got the taste of blood

No more plastic war movies

To show him what it's like

Burning bones of war

Days when I kissed your tears
Long crazy nights spilling into days
Times when I lost my fears

And it's driving me insane

Won't you be my guest tonight

Steppin' into that supertrooper light
Will put our spirits right




I can feel your heartbeat I can see your smile

Living out your fantasy

Denim and leather never go out of style
Rock'n'Roll holds the key



Crank up the volume, blast it out loud


Scream at the top of your heads



Fasten your seatbelts, into the smoke
One way up we go


And we're flying through the night away


Far far away
And we'll fing a place we'd like to stay

Far far away



Everywhere around the world

Rock is still alive

You get together with your best friends


On a magical drive


Crank up the sound, turn it up loud

Shout, let your feelings out
Fasten your seatbelts, light up the smoke


One way up we go



And we're flying through the night away...



And we're flying through the night away...

At the speed of light

And we'll find a place we'd love to stay



You got to hold on tight

Solo



Crank up the sound, turn it up loud

It's a magical carpet ride

Scream and shout, let your feelings all out


Get your spirits high


And we're flying through the night away...



And we're flying through the night away...



Come and join the ride!

The sound of steel rang loud, above the battle cries
I found her lying lifeless, dagger through her heart
I picked her up, and held her high, and I swore to be avenged
Swore to the best, oh swore to be avenged, oh

I want to touch and hold you for my own

I've waited long for this love
To unfold the secrets from within
Under the moon, the stars, the sky
So alone that I could die
Without the cure, without your love, so pure

Let's find a place
Come on, I wanna touch ya
Wanna hold you, oh, come on
",Open Fire,2003
Krokus,"One love, no war
I know I'm not alone
I like to live my life in freedom
So don't you close the door

Around the world too many people
Wastin' their lives away
'Cause they can't tell what's right from wrong
At the end of the day

Life is hell, no peace for the wicked
Where evil rules the game
Spreads like a wildfire and burns you down
We've gotta fight it, gotta stamp out the flame

Raise your hands for a better world
Raise your hands and let your voices be heard
Raise your hands if you want a better world
Raise your hands, I say that truth is the word

I know I'm not alone
I look in your face
Can see her sparkling shine of innocence
I'm in the best right place

Life has its burdens, too much pain
She can be a cold bitch
Let's put this sufferin' all down to experience
And let her make us all rich

Living in hell, no peace for the wicked
Where evil rules the game
Spreads like a wildfire, destroys all dignity
We've gotta fight it, gotta stamp out the shame

Raise your hands for a better world
Raise your hands and let your voices be heard
Raise your hands if you want a better world
Raise your hands, I say that truth is the word

Let's hear it

Raise your hands
Raise your hands for a better world
Raise your hands and let your voices be heard
Raise your hands

Raise your hands, make a stand
Turn on and raise your hand, make a stand
Raise 'em high in the air
Make that message clear

And it's rainin' in my head
Stayin' at home is drivin' me nuts
Gotta boogie through the life out there

Great plans for a wild weekend

On the corner of the city gate

There's a place open all night

Krokus,"I saw her walkin' down the street
My heart jumped up and missed a beat
Boy, she looked sharper than an arrow
Her skirt too short and really narrow

No risk, no gain
But I must have made a pass too plain
Her hand came flyin' and it really was a shame

Well, I guess she was throwin' her china
With a steamy temper no one could stop
Yes, I guess she was throwin' her china
Too sexy when she blows her top

Next day I saw her in the park
If I was a dog I would have barked
In a pink bikini by the lake
Her perfect body lay to bake

No risk, no pain
And I must have blocked her sun away
Cold ice came flyin' and it landed on my face

Well, I guess she was throwin' her china
With a steamy temper no one could stop
Yes, I guess she was throwin' her china
Too sexy when she blows her top

Lyin' in the sunshine by the lake

Another time, another place
I just gotta win the race

Krokus,"Dark was the night
Tears on my face
We gathered in the candlelight
As the whole world stood still

How can I forget that prayer for the dead
Underneath that blackened sky
As close as we could get

It's the age we're livin' in
A dark sign of the times
Can't let the madness
Kick us down to the ground

We'll rise, we'll rise
We'll shine in the night
We'll rise, we'll shine
From the ashes of eternity

We'll rise, we'll rise
We'll shine in the night
We'll rise, we'll shine to eternity

Another starry sky
Another silver moon
And soon the sun will shine
Warming our roofs

Gather your children
We must move with the wind
To make a fire bright
From the flames within

We'll rise, we'll rise
Like an eagle flies in the sky

And we'll rise, we'll rise

I learned when I was growin’ up
Sometimes you, sometimes me
Always love
Train hard, now my focus up
Got it all but ain’t had enough

I’m out the shed and the tools brand new
Dear mama dropped them jewels that I never ran through
The most driven never sat up in the back seat
The most forgiven never flagging down a taxi
That’s my word if it’s meant to outgrow
Like I used to run home to catch the last of my show
Some move to the future other's living it slow
Old tunes trying to find where the memories flow
You know I try to chase ‘em down no dragon
Shit, they shot a Beatle, do people still imagine?
I think the world could be a better place
No fam but I still set a table and I said it's grace
I think I'll let you in my life all access
Gift and curses, cursive closed captions
Misinterpreting the passion
Saving face ain’t a game, ain’t a time for retractions
I learned one way then front the opposite
I learned behind the beat, now I learned on top of it
I do go against the grain
I do take bigger pictures that don’t fit in the frame

Dip the scriber in the inkwell
Thoughts sketch a snapshot
Vibrant check the detail, now the family eats well
Used to cut the mold off bricks for grilled cheese melts
Wandering the crumbling castle wondering how the things fell
Mansions and lap pools to sleeping on back pews
Pictures and statues where roaches and rats moved
Faithfully I've seen it all alive, and I’m grateful
With Curtis Mayfield singing “Just be Thankful”
Slapping loud out a glasshouse, pearl enamel tooth color
Seasoned old cats then the ragtop, roof covered
Nodded and they nodded back, respect acknowledged
Got a fine arts degree plus the streets are a college
California campus, I've studied abroad
Bloodied the canvas, pondering atlas, ""What if he shrugged?""
The rich lady asked, ""What if we thug?""
Humanity said ""I’m feeling drowsy what is the drug?""
Wake the team up, never alone but on my own two
Held the elevator, check the levels that we've grown through
Philanthropic maybe 'cause I did my dirt
There, I’m haunted, honestly I never fronted all is all I ever wanted
Keep an eye on hustlers, watch out for the schemers
No more kid gloves for the dreamers
Awake trying to live dreams physically, energy is extreme
Lessons of infinity are vivid on the big screen

I stay connected in places, respected by faces

Kronos Quartet,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

Really gets bad

Some of them cries about it.
Some of them dies about it.
Everything's a-fightin' about the spoonful.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful.
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful.

Could fill spoons full of tea.

Save you from another man.

Just say you're with me now, with me now
With me now, with me now

Heartbeat's the sign of my time
I love to linger in your sign
There's something wrong with me tonight
Somehow I know I've crossed the line
Don't go
(Oh, ya)
Couldn't take the blow
I need you with me now, with me now
With me now, with me now
I'm moving slow

asleep in his bed and he seems to be alone

a burnin' pain in the small of my back

a shot to my shoulder, another to my waist
i turn to see my queen with a smile on her face

strap at hand, i don't understand, how could you 
decieve me for another man?

i wake up to darkness, my one room apartment
no lights, just candle wax burnt to the carpet

it was just a dream, right? oh, what a sight
there lies my queen, asleep in the night

What is a real hip-hop MC?
Is it MTV, is it BET?
Is it five m-i-see's 
So the people can see
I mean, how you think you're free 
When you act like property?
Tell me, how do you judge an MC when he's rockin
I mean rockin it live, not pickin his cotton
I mean adjustin his clothes, I mean how do you know
Before you come to the show that you're not gettin heated
That you're not gettin cheated
That you ain't come to the club thinkin 'I must've been weeded!'
(Word)
You got to be a educated consumer
Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya
Ass they want is your cash, ass, grass, gas in a flick
When you ask for that autograph they ass-dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we bust off the gatler

[Chorus]

This is the ""Sneak Attack""
The ""Edutainment"" style returns like that
Take it off your shelf

You got to get with a

Representin the religion of hip-hop, sir
Those that oppose are foes and will get rocked - eh

True hip-hoppers don't bleed
True hip-hoppers don't need
True hip-hoppers don't speed
No time for greed
True hip-hoppers do read

Will sow seeds that breed
Ah-ha that's safer than weed, indeed

True hip-hoppers don't crave
Silver and gold, we're not amazed
We live f-are-e-e
If you not into lyrics you can't really hear it nor see me
My philosophy keeps it plain and simple
Here it is: the kingdom of hip-hop is within you
Or is it the kingdom of hell that sends you?
I'm ringin a bell within you
You only seek in a cell, that's what sin do
It tells you to put your craft on a menu, a chart
So they can sell you and your art

Verse One: Steele 
Here we go, break of day, with a mad live session 
Down in Bucktown it's Black Moon, and Smif-N-Wessun 
Pick up the pace 'cause we're right behind ya black 
The punk got X-amount of shots, take one to your back 
BOO-YAA-KAA!!! Mr. Ripper did the shooting 
Cops heard the shots, shit's hot 'cause they're pursuing 
But it's my stomping groung where herds get blown down 
Think I'm gettin caught by beasts youse a damn clown 
Check the drums of death as I break what's left 
of your face, 'cause you're sellin out the rap race 
Your family cried as your body lies in it's casket 
I keep a black Smith-and-Wessun in my polo jacket 
Sixteen shots, for all you hardrocks 
And if your bitch is a dime she can get the cock 
Straight up and down, we two terrible toughies 
The Vickster hit your pockets then I made your eyes puffy 
What pussy? Better drop your mic and get to steppin 
Before you're face to face with a black Smith-and-Wessun 
Chorus: repeat 4X 
Load the clip, bust lead to the head 
The nappy head dread, Buckshot and Baldhead 
Verse Two: Buckshot 
Real niggaz represent and don't die 
Never dead like I said all we fuckin do is multiply 
I puff a mad bag of buddha 
Niggaz be like ""Yo who the shorty?"" 
I'm bustin niggaz with my six-shooter 
I get so much pussy my dick be in stitches 
Red-boned or even fucked-up black Zulu bitches 
What? This lil nigga is a mad stalker 
Brooklyn, New York will grab the leash around your neck and then I 
walk ya 
If youse a bigger nigga bigger niggaz get bucked 
'cause I'm the Buck and I don't give a fuck my dick you can suck 
Buck is a killer, thrill a nigga like Manilla 
I'm small but strong like that fucking gorilla 
A crazy-ass nigga puttin Brooklyn on the map 
I never gave a fuck, I never give a fuck, 'cause I'm all that 
I take no shit see, givin the Buck fifty 
I even blew your bitch 'cause your man tried to stick me 
Chorus 
Verse Three: Tek 
Ahh shit, a personality split 
And I'm bout to flip with my nigga pull the trigger let the Glock spit 
A little bad-ass shorty with no remorse 
I kill forties and quarts remains on stage so who the boss? 
Another boom blew up the scene 
throughout the planet, get green, now I got sticky mean with my tag 
team 
G want a clip thinkin I'm takin this the underground moves 
There ain't no more fakin if you're fakin I'm bakin it 
Straight up and down, nuff respect to Bucktown 
Home of the chrome, where I roam, not givin a FUCK now 
Damn, just when you thought it was safe 
to come out, with a rhyme, I got the nine to your face 
Boom, hooked up with Black Moon, now it's on for real 
so I pack more steel lookin for the kill 
Hope you're not the picture on my scope, 'cause the dread'll 
pump lead, from the black Smith-and-Wessun, nuff said

",Black Smif-N-Wessun,
KRS-One,"Uhh! Yeahhh
I know you're diggin this type of shit right here
We about to spark it on the mic, yeahhh
Come on!

The episode starts when I walk down the block kid
Reach in my poc-ket, yo where's my knot, it
Follows me into the spot, compellin
Go check the dread and yes he's herb sellin
A punani gate, I'm a potential felon
Izm is smellin, like I ain't even tellin
Channel one two, I'm smashin the law
Channel three, I make a run to the store
Channel four leave the store with the Phillie cause I...
Spark the izm, I'm off to Channel Live

Wake up in the mornin got the yearnin for herb
Which loosens up the nouns, metaphors, and verbs
And adjectives, ain't it magic kid what I'm kickin
Multi-flavored bags of sess, for the pickin
So listen to the izm as it talks non-stop
Hawaiian when I'm rhymin but so is the chocolate thai
Now the high, starts to settle
Kickin fat lyrics that rocks, like heavy metal

I'm comin out de dance wif de spliff of sensei
When I speak, big up Mack, L.O., and Malik
Like John Lennon, yes I'm I-see-M'n
I start grinnin, and syllables start bendin
My style is untangible, like a wild animal
Check the label as it goes round it's on Capitol
That's what I'm smackin you with cause it's easy
Like Lionel Richie, your whole style is bitchy
Switch me, mix me, somebody get me
Don't let me rip out my clothes like Bill Bixby
Rippin the microphone 'til I'm motherfuckin sixty
Smokin the indo, by the window, it's sticky

Spark the izm, my expertism, is lyricism
My flow will take you over, like I was hypnotism
So where's the lighter, to decipher, the skills that I'm bringin
Hyper than a little kid on ginseng roots
And culture, my intellect will insult ya
Finish off your dead mind like a vulture
I gotta get mine, get a grip
Cause there's all these weak rappers steady makin hits, FUCK THAT!
But ninety-four I bring the skills back
So listen now I'm doin what I want to do and sparkin mad izm

I come with notions, deeper than the ocean
Check out my potion, mad rhythm in the motion
The izm, brings the wisdom, when I kick it on the rhythm
Check it how I rock it in a cipher
Desire, takes you higher, lyrical messiah
(Yo yo yo yo-yo, pass that lighter)
Counterclockwise, I rise like the sun
Now feel the heat from the rays of the gun
Shootin out the mental mist
How you gonna know the real shit when your style's counterfeit??

His shit is counterfeit cause he's motherfuckin phony
Come into the jam try to front like he know me
Hah! Listen to this new type of somethin
Bumpin, ninety-four ain't for no frontin
New type of lingo, catchy like a jingle
Rougneck hip-hop is drippin from the single
Now, let me introduce you to the one
The Channel Live indo this loosens you up
Goin through the channels of the remote control
Flickin through the frequencies of your soul

Then roll the izm, the inflater, I'm weeded
Like wearing a sweater, at the equator, I'm heated
But I flip a style like I flip a channel
Step up and test the skills, you can get my tes-ticules
Cause hip-hop's been runningthrough my veins ever since
So it wasn't hard for me to grab the mic and represent
Representing tormenting MC's craniums
Till they can't flow why cause I'm drainin em
Don't mean to be blunt but don't front
I'm doing it for the love so now I'm doin what I want
To do with my Channel Live crew so just listen
Dissin wack MC's and sparking up mad izm",Mad Izm,

You can take a shot in the dark, but keep missin

But the pencil's made of oak, so don't provoke
You'll get broke, whaddya take I for a joke?
I'm radical, mathematical if I have static I'll
Pick up the mic or automatic either way I won't have it
I cover the whole gamit
Mic I'll rap it leaving with your ass out like a faggot
This is a losing battle your like cattle
The sound of my name KRS makes your tail waggle
Better yet you're a snake so it rattles
I'll dice you up like you're apple, smash you into Snapple
I'm not, the one you want to battle that bad 
Or just give me your ass I'll make a shoulder bag
I bring the blade all around
By the time I'm done you'll be $2.99 a pound

[Verse Two:] Tim Dog
Coming from the butcher shop
Fuck with KRS and the Dog and get chopped
Chopped, say stopped, hah think stopped
Stop listen to the hip-hop while others slip-slop
Till they hit the tip-top now it's time to get props
Wack MC's I just tax
I'll eat tracks shit it out with Ex-Lax
Bitch ass niggaz step aside
Tenderoni rappers, means your homicide
Toyin non-believers, here's the menace side
Shit aside, come inside, you're goin on a murder ride
I'm energetical theoretical copastetical alphabetical
Hypothetical yeah that is cool, no I'm not a fool
Takin you to school, don't be late for school, fool
I'm suckin your girl while your ass in school
Fool, why bother drool, cause I'm too cool 
I'm the man with lyrics that jam
Kickin MC's in the face like Van Damme
Shazam, hot damn, thank you ma'am
Don't eat Spam or no types of ham
You thought I fell off? You're smokin somethin
You thought I was soft? You on dope or somethin
You must be on a can of dope and dog food
You actin real rude, don'tcha know I'm Tim Dog dude?
So go ahead and flex, if you got necks
But when I get the mic I get wreck
So come on, come on, come on, come on
I'll eat that ass that's word is born
Rarrrrrgh!

[Chorus:] Tim Dog (KRS-One in parenthesis)
Can I get a yes (yes)
Can I get another one, yes (yes)
Do I get wreck and get respect (yes)
Are you the king the K the are the S (ohhh yes)
Well can I get a ho (ho)
Can I get another one, ho (ho)
Do I get wreck at any show (ho)
Lyrically I got the flow (ho), there ya go

[Verse Three:] KRS-One
Now don't say nuttin while I'm checkin ya
Causin hysteria been in more battles than America
Rap messenger, comin in quick I pick up the mizick and watch em stagger
Rip another verse and watch his body splatter
Whether you like me or not don't matter, Kris is not a actor
I'll burn your favorite rapper and leave him in stitches
Weak bitches, real renegade rap rebels rip rhymes
Ferociously, which one of these pussy MC's can go at me
So if you wish to play me like a farmer
I get calmer, chop ya ass up like Jeffrey Dahmer
My pyschopathic fantastic pathic puts you in a casket
On top of that, you can get your ass kicked
Quick, awww shit
(undecipherable)
And I got more rhymes than Madonna gets dick
And I'm the lyrical lunatic, that flips offness with the quickness
Yo I get heated like cough menthalyptus now
The micraphone I must feel it I must touch it up
Kris One and Tim Dog's come to fuck it up
Evidently I bust shots till the glock is empty
No safety, pull the trigger tip don't try to chase me
Down, chase the sound you must be buggin
This is Boogie Down, Boogie Down, Boogie Down
Boogie Down Boogie Down Produc-tions
Jump around be the one is the function
Tim Dog, why don't you show em a little somethin

[Verse Four :] Tim Dog
Baby baby um, maybe maybe um
You better run, cause you know I have a gun
Bang bang boogie, up jumps the boogie
Take that bullshit rap down the street
A skippedy be bop be bop, Scooby Doo
That bullshit's not me, that bullshit is you
I come correct, get much respect
Do some hummina hummina shit, and still get wreck
Cause I'm the Dog, the muthafuckin Dog ya hear
I'm the Dog, the muthafuckin Dog ya hear
MC's come close but never could get near
Cause I just smash, throwin keys through glass
Take his cash, whip his ass, and do a yard dash
So take your ass home, write a poem
And when you get nice, use the god damn phone
Cause I get buckwild, do some ole freestyle
And beat ya down with the turnstile
Doggie doggie bo boggie fanana fanna fo foggie
Me mi mo moggie, doggie
Rappers goin platinum doin this bullshit
I do the same shit, and make a big hit
Cause if you don't like my lyrical flow
I gotta make dough, don'tcha know, ya little ho-
Mo- sexual I bet you will
Be on the dick if it turns into a hit
But that type of shit is jumpin the fuck off
So I do the same, now I'm comin off
So don't get upset if you can't get lyrical respect
Don't get mad, get wreck

Yeahhh, this track has been dedicated, to real hip-hop

Here in America you have drug spot
They get the black cop, to watch the drug spot
The black drug dealer just avoid black cop
They're killin each other on a East Coast block

Thirty years, there were no black cops

Hardcore kids in the West got stress
In the East we are chased by the same black beast
The black cop is the only real obstacle
Black slave turned black cop is not logical
But very psychological, haven't you heard?
It's the BLACK COP killin black kids in Johannesburg
Whassup black cop, yo, whassup?!
Your authorization says shoot your nation
You want to uphold the law, what could you do to me?
The same law dissed the whole black community

But me NAH violent, just myself I protect
Too many time I see, young gwal pickadee
Pay five ten twenty thirty dollar to see

Talk bout they wan fi sex up and fill up you body
But them NAH talk about peelin off some money
for the pumpin onna bed, when you haf the baby
Whattaya think can happen next?  After you're done havin sex?
Too much of ignorance, not enough intellence
Mahn me NOT against sex, but too many DJ

KRS-One,"After seven years of rockin'
How do you rate me?
Poorly or greatly?
Everybody seems to be goin' for their's lately
Yo mad heads be needin' money
So listen very close as I conduct this little study
See it's, funny to me, you can watch TV
And give up your life trying to be all you can be
In the Army
Not knowin' your history
You either fight and die or come back home in misery
Yo get with me, I deal with reality
Loosen your mind to the truth, and don't get mad at me
No politician can give you peace
If you trust Jesus, why do you vote for a beast?
Emancipation is long over due
So overcome procrastination
Because freedom is within you
For some reason we think we're free
So we'll never be
Because we haven't recognized slavery
You're still a slave, look at how you behave
Debatin' on where and when and how and what Massa gave
You want to know how we screwed up from the beginning?
We accepted our oppressor's religion
So in the case of slavery it ain't hard
Because it's right in the eyes of THEIR God
Where is our God, the God that represents us?
The God that looks like me, the God that I can trust?
A God of peace and love, not mass hysteria
I don't want a God that blesses America
I could never really vote for the devil
Let me take you to a higher level

Title, take the title from the Bible we can get there
Rip the title from off the front of the Bible, God don't live there
Too many inconsistencies, too many mysteries
Picture the Pope and the Vatican, laughing and drinking and singing and
Kissing me
I stand with God whether I'm paid or whether I'm cryin' broke
I like to ask these politicians would Jesus vote?
The way we view God is a freakin' shame
Church is to blame
We trust God, but bomb Hussein
We simply lovin' the scripture
Same scripture that whipped 'cha
Sooner it'll hit 'cha
Religion's gettin' richer
With that European version of Christ made into a picture
Our society's gettin' sicker, and sicker, and sicker...
Like liquor, we are God-Intoxicated
Not to the true God, but the one the government created
The same governments tellin' people to vote
I pray to God because the people have lost hope
You either vote for the mumps or the measels
Whether you vote for the lesser of two evils, you vote for evil
Politics and God are not equal
But the education if you don't guard, is really lethal
People have more respect for a holy book
Than they do for a cow on a meat hook
Believers of Jesus be denouncing Satan on every level
But every Halloween they're dressin' like devils
I pray to you for the light you might give them
Mother make them know that you're livin' with them
You begin them and end them in silence
Frankly, if they knew you, they would understand violence
I pray to you for the Pope and the Vatican
Have mercy Mother, cause I know that you're mad at them
The White Jesus deceived us awhile ago
And Pope Julius the Second paid Michaelangelo
I know this happened in 1519 yet
This is the image we can't seem to forget
Vote for God, don't vote for the Devil
Let me take you to a higher level",Higher Level,1993

Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two

I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

I'm dreamin, about bein a blunt
I'm runnin around and I just can't wake up, hah!
I'm dreamin, about bein a blunt, ho!
I'm walkin around and I just can't wake up

I'm tryin to wake up, I can't wake up
So I run and jump, someone yelled, ""Get that blunt!""
Get that blunt now I'm thinking this is major
I've got a bunch of people chasin me with a razor?!
I don't like this dream as a blunt
But I can't get out of it and I can't seem to wake up
So I'm runnin and racin, blunt smokers are chasin
This is insane, I'm caught by House of Pain
I'm picked up, they said they gonna Put My Head Out
They slit my back and all the tobacco fell out
Now I'm hollowed wet thin and yes ready
They poured the shumpang gently and re-wet me
I'm in the mouth yo, I can't wake up
Yo I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

Check it out now, in the same attire here comes the fire
OW they lit it, now I'm burnin by the minute
But check it out, more heads came to chill
Everlast took a pull and passed me to Cypress Hill
Cypress Hill took a pull, lungs are full
Who's next? I'm bein passed to Das EFX
As they took a mad pull, smoke blows in heaps
It's really smoky but I can still see Black Sheep
Whoa! Black Sheep gets me, relights me
Room is proper, now I'm passed off to Shabba
Shabba's voice gets low like a tuba
He said, ""Me no follow no rumor"" and passed me to Grand Puba
I wasn't burnin right so Puba got mad at me
And said, ""Who rolled this?"" and passed it to Kid Capri
Kid Capri said, ""I won't front!
Pass it to Redman, he knows how to roll a blunt""
Redman said, ""No need to re-roll""
He hit, relit it, and passed me to De La Soul
De La Soul took a hit and kept hittin
Now they're buggin cause they passed me to Bill Clinton
Bill Clinton said, ""I'll smoke but I won't inhale
I'll only hit it twice,"" he got slapped by Greg Nice
Now I fell on the floor, Greg Nice picked me up
I'm bein smoked and I can't wake up

I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

Get me out of this, somebody wake me up
I'm still on fire and I'm still bein smoked up
Half my body is gone, now they're comin to my head
Now my head is being pinched by Teddy Ted
A crazy nightmare I got to go
I got to wake up and I'm passed off to Yo-Yo
Yo-Yo gets respect as a lady
She didn't smoke, she passed me to Showbiz & A.G
A.G. said, ""Respect due seen""
He got one big pull and passed me to Smooth B
Smooth B, although he's talking to Teddy
Took a hit and passed me to Fab 5 Freddy
Freddy said, ""Yo! There's nothing left pop""
Looked at me in my face and passed me to Chubb Rock
Chubb Rock said, ""Yo Freddy chill!
If you ever catch me smoking, just kick me in the grill""

Whose mouths and things are covered with herpes sores
He brags to the public about how he scores
With 12 year old girls behind convenience stores

Ask your Moms and Pops, yo they respect me

Use caution

And I also give abortions
I'll do a number to your body structure
You look like supper
And I'm that hungry motherfucker!
You don't want to be on the menu!
I'll end you, twist you up and bend you

Well I roll by myself but don't let it fool ya
If I got beef my crew'll damn step to ya
We don't play no games, I'll come straight to your rest
Lift up your shirt and blast you in your chest
[Well that was fresh]

A fad doesn't fill the bill, but mad skills will
Don't let me have to kill you kid, god forbid still
Greed will lead your need to succeed
but your speed, your speech
Your outreach is a breach of what I teach
For lyrical styles you're a leech
If I was Spanish I'd say, [""You lie like a beech""]
Wow-wow-wow-wow, wow-wow-wow, wow-wow-wow...
Wow, for a amateur you really looked hard
But you're really a bitch, when you get it together
call me, here's my card
Check the list: you lack breath control, mental behavior
Lyrical talent, imagination and flavor
I got no time for amateur rhyme, you could be hurt
Thinkin' you're hard because you wear a gangsta T-Shirt
I'll smash your want to-be ass in the deep dirt
Black, you'll come up dizzy sayin' ""How da fuck he do dat?""
'cause you're yappin' like you can't be reached
If your name ain't Arrested Development, well save your speech

Not a fake, I got more styles than Drake's got Tasty Cakes

KRS-One,"Bo!  Boom bye bye, hip-hop will never die
Despite the fact that I'm fly I'm never dry
You could beat me, cheat me, when you meet me try to defeat me
But nevertheless you'll have stress, cause I don't rest
You want to know what my problem is, if you're curious??
I take this hip-hop shit too serious!!
I forget that other rappers ain't true to this
So when they grab the mic I get hyped like LET'S DO THIS!!
All my rhymes are fat, while rappers are skimpy, wimpy
So I simply chew they crew like a Blimpie
Skip me when you dissin, skip me when you on a ego mission..
I blow up, like nitroglycerin!
You better tune in to Teddy Ted
""Yo stop frontin', and use your head""

Well if you ain't called it hip-hop, there's a door, I ain't stoppin
I got more flavors than Baskin Robbins!
I flash the funky fresh flavors force-fully
Freak the phonies and flip philosophy constantly (true!)
That reminds me, rappers rock drip-drop
Not hip-hop, they want to SING and all dem ting
Thank God KRS is still rappin; all that ""ooh I love you baby""
and ""blink blink blink"" - this ain't happenin

Yo this is curtains for these rappers that be frontin on the next man

Around the way, we got a neighborhood trooper car
We ride by, and spray your crew, and your honies too
And rip you open and drink your blood like a Mountain Dew

I descend to lend a friend a helping hand
to stop a trend, again and again and again, I just can't say when
I beg to confess my sins to other men
Reverands guard lips, within there I'll begin
I'll always win, over-sakin
The party is ripped, without a hit or with a hit I'm rippin shit

You sling the M-16 and flash the M-1
But you don't know what you're doing never learned to handle one

Your father telling you ""Now son just go to school
Don't go acting like a fool and don't go acting too cool""
You get to the school and meet up with the right bunch
Just a group of kids with no names taking people lunch
You join the click because you want to meet some girls
And you want a little prestige in you little school world
One day you're walking with your crew along the road
And a member of your crew pull out a gun and unload
He shoot a parked car and all you run far
You and your friends laughing like you a superstar
And you get home and you thinking it was fresh
And a cop meet you there with a warrant for your arrest

Didn't you see the little boy there in the back seat sleep?
Now the boy dead we want to know from you
Who shot the car up, are we gonna take you?""

We don't want no niggers here unless he is a cop""
So the kid pull out a big baseball bat
And them him slap with the bat because the kid is black
Now then the kid fell down but still alive
So he reach in his pants and pull out a four-five
Pop! One friend drop and everyone run
Out of all the white kids now you the only one
You start cry, cause now you gonna die
And it's all because what your friends did to this guy

KRS-One,"Back in the days I knew rap would never die
I used to listen to Awesome-2 on WHBI
I used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops
Rappers wore bell-bottom Lee suits
Me and Kenny couldn't afford that
So we would go to the park when they was jammin' to hear rap
I used to listen till the cops broke it up
I always thought to myself ""Damn, why they fucked it up?""
But never the less I was in love with the microphone
And it stayed that way until I left home
On the streets of New York, now I'm free
But with freedom comes big responsibility
I used to walk around driven by the force
I remember how large Super Rhymes was when he fell off
I used to wonder about crews that used to rock
They were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top

Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Record deal and video outta here?
Mercedes Benz and Range Rover outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!

After livin' on the streets alone
Some years went by, I signed myself into a group home
I used to watch the show ""I Dream of Jeannie""
And dreamt about ""When will I be large like Whodini?""
But I was messin' with graffiti on the subway
And gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday
I knew it had to bea better way see
So I would go to my room, blast RUN DMC
Around 1984 I left the group home, again alone
Still dreamin' about the microphone
Gimme a chance man, I know I can rock it
But I had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket
So when I reached the shelter I met my helper DJ Scott La Rock
And we both loved hip-hop
I was takin' suckas out in the shelter system
Yeah there was rappers in the shelter but I had to diss 'em
But all along, my vision was never lost
I kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off

Do you ever think about when you're outta here?
Fly girl and fresh gear outta here?
Five-thousand dollar love seat outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!

While I'm battling these rival crews
Yes, BDP would stay in the street news
Some said all they want to do is battle
They can't write a song, so their careers won't last long
Around this time I used to hang with Ced Gee
And DJ Scott La Rock used to buy gold with Eric be
I didn't meet Rakim till later with Scott
I remember we were jammin' at the rooftop
It used to irk me when these critics had opinions
Scott would say ""Just keep rappin', I'll keep spinnin'""
We had a fucked up contract, but we signed it
And dropped the hip-hop album Criminal Minded
We told the critics your opinions are bull
Same time Eric be and Rakim dropped Paid in Full
Hip-hop pioneers we didn't ask to be
But right then hip-hop changed drastically
People didn't want to hear the old rap sound
We started samplin' beats by James Brown
In the middle of doin' My Philosophy
Scott was killed and that shit got to me
But knowin' the laws of life and death
I knew his breath, was one with my breath
I had nothin' left and it was scary
So I dropped By All Means Necessary
Another hip-hop group that was a friend of me
Was a revolution crew called Public Enemy
It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back
These two albums set off consciousness in rap
But all along, I'm still lookin' around
And all I can see are these rap groups fallin' down

Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Condominium and beach house outta here?
Credit cards and bank accounts outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, be we ain't goin' out!",Outta Here,1994

What... I say, follow me follow me
With my syllable syllable lyrical criminal
MC threats are minimal to my phsyical they just
Whittle and whittle away, with little and little to say
As they piddle and paddle away, they say OK
But I chop that ass up anyway
What's your handle I got mad MC heads upon a mantle
I got genuine MC skin sandals
I light the mic up like a candle, watch it melt
Cause when I felt lyrics you both are screamin for help
When you hear it, you can't bear it, you can't even wear it
You oughts to just cheer it, go get it spirit!!
As I fa-la-la-la-la, I'm comin with that rara
Rockin mics when you was googoo gaga to your momma
You wanted to battle KRS when you was young you told your poppa
He slapped you in your head and said UHH-UHH
But you didn't heed the warning
Now I'm in the place, now I'm your face

Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
Let it be known, you can lean on KRS-One
Like a wall cause I'm hard, I represent GOD
Wack MC's have only one style: gun buck
But when you say, ""Let's buck for revolution""
They shut the fuck up, kid, get with it
Down to start a riot in a minute
You'll hear so many Bowe-Bowe-Bowe, you think I'm Riddick
While other MC's are talkin bout up with hope down with dope
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY!
That's for calling my father a boy and, KLAK KLAK KLAK!
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO!
That's for calling my sister a hoe, and for you
BUCK BUCK BUCK, cause I don't give a motherfuck

you black people still thinkin about vot-ing
Every president we ever had lied
You know I'm kinda glad Nixon died!

[Chorus]

This is not the first time I came to the planet
But every time I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin to like
get wit you, showin you, you are invincible
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
In my spiritual form,  I turn into Bobby Seale
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
and enters into Kwame Ture

[Chorus]

In the streets there is no EQ, no di-do-di-do-di-do
So I grab the air and speak through the code
the devil cannot see through as I unload
into another cerebellum
Then I can tell em, because my vibes go through denim
and leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin
Have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
We got no time for fancy mathematics
Your mental frequency frequently pickin up static
Makin you a naked body, attic and it's democratic
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic

While KRS-One, holds the minds of the children
I'm buildin' a followin' of a hundred and forty-four thousand
Chosen few heads up in project housin'

I spent 40 days, and 40 nights in the wilderness
I'm hard, from head to toe yo there ain't no killin' this
I wrote over 100 rap hooks
and sociological books, while you worried about your looks
Now you want to enter the dragon in sound
But I've got the live club show locked down
Platinum and gold don't hold in my arena
You gots to keep it real on the mic, when they see ya
I manifest, in the West the East and overseas
The vision in rap is wack, and I don't know of these
I represent New York to be specific
The South Bronx, but in Japan I'm still gifted
I grab a jet and land on your set, what the fuck?
Twenty bucks for a rap show is still, twenty bucks
I start from eighty-six, and bring you into ninety-six
No gimmicks, tricks or lip-sync lyrics

Talkin about they people and how they should be equal
They talkin but the conversation ain't goin nowhere
You can't diss hip-hop, so don't you even go there
C. Delores Tucker, you want to quote the scripture
Every time you hear nigga, listen up sista

I met up with this girl named Delores, a prankster
I said I MC, she said, ""You're a gangster""
But she was caught up, she hit the floor like a breakdance
Wrapped her up like the arms in a be	-boy stance
Recognize moms I'm one of your sons I'm hip-hop
In the form of Channel Live and KRS-One
Representin MC's across America
She said, ""You're the one who be causin all that mass hysteria""

Wisdom shall come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
But you blinded by cultural ignorance and steady judging
But judge not, lest ye may be judged
For the judgment ye judge ye shall surely be judged, you gets no love

She said, ""I like it, that's why I jock it""
Then I said, ""You only on my back because I fill brother's pockets""

Wild recital, I kicks the vital, like the _Final

I had to Rush Limbaugh, get that pig with an axe
Tuffy dips to the side, buckin cannons that's phat
Because he censors the uses of the metaphor
You can get the dick bum up
Because it's you that brings the, real horrorcore
Expenditures forgettin, gut from the poor

Why sure!  Back before we were born they sold us out
Yeah Dade Jackson we know what you about
Youse a Slave Mason, not a Free Mason
Before long the Goddess Tiamat through hip-hop you'll be facin
Don't start me, cause I be the, lyricist
At the nineteen ninety-nine millennium party held at Giza
Sayin he's a, fraud, oh my Goddess
Never in your life should you disrespect an artist
Instead, focus your attention on astronomy
And the up and coming, shift in the economy
If you can't do that, then heed the final call
To free Mumia, Abu-Jamal

Hate to be so rough, it could be the White Owls
House niggaz are full of crap, like my Colin Powell
Kickin vowels, is how we relieve the tension
Until we start to bounce white people like suspension (revolution)

But tell me, who blew up Oklahoma?

It's Hakim that voice from the East

Buck buck!  Buck buck buck!
It sound like gunshots but it could be the plot
Of a chicken, definition, is what you're missin and
Listen to your children instead of dissin em
Senator Dole doesn't understand the young people
Like they be sayin want to, but we be sayin want to
They gettin dumber every summer as they walk the rope
Maybe because they cannot understand the quotes

Word, in actuality, this Norman Bates mentality
Always seems to represent, minus three-sixty percent
For degrees full circle, dead from the purple
Rays of the sun I gots melanin so check it
Bag your nuts quick or get sick from being naked
Suspect it, was it a means for the end
For just a few to drive the Benz while you eat the pigskins
Turned you into mannequins, cause the trick of technology
A revelation, revelations
Sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
That's my solution, there will be no sequels
I'm Audi hundred forty four thousand with my people

From Caligula to Hitler, now it's Schwartzeneggar
A lust for the violence is the science of their behavior
Who enslaved ya (it's the Devil) but the God of virtuosity
And of the world created, could it be mental sodomy
Got my mind twisted like the blades of fonta leaf
I sit in disbelief as he crawls underneath
The rock cock back the glock, cause I don't trust
The Devil I rebel until Babylon is dust

KRS-One,"Yeah.. yeah.. yup!
You know what?  I was just downstairs
And I was on my way up here to the studio and
A guy bumped into me and
And he said.. he said, ""Yo Kris!
How is it that you stay in this music?
You know, this rap music ex-specially for SO.. LONG.. SO.. LONG""
I said, ""Well you know years ago I made a deal with the Goddess""
He said, ""The Goddess?""
I said, ""Well yeah, you might know her as God
But I know her as the Goddess""
The universal mother
The mother of everything you see in existence
I ax-ked her for assistance
In lyrical persistence
And she gave it to me, under one condition
She said, ""I'll give you the gift
But use the gift to uplift""
I said, ""Okay mom!""

So I tell you the truth, really
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself

In the beginning was the word, the word was made flesh
Knowledge K. Reigns R. Supreme S.
Some of us guess while others of us are blessed
Take heed to the word, that I manifest
I manifest the future, the present, followed by the past
Everything in nature, rules by kickin ass
What they tellin me, but yo, you a friend to me
So I'ma tell you the secrets of MC longevity
Secret one: if it ain't fun, you're done
And about your career, huh, well choose another one
If you don't like what you do, you're through
Lesson two: make sure you got a dope crew
Not some crew, that's like an anchor on a shoe
A MAD CREW, that's of some benefit to you
Lesson three, might be contradictory or funny
But MC's should have OTHER WAYS of gettin money
That's to say learn other things beside music
Make money elsewhere, Hip-Hop you won't abuse it
Too many MC's, just emcee
So their longevity, is based on an Uncle Tom
At the record company
Lesson four: sell your image, never sell a record
Image is respected, records come and go
And get collected
Even the records of platinum artists, that used to rip shop
Can be bought, for a quarter at the thrift shop
Which brings me to lesson number five, the illusion
Has me thinkin, the minute they drop a record
They'll be cruisin, in the Acura
Slow down!  You're still a amateur
What separates the pro from the amateur is stamina
Not how long you can rhyme, but how long you've been rhymin
Changin with the times, and findin yourself
Still CLIIIIIIIIIIIIMbin for wealth
Blow for blow, you're still growin, still showin
(all knowin) now that's a pro at it

Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself

I'm thinkin' real hard about some money I can hold
But everybody I know is deep in the hole

But in my hand a shiny .45 is what I hold

Wheat, I'm feelin' weak, I can't hold
I gotta rob somebody tonight and take the whole
Bank roll, some cash I gotta hold
At the bottom of my shoe is a little bitty hole
That's it, my mental sanity I can't hold
I'm walkin' to the store with this pistol that I hold...

Half of me is sayin' maintain and uphold
Suddenly I bump into some asshole
He's cursin' me out, but this pistol that I hold
Took control, and in his head I put a hole
Ahhh man, now I'm lookin' around the whole
Area, the gun is still hot that I hold
I'm buggin' out, and I don't know how much longer I can hold
I feel myself sinkin' deeper in the hole
So in my victim's pants I rip a little hole
And felt for the wallet, and took the whole
Bill-fold, forty bucks is what I hold
Suddenly I hear, ""Freeze! Police! Hold!""

In the penitentiary I see a whole
Bunch of blacks and Hispanics that they hold
In my cell I cry like hell, my head I hold
One day somebody ax if my shoes they could hold
I told this guy, ""Listen! My shoe's got a hole
But what's up with that shiny sharp knife that you hold?""
He lunged forth, the first thing that I thought of was to hold
The arm with the knife so that he couldn't put a hole
In me, but then I put him in a chokehold
Took the knife and in his neck I put a hole
Suddenly all the C.O's come to me and it's me they hold
Beat my ass and I spend two weeks in the hole
I'm ready to bug out, my sanity I can't hold
My needs and wants messed up my life on a whole.

Damn. Just wasn't satisfied with life.

The moral to the story is...your addiction to your needs and your
wants is what causes problems in your life. Make sure you got whatcha
need. Put at a safe distance all the things that you want. It's wants
that get you into trouble.

Historically speakin, cause people be dissin
The first graffiti artists in the world were the Egyptians
Writing on the walls, mixing characters with letters
to tell the graphic story about their life, however
today we do the same thing, with how we rap and draw
We call it hardcore, they call it breakin the law
There used to be a time when rap music was illegal
The cops would come and break up every party when they see you
But now the rap music's making money for the corporate
It's acceptable to flaunt it, now everybody's on it

Fresh.. for nineteen-ninety-five
You SUCKERS!!!!",Out for Fame,1995
KRS-One,"Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth

I lived in a spot called millbrooke projects
The original criminal minded rap topic
With twenty cents in my pocket I saw the light
If you're young gifted and black, you got no rights
Your only true right, is a right to a fight
And not a fair fight, I wake up wonderin' who died last night
Everyone and everything is at war
Makin' my poetic expression hardcore
I ain't afraid to say it, and many can't get with it
At times in my life, I was a welfare recipient
I ate the free cheese, while the church said believe
And went to school everyday, like a god damn fool
Well anyway, here I am, chillin' at the party
Brothers lookin' at me like they want to kill somebody
A cypher manifested in the center of the jam
I got to show these wack rappers really who I am
It's me against them, so I clear the phlegm
And wage the war, hardcore to the end
For someone lookin' inside, yeah from the out
It seems like disrespect is what rap is all about
But hip-hop as a culture, is really what we give it
But sometimes the culture contradicts how we live it
Cause every black kid lives two and three lives
The city's a jungle, only the strong will survive

Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth

Every single day I hear lie after lie
Like ""black people don't die, we multiply""
So when I kick a rhyme I represent how I feel
The sacred street art of keepin' it real
Why I gotta listen, to somebody else?
How they got wealth, let me talk about myself
But all I really got is hip-hop and a glock
The results are obvious, if I'm confined to my block
Occasionally, in the city I'm released
To meet other beasts, lookin' for the feast
We grunt and growl, on the prowl, as the air gets thinner
""yo yo there he go, him,"" there's the dinner
White meat, carryin' a bag of some sort
Life is short, white meat is quickly caught
A scuffle a muffle yet none of us hesitated
Like mother africa, white meat is violated
We quickly disappear, like santa's little elves
And go into a area to fight amongst ourselves
We say, ""peace/piece"" cause that's what we really want
A piece of the pie that america flaunts

Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth

The truth is that police must serve and protect
Reality is black youth is shown no respect
The truth is government has a war against drugs
Reality is government is ruled by thugs
With all this technology, above and under
Humanity still hunts down one another
Rappers display artistic cannibalism
Through lyricism, we fight each other over rhythm
Through basic animal instincts, we think
So the battle for mental territory is glory, end of story

Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes equal actual life, in the youth

KRS-One,"Blastmaster Kris, I don't talk ish.
Expand your consciousness and dismiss foolishness.
No one is new to this or new to Kris.
In hip-hop's atomic structure I am the nucleus.
That is the center of the group we, us.
They, them, you, every squad, every massive, every crew.
Dental floss is lost when a true rapper jumps off.
The cash is incidental, but not mental distract you off course.
The style that I am kickin' is like chicken.
It will be bitten, rewritten, then performed for a twenty-five dollar admission;
Reviewed in The Source.
You will listen, then find somethin' missin' of course... it's skills;
That's what you're fishin' for, it's lost.
I'm gettin' too explicit; the track jingles.
I won't do a wack album, then remix it for my single.
Kickin' rhymes till I wrinkle, and my brown eyes twinkle.
God called hip-hop for the nine-cinco.

Tasty like a soufflé french croisant on Tuesday.
Rappers be boo-tay.
Goo-fy, that's how they crew stay;
Bitin' whatever you say to boost they ego.
We know the steelo; your whole character is foul.
Makes me want to shoot a free throw; blaow!
From the git go, no, get go, my flow hits low.
Wherever all the dope shit go; there's where my shit go.
Bee-dee-bee-bo, skank, I think;
Self with ya groups, everyone else, and the bank.
Others like to bring the shottie to the party;
I bring knowledge of self; you cure the mind; you cure the body.
Some rappers like to come to the party hopin' to leave with somebody.
Check, I come with skills, and I leave with your motherfuckin' respect.
Ahh yeah... so check, uh!

New types of verbal hip-hop I bring.
When you know you can sing, boy, you know you can sing.
I do not clutter up the airwaves with stacks of useless facts.
MC's trying to be macks, but acts like ignorant blacks;
Freak that, I'll snap your back as it cracks.
You will experience loss or lack of balance.
Stop the violence; fry from week to week like an allowance.
All of you are cowards; hiding behind the mask of MC.
I remember, thinkin' back to eighty-three;
No video; no you had to be a real, live, MC.
Now you younguns grow up buggin' any new jock you're huggin'
Weak production; let me tell you somethin'.
Any MC can battle for glory,
But to kick a dope rhyme to wake up your people's another story.
Act like you never saw me,

If I ruled the schools, from pole to pole
the entire judicial system would fold
I would get rid of the books cause they bogus
and in school, Knowledge of Self would be the focus
Kids would flock to the schools like locusts
Cause school now relates to them, and you would notice
violence in society would be a minimal
Cause the education yeah, would now be metaphysical
Not livin by laws, but livin by principal
If you disobey, the UNIVERSE gets with you
We would study giving so no one would steal
And we would read each other's magnetic fields
Petty crimes times petty crimes
equals prison for lifetimes
The universe divided by two
equals me and you
Me and you, go into the universe once
or as one united front

Any which way and you'll Cherish the Day like Sade

I'm strappin and attackin a pack

Flamboyant and flashy is one point in time when you're not ashy
Focus on the syllable formats and the cash G
G for guard your grill, I'm hard to kill
Odd but ill, a job to fill is to refill on skills
We built and killed style and skill
while poetically recriminate you like a child I will

But what you really sayin
You sound like a bitch-ass rapper when he's saying
""Yo Kris you hit too hard"" stop playing!
Switching and swaying
Day in and day out, your styles are played out, see you way out
Before you're laid out, your bright lights start to fade out
The last thing you heard is ""Who let the K out?""
?No great area?
Everything is black and white we took the gray out it's scarier
Either you're winnin or losin, spinnin the rules of conscience
But lyrically there ain't no stoppin
I'm droppin a lot in your noggin
Cause I know that you're lyrically starvin
Carbon, your name, battle battle
Everybody wants to battle but you BAB-BLE
Who knows ya, battlin me, is the only way that you can gain exposure
I feel for ya soldier
I hate to say it but I told ya so

This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill

MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
Cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine?
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tangle with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like artefacts
On the wrong side of the tracks, electrified

South South, Bronx

Raw rhymes for raw times
My albums are underground, but this blessing is all mine
And when it's tour time, we open more minds
You need to rethink who you think is the ""Greatest of All Time""
I got this -- I'm raw like Freddie Foxxx is
Hardcore like The LOX is, Scott LaRock is where Tupac is
Where hip-hop is, Digital-ly Underground like Shock is
Oh yes -- I know where the top is
But I'd rather rhyme about how crooked some of these cops is
My synopsis ain't pretty
I'd stay, off them plains and, out the city if I were you
Do what you gotta do
But while you wave them flags, remember Amadou Diallo
Here's what we gotta do, follow
I'll put hip-hop in you if you're hollow
Those that already filled, still take swallows
Goin over potholes with Tahoes
You don't think +I+ know? Huh! I'm lookin at you right now
You ain't dancin in the club, you in your car, sittin down
You in the crib, on the low
You got them headsets on the go
You just saw me at the show oh you don't know?
It's the Temple of Hip-Hop, comin, with a whole different flow
Yo where them hoes at? I don't know
But wherever God at, I'ma go
I give 'em a hard rap and a flow
That's why when they call back for the show, with no video
We get up and go

Yo where it started at?

Peep it out while I tell ya like this
In every single hood in the world I'm called Kris
It's the, truth for ya, it's the proof for ya
My Cristal passes more bars than lawyers
The underground sound, this is not easily found
You don't need no rings to be down
This is, past the platinum and gold
We already had 'em, it's old
Here's the truth if it be told, gather 'round
Philosopher style is known to be wild
If you only holdin them guns, who's holdin your child?
You got to be thinkin you know that you shrinkin
When the art of Navigation has been reduced to a Lincoln
Change the dial! I was free then and I'm free now
You free, runnin to MTV? I don't see how
You know the real from the fake, you know they stealin they cake
You know it ain't about the art, it's all about what they make
You know the radio's late, you know they play what you hate
That's why you got that Kay Slay tape, tryin to escape
You know the love of the cars and the rims
Tattooed arms and Timbs, are also called sins
You know you got to pay for these spins
You know the rap magazines be wack from beginning to the end

I never was a king and I'm not the Pres

I'm a preacher tryin to bring my people back from the dead
I'm a leader tryin to keep you all away from the feds
You my sister I'll be tryin to get you out of the bed
I'm a philospher sayin what has got to be said
I don't fill you with lead, I bring that knowledge instead
Follow this dread, I'll take you from A to Zed
Who am I? Just a scholar called K-R-S
You can spend your money on others but they ain't blessed
You can spend your money drugs and still be stressed
Look around for conscious rappes yo there ain't none left
I'm holdin it downbetter yet I'm holdin up
Waitin for some young buck to come and sip from the cup
And continue with the menu puttin new knowledge in you

KRS-One,"Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police! That's the sound of the beast!

Stand clear!  Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out!  We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack
But you be doin' that
I'd rather say ""see ya""
Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer?  You wicked overseer!
Ya hotshot, want to get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you want to follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police!

Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police! That's the sound of the beast!

Now here's a likkle truth
Open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word ""overseer,"" like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patrolling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police! That's the sound of the beast!

Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the see-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary
Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great, when it's gonna stop?!

'Cause I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks

If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go ""Illlll!""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, that's to leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or natty dread
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer

This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
'Cause they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine?
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tangle with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like artefacts
On the wrong side of the tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad iszm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em",MC's Act Like They Don't Know,1996
KRS-One,"It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Her truth is not hard
        It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Gimme the truth!

Listen to the lyric as the negative is shrinkin
It's shrinkin out your life when you decide to change your thinkin
One of the first things we gotta switch around of course
Is Jesus Christ, and him dying on the cross
You're looking at the cross, surrounded in it's mystery
With Jesus on the cross in a, total misery
Now separate Jesus from the cross so you can see
The truth about the cross, and the cross's history
The cross was created by the Roman government
It's only purpose and use, is cap-I-tal punishment
But Jesus Christ, was all about the revolution
While the cross was used as Jesus Christ's execution
See what if Jesus Christ, was hung upon a tree
Upon every church wall, that's exactly what you'd see
If Jesus Christ, was shot in the head with no respect
We'd all have little gold guns around our neck
If Jesus Christ was killed in  electric chair, now get it
You'd be knealing to the electric chair with Jesus, still in it
You gaze upon the cross, and you see the execution
You yell stop the violence but the cross you're still using

        It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Her truth is not hard
        It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Gimme the truth!

So I say listen, listen, open up your third eye vision
God is not down with religion
Religion they be sellin it, listen up, God is intelligent
Reading of the bible is irrelevant
You gotta look within yourself, not a scripture
KRS-One comes to rearrange the God picture
If you sit and believe, you can achieve
If you sit and accept, you don't know, what's correct
Or incorrect, take for instance Adam and Eve
The first two people on the planet, or so you believe
Their first time in heaven kids they had, Cain and Abel
Huh, now let me show you why the story's unstable
According to the story, according to what you believe
There was only Cain, Abel, Adam, and Eve
On the whole planet, now use your intellect
And tell me, what did Cain and Abel do for sex?
Upon the whole planet there was not another
Could it be for sex, heh, they were looking at each other?
Hold up!  I thought the church wasn't into that
But wait, still yet, there is another fact
How did the world get populated?
Now tell me if I'm wrong, but obviously Eve had it goin on
Think for a minute, I know it gets notorious
But yo G, check out the chorus

        It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Her truth is not hard
        It's not natural                If it goes against God
        It's not factual                Gimme the truth!

KRS-One,"Anybody in here right now with tape decks turn em on
And put em on record, I'll give you a second
I want to add authenticity to your tape
So when it's sold out in the street
You all can know this was a real party

These are poems circulating throughout the nation
Everybody's bad and everybody's tough
But how many people are intelligent enough
To open up their eyes and see through the lies
Discipline themselves, yourself to stay alive?
Not many
That's why the universe sent me today on this stage
With this to to say
The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer
And in the final hour many heads will lose power
What does the rich versus the poor really mean?
Psychologically it means you got to pick your team
When someone says the rich gets richer
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture
The rich get richer, cause they work towards rich
The poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto
Let go, it's not a novelty
You could love your neighborhood without loving poverty
Follow me, every mother, father, son, daughter
There's no reason to fear the New World Order
We must order the whole new world to pay us
The New World Order and the old state chaos
The Big Brother watching over you, is a lie you see
Hip-Hop could build it's own secret society
But first you and I got to unify
Stop the negativity and control our creativity
The rich is getting richer, so why we ain't richer?
Could it be we still thinking like niggas?
Educate yourselves, make your world view bigger
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture!",2nd Quarter-Free Throws,1997

Floatin' like a soap bubble that you don't wann puncture

KRS-One,"Open a the herb gate selling pure ganja
Babylon come but they undercover
They never really want me stop sell ganja
(They just wanna take a cut of what you make so far!)
But I'm not having it, I load the SLR
Pack the ganja boom! They break down the door
Pop-pop! T'ree shots, exchanged at close range
Out of three Babylon, me hit one in the brain
Pop-pop! Two shots hit the window pane
I exchanged four shots, I drop and feel pain
but I'm not hit, into the bathroom I crawl
I look out the window, it's a one story fall
I'm falling, hit the ground and start crawling
Soon I'm walking 'round, blending in with the crowd
Another day, I got away, I gotta fix this problem someday
But the very next day

Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)
Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)

I'm in another herb gate like a superstar
Eleven A.M., things are safe so far
I used to worry 'bout the competition on the block
But now the competition on the block is the cops
And even block watch doesn't know where we lay
Well (""Open up! It's the D.E.A.!"")
Aww man, just when I went for more lead
The door opens up, I got a glock to my forehead
(""Get down! Get on the floor!"") I felt the stick, I thought I was dead
But I woke up instead in a cell laying on my bed
I lay back down, then I heard the crack sound
Two D.T.'s came in and laid they glocks down
One was whistling a love song, as he put some gloves on
I thought to myself, damn something's wrong
Boom bap! Boom bap against my head
I fell back on the bed, down to his feet
The pain was insane but the hit was sweet
Cause these dumb-ass cops punched me right by the heat
The glock, two shots, three shots they screaming
Then someone said (""Hey wake up kid, you're dreaming!"")
I said, ""Yo dreaming?! That nightmare was hell""
But as I look around, I was still in my cell
Damn, I got myself caught up in a jam
The D.T. that woke me up was like, WHAT?!
I wiped the saliva, off my mouth
The D.T. said.. (""Let's make a deal"") No doubt!
No question, now we started up the session
No need for guessing, yes they want my supplier
I said, what makes you think there's anyone higher?
He said.. (""Don't be a God damned liar!"")
You killed three D.T.'s yesterday, you heard me
But still the cops you knocked off yea was dirty
Now the whole investigation is federal
We want you to point out, the rest of the cops that are criminal
He continued to say, you can't think it through
This whole drug game is BIGGER than you!
Follow our plan man and you'll be free
Let me explain one thing so you can see, we

Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)
Can't stop, won't stop selling mad izm
All competition I gots to get wit 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, dis him!)

Now I'm back in the herb gate, all wired up
Constantly thinking about being tied up
Snap out of it, I'm thinking, ""Damn we like elves!
The federal and local cops got wars with themselves;
and I'm in the middle, and can't solve the riddle.
My nose is runny"" (""Let me get a 20!"")
A 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown?
(""Gimme the whole pound, clown, or duck down!"")
God damn, God damn, here we go again
But this time I'm set up by my federal friend
Suddenly I hear (""Yo, move from the door!"")
Followed by the shot sounded like a four-four
After the violence, then there was silence
Then I heard.. (""Hey yo it's us, open up the door!"")
But rule number one in this game is self-reliance
So I picked up the mini-mac in case they wanted more
The door opened up, the feds said what up?
They was sticking you up, so they had to get bucked
Suddenly a sense of trust came over me
I thought to myself, ""Well soon I'll be free!""
But as I turned around, I heard the gun go click
I said wait, but it was too late","Can't Stop, Won't Stop",1997

Yeah, yeah
Hardcore lyric comin at ya they attackin ya
Rappers bite like Dracula the soul of hip-hop
I'm puttin back in ya, with the South Bronx vernacular
Bound to put the crack in your armor, I am much sharper
Than a lot of other mic rockers, slightly eccentric
But everything's authentic, when I said, ""I'm hip-hop,"" I meant it
Emcees want to debate the issue, but false though
If they studied they would see that they are hip-hop also
Hip-Hop you can't do it, you gots to be it
You can't confine it, you have to free it, so you can see it
As your expression, and learn the lesson, on life in ghetto sections
And what you feel is the forward direction
For black people, not these Star Wars save that for R2-D2
I got five fingers like Bruce Lee do
And with the five fingers I grab microphones and bring the
Stinger to DJ's, rappers, singers and beer drinkers
This MC's a thinker, unlike others but I won't diss yaz
You're still my brothers and sisters, Kris is
ONE aspect of hip-hop rap
Negative rap, positive rap, forget that black it's a trap
To set us back, concentrate on various rap talents
Presently the rap radio format is unbalanced
You either got the player, or the conscious rhyme sayer
All day, on your radio, not with a different flavor
Someone has to DIE before you hear a conscious record
People don't like gangsta rap, but conscious rap, they don't respect it
The truth is people are afraid of black youth
Our expressions, our lessons and gold teeth, so..

Or chill out watchin videos
Or actin really silly yo but really doe
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

If we can't have trust then you can't hang with us
We respond to those who show respect with respect
We respond we connect on the same deck
Same intellect, my man, never shifty, thinks quickly
If you can't understand, we boys we boys
We could stand on the corner with a hat sellin toys
It ain't about your Benz I hope it ain't about mine

Gettin G's around the world, I can trust you with my girl

I'm not a yes man and none of my friends are yes men
Or women, I'm drivin, I see my peeps yo get in
Where you fit in?  True friends are quick to sit
In the beginning of all trouble, and when your bankroll doubles

Still I got my own space like Hubble

Cause don't nobody care about us, all they do is doubt us
Until we blow the spot then they all want to crowd us
And want to shout us, but you my man from way back
I just gots to say that, actin large I don't play that
But I can't say that, where I play at isn't fast-paced
A friend can acquire the taste to become two-faced
And that's a disgrace there ain't nothing you can say to us
When the kid you grew up with betrays your trust
When we used to ride the bus we had trust
Now we cash checks and drive Lex, and can't show respect to one of us
Yo the heads I hang with ain't tryin to just get
What they can get, sit quickly backstabbin the click

Thumpin, between the crew we always got sump'un
But if we had nuttin no frontin whatever
We'd still be crew you and me, me for you together

You caught up in they bodies and don't know they minds
So I'm, here to bring the truth in the place
Like don't think Common won't punch you in your face~!
And don't think Talib won't hold the heat
To stop the violence you gotta know your street
You gotta know who Tanga Reed is
Fat Joe's a leader, Busta Rhymes a preacher

You grab the microphone and talk a good ramble

One day you gamble up snake eyes
Talkin all that junk about you don't take dives, you take lives

One of your mindless and stupid friends?
Why can't you simply tell me the truth?
So I can hold you, or cut you loose?

I'm not the type to listen to what everybody will say
But more and more it's seemin' that I can't trust you anyway
You make me think that I must sleep with somethin' over my head
For fear I wake up in a pool of blood and probably dead

Why do I call myself God when I'm speakin?
People always ask me this question when I'm teachin
What you gotta understand is that Kris don't exist
The only existence is God consciousness
And God consciousness is what exists as Kris
Your ego tells you that you're doin all this
You amidst a mister professional lyricist
I get rid of this forever, it only gets better
Kris from the universe you could never sever
Cause there is no Kris, only the universe, remember
Goin a little deeper you can check me
My whole campaign is about livin life correctly
But don't respect me, respect the universe

If you really want to be rich you gotta act like you're rich
You can't act like a bitch if you want to be a lady
You can't get the gravy if you're sittin around lazy
You can't be in the hustle if you ain't lookin for trouble
You can't be single if you know you're really double

You can do it (yeah) we can do it (yes)

But Kris won't let it

But hip-hop, yes, you must respect it
We must direct it

Yo, let me set it

And athletic

The balancing of the mind is what's authentic
The total body is ultra magnetic

We did it like that

And we did it like that

And we did it like that

[Verse 2:]
People always say when they see us, teach us
so we move by the inch, teachin only some of it, believe us
Hustlas and players and hos will never leave us
They been around since Mary Magdalene and Jesus
Run wit it, pimps and players run the government
We been raised on a tonne of it that's why we're lovin it
Bein a player is cool when you a kid
until you get sent up for a eight year bid
Now you use and abuse and serve like hell
til one day you are found face down upon the ground
two shots to the dome, we need to switch quick
Dyin over what you players, I think, call a bitch
I'm not a player hater 'cause I hate no one
but when you start destroyin hip-hop, you gots ta go, son
Government attack one who's brainwashed
Government attack two who is, yes, brain rinsed
Government attack three is for you and me
to constantly dream about the Lex with bulletproof tints
It's pointless to think I'm knockin ya
If you a pimp, be a pimp, I'll be a philosopher
So the....

[Verse 3:]
why-yes are the intelligent, we descend on every establishment
In the East or West, microphone grabbin it
Chess-to-chess, lyrical confrontation is dope
for the hip-hop nation, yet our hope, your scope
is broader than who can kill who and who got the biggest crew?
That's why black people cannot seem to break through
It's like crabs in a pot when one crab reaches the top
other crabs wish to pull down and blood (BLOODS)
I'm not understandin what's all the fuss
Hip-hop belongs to all of us
The East created it, the West decorated it
Learn the lesson, the unified picture is black expression
When black expression heights itself
it becomes black digression leadin to depression in health
Now question these ideas today
If hip-hop was destroyed could we blame the CIA
or the FBI, you'd be a motherfuckin lie-
-er, li-are, pants on fire-er
Conspiracy theories are contrise or we keep them on the shelf
We got no one to blame but ourselves

Nothin but the truth, taste is the proof 
These niggaz want the Juice, and in the crossfire 
Be the youth, who didn't learn to duck when they shoot 

What kind of party is this, it's that political kind 
Where America's best, most hypocritical minds 
Try they hands at keepin y'all deaf dumb and blind 
And for the right dollar sign, do white collar crime 
Behind suits, and clean shaves 
I confuse em and use em as tools and slaves 
Because my schools is graves and jobs is plantations 
I robs the damn nation 
So I can live in luxury, you fucks with me 
You marryin' the dirt and I'ma throw in the tux for free 
I tell the people what they want to hear 
I make em laugh and cheer, and then they re-elect me every year 
So when the coast is clear, I stop duckin' 
And start back doin' dope, cussin and fuckin' 
I kiss the babies, shake hands, wave and smile for flicks 
That's my style, my pol-I-tricks 
Triple-Six convicts, lyin is automatic 
In the government, Republican or Democratic 
Fuck Freedom, Justice and Equality

You better ask yourself
What do you want, what do you need, what will you find
Don't be afraid, don't fall asleep, open your mind
I hope this rhyme gets you in time and space, come to a different place
Where you hear spiritual lyrical knowledge and you're face to face
Like welfare, and these rappers lyrics they need help there
Does KRS represent heaven? Hell yea
Let me take you elsewhere, where you stand, there's a curse there
For sure, unless you're mature, grow up
If you're immature, then you're livin' sinister
You reject the words of the minister
You better get witcha Qu'Ran or bible, you won't be livin' long

Forever like a juvenile, to stay alive
Survivin' in the freestyle, yo hold it down
Walkin' on the wild side, to live or die
Damn another slow song
Yo Money put the record back the FUCK on
No respect for the Usual Suspects, mad teens
Pourin' fire on the gasoline, defeat fiends
Feelin' like fever, I'm gettin' warm
Chalk marks in the rainstorm, children of the gone
Lost and forgotten, minds rotten
The arcade shot em, Channel Zero on the TV got em
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
If you don't know yourself, then you nobody
Do your thing, no bang, in the same damn gang
I never sang, I'm back, but I transmit slang
Silence in the face of violent crews

Tight an good, come is it tight an good
Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, old king go blast dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ascap lyrics for hand clap

Mc's more worried about their financial backin'
Steady packin' a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin' they cousin, they buggin'
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin', even though some people front
It's the god of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin' airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, mc's are just hopeless

D-Nice and McBoo, they're down with us
Ms. Melodie, she's down with us

Castle-D boy, he's down with us
D.J. Red Alert, he's down with us
Robocop boy, he's down with us
Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one.

People still takin' rappin' for a joke
A passing hope or a phase with a rope
Sometimes I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million MCs
I try to tell them, ""We're all in this together!""
My album was raw because no-one would ever
Think like I think and do what I do
I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue

What do you think makes up a KRS?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking?
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but a raid of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original teacher of this type of style
Rockin' off-beat with a smile
Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to
BDP Posse so I love to
Step in the jam and slam
I'm not Superman, because anybody can
Or should be able to rock off turntables
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the Old School
'cause Rap is still a brand-new tool
I say no-one's from the Old School 'cause Rap on a whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
'cause we'll be the Old School artists
And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun
'cause even then, I'm still number one.

[Verse 2]
Blastmaster KRS-One of course
Comes to express with style the lost
Ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present
Knock, knock, who is it?
A brand-new style, hup, time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
Now tomorrow you can say you saw
KRS-One stompin' once more
I play by ear, I love to steer
The Alfa Romeo from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
'cause I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin' because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old School artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper who's had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots posing as kings
What are we here to rule?
I thought we were supposed to sing
And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak
KRS-One is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'
Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
By bringin' out the truth in a song
So BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions
Made a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin'
People have the nerve to take me for a gangster
An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster
Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary
But in a scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple: BDP will teach reality
No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, 'cause I'm still number one.

Me and Goldie sssh, you know how we do
Only the true hip-hop-heads know what time it is with this
Now, if you're with me.

Ill lead through and dominate this microphone I speak through
I'm writing for the people, bite it if you need to
I can see through and see that, you saw an MC and tried to be that
That MC you saw was me can you believe that? And obey that?

Simultaneously you will be forgotten
While in the year 2000 Criminal Minded will still be rocking
You waste your time battling me I got mine happening, see?

You should have thought G, a little bit sooner
Instead of battling me you need your plan your long heavity
Before you die broke like Sammy Davis junior
The solar, followed by the looter, followed by the solar

Followed by McDonalds and Coca-Cola
The point is whatever the outcome of the battle

Saul the road to Damascus, come follow me
The serpent swallow the moon, but it won't, swallow me
(Yeah, speak the word!)
Intellect is like a major city
Laden with concrete, metal
Advanced modes of transportation
Shining buildings, and fenced in parks
Spirit is the mountain's forest wilderness
And vast countryside that surrounds it
Too many people live in the city
Struggling day to day for mere existence
Most have forgotten how to live off the land
They only experience nature on class trips
And short-term vacations
For those that live in the country
Cities are like amusement parks with high prices
And temporal satisfaction
At the end of the day, they are tired
And ready to go home, and relieve their ringing ears

[Chorus: x2]

[KRS-One]
Uh-huh, speak the word
Hyper-accelerated meditations talk
The reversal of this word dispersal is thought
There is no difference between thought and talk
Like the blackboard chalk and homicide chalk
They both give outlines
One is designed to outline the mind
The other outlines the body after a crime
Could it be that these two chalks are connected;
Meaning the body gets outlined when the mind is neglected,
Or poorly directed
Like the teacher with the chalk
Or is the teacher the beginning of the homicide we talk?
Be selective in your speech
Cause the chalk of the two technical teaching has taught each
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
Nearly every daughter, nearly every son
Ignorance reigns supreme for some
They chase the sum, inviting the I-are-S to come
Make the connection, choose your direction
Use your protection when sexing and hexing
Things come back cause they really never left
If the secret to meditation is found in the breath
Then speech is another form of meditativeness

I'm not the run of mill, cause for the mill I don't run

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, krs-one, rock on!
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, krs-one, rock on!

Everybody on the mic in the party sound alike
Until I recite, in black and white what's right
Let me take flight, my style is tight an good
Tight an good, come is it tight an good
Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, old king go blast dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ascap lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin', youth trackin', talent lackin'
Mc's more worried about their financial backin'
Steady packin' a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin' they cousin, they buggin'
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin', even though some people front
It's the god of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin' airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, mc's are just hopeless
Thinkin' record sales make them the dopest

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, krs-one, rock on!

The smile you're really glad to see, when it comes round

Now the cheek, give a hug, snug 

No grudge, til you turn your back and learn the facts 

It's called learn the truth 

The tree is only known by it's fruits 

These smiling faces, in many places, sometimes they racist 

Sometimes they sexist, sometimes they want your Lexus 

Sometimes they be your family members remember, 

""Oh no not my lady, oh no not my fellow"" 

with them you thought you'd never ever sever 

But they was two-faced and headless

If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go ""Illlll!""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, that's to leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or natty dread
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer
 
This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it
    
Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
'Cause they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine?
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tangle with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like artefacts
On the wrong side of the tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism

Which city shall we destroy today?

Take a look a look around, we last forever
We carry books around, manuals are bound in leather
We rock the center, the only point that's in the circle
We free MC's, what we decree will not desert you
We know what we doin, we wise and we chillin
We calculate against the continued cries of our children
They may be cryin now but they won't be cryin later
We love hip-hop, because WE are it's creators
So we, build the Temple, write the books, teach the classes
Create instrumentals, write hooks and rock masses
NONE passes, without studyin this flow
It's all good as long as you know Kris know!

While I deal with I, Jah talk to I
When I dem go alike, only de one comply
Whatchu see with de I, look twice toward de I
If you don't unify your children them a gon' cry

I stand with the rejected, the unsuspected, the unconnected
The neglected the one you, never suspected
It seems you forget hip-hop plays the back
Sayin that's my sound, and that's my sound
And that's my track, and that's my rap
And that's some chorus they did way back, look honey bringin it back
I'm actually, I'm everywhere at every time
Animating every rhyme and every dare in every mind
KRS is my representative on Earth
Challenge him not, he's been hip-hop since birth
His main objective, is to put hip-hop in perspective
Show pity, and DESTROY these wack cities

While I deal with I, Jah talk to I
When I dem go alike, only de one comply
Whatchu see with de I, look twice toward de I
If you don't unify your children them a gon' cry

Dey worship slackness and to be under sky
We lead dem to de water but we cyan't make dem drink
Pussy to take a sip, cause it gon' make you t'ink
We don't usually ? shit ?, yo alla dem a sing
Wisdom wort more den any diamond and gold
People use it and find it like de Dead Sea Scrolls

Take dem Lion, take 'em, take it over!

'Cause of dem outer, dem outer, dem outer inter outer inter
Outer inter outer inter out of control
Dey neva find wisdom til dem dead ohhh
Mad Lion make de ? roll
KRS make up a sea and bulge ya
Of the story of never been told-a
Cause we outer, outer, inter outer outer ese
Out of control, out of control
I'm so serious ay (what?)
We don have no time fi play, ay (tell 'em again)
Some people diss dem ? hell's in this world
But dey'll come around one day

Yo, yo, only Beezlebub think my voice is aggravatin
Children of light hear my voice and start congregatin
The mind's debatin, is he a prophet or is he Satan?
But the tree is only known by it's fruit, what am I creating?
What am I stating? Have I stood the test of time?
Or am I fading, or has God blessed my rhyme?

Head back to Brooklyn in the Expo

Back on the block, I see the cops everybody clockin'
Buckshot, when you see the rocks, me I got you shocked
Why not? You see the recipe
Buckshot, I represent Brooklyn and my {nigga} Biggie

I'm from see-I, L-I, F-L-why
Where the {niggaz} and the {bitches} stay paid fly and high
Where a slut will get mad if you call her a {bitch}
And a rat will get mad if you call her a snitch

Where the rich emerge, with the {niggaz} from the ditch
And it's a myth, they get {niggaz} from the suburbs, that's herbs
Yo this is for my {niggaz} on the block all day

Put your money on it, yo we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best {niggaz} that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
{Niggas} comin through will not stand a chance

From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Comin' deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin'
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island

We destroy {niggaz}, need advice, cause I heard em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Makin about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type, you need a dyke, babygirl I see the light
But sometime why'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny
So guard your girl, Harlem World, cock the gun, pop it son
Fila fam, illa players, Killa Cam is still the man

Uptown massive, Uptown the borough
Uptown let the ? kali, no sorrow
Uptown trestle, Uptown of course
I grab you ? they got me turn up to North

And if dem turn up North ? hurt no tell de boss
And if dem tell me off dey are a bunch of ghosts
And if dem gal are up, well den dem know da gal are boss
De rap dancehall try on de Mossinos

And if dem tie me off, dem can call me Cedro
I put a rap to singalong in all de ? crew
And if da gal a bitch ? ? the rainbow

Yo, hit you with the force of an iron horse
Tear your face off the planet, leavin' one-third damaged
With you back cracked the earth canvas, leavin' mountains slanted
Rock the earth of the axle, crabs who

Polar bears beneath the sea gravel
Thoughts be runnin' wild like the Lil' Rascals
Puttin' dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws
Chasin' {motherfuckers} through malls, and clash in halls

Beatin' {motherfuckers} through walls, stompin' through floors
And jumpin' down elevator shafts
Searchin' for they {ass}, stayin' low in the grass
Wearin' a gas mask, wrappin' their hands up in plastic bags

On stage like a savage goin' mad
What? Yeah yeah, so!

Yeah, by all means you know you gotta put Queens on it
Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slam dance with you hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us

Then sent her {ass} back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms
And we never use those, til the man act

Other than he's 'sposed to, {nigga} what I'm 'sposed to do?
Shots whistle, damn near missed dat
Shoes get pissed at

From the, tip of my Timbs, to my eyebrows
The hostile, english, Olde E widemouth
Get PCP fiends, jumpin off cliffs
And if you had the balls, you'd be walkin off stiff

My paragraph alone is worth five mics (uh-huh)
A twelve song LP, that's thirty-six mics (uh-huh)
And while you win Un Hype (uh-huh) I spit on your snipe
And tell you {fuck you} and that {bitch} on your bike
Brick City!!

Ah-yo.. now bust it
Never try me crimey I'm grimy so don't deny me
I be Little like your Rascals and stymie to fly that hiney
Buy me keys, to my Benz and my Coupe

Like Jay and Run and D.M.C.'s, that's the name of my group
(now speed it up)
Beat to the rhythm of the rhyme
I'm givin' up a dime, there go another line you figured

Never drivin' by nine, never givin' up a dime if you was
Never been that (nigga)
If you really want to test me, brother don't stress me
Or you just be bowlin'

It's Reverand like a Jesse, brother that's just me
And that's just my colon

The five boroughs of death, we rep to death

Brought to you by the WOOOORRRLLLD FAMOUS Wake-Up Show!

[RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!

[Tech N9NE]
When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9NE's filled""

[Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit Withe-out
'cause why'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house, 
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys 
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

[Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
'cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, see now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Kool G Rap]
I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play

Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk

The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg

Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech

KRS-One,"Am I supposed to stand here?
These bright lights, I'll probably get a tan here
Scott, turn up the master
So I can hear, and talk faster
I'm the Blastmaster, 'cause I'm blasted
I know a lot of why'all are shocked that I've lasted
But Blastmaster is a subtitle
KRS ONE is more vital
And more lethal and more vicious
As the suckers always say, ""He just dissed us!
He got a problem, yo, he's conceited""
I'm not conceited, they just couldn't beat it
'cause when I'm in a club I like to mingle
Seconds later they're playin' that single
Loud as a collision and pumped up dramatically
So the people in the place will automatically
Time it, and dance right behind it
Those that have it on tape will rewind it
It's not surprising, we rock parties
Anywhere, anyone, anybody

I like eatin' wheat bread with honey",Essays on BDP-Ism,2000
KRS-One,"(One, two, three)
Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

Again we start, let me say my part
About the only guy who has some heart
It took some time for the heart to come
But it's here, and everybody's in fear

Crashing through the door of that whore
Bringin’ a end to this gold chain war
What you saw, KRS-One is now seeing
Another fly human being

Making no excuses for the losers
Chain snatchers, pimps, drug abusers
You don't like it but you gotta keep pushing
Until somebody starts mushin'

All these suckers, claimin' to rule the environment
(Nah man, I ain't buyin' it)
You seem to think that everybody can be taught
That everyone else can be bought

But you took a short, 'cause one guy hasn't been paid
He is the Jack of Spades

Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

He's a calm kind of guy, courageous and loyal
But don't let the temper boil
Cause just like a pot when the whistle blows
(That's right boy, anything goes)

The crime is committed and he's right on your tail
There's no bail, not thinkin’ 'bout jail
All the ends are justified by the means
When Jack's on the scene

Track the movement, don't lose it
Cause if he come through the back, he attacks
Crack, cocaine, cops, and more fiends
Who all get the same in the heat of this gold chain game

Here is the aim
Destroy all the stereotypes, hypes, and crack pipes
We don't like, criminals, and crime
But we don't pay it any mind

So here comes Kung Fu Joe, and Fly Guy
Slade, Hammer, and Slammer
I am a renegade teacher and scholar
If you ain't up on it you gotta

Fall to the back of the line
Hear this rhyme, cause I'ma say it one more time
It's Jack's theme song that KRS made
It's called the Jack of Spades

Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

You know, the Jack of Spades is now down with the BDP posse
If you wanna see more, just watch me man
Do what I do, throw your hands in the air
And scream it out, oh yeah

(Oh yeah)
One more time
(Oh yeah)
(Flash the rhyme)

Cool, guy, loud and quiet
If your head's in the way, he'll fly it
Don't try it, cause Jack of Spades doesn't buy it
He's a one man riot

Cleanin' the community, of all its debris, the C-R-I-M-E
The road was long and scary and some didn't make it
The average guy couldn't take it

But Jack is not the average guy
He took a piece of the pie and bit it
Got with it, for his brother he did it
So you gotta admit it

This is a martyr, a soldier, a hero
Why? Because he started from zero
In this battle he clearly understands their power
They're payin' people by the hour

To sell, to lie, to try, to stand up and deny
They are gettin' everybody high
High on a cable, cash under the table
Currency is how they're able

To buy the cops and props and keep the law paid
But here comes the Jack of Spades

Jack, Jack, Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

Break it down

Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)
Jack, Jack, Jack
(One, two, three)

Fresh, for Jack of Spades, you suckers

KRS-One,"What was it like to see
The face of your own stability
Suddenly look away
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?
Eleven and she was gone.
Eleven is when we waved good-bye.
Eleven is standing still,
Waiting for me to free him
By coming home.
Moving me with a sound.
Opening me within a gesture.
Drawing me down and in,
Showing me where it all began,
Eleven.
It took so long to realize that
You hold the light that's been leading me back home.
Under a dead Ohio sky,
Eleven has been and will be waiting,
Defending his light,
And wondering
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping, lost, and numb.
So glad that I have found you.
I am wide awake and heading home.
Hold your light,
Eleven.
Lead me through each gentle step by step
By inch by loaded memory.
I'll move to heal
As soon as pain allows so we can
Reunite and both move on together.
Hold your light,
Eleven. Lead me through each gentle step by step
By inch by loaded memory
'Til one and one are one, eleven,
So glow, child, glow.
I'm heading back home.",Jimmy,2000
KRS-One,"Ya know that's why man I be telling you all the time man  you know 
LOVE  
That word love is a very serious thing  and if you don't watch out I 
Tell ya 
That (Love's gonna get you) because a lot of people out here say ""I 
Love my 
Car"" or ""I love my chain"" or or ""I'm I'm just in love with that girl 
Over 
There"" so far all the people out there that fall in love with material 
Items 
We gonna bump the beat a lil' something like this 
I'm in junior high with a be	 plus grade, 
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade, 
I walk from school to my moms apartment, 
I got to tell the sucaks everyday ""don't start it"", 
Cause where I'm at if your soft your lost, 
To say on course means to roll with force, 
A boy named Rob is chillin in a Benz, 
In front of my building with the rest of his friends, 
I give him a pound, oh I mean I shake his hand, 
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man, 
I go upstairs and hug my mother, 
Kiss my sister, and punch my brother, 
I sit down on my bed to watch some tv, 
(machine gun fire) do my ears deceive me, 
Nope, that's the fourth time this week, 
Another fast brother shot dead in the street, 
The very next day while I'm off to class, 
My moms goes to work cold busting her ass, 
My sisters cute but she got no gear, 
I got three pairs of pants and with my brother I share, 
See there in school see I'm made a fool, 
With one and a half pair of pant you ain't cool, 
But there's no dollars for nothing else, 
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf, 
Every day I see my mother struggling, 
Now its time I've got to do something, 
I look for work I get dissed like a jerk, 
I do odd jobs and come home like a slob, 
So here comes Rob he's cold and shivery, 
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery, 
I do it once, I do it twice, 
Now there's steak with the beans and rice, 
My mother's nervous but she knows the deal, 
My sister's gear now has sex appeal, 
My brothers my partner and we're getting paper, 
Three months later we run our own caper, 
My family's happy everything is new, 
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do, 

[Chorus] 
That's why, (loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
You fall in love with your chain, 
You fall in love with your car, 
Loves gonna sneak right up and snuff you from behind, 
So I want you to check the story out as we go down the line, 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 

Money's flowing, everything is fine, 
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine, 
Business is boomin' everything is cool, 
I pull about a g a week fuck school, 
A year goes by and I begin to grow, 
Not in height but juice and cash flow, 
I pick up my feet and begin to watch tv, 
Cause now I got other people working for me, 
I got a fifty five inch television you know, 
And every once in awhile I hear just say no, 
Or the other commercial I love, 
Is when they say, this is your brain on drugs, 
I pick up my remote control and just turn, 
Cause with that bullshit I'm not concerned, 
See me and my brother jump in the BM, 
Driving around our territory again, 
I stop at the light like a superstar, 
And automatic weapons cold sprayed my car, 
I hit the accelerator scared as fuck, 
And drove one block to find my brother was hit, 
He wasn't dead but the blood was pouring, 
And all I could think about was war and, 
Later I found that it was Rob and his crew, 
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do, 
Ya know that's why, (loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(love loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
(love loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
That word love is very very serious(loves gonna get you) 
Very addictive 
My brothers out of it, but I'm still in it, 
On top of that I'm in it to win it, 
I can't believe that Rob would diss me, 
That faggot, that punk, he's soft a sissy, 
I'm driving around now with three of my guys, 
The war is on and I'm on the rise, 
We rolled right up to his favorite hang out, 
Said hello and then the bullets rang out, 
Some fired back so we took cover, 
And all I could think about was my brother, 
Rob jumped up and began to run, 
Busting shots hoping to hit someone, 
So I just stopped, and let off three shots, 
Two hit him and one hit a cop, 
I threw the gun down and began to shout, 
Come on I got him it's time to break out, 
But as we ran there were the boys in blue, 
Pointing their guns at my four man crew, 
They shot down one, they shot down two, 
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do, 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
(love loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
(love loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you), 
(loves gonna get you) 
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) 
(love loves gonna get you) 
Ya know a lot of people believe that that word 
Love is real soft, but when 
You use it in your vocabulary like your addicted to it it sneaks right up 
And takes you right out. out. Out. Out. Out. 
So, for future reference remember it's alright to like or want a material 
Item, but when you fall in love with it and you start scheming and carrying 
On for it, just remember, it's gonna get'cha",Love's Gonna Get'cha (Material Love),2000
KRS-One,"Let's begin 
What  where  why  or when 
Will all be explained 
Why destruction is a game 
See I'm not insane 
In fact  I'm kind of rational 
When I be asking 
Yo  who is more dramatical 
This one  that one 
The white one or the black one 
Pick the punk 
And I'll jump up to attack one 
KRS One is just the guy to lead a crew 
Right up to your face and dis you 
Everyone saw me on the last album cover 
Holding a pistol 
Something far from a lover 
Beside my brother 
S-see-O-T 
I just laughed 
'Cause no one can defeat me 
This selection number two 
Is ""My Philosophy"" 
Number one 
Was ""Poetry"" 
You know it's me 
It's my philosophy 
Many artists got to learn 
I'm not flammable 
I don't burn 
So please stop burnin' 
And learn to earn respect 
'Cause that's just what 
KR collects 
See, what do you expect 
When you rhyme like a soft punk 
You walk down the street and get jumped 
You got to have style 
And learn to be original 
And everybody's gonna want to dis you 
Like me 
We stood up for the South Bronx 
And every sucka MC 
Had a response 
You think we care? 
I know that they are on the tip 
My posse from the Bronx is thick 
And we're real live 
We walk correctly 
A lot of suckas would like to forget me 
But they can't 
'Cause like a champ 
I have got a record 
Of knocking out the frauds in a second 
On the mic 
I believe that you should get loose 
I haven't come to tell you I have juice 
I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level 
I'll be back 
But for now just seckle 

I'll play the nine 
And you play the target 
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start it 
Or should I say, ""Start this"" 
I am an artist 
Of new concepts at their hardest 
Yo, cause I'm a teacher 
And Scot is a scholar 
It ain't about money 
Cause we all make dollars 
That's why 
I walk with my head up 
When I hear wack rhymes 
I get fed up 
Rap is like a set-up 
A lot of games 
A lot of suckas with colorful names 
I'm so-and-so 
I'm this 
I'm that 
Huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack 
I'm not white or red or black 
I'm brown 
From the Boogie Down 
Productions 
Of course 
Our music be thumpin' 
Others say their bad 
But they're buggin 
Let me tell you somethin' now 
About hip hop 
About D-Nice, Melodie, 
And Scot La Rock 
I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker 
Mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker 
Some mc's be talkin' and talkin' 
Tryin' to show how black people are walkin 
But I don't walk this way to portray 
Or reinforce 
Stereotypes of today 
Like all my brothas 
Eatin' chicken and watermelon 
Talk broken english and drug sellin' 
See I'm tellin' 
And teaching real facts 
Now when some act in rap 
Is kind of wack 
And it lacks 
Creativity and intelligence 
But they don't care 
'Cause the company is sellin' it 
It's my philosophy 
On the industry 
Don't bother dissin' me 
Or even wish that we'd 
Soften, dilute, 
Or commercialize all our lyrics 
'Cause it's about time 
One of y'all hear it 
First-hand 
From the intelligent 
Brown man 
A vegetarian 
No goat or ham 
Or chicken or turkey or hamburger 
'Cause to me that's suicide 
Self-murder 
Let us get back to what we call hip hop 
And what it meant to DJ Scot La Rock

How many Mc's must get dissed 
Before somebody says, ""Don't fuck with Kris!"" 
This is just one style 
Out of many 
Like a piggy bank 
This is one penny 
My brother's name is Kenny 
Kenny Parker 
My other brother I.C.U. 
Is much darker 
Boogie Down Productions 
Is made up of teachers 
The lecture is conducted 
From the mic into the speaker 
Who gets weaker? 
The king or the teacher 
It's not about a salary 
It's all about reality 
Teachers teach and do the world good 
Kings just rule 
And most are never understood 
If you were to rule 
Over a certain industry 
Fuck right now 
Would be in misery 
No one would get along 
Nor sing a song 
'Cause everyone'd be singing for the king 
Am I wrong?! 
So yo, what's up 
It's me again 
Scot La Rock, 
KRS, BDP again 
Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend 
We're criminal minded 
And only tend 
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records 
No more than four minutes 
And some seconds 
The competition checks and checks 
And keeps checkin' 
They get the album 
Take it home 
And start sweatin' 
Why? well it's simple 
To them it's kind of vital 
To take KRS-One's title 
To them I'm like an idol 
Some type of entity 
In everybody's rhyme 
They want to mention me? 
Or rather mention us 
Me or Scot La Rock 
But they can get bust 
Get robbed, get dropped 
I don't play around 
Nor do I fuck around 
And you can tell by the bodies that are left around 
When some clown jumps up to get beat down 
Broken down to his very last compound 
See how it sound? 
A little unrational 
A lot of MC's like to use the word 
Dramatical! 
Fresh for '88 
You suckas",My Philosophy,2000
KRS-One,"The day begins with a grin
And a prayer to excuse my sins
I can walk anywhere I choose
'Cause everybody listens to the B.D.P. crew

We're not here for glamor or fashion
But here's the question I'm askin'
Why is it young black kids taught black?
They're only taught how to read, write and act

It's like teachin' a dog to be a cat
You don't teach white kids to be black
Why is that? Is it because we're the minority?
Well, black kids follow me

Genesis chapter eleven verse ten
Explains the genealogy of Shem
Chem was a black man in Africa
If you repeat this fact they can't laugh at ya

Genesis fourteen verse thirteen
Abraham steps on the scene
Being a descendant of Shem which is a fact
Means, Abraham too was black

Abraham born in the city of a black man
Called Nimrod, grandson of Kam
Kam had four sons, one was named Canaan
Here, let me do some explaining

Abraham was the father of Isaac
Isaac was the father of Jacob
Jacob had twelve sons for real
And these were the children of Israel

According to Genesis chapter ten
Egyptians descended from Ham
Six hundred years later my brother read up
Moses was born in Egypt

In this era black Egyptians weren't right
They enslaved black Israelites
Moses had to be of the black race
Because he spent forty years in Pharaoh's place

He passed as the Pharaoh's grandson
So he had to look just like him
Yes, my brothers and sisters take this here song
Yo, correct the wrong

The information we get today is just wack
But ask yourself, why is that?

The age of the ignorant rapper is done
Knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everyone
The stereotype must be lost
That love and peace and knowledge is soft

Do away with that and understand one fact
For love, peace must attack
And attack real strong, stronger than war
To conquer it and its law

Mental pictures, stereotypes and fake history
Reinforces mystery
And when mystery is reinforced
That only means that knowledge has been lost

When you know who you really are
Peace and knowledge shines like a star
I've only shown you a simple fact
It takes a nation of millions to hold us people back

Which is wack but we can correct that
Teach and learn what it is to be black
'Cause they're teachin' birds to be a cat
But ask yourself homeboy, why is that?

Okay now, listen to this..
[Seagull sounds]
A mystical teacher sat by the seaside
It was about five o'clock cause we heard the free ride
Anyway; the teacher was talking in stride
Sitting upon a rock that was wide
And warning against false pride
""Come to where I reside!"" a woman cried
And the teacher replied, ""Do you serve your fish fried?""
""Yes,"" she replied, ""with potato salad on the side.""
And the teacher replied, ""Well where do you reside?""
She said, ""Up on the hillside, it's not a far ride.
If you came to have dinner, I would be so gratified.""
The teacher replied, ""It's six o'clock, seven o'clock, you decide.""
She replied, ""Seven o'clock, do you like stir-fried?""
She was mystified and felt so dignified
The teacher was coming to the house where she resides
So she purified with pesticides
[Chemicals sprayed; noise]
Called her friends up nationwide
[Phone being dialed]
Some of her friends were tongue-tied they felt so glorified
She made steamed fish, baked fish, fish that was fried
Soup, steamed vegetables, potato salad on the side
[Cooking food]
You could smell the bread in the oven far and wide
Natural juices and water purified
Organic fruits brought from the countryside
With silver forks and knives placed side by side
[Silverware clinks; noise]
You could not be dissatisfied;
Looking out the window staring at the mountainside,
You would have died
6:59 she's swollen with pride
As the moment intensified, there's a knock from outside
[Knocking at door]
She opens the door, for the teacher has arrived
[Door opening]
But to her surprise, it was a bum who cried
""Please, I smelt the bread from outside!
One piece,"" and then she replied
""The teacher is coming, he's soon to have arrived.
You're making me look bad, come on now, step aside!""
The bum then replied,
""When I say I'm hungry I haven't lied.
Give me some of that chicken that you just fried.""
[Food cooking]
She replied, ""Chicken - fried?
No that's for the teacher, you're not purified""
Then she slammed the door and went back inside
[Door closing]
Sat on the couch with the TV Guide
She looked at the clock, it was 7:09, then 7:30;
He still hasn't arrived
Eight o'clock, she's on the downside
Nine o'clock, by now she's teary-eyed
She's pissed off and her anger multiplied
She cried, then fell asleep dissatisfied
Next day she woke up, and was preoccupied
With meeting the mystical teacher who lied
Where could he hide?
She ran down by the seaside
[Seagull sounds]
He was there teaching about - false pride
""You lied!"" she replied, ""You lied!
You said you'd be there at seven o'clock, you lied!""
He replied, ""No I have not lied.
I came at 6:59, and you told me to move aside.
I asked for bread and the chicken that was fried.
[Food Cooking]
And you said, that I wasn't purified.""
She replied, ""I wasn't notified!
I had no idea that you was the bum that cried!""
And the teacher sighed, then replied, 
""This concludes our lesson on false pride.""",False Pride,2001

What is a real hip-hop MC?
Is it MTV, is it BET?
Is it five m-i-see's 
So the people can see
I mean, how you think you're free 
When you act like property?
Tell me, how do you judge an MC when he's rockin
I mean rockin it live, not pickin his cotton
I mean adjustin his clothes, I mean how do you know
Before you come to the show that you're not gettin heated
That you're not gettin cheated
That you ain't come to the club thinkin 'I must've been weeded!'
(Word)
You got to be a educated consumer
Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya
Ass they want is your cash, ass, grass, gas in a flick
When you ask for that autograph they ass-dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we bust off the gatler

[Chorus]

This is the ""Sneak Attack""
The ""Edutainment"" style returns like that
Take it off your shelf
Cause all we deal with is knowledge of self, health and wealth
Not Stealth bombers, leather goose bombers

You got to get with a
21st century philosopher
Representin the religion of hip-hop, sir
Those that oppose are foes and will get rocked - eh
Stopped, eh, I rise like a helicopter
Like Zulu I'll Shaka, crowd
With a beat that's loud
Huh, I'm black and I'm proud - irrelevant
I'm black and intelligent
I teach my kids to watch the education they give em
Cause it's really all about street wisdom

[Chorus]

True hip-hoppers don't bleed
True hip-hoppers don't need
True hip-hoppers don't speed
No time for greed
True hip-hoppers do read
And will lead, not plead
Will sow seeds that breed
Ah-ha that's safer than weed, indeed
True hip-hoppers don't slave
True hip-hoppers don't crave
Silver and gold, we're not amazed
We live f-are-e-e
If you not into lyrics you can't really hear it nor see me
My philosophy keeps it plain and simple
Here it is: the kingdom of hip-hop is within you
Or is it the kingdom of hell that sends you?
I'm ringin a bell within you
You only seek in a cell, that's what sin do
It tells you to put your craft on a menu, a chart
So they can sell you and your art

1987 I was at the Latin Quarters
Listenin to Afrika Bambaata give the order
The call of the order was to avoid the slaughter
He said, ""Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya!""
Without a lawyer, he taught The Infinity Lessons
In how hip-hop could be a, many a blessing
And that was great, so in 1988
There was no debate, we had to end the hate
The name of the game was ""Stop the Violence""
And unity, knowledge, and self-reliance
We - started talkin bout Martin and Malcolm
Had these ghetto kids goin, ""Huh, what about him?""
1989, Professor Griff speaks his mind
But his freedom of speech is declined
1990 came with the West coast
East coast, West coast, who is the best coast?
Lookin back now, of COURSE it was bogus
The whole argument was where we lost focus
We got hopeless; not with the lyrics and music
But with hip-hop, and how we used it
Or abused it, you know how the crew get
""You like it cause you choose it""
1991, we opened our eyes
With Human Education Against Lies, we tried
To talk about the state of humanity
But all these others rappers got mad at me
They called me ""Captain Human"", another message was sent
""Self Destruction don't pay the {fuckin} rent""
Remember that? Nobody wanted conscious rap
It was like - where these ballers at?
Where can they call us at? All was wack
Hip-Hop culture was fallin flat and that was that
So in 1992, I found my crew
They said, ""Yo Kris, what you wanna do?""
I said, ""Damn - why they wanna get with me?
If I bust they {shit} I'm contradictory.
If I play the bitch role, they take my shoe.
Tell me what the {fuck} am I supposed to do?""
So I did it, don't stop get it get it get it
All of a sudden these critics they wanna spit it
""Kay Are Ess One is con-tra-dic-to-ry""
Just cause I wouldn't let these rappers get with me
{Fuck} that, {fuck} you and {fuck} your pen
If a rapper wanna diss, yo I'd do it again
But I'm makin these ends, and I got my friends
And I really don't wanna have to sit in the pen
So I go back to the philosopher
1993 hip-hop is uhh.. wack
Go back, check the facts
1994, ""Return of the Boom Bap""
It wasn't all about the loot
It was all about Harry Allen Rhythm Cultural Institute
Blowin up, 1995
Conscious rap is still alive
But nobody wanna play it, nobody wanna say it
Nobody okayed it, they'd all rather hate it
1996 it really don't stop
We put together somethin called the Temple of Hip-Hop
Not just DJin, breakin, graf and lyrics
But how hip-hop affects the spirit
""Step Into a World,"" that's what I did
1997 I was raisin my kid
Or kids, but I, had to go
Cause New York DJ's changed the flows
To clothes and hoes, but that wasn't me
I'll be damned if I dance for the MTV
So in 1998 I began to debate
Should I go now, or should I really wait?
'99, I moved to L.A. you see
And took a gig with the WB
Started studyin philosophy full-time
To have a full heart, full body, full mind
But you know what the problem is or was?
DJ's don't raise our kids, cuz
They so caught up in the cash and jewels
How they gonna really see a hip-hop school?
How they gonna really see a hip-hop temple?
They don't even wanna play my instrumentals, but
Big up Dr. Dre, Snoop, Xzibit
Especially Xzibit, he was there in a minute
Mic Conception, all of them, said
""Yo you need help? I should call them""
When I was in L.A., I held the crown
Bloods, Crips, they held me down
I could never forget Mad Lion, killer pride
With the gat in the lap in the low-ride
Oh I can't forget, Icy Ice, Lucky Lou
Julio G, that was the crew
Davey D, Ingrid, David Connor
The list goes on and on, let me tell ya
FredWreck, and my man Protest
Much respect, no less
To my spiritual and mental defenders
Big up to L.A., temple members
But in 2000, I seen how I wanted to live
I wasn't no executive
So I picked up the mic and I quit my job
Said to Simone I gotta get with God
She said, ""Don't worry bout these dollars and quarters.
Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya.""
Damn, she took me back to Bam!
Took me back to who I am!
Brought me back to the New York land!
Now I overstand!

Now KRS-One, now you've been quoted as saying that
Rap is something we do, hip-hop is something you live.
{KRS} Yes!
{interviewer}
Explain that to us please.
{KRS-One}
Well, well, today hip-hop, we are advocating that hip-hop is not,
Just a music, it is an attitude, it is an awareness, it is a way
To view the world. So rap music, is something we do, but HIP-HOP,
Is something we live. And we look at hip-hop, in it's 9 elements;
Which is breaking, emceeing, graffiti art, deejaying, beatboxing,
Street fashion, street language, street knowledge, and street
Entrepenurialism - trade and business. And uhh, that's where y'know
That's the hip-hop that that that we're about. We come from the uhh
The root of, of Kool DJ Herc, who originated hip-hop in the early 70's
And then Afrika Bambaata and Zulu Nation (mmhmm)
Who instigated something called The Infinity Lessons
And added conciousness to hip-hop, and then Grandmaster Flash
With the invention of the mixer, on to Run-D.M.C. and then myself.
And uhh, we created the ""Stop the Violence"" movement, you may recall
A song, ""Self Destruction"" and and and so on. All of this, goes to
Uhh uhh, the idea of LIVING this culture out and taking responsibility
For how it looks and and acts in society.",Hiphop Knowledge,2001

We CRUSH, THEM, and they crew
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to do
While they floss with the chi-ching and all the rings
You stay focused, keep doin your thing
You cannot get the diamond ring, if you can't really sing
Or if you haven't got a skill, that you ready to fling
What you bringin to the table if you not really able
Tryin to get to the top, like the Tower of Babel
Back in the days, remember all the old gold cables
Where they at now? Sold, when they dropped from the label
All the money they gave you made you very unstable
They really enslaved but you wasn't able with the coke in your nasal
to see, you up in the crib but they rockin your cradle
You a joke and you fatal, they made you an M.C.

Whether our children they gonna be winners or losers?
Don't you think it's time to advance the rhyme we spit?
Whether you know it or not, you deep in politics
All inside of it, in fact YOU the issue
Don't let this government diss you!

They really do not want you to hope
They really want you sniffin they coke
You look around yo we missin the boat
I coulda wrote about ANYTHING to get on, but this what I wrote
And what I'm writin, is guaranteed to enlighten

Rise up, and put aside childish things
This is the message we bring; listen

Last verse, KRS, blast first
Ignorance is bad, but temptation that's worse
They hide they purse, cause of the way we spit the verse
No one ever told 'em that the style's rehearsed
And even if they did, it wouldn't be new to they mind
Cause all day rappers confess to doin these crimes
So when the cops see you, they're not thinkin about me
They thinkin about takin you out of society
Keep it right, don't lie to me
You think it's too much preachin teachin?
Huh, well fine, we'll see
When you're locked up in J.D.C., or even prison
The truth shall set you free, just listen
You want health, and really that's about prevention
You want love, real love, and not depression
You want awareness, which come from discipline and will
You want wealth, which come from skills
When you really ready to talk, let's build
You ain't gotta be a scholar to know the next 4 years gonna be ill
I believe you already know the drill, don't lie
don't steal, seek peace and don't kill

At the Temple of Hip-Hop
WE TEACH MANY!

Look! To all my people hurtin, all my people searchin
What we know for sure, God is always workin
Workin while you flirtin, workin while you jerkin
Workin while the world is turnin and these cities burnin
God is always workin, workin while you learnin
Workin while you ignorant and when you're not concernin
Christ consciousness, get that, got that
Spit that, rock that, hip that, hop that
You sniff that? Stop that, I give back and got back
Greedy? I'm not that, you needy for that shock rap
Slangin on the block rap, duckin where the cops at
I don't know that, but Jesus done copped that
Not that man on the cross, it ain't like that
You must act like the son of God, that's where the lights at
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me

[Chorus]

One thing's for sure and believe it hurt
It's when the pastor ain't sure, and deceives the church
They don't know God's law, and can't see God at work
So when they see hip-hop, they push it to the back of the church
Like fig trees or figures they don't bear fruit
They gospel artists, still tryin to chase that loot
Hear the truth now, I come to enhance the light
They women of God, singin while they pants is tight?
They not hot! Really they, regular
They clothes they flows, all that, secular
What's the difference I could stay in the world and wild
if these church girls wear more makeup than Destiny's Child
Keep it real Christian, some of y'all liftin ain't likin
But this is the difference between a Christian and a Christ-ian
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
Listen, listen, listen

[Chorus]

Look! Spiritual minded, you must find it
Find your spirit and go deep inside it
This goes out to the Christ-ians listenin
This is the flow that, gospel's missin it's
urban inspirational rap
We got our own section in the record stores, in our own rack
We respect tradition, from the start
But we now know, the true word of God is written in our heart
We gotta say somethin to the streets kid!
All these churches surroundin the devil still ain't defeat it?
They the type to get down, I'm the type to get up
From ""Criminal"" to ""Spiritual Minded"", now raise your head up
Let me start, these rappers ain't got God in they heart
All they want is quick money, and a movie part
Let me begin - what, where, why or when
What's the use of double platinum if you're livin in sin
Hear the truth - how long you think you gonna last
Rockin the mic, without havin to go back to class?
Now you're forced, to listen to the teacher outrap them
Yes there's life after platinum",Ain't Ready,2002

You think you got what it takes? (Yeah that's easy!)
Huh, we gon' see.. we gon' see right now (Now what?)
Look

So you wanna be a conscious rapper
Can you handle the press and they negative chatter
Can you eat cold platters, and still spit data
Watchin others spit lies and they pockets get fatter
Can you climb up the ladder, and reach the top?
But it still doesn't matter, cause you ain't pop
Can you rock for the love of the art
Can you drop hit after hit after hit and still don't chart?
Can you REALLY stay loyal to God
when your life is full of strife, plus it always seems so hard
Can you handle the criticism
People holdin you up to higher standards, but they don't live 'em?
Can you hear these kiddy flows and laugh at it
But when you spit they callin you arrogant?
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', let's do it!

[Chorus]
Think you can do what I do
Think you can step in my shoes
You have no clue what I go through
You never felt my pain
When they attack my name
All because I have spoken the truth

To be a conscious rapper ain't a mystery
You gotta laugh when they call you contradictory
The whole industry, you gotta push and pull it
To really get with me, you gotta dodge they bullets
Blaow, blaow, blaow, every day and every way
You critics got somethin to say
At the same time, you gotta uphold Christ
Uphold life, while others flash cars and ice
It could break you down, take you down, make you frown
It could actually shake your ground
But if you love who you are, and believe in that
Best believe you will BE where the teacher's at
And where's that? In fact, in cold or heat
Yes, I declare victory over the streets
Overstand, over these beats, over the so-called elite
Over the strong, over the weak
I know how to speak, and most of all I know how to eat
I know I want humble and meek
So you better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', uhh

[Chorus]

Look!
So you thinkin about bein a concious MC
Well you gotta love God and you got to live free
You got to see the life that others can't see
You got to be the person that others can't be
You can't be a S-L-A, V-E
If you sayin to yourself, ""This may be me""
Then you know goin in that you work against sin
Your very skills will kill the demons within
So don't expect respect from slaves and hoes
Nor the slavemaster's video shows
Nor the rap mags, you know how it go
Especially black mags, you know they don't know
Just go to the crowd that you know will need you
Cause NOTHING compares to the respect of the people
That's what you look for, that's what you work with
Cause anything else, is truly worthless
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris'
You better think about that, 'fore you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris', uhh

Holy hip hop
You know the type, all in your city
Word up

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

Let's come together once and for all
Before our children cannot walk in the mall
Before we cannot talk or walk at all already aviation is stalled
Now everybody wants to drive, bringing our highways to a crawl

Just about three weeks on back
I was talking to a journalist about my album, the sneak attack
Now I know, why I felt that way
Why the cards God revealed to me was dealt that way

Be prepared for the unexpected, that was the theme
But if your booty's shaking, you can't know what that means
Look, we all, in the, same, game
It's that world bank game that got struck with two flame

But we, yes the people, are struck with true pain
'Coz the world Bank'll do the same under a new name
We gotta recognize the prize and the people at the door
No more lies, you can no longer ignore

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark

(They don't play it on radio)

Yeah, but the spirit know
But only a few can hear it though
The metaphysical lyrical blow
The minute you're in it and hear it, yo

See the evil and clear it, yo
See that for as many that died there was twice as many miracles
Uh, so let the dead bury their dead
Life is but a dream and in the dream we gotta get ready for bed

Better we look ahead instead, to the ones that survived
Pray for them too, 'coz there grace of God kept them alive
Yes, we mourn for the dead and will still kill for them
But what about the injured that must still rebuild again?

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

To all the people, that never lost someone
Consider the cost of the loss of a lost daughter or son
These cowards slaughter and run
And to know that there's more than just one

Makes you wanna store up your gun
And withdraw all the funds, but

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victorya
The love I give to you, you give to me

But you can shine the light that's in your heart

Relax, it's curiosity that always burns 'em in fact
Sex is like candy, be disciplined, no splurgin
You don't want your stomach hurtin
Girl, you gotta.. {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Listen!

Cash is an issue with that he can never diss you
Even if he makes you cry, you bought your own tissue
witcha own case, witcha own hand, wipe ya own face
And throw him out, no doubt, out of your own place
If your heart is broken you can mend it
If you're independent, your womanhood, that's when you defend it
Just.. uhh, just {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME} woo!
Look!

{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}

Don't come witcha hand always out
If he buys you somethin thank him, but that's not what a man is about
Real men are real friends, showin their real commitment
He tells you he really loves you, a boy can't really admit it
If a man really wants you, that man really flaunts you
In public or private a real man really supports you
'Member what Guru taught you? Of course you ""Royalty""
You dress how you like when a QUEEN is what you ought to be
and ought to act like, and also ought to manifest
How you dress makes you constantly blessed, or constantly stressed
{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME} Yo!

{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}

Yo, yo
So while you burnin off those calories, think about reality
Get a skill for the salary, a man for the family
Not a boy, that's a catastrophe, don't get mad at me
Instead of always clubbin visit museums and art galleries
Pick the single man, admirin the ancient sculpture
He's cultured, chances are he won't insult ya
Give him your number only after you know what he does
Ask him what it is, not what it was
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)

KRS-One,"At midday today, some Americans attended memorial services
For victims of Tuesday's acts of terrorism. Thousands
Gathered at Chicago's Daily Plaza. Hundreds more looked
On from the windows of surrounding office buildings.
Many waved flags, and traffic came to a complete standstill.
On the rooftop of City Hall, which faces Daily Plaza, a
Police sharpshooter watched the crowd, even as he saluted
The flag. After a minute of silence, church bells rang.""

{Ain't no need in all the tears, oh no no, yeah yeah
Yeah cause things will be better tomorrow}

[Chorus x2]
No need for tears, no need to cry
No matter what we face, we shall get by
When the problems you face are too much to bear
Know I'll be there

Hold that head up y'all, don't get fed up y'all
C'mon let's get up y'all
Make that bed up y'all, life is a set-up y'all
Sadness comes from a lack of knowin, not knowin
Where the one that you love is goin
We all gonna reap what we all are sewin
There is no death, just constant growin
We can't stay here forever
We all gotta go to a place we believe is better
So why be sad, why be mad
Now you can see it ain't about the cheddar
It's all about the time that we spend together
Not the rhyme or the crime or the Gucci sweater
The house that's built on a rock can stand the weather
Faith, can stand the weather
But is your house, upon the rock
Or is it on sand and about to drop
Here is the question that you got to ask
Do I live for today or do I live for the past?
Think fast, but do not hurry
Life is a class and we should not worry
But tell me, how long you gonna ignore
Tell me how long you gonna ignore God's law?
How long can you really endure
Livin like pimps, livin like whores
The choice is yours, or really ours
Think about this while you lay the flowers
On the grave, uh, let's talk about how you behave, uh
Do you come out the neighb' or out the cave?
Better change your ways, we comin up on some stranger days

[Chorus]

Uhh, uhh
Don't step where the danger lays or danger lies
Open them EYES UP, better to RISE UP, WISE UP
Raise your MINDS UP
Look to the left, look to the right
Pray in the day and the night
Be prepared for the fight, not scared of the fight
He's the way, the truth AND the light
J to the E to the S to the U to the S
You can remove the stress
Yes, we do need you here
Yes, we wanna be free from fear
Yes, we wanna start seein clear
Havin you here, not over there
Lookin around sayin where, does anybody care?
Yeah, I'll be there
At the door, not at the war
At Matthew 5:44
""But I say, unto you
Love your enemies, bless them that curse you
Do good to them that hate you
And pray for them which despitefully use you
And persecute you""
This goes for them terrorists too
But them publicans, done put themSELVES up above again
Lookin for blood again, hate no love again
Got them soldiers runnin in, with a gun again
With a ton of sin, in a holy war, how we gonna win?
I think it's time for KRS-One again

[Chorus: x2] 

The time is now, you gotta make your choice
Which side are you on? Turn now to Matthew 5:46
""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?
Do not even the publicans the same?
And if ye salute your breddern only, what do ye more than others
Do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect;
Even as your FATHER which is in heaven, is perfect""",Tears,2002
KRS-One,"C'mon, gather round now, gather round now, look now
How many times did you pre-meditate
what you thought was your fate, cause you couldn't just wait
You had to have it the way that you thought in your mind
But in the end, everything came in time
But before the time, you was losin your mind
You was racin and rushin and fallin behind
But let me tell you bout God and the way that She works
I mean the way that He works, I mean the way that We work
You gotta trust in your Lord, everything is in accord
Don't rush or fuss, you gonna get yours
Close your eyes, your heart, your ears, your mind
to the ways and thoughts of mankind
And seek ye first the Kingdom of God
And things won't seem so hard
You gotta trust your Lord, uhh, uhh.. tell 'em bout

[Chorus]
Trust and obey, trust when afraid
Trust when you paid, trust when betrayed
Trust when you fear, trust when you unclear
Trust when you here, trust when you near
Trust when you down, trust when you found
Trust when you clown, trust

C'mon, let's do it again, uh, uh
Let's raise it up, c'mon, look

After you live and you learn then you see
You will learn how to trust in your G-O-D
You will be so free, you won't see no me
You will only see the will of the almighty
You sick of what? Well ya will, give it up
Stop thinkin and begin to, live it up
Every time you think it's one way it's not
Every time you wanna start you really stop
Trust in the inner the outer is for the sinners
In fact this whole rap is for beginners
Those that have talked and walked upon the path
Know that they get what they want before they act
So why rush, if your respect is due
Whatever you DON'T have is protectin you
Here's what you DO have that be bringin the drama
Ask and it shall be given, with a comma

[Chorus]

You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends
You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends

Uh uh, soundin good, soundin good, look, look
So when will you be it, when will you see it
That thoughts and things they manifest when you decree it
But God be lookin out for you
Puttin a stop to what you're about to do
In your life, and in your circumstances
Every time you speak you be takin chances
Talkin bout things that you really don't have to have
So when you get 'em, your life turns sad
Your life turns bad, now why would your God be allowin that?
Trust in God, that's where the crown is at
It's not in what you get, it's what happens after that
So if you think your life is shrinkin
It may be cause you keep thinkin
Not that intellect is wrong
It's just the beginning, it might be time to move on

It's the heart that your missin
It's the art that your missin
Just a little something to hold why'all over

The Kristal album on the way, word up
When you're number one, everybody come
But when you drop to two everybody still with you
But when you drop to three everybody want to see

But when you drop to four everybody still endures
But when you drop to five people will help you strive
When you drop to six you still in every mix
But when you drop to seven people start guessin

When you drop to eight people hesitate
But when you drop to nine that's when you start to find
That when you drop to ten you start to lose your friends
When you drop to eleven your record stop sellin

When you drop to twelve it's everyone for themselves
So when you drop to thirteen you stop working
When you drop to fourteen no more self esteem
You drop to fifteen 'cause you lived and you seen

When you drop to sixteen you now out the scene
When you drop to seventeen you see things you never seen
Like when you drop to eighteen you know what it mean
So drop to nineteen and on then to twenty

At nineteen you lose your honey
At twenty your money to a Playboy bunny
At twenty one things ain't funny
At twenty two you don't know what to do

So you hit twenty three you look for security
So you drop to twenty four no more can you endure
When you drop to twenty five at the bottom you've arrived
When you drop to twenty six you in a old school mix

When you drop to twenty seven until you start steppin
When you drop to twenty eight you start to meditate
When you drop to twenty nine you expand your mind
When you drop to thirty you see it was all dirty

No you drop to thirty two and it occurs to you
When you hit thirty three now you can see
That it's all about skill and a love for the art

Word up, the KRS style album comin' soon, KRS-One
All in the room, we gonna bounce these cats this year
Word up, why they do this? Ha, yo, yo

I climb up the back of rappers, reach over they head
And rap backwards at 'em, excuse me, madam
I used to throw these Uzi's at 'em
But I'm a teacher, skills I truly have 'em
These clubs, I duly pack 'em

Potential lawyers, engineers and doctors, I do attract 'em
Go to your professors and ask 'em
If the songs of the edutainment in college
They didn't blast 'em

Yes, I'm that ancient one, I set the framework
For today's rappers to make they funds
But no, you don't know me son
My facial features matches the Sphinx with it's nose redone

You know how many clubs we done, rocked?
You know how many guns we done, popped?
You know how many funds we done, dropped?
You know how many ones we done, got?
We been gettin' live since the days of Chubb Rock

We know how to survive, these other cats
Be in at nine o'clock then be out at five, uhh
We doin' the overtime on stage, I over-rhyme
Makin' these whack rappers tow the line

Steppin' to me, I know you blind 'cause your whole flow
Your show, your style, you know it's all mine
The first time you learned to spit, it was either me
Kane, Rakim or Slick Rick

Welcome to the KRS style
This year I had to switch styles and bust off, two missiles
And that's not all, rappers have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall but still in all
I have X amount of lyrics to get 'em all

Live at the club, I spit 'em all
Rappers backstage lookin' sad and pitiful
'Cause they know I'm the pinnacle and they minimal
I spit the metaphysical, the spiritual
The oracle, the lyrical, the oratorical

Rookie, I'll mop the floor wit you
I'm the lyrical foundation to all your flows
All your clothes, all your shows and I'm not alone
You wouldn't even know how to hold the mic or the phone

You couldn't even bite on the bone
While we was rockin' mic's out in Rome
Now you hyped 'cause you grown
You know we internationally known

The people love it, but what they learnin' 'bout
Is on the whole, look above it, but let us get back
To what we call hip-hop
Before you, whack rappers went, pop

",Things Is About to Change,2002
KRS-One,"[Verse 1]
Yeah... KRS-One bout to wreck the joint
I was seen openin up at the edge of Detroit
Where the cops go beyond the laws
Where enemies work together by putting they shit on pause
So what does it mean, Assault on Precinct 13?
You are bout to see just what the dirt bring
It's working, that force, I have been searching
Like Lawrence Fishburne when it's time to hurt things
Ethan Hawke, man he face all that
I hold the mic like Ja held the baseball bat
I stay ahead, like a baseball cap
The ways of the world, Kris don't chase all that

[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 2]
Well as I walk through the street, my spirit will speak
To those I meet and great from week to week
I am not my handsome beat. I command the speak
As the observer inside the physique
Many rappers try to compete, of course
But they got smashed and trashed in the streets and tossed
Sometimes I think we all just lost
We just flashin and flossin the disastrous cause
We don't even know the one-ness of the only force
Instead of a golden calf, we got a platinum horse
But what did Moses do with the golden calf?
Threw the log at it and it ended in a blast
Master, get on them quick, get on them faster
In the background you frontin, 'cause there's nothing but laughter
I tag church like the shirt king
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13

We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 3]
Wow, what an ending. What a conclusion
They thought they was winning, but they really was losin
He though he was sinnin, but he really was provin
That leadership keeps it moving, steady cruising
Guns up, funds up, from sun up to sun up to sun up
Buck buck buck! Yo, duck duck
We run up, two down, one up
Dope MCs see me and get butterflies in they stomach
Others can't speak, they just shut up
KRS on the come up, liftin Big Pun up. Let me sum up
Dope MCs, wack MCs, thin MCs, fat MCs, commercial MCs, they can't all
Get done up
Raise the drum up, breath for breath, I'll rip your lung up
On my trophy wall, I'm nailing your tongue up
KRS-One, you know what it means
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13

[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 4]
We gotta start trusting each other right now if we gonna make it
Through this night
From Criminal Minded to Spiritual Minded, and even beyond and behind
It, never be afraid to fight
Or be the lazy type. Me, I'm the crazy type
I get them clubs so crazy hype
I throw them glasses on that them ladies like
And years later, rock what they babies like
I blaze the light, there me be 8,000,000 ways to die
But there's 16,000,000 ways to fight
So wherever you are... in the crib or your car, in your tank too
KRS-One would like to thank you, right
That's why KRS on the mic
Wishin you peace for the rest of the night

This is not the first time I came to the planet
But every time I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin to like
Get wit you, showin you, you are invincible

The devil cannot see through as I unload
Into another cerebellum

And leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin
Have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is

Y'all rock the same style  (sound of the mic)
I know the way how  (I know)

It's supposed to be

This is the way it's supposed to be
It's supposed to be like you more close to me
It's supposed to be about our families
It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
But it's all about salary and flattery
Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
And you know about how they runnin' this game out
It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
But it's all about clout and poppin' them chains out
Instead of forgiveness, we poppin' they brains out
It's supposed to be about seekin' in the seek out

If you claimin' you love this, you got to release doubt
Knowledge is what I'm all about

It's supposed to be NO police brutality
And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
It's supposed to be museums and archives

You hear a voice in the wilderness;you know it's Kris
Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
But it's supposed to be about makin' it better

Go ahead be a hero, get your cheddar
Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that

You can see in your heart how it's supposed to be
You doin' your part, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
Pursuin' your art, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
Today you will start, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
It shouldn't be about you movin' slowly
Then talkin' junk when you don't even know me

All I have is my word and my balls
And my fam and my music speaks for them all
It's the Dominican animal ready to damage, you puttin'
Pressure to rappers that think they can challenge you, Kris (uh huh)

You grimy and hungry?
But how long you gonn' trust me?
You really down for this cause or just chasin' the money?
I be up in them spots to be hot, so dusty and ugly
Nothin' be funny, it's all dark, nothin' sunny
Can you walk with me? Talk with me? Pop the cork with me?
When we in other cities, will you rep New York with me? (yeah!)
I need respect and honor
Discipline and no drama

This is no game! Why should I make you popular?
You know I'm the philosopha
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
If you see it, you can believe it, perceive it, retrieve it and flaunt it
How bad do you want, doggone it, there's the track, if you want it
You got to put your rhyme on it!

How bad do I want it? I'm ready to die like Big

This is no game, why should I do it?

How bad do you see it?

I got the city on lock, but I'm gonna hand you the Keys like Alicia
You know my style, you know I'm the teacha
Philosopha, minister, emcee, Hiphop's spiritual leader
With the heater
You comin' with me? You runnin' with me?
In the spirit Scott LaRock, JMJ and Pun is with me
Yo, cats be steppin' to me ALL the time
With the rawest rhyme
But two weeks later, they fall to crime
If you listenin' to this song, and you want to be put on
You must be loyal to the cats that made you strong
It could be your friend, your father, you sister, your mother, your brother or some other
Just remember the days when YOU was under!
Before the Hummer, before the Benz
Before the hundreds, before the fifties, the twenties and tens
When you was thirsty, remember the living water, and who poured it

It's all a struggle (tryin to make it day to day)
It's all a struggle (from my hood to around your way)
It's all a struggle (single parents all by theyself)
It's all a struggle (diseases decreasin your health)
It's all a struggle (fiends swearin that's they last puff)
It's all a struggle (hustler tryin to avoid handcuffs)
(No matter what you do, who you are or where you from)
(Rich poor black white, at the end of the day)

It's all a struggle, and most people's struggles are doubled
You ain't the only one with a challenge facin some trouble
Look at the woman chewed up by the dog with no muzzle
Or the workers that got trapped underground in that tunnel
Some kids are playin in pools, others in puddles
When they listen to the news the propaganda is subtle
But it's time for you to know that the cryin got to go
Release the guilt that you built and let it flow
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Move slow and on the low, this you gotta know
You don't get the muscles without the hard struggles
You ain't the only one out here tryin to get dough
From the hustler to the preacher to the government leaders
From the airline pilot to the chef to the teachers
We linked in the same huddle, in the same tussle'n'bustle
Cause at the end of the day, it's all a struggle

[Chorus]

It's all a struggle - but don't let the challenges bug you
Or the government drug you, or the thieves in the street
Beat and mug you - build your tunnel under the rubble
Come up on the other side eye to eye with the trouble
Look at the Twin Towers crumble
Look at the religious leadership stumble, everybody struggles
But not everybody comes through nifty, it's fifty/fifty
The city itself will outrun you quickly
Whether you be healthy or sickly
Whether you be wealthy or thrifty, ugly or pretty
Everybody's tryin to get 50's and 100's
I taught this at UCLA just off Sunset
Now run get ""Ruminations""
It's a book that I published for the healing of this nation
In just a few chapters we run through, some possible solutions

Every dollar that we get, we be earning it
Yo, you never have to worry about me taking a trip
Or leaving you at home so I can quickly forget
Yo, with me it's the opposite, you swerve the jeep
You the queen of your house, you earn your keep
And I respect that, in high school we both got left back
We both were divorced and had setbacks
But you should never let that depress you

Support your goals, keep you warm when it's cold

You are the only one (one, one, one)

Crazy why love making we already did
Shit, that's why we got four kids
Romantic, our parenthood we planned it
On the queue two to England, cross the Atlantic
Respect, you don't have to demand
It's like you got the perfect husband and your friends cant stand it
Especially when I watch the kids
And when you come home I ain't trying to find out what you did
It flips theirs leave, 'cause they looking for the player
A little boy trying to pay theirs cell phones and pagers
But with me you living with the savior
We be up in the temple of hip-hop, or chilling with the mayor
I thank the creator
We don't need what they handing out
This is what your man is about
It's like peace and much love
Trust and respect
Your friends may have diamonds but they ain't get that yet
They may have the burghettes and cars and private jets
But all they're really good for is sex

We be hanging out late night at Denny's
Having conversations about every and any
Many people want what we got

You know I can't be compared
You know when the drama comes I aint scared
My name rings bells in the street
You can say my name in any hood your protection is complete
Thugs be right on their feet
Saying 'What, your man is Kris?'
You don't worry miss

But most of the time you're with me and the kids
Mind at ease, chilling out at Chucky Cheese's
These are my kids, I know what their need is
I know what the doctor bill in school to which in fee is
My daughter, I know who she is
And all my sons know exactly what being free is

What they definition of Classic is
Timeless, cause age don't count in the booth
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth
And no doubt the truth I'm off the meters

That's what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place, the beat slowed til you listened to my pace

Oh you went platinum, yeah that's nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time
It's one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain't right, 
By the time you could afford it the car ain't important
In the streets silent, it's just I and, cops keep firing in my environment
Leaving your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong

And we's a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoking trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC's
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC'ing and rap

Hooooooooooooo~! (HEY DJ!) WHAT? (""I know you're gonna dig this"")
Yeah, yeah, yeh yeh! KRS, ohhhh~! Talib Kweli
Talib this is crazy, yo this is crazy
Hah... what'chu doin?
Throw your hands up, c'mon

BK to BX and every place in between, it's all 7-18 like
Grand Concourse, whassup!

We got beats to the rhyme and the rhyme is so fresh yo
So what'chu got? 9's and tecs, you no threat
It's the beat, how you get your cake don't matter
It takes heart the lyrics been replaced with the swagger
I stay sharp enough to slash your face like a dagger
The actors been replaced with the rappers
The rappers been replaced with the actors, see how they try to stay on the beat
The pig route when he walkin down the street to the beat

WOOP~! Sound of da police
What is the life of a true hip-hopper, the beats
Peace love unity livin proper with the beats
In any endeavor whatever we will prosper with our beats
Some cats are real, other are impostors with beats
We the realest, livest
The rawest, crack cocaine heroin survivors with beats
We avoided the cops, we focused on beefs
Spittin, all we saw was stacks of rhymes written, elite
Way too smart for the system of course
We know a smart free black man just pisses 'em off!
What they like is when we glisten and gloss
Flashin millions but still takin a loss
Bump the beat! Yeah, all in the street
Talib yo, I think it's 'bout time to speak

Yeah... yeah... word~!
Watch me take it there, life ain't no Christmas there
Hell yeah it's crystal clear when Kweli and Kris is here
Searching for the perfect beat I went to East Dayt'
It's crazy and fugazi how they slaves to they release date
They try to look away, they're scared to look inside
Askin why like a guy who look for God up in the sky (that's right)
Searchin high and low, behind the do', inside the drawer
Little did he know that the beat was tryin to find a flow
Stuck in limbo, how low can you go
A punched hole through your stomach lining like Tylenol
Build all kind of rolled, metaphors and similies
That'll have you doubtin my competitor's abilities
My whole body is a spiritual facility
Rock a vest after a lyrical killing spree
The illest delivery, later for the talk we need action
Silence is golden but the violence is platinum
When you rappin to the beat

Boom, bap, who's, that?
KRS-One bring the beat back
The perfect beat we seek that, knowledge of mind we speak that
We don't speak weak crap over weak tracks
MOVE, THAT; we speak boom bap live in the club
We can show and prove that

Yeah, it ain't old school or new school it's true school rap
Beat you 'til you're blue and black, true dat, it's

Better beat win again, work the street
Movin again, insert the heat
Lookin again for the perfect beat
Don't look in the book to learn to eat
Write up a hook, learn to speak
Never be shook, follow the heat
Forever they look weak
T.K. you must speak!

Teachin 'em how to eat to live
They cheap and their pimp is pleadin the fifth
Bleedin as if they goin to war
Everytime they leavin the crib
Sneakers and whips, police be peepin the strip
You see 'em walkin the beat
Hoes believin the pimps who eatin the shrimps
So John's walkin the street
Lookin for a sweet face, in each case
Tryin to get they heartbeat racin, and the dark meat be tastin
So delicious, my description so good to the beat
It's lifted right from the sounds that you hear in the hood when you sleep

Bring the beat back!
All that whackness, we don't need that
You gotta bring the beat back!
All that whack garbage, we don't need that
Bring the beat back! All that weakness we don't need that
Selector bring the beat back, bring the beat back!
Selector, listen!

Like Freddie Foxxx, I'm keepin two
I'm known for my scary feuds
That's why I'm called The Terrorist by the Daily News

I rarely lose, I'm known to rattle a cage
I'm known to throw rappers off the stage
Maybe it's a matter of age

Havin' omnipresent power, the watchman's in the tower of

Hip hop, hydrogen iodine phosphorous
Hydrogen oxygen phosphorous, that's called
Hip hop, the response of cosmic consciousness
To our condition as hip hop

We singin' what? Sickness, hatred, ignorance and poverty
Or health, love, awareness and health, follow me

You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
The investigation won't go further, kill a rapper

Tupac's a open case, even though
He was killed in a open place, there's really no haste

It's sorta like we govern ourselves

He simply becomes a poster, somethin' to run after

Kris is the hood of America, I stay ahead of ya

Way too clever for cats that want me to sever this endeavor
I'm like whatever, hah

The opposite of a lie, many tried to get with this guy
But only the best can spit with this guy
It's the teacher, go on and give him a try
I take you all the way back to ba-da-bad-ba-ba-bi

Stay fly, without the flashyness my
Jewels is the gift that I apply, so I ask why
These Kentucky Fried Chicken DJ's promotin' breast and thighs
Marley Marl test these guys, it takes real eyes to realize these real lies

Oye repeta mietro
This for the hood, for the ghetto
Do the math loc or get goin
Huh, 'bout that cuenta

How can I get in the front if I ain't gettin in front
That's why I spit what I want and slide credit to pun
Lies spread it to none, rely on heaven and funds
A two-faced nigga's what I'll never become

Used to be a [unverified], now I see my rhymes get applied
To a track with two live nayendas
Marley, KRS cono dude well that makes it tres
Make a tape, no crosshairs, my aim is great

This ain't the top 8 at 8, it's Hip-Hop 88
When it wasn't all about guap' in a baby face
Back then

Can't win on the streets dog you need a lawyer
Use your real eyes and realize
That real lies are upon us and stop gettin cornered

The teacher, a specialist speaker
To stand next to the leader you must be next to BE leader

We free and we strive to be freer

I'm seein' a lot of cats comin' into the industry

Nah but f'real f'real, a lot of cats comin' into it like

Yo what could the industry do for me? No
What could you bring to the industry?
What could you bring into the industry?
F'real

Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new
Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new
They run, they run, they run, they run, they run their lyric through
But when you're finished rhymin' you have not heard nothing new

So this one dedicated to the one that run their rhyme-a
Time after time after time after time
I know what you will say before you jump up on the stage
But make sure you don't say, ""Di-di-di-dah-di-di-di-day""

Then we'll have to look for you and chop you all up
So when you see me in the street just keep your mouth shut
Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new
Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new, what?

Everythin' you doin' kid we already did it
Everythin' you spittin' kid we already spit it
This my 15th album, I'm havin' fun wit'chu critics
Everythin' you doin kid we already did it

If rap was a toilet, I woulda already shit it
Critics sayin', ""Kris you shoulda already quit it""
But I can't stop, won't stop spittin' crazy lyrics
'Cause I, am hip hop, other rappers just try

You critics wanna sit down and debate every line
But tryin' to get into my concert same time
Spot all packed up, cops yellin', ""Back up, back up""
KRS yellin', ""Sound man turn the track up""

We act up the whole spot a hour straight
We rock 30 classics at least 20 breaks
We always in demand and you must over stand man
We won't be found man on Billboard or SoundScan

Seek me and you will find
Where I be kickin' or spittin' that ill rhyme
Until then they can't see me 'cause I be
In the heart of every rapper I shine

Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new
Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new

So this one dedicated to the one that run their rhyme-a
Time after time after time after time
I know what you will say before you jump up on the stage
But make sure you don't, yo yo Marley turn me up a bit

Which one of you punk ass rappers
Wanna get chewed up like seafood platters?
Bring your best rhyme, it don't matter to me
You ain't gettin' on tonight by battlin' me

The streets won't forgive you man, them guns go blam
Have you crawlin' up the wall like Spider-Man
You all in the jungle, with no Spears like Brittney
Like the coke want Whitney, you still wanna get me

But no, you ain't made for this
I put my hand through your chest like Agent Smith
I jam like them big four-fifths
I go off like a glock 9, no safety on Kris

y'all talk 'bout platinum, I don't need all that
I got 26 gold and platinum plaques
I'll take away your rights like the Patriot Act
Have your whole crew thinkin', ""Well maybe he is kinda whack""

Oh you know what happens after this
Win or lose, you know what happens after Kris

KRS-One,"[Incomprehensible] to you super listeners how you doing tonight?
All you fly guys and fly girls
Welcome once again to the world famous
Mister Magic Rap Attack and of course I am [Incomprehensible]

Way way back before the 'Hots' and the 'Powers'
We used to listen to live mixin' for hours
Roxanne Shanté, U.T.F.O.
Mister Magic Rap Attack some of y'all know

But I was in the shelter in weakness
Homeless, turntableless and microphoneless
Fresh gearless but still I was fearless
And focused on being the dopest MC alive

It's '85, LL's on Def Jam with the best jam
And Whodini's on Jive, man you know I had to survive
New York City was crazy in the 80's but damn it was live

So here comes the Juice Crew with MC Shan
Shanté's already the queen, Marley's already the man
Y'all don't really understand
When you throw on Shanté or Shan it got live in the jam

So we went to Mister Magic
If anybody had to power to put you on he had it
We gave up the demo tape no love lost
But it seems Mister Magic just brushed us off

Somehow we heard we were whack
Every track, and that we shouldn't even call back
Right there my jaw dropped, no doubt
But it made me see what I was all about

And I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got

We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got

In the spot new hip hop and Latin Quarters
And the Union Square and the rooftop
We used to hear them tunes pop in the parking lot
Where it got dark a lot me and Scott La Rock

But it was all for the hip hoppers
Salt-N-Pepa answered Doug E Fresh with 'The Show Stoppa'
MC Shan was gonna challenge LL
Shanté was battling 3 or 4 groups at the same time what the hell

Answer records were big then after Shanté did it
Everybody was trying to spit them so we spit off
To tell you the truth it was the only way an MC could get on

We answered MC Shan's 'Queensbridge'
A dope jam about where he was from and where he lived
But in the Bronx there was these kids
KRS, Scott La Rock trying to live

And I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got

We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got

This it what an MC was we had a strong street buzz
Marley and Shan showed us some love and love never hurt
'Cause while Shan was with Marley we was with DJ Red Alert

Every Friday night, every Saturday night
On the airwaves the battle was right
Under New York nights, smog and lights
Jargon at night the Roxy used to get so hype

You could put on your headset
And get what heads didn't get yet
Live MCs going, ""Check, check""
Spitin' rhymes over the radio set

These are the days and the ways I can never forget
So I don't forget it to Marley and Shan I am indebted
For the start of my career these guys could take credit

For my rappin', the whole battle they let it all happen
Marley and Shan and Shanté could have been gun strapping cousin
But they wasn't and you know why
'Cause we was on some real hip hop let's keep it buzzing

'Til they locked up and they blood is sheddin?

I really spit conscious rap
And when I say stop the violence
How you think we stoppin? that?

Oh no, I got the baseball bat in my hand

Before da twenty thousand seat arenas, before cocaine

Self destruction damn you da leader

No I won't let up, because of how I'm set up

Fighter, petty gangster that flips em neither

Ripping up MC's with their meaningless words, why'know 
There's more wit, to one of my turds of shit 
You ain't shit, you never was shit 
So I spit, on your number one hit, now quit! 
Leave the poetry, it's just too strong for thee 
Maybe we should rethink the strategy see 
Poetry I speak, fluently I think youse a sucker 
Cause the only word you know is motherfucker 
Yo, you don't see a whole race in bondage 
No, you grab the microphone and feed em garbage 
Yo, everything about me is fresher than fresher 
Than fresher than fresh, of COURSE it's KRS 
Flashing lyrics, metaphysics, unlike you idiots 
Be doing, I'm pursuing, chewing your whole crew 
And what you feel like doin, your face they be ungluin

For all you fake ass teachers out there

The type of lyrical terrorism I present 
Educates people  at the same time pays my rent 
You've been hearin' me now for the past twelve semesters 
When the suckers stepped up  I had to use the drastic measures 
I know you want to step to me kid! 
But you're thinkin'  ""Damn  Kris is kinda big!"" 
Plus he rolls wit a crew that don't care 
And drops a hit album, hit video, hit single every year 
From your eye drops a tear 
I don't play that shit, I play that hit 
Your whole gangsta image is not legit 
You heard ""Criminal Minded"", and bit the whole shit 
Now if I punch you in your face I'd be wrong 
Don't even think about battling with a song 
You'll be gone, your career ain't strong enough to call my bluff 
You ain't rough, you ain't tough, you'll be handcuffed

In jail in a pair of panties you look just stunning 
You pop all that wannabe shit on vinyl 
Until your ass is bein' pumped by some faggot named Lionel 
In jail you ain't got respect 
You a fairy, I'll be takin' your commissary 
And the picture of your sister, mister 
As seamy as Pee-Wee Herman, I ain't trying to diss her 
This ain't no bullshit game and I ain't changed 
I'm just thinkin' long range 
People died so I can rhyme
You think I'm gonna grab the mic and waste my nation's time?

So yo Kris, my mellow my man yo 
Get on the mic and do the best you can

Well, the teacher comes to you, in effect 
From a different style, a whole different sect 
I inject, force and intellect 
When I hit the mic, suckers hit the deck 
I come correct and practice what I preach 
I don't pimp you or rule you I teach 
Come through the doors and slap up whores 
Ordering them to put back on their drawers 
Cause, I run their pimp 
When I leave he leaves with a limp 
Shrimp, I got the tartar sauce 
Never underestimate the power of the force 
of the intellectual KRS-One 
I don't think yet my job is done, because 
I stand alone while others have to verify 
Just why they are thought to be fly 
Makin the public believe that they are way up in the sky 
Sort of like a rap superguy 
But I, horrify and terrify the super duper rap guy 
Because you're SOFT as a lullaby 
While they sit on their throne lookin 
Well I'm walkin in the streets of Brooklyn 
Or Harlem and Queens and Bronx and 
I'm even out there walkin in Compton 
Cause everywhere BDP is schoolin 
So anywhere, KRS is coolin 
I'm not foolin, cause no, I'm not a fool 
Don't act stupid boy, you know the rules 

Word, aiyyo Kris, they act like they don't know the rules 
But yo, I tell you what 
Yo get on the mic and tell em what makes up KRS-One 
YaknowhatI'msayin? Huh, and ya don't stop 
Verse Two: KRS 
Yo, from off the sidewalk I grab the mic and talk 
Born nineteen-sixty-five in the state of New York 
My name is Kris Parker, KRS-One for short 
I slap up crews and rock parties for sport 
Lived on the streets about eight years straight 
There I got my education and learned to debate 
So when I pick up the microphone I know what I'm sayin 
Education doesn't come from simply obeyin 
the curriculum, of the school criteria 
In fact what I learned I found inferior 
I'm not a Muslim but I do support them 
My Father in heaven taught me and taught them 
I'm not a Christian, but I won't diss em 
I'm not a Jew, I don't practice Judaism 
I'm not a Buddhist, but Buddha's a master 
I don't eat beef pork nor Diet Shasta 
Reason for this is very simple indeed 
When it comes to music everybody's in need 
You got wealthy artists spendin money loosely 
You ask about the culture, they talk 'bout Gucci 
Metaphysics, the science of life 
And how to live, free from strife 
Walk with ease, and no disease 
Understand that I am the breeze 
And the trees, oceans and seas 
And the be and the D and the P's 
Suckers try it, but I don't buy it 
When I speak you seek to stay quiet 
Shut up! What what? You better stay cool 
And heed the warning boy, you know the rules! 

Ah one two yeah, and ya don't stop 
Ah three four (say what?) and ya don't stop 
Ah five six (pop pop) and ya don't stop 
Ah seven eight (get down) and ya don't stop

Seven bucks an hour wasn’t much money
But I be rapping and kicking it on my lunch break
Like “I'mma make it out this motherfucker one day”
I was in the back, back seat of the bus before a bluetooth
Got the boombox and a blunt, bootlegger deuce-deuce
H on my crew, we get drunk, a little coo-coo
Type of dudes who square up and knock a tooth loose
Quick to the basement, the, the, the basement
That is the window I’m planning to vacate with
Pops put on bars just in case somebody breaks in
That’s not gonna stop me from getting to the pavement
Shh, meeting Jerome at the bus stop
I got the bigger roll, paranoid buck cops
And all my city’s known for grunge, flannel, puck rock
And a bunch of Sub Pop, I was on that Buckshot

Window to window and wall to wall
Can of Krylon, we out to bomb

Just copped that new Boot Camp tape
The neighbors keep complaining ‘bout too much bass
Bang, bang, let me do my thing
Give me two cans and you gon’ know my name
You don’t want to get involved
You know I be on these overpasses burning bridges, dog
You know I be dippin' through these alleys tryna diss the law
Sixteen with Adidas on
I’m too speedy for police I’m chiefin' through these streets, I’m gone
I got game, don’t need to talk anymore
Boppity-bo, tippity-toppity, I pop me some more
I was underground where he came from and he pop out a hole
Cracked the top back on the flat black aerosol
I woke up in the morning and I had a vision
These suit and ties got the nerve to call it vandalism
They hella mad, say my art is really bad for business
But I'mma paint a better world until the cans are empty
Now let it drip, let it drip
If they catch me doing dirt I’ll plead the fifth
I pop a top, I brought my Glock
Speakers bumpin’, I was on that Buckshot

So I try to show the little homies different things
How to diversify, and change different lanes
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't
'Cause all my teachers and doctors were purists to the fullest

Check my lingo, check what Busy Bee brings you
Check out the lyrics I sing you
I fly through the hood like chicken wings do
Like a chef Marley likes mixin' things too

We came together just to change the weather
Busy Bee, he made this game remember?
These unoriginal rap flows, I don't speak those
Too many rappers just copy like Kinko's

Dressin' like they from office depot
Tryin' to be CEO's with whack weak flows
I teach those that flow how to be better
I train MC's to gain in any endeavor

But if you tryin' to diss, you'll get dismissed from the class
In other words, I'm kickin' yo' ass
Beats, bars and breaks, really that's it
And you get that sound at the House of Hits

Where's that place we work it out?

Yo, look, look
KRS reportin' from the House of Hits kids
'Cause in the future you gonna doubt it existed
Comin' up the block your whole spirit gets lifted
The whole spot designed for the lyrically gifted

You walk in the spot, you walk in the history
This is where the greatest MC's spit it lyrically
I don't think you hearin' me today
Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, LL Cool J
Cool G. Rap, Roxanne Shante
Craig G, man, what else can I say?

The home of hits, where one spits and records
In the other room we live on the broadcast boards
The internet's hooked up with all these cords
And the outboard gear man you can't afford
You can rest assured we comin' out with it

You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
The investigation won't go further, kill a rapper
You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper

Scott LaRock's a open case, unresolved
The cops never find the killer, when it's one of ours
Tupac's a open case, even though
He was killed in a open place, there's really no haste

It's sorta like we govern ourselves
Even though we lack a love for ourselves
Or is that we know this thug shit sells?
You want them pockets to swell well

Even though we know we livin' in hell, what about big L?
Hold up, let's stop frontin', let me tell you somethin'
JMJ's dead and the cops don't know nuthin'?
We gotta open our eyes to this too, this issue

The investigation won't go further, kill a rapper

It seems like when a rapper dies, it don't matter
He simply becomes a poster, somethin' to run after
A reason for these kids to pull they guns faster
Tryin' to emulate and be like dead rappers

I roll with them visionary look-ahead rappers
From the city to the farm pushin' John Deere tractors
Bust this, in the city, there is no justice
The whole system is flawed, how could you trust this?

Crimes can't seem to be solved when it's one of us
That's why there's no forgiveness and cats just wanna bust
Hush, some people take the law into they own hand
And get burned like touchin' frying pans

Mothers cryin' too much, brothers tryin' to touch
That cash and such, in they hand they want a grand to clutch
Dissin' they man and such

But Christopher Wallace is a unresolved murder
Another one is Mac Dre, I don't know if y'all heard of him
But word is grim, when it turns to sin
All hip-hoppers are next of kin

We face what we supposed to face

Do the math loc or get goin

How can I get in the front if I ain't gettin in front

Make a tape, no crosshairs, my aim is great

Use your real eyes and realize
That real lies are upon us and stop gettin cornered

I'm seein' a lot of cats comin' into the industry

Yo what could the industry do for me? No
What could you bring to the industry?
What could you bring into the industry?
F'real

Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new
Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new
They run, they run, they run, they run, they run their lyric through
But when you're finished rhymin' you have not heard nothing new

So this one dedicated to the one that run their rhyme-a
Time after time after time after time
I know what you will say before you jump up on the stage
But make sure you don't say, ""Di-di-di-dah-di-di-di-day""

Then we'll have to look for you and chop you all up
So when you see me in the street just keep your mouth shut
Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new
Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new, what?

Everythin' you doin' kid we already did it
Everythin' you spittin' kid we already spit it
This my 15th album, I'm havin' fun wit'chu critics
Everythin' you doin kid we already did it

If rap was a toilet, I woulda already shit it
Critics sayin', ""Kris you shoulda already quit it""
But I can't stop, won't stop spittin' crazy lyrics
'Cause I, am hip hop, other rappers just try

You critics wanna sit down and debate every line
But tryin' to get into my concert same time
Spot all packed up, cops yellin', ""Back up, back up""
KRS yellin', ""Sound man turn the track up""

We act up the whole spot a hour straight
We rock 30 classics at least 20 breaks
We always in demand and you must over stand man
We won't be found man on Billboard or SoundScan

Seek me and you will find
Where I be kickin' or spittin' that ill rhyme
Until then they can't see me 'cause I be
In the heart of every rapper I shine

Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new
Nothing new, nothing new, dem not sayin' nothing new
They run, they run, they run, they run, they run their lyric through
But when they're finished rhymin' you have not heard nothing new

So this one dedicated to the one that run their rhyme-a
Time after time after time after time
I know what you will say before you jump up on the stage
But make sure you don't, yo yo Marley turn me up a bit

Which one of you punk ass rappers
Wanna get chewed up like seafood platters?
Bring your best rhyme, it don't matter to me
You ain't gettin' on tonight by battlin' me

The streets won't forgive you man, them guns go blam
Have you crawlin' up the wall like Spider-Man
You all in the jungle, with no Spears like Brittney
Like the coke want Whitney, you still wanna get me

But no, you ain't made for this
I put my hand through your chest like Agent Smith
I jam like them big four-fifths
I go off like a glock 9, no safety on Kris

y'all talk 'bout platinum, I don't need all that
I got 26 gold and platinum plaques
I'll take away your rights like the Patriot Act
Have your whole crew thinkin', ""Well maybe he is kinda whack""

Oh you know what happens after this
Win or lose, you know what happens after Kris

KRS-One & Marley Marl,"[Incomprehensible] to you super listeners how you doing tonight?
All you fly guys and fly girls
Welcome once again to the world famous
Mister Magic Rap Attack and of course I am [Incomprehensible]

Way way back before the 'Hots' and the 'Powers'
We used to listen to live mixin' for hours
Roxanne Shanté, U.T.F.O.
Mister Magic Rap Attack some of y'all know

But I was in the shelter in weakness
Homeless, turntableless and microphoneless
Fresh gearless but still I was fearless
And focused on being the dopest MC alive

It's '85, LL's on Def Jam with the best jam
And Whodini's on Jive, man you know I had to survive
New York City was crazy in the 80's but damn it was live

So here comes the Juice Crew with MC Shan
Shanté's already the queen, Marley's already the man
Y'all don't really understand
When you throw on Shanté or Shan it got live in the jam

So we went to Mister Magic
If anybody had to power to put you on he had it
We gave up the demo tape no love lost
But it seems Mister Magic just brushed us off

Somehow we heard we were whack
Every track, and that we shouldn't even call back
Right there my jaw dropped, no doubt
But it made me see what I was all about

And I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got

We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got

In the spot new hip hop and Latin Quarters
And the Union Square and the rooftop
We used to hear them tunes pop in the parking lot
Where it got dark a lot me and Scott La Rock

But it was all for the hip hoppers
Salt-N-Pepa answered Doug E Fresh with 'The Show Stoppa'
MC Shan was gonna challenge LL
Shanté was battling 3 or 4 groups at the same time what the hell

Answer records were big then after Shanté did it
Everybody was trying to spit them so we spit off
To tell you the truth it was the only way an MC could get on

We answered MC Shan's 'Queensbridge'
A dope jam about where he was from and where he lived
But in the Bronx there was these kids
KRS, Scott La Rock trying to live

And I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got

We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got

This it what an MC was we had a strong street buzz
Marley and Shan showed us some love and love never hurt
'Cause while Shan was with Marley we was with DJ Red Alert

Every Friday night, every Saturday night
On the airwaves the battle was right
Under New York nights, smog and lights
Jargon at night the Roxy used to get so hype

You could put on your headset
And get what heads didn't get yet
Live MCs going, ""Check, check""
Spitin' rhymes over the radio set

These are the days and the ways I can never forget
So I don't forget it to Marley and Shan I am indebted
For the start of my career these guys could take credit

For my rappin', the whole battle they let it all happen
Marley and Shan and Shanté could have been gun strapping cousin
But they wasn't and you know why
'Cause we was on some real hip hop let's keep it buzzing

Kehidupan anak muda di kotaraya
Hari-hari ku mencari destinasi ini
Seperti semua aku juga punya mimpi
Namun kita berbeza
Usia, harta, rupa, latar keluarga
Hitam putih kehidupan sendiri menentukan
Namun terlalu banyak kehitaman dalam kehidupanku
Aku...aku lakukan apa perlu
Hari ganti hari masa terus berlalu
Bukan ku pinta kehidupan tak bererti
Situasi yang menjerat tak bisa ku lari lagi
Sampai bila, sampai bila nasib ku begini
Bila ku mati, siapa peduli?
Inilah sehari dalam diari
Anak metropolitan, di kotaraya ini

Adakah hidupku satu gurauan
Sekadar penuhkan pementasan
Diriku tak perlu belas kasihan
Bersendiri ku menyepi di sini
Jangan kau cuba mendekati
Kamu juga pentingkan diri sendiri
Mengakulah ini realiti
Yang lemah 'kan mati, gagah berlari
Sedar tidak sedar, akulah sisa
Dipandang hina tak pernah ku sangka
Kais pagi, aku berdosa lagi
Fikirku tak mungkin akan berlaku pada ku
Temanku...semuanya dikejar, diburu
Lambat laun tersungkur juga satu persatu
Bila-bila saja masanya 'kan tiba
Aku juga mnejadi lelaki diburu
Mengimbas sekias semalam
Anak kecil masa depan cerah menjadi malap
Takdirnya di dalam diari
Anak metropolitan ku bersendiri lagi
Sehari di dalam diari
Sebuah kehidupan di metropolitan

Sepuluh tahun pengalaman
Anak jalanan juga punya prinsip dan pegangan
Inilah dia syarat pertama
Jika gua tak kacau lu, lu jangan kacau gua
Apa jua kau berkata
Beranilah juga tanggung risikonya
Aku masih muda, umur dua tiga
Jangan kerana mulut badan binasa
Dan janganlah kau cuba menyekat dan berinasihat
Kerna mungkin kini masanya sudah terlewat
Biarku dengan caraku nanti hidup kau juga akan tidak menentu
Walaupun apa kau fikirkan
Aku masih menaruh sedikit harapan
Agar diari lebih bererti
Anak metropolitan tak perlu berdosa lagi

Who’s better, Mawi or Jackie
And in awards shows, will anyone ever beat Miss Siti?
Who cares if she’s got something going on

So why can’t we be obedient when no one’s watching us 24/7
Passing red lights in the middle of the night
What’s right is wrong, on the roads we become demons
Honks and fingers, abuses and sisters
That you force to stand and book your spot at the parking lot
Unless if you’re an AP king driving Ferraris
Hustlers will scratch your doors and nail your tyres
So which team do you support here?
Melaka, Pahang, Selangor or Johor?
Cause at the mamak stalls they watch the EPL scores
Maybe that’s why it’s hard for our national team to beat Singapore

Whether in the clubs or malls or streets in the cities
We make a big deal about the little things in life
On the differences rather than the similarities alike
Just chill, be cool with each other

Stop the slacking, dissin’, slammin’ and moanin’

Too much pain
I'm speechless
Too much to take
I'm speechless
Can't carry on
I'm speechless
Is there hope for me

A cry without voice
No tears in my eyes
Life without hope
Dispair bur no sighs
My hands are tied
I cannot move
Show me a future
To look into

Krumb Snatcha Mobsters,"First and foremost, some rappers are sweet like fructose
When I cock back these lyrics, y'all punks best be ghost
I be the seven, twenty-one, eighteen, twenty-one
The illest one, I'm almost doper than anyone
Straight out the late nights of Bed-Stuy
Steppin' up, y'all put your weapons up, I make heads fly
You're artificial, like saccarhin
You're crazy fake, it's more than skills you be lackin' in
Concepts you bite, 'cause your identity ain't tight
Tryin' to be somethin' you're not, like pullin' a knife at a gunfight
I'm troopin' on night air, like flight number 1-0-6,
And gettin' all up in your fuckin' mix
You get me upset, and I got you uptight
'Cause my committee's in your city tonight, a'ight?
We got seventeen million of us, plus two million Indians
That makes nineteen mil, lightin' shit up, like Wild Bill
I be the supreme father, plus the ill kid, with drama
My karma, creates the teflon to pierce your body armor
And make sure you check the shit, before you walk to me, or talk to me
Steppin' to me improperly, you just may catch the weaponry
My specialty is tearin' tracks out the frame
You know my fuckin' name, I rule all game
I'm universal, on all planes, what's your claim?

Yo, I be your highness, in slickness, you chumps bear witness
Tremendous tropper, verbal nigga, with the fitness
Drop you for your spot with the blazer, then I blast ya
Slice precise, like Benihanas, when I come to bring the dramas
Styles so swift, that you can't peep the God
As your lyrics get buried, six feet deep, in my backyard,
I laugh hard, while your mental, I run through mazes
Dark stages of terror, to shatter your dressing room mirror
Your whole error gets crushed, your whole show gets bumrushed
Too many dumb punks want to enter this rap scene
Kickin' Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion; the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief, plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fuckin' barber
So what, you made some dough, you best keep on scramblin'
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handlin'
Demandin' that you pay, for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday

I see myself as the black Rap Messiah
Colossal, spreadin' my gospel through electrical wires
Spit fire through speech, so I can reach each and every
Tom, Dick, and Jerry, slippin' like petroleum jelly
Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight
I got divine right to bring y'all to light
Somethin' ain't right, to be an MC, you gotta thug
Or to thug you gotta be an MC, this shit is bugged
Show love but few; deal with crew and crew only
And think universal, like Sony
Phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
Give a fuck like Pizza Hut, I got to stay Noyd-ed
'Cause that same nigga you trust, could be that same cat
Behind that gat that bust, quiet ya, with the silencer
Keep it hush, ashes to dust, then dust to ashes
Nowadays it's who pull out the fastest, imagine this
Rap shit without this gat shit, or the phony cat
In black, talkin' 'bout how much his Mac spit
But this year, Gang Starr got changes bein' made
No wack shit bein' played, no fake macks gettin' paid
No Versace MC's, with a mouth full of Mo'
Soundin' like a ho, spittin' that old-fashioned show flow
I bombshell that pastel Chanel rap, through a Maxwell
Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Goin' deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with interpretive robe and sandals, like Moses
Travellin' high sands and Eastern lands, for the answers
Ignorance is spreadin' through the streets, like it was cancer
Too many drinkin' not thinkin', when behind that trigger
A thirty-eight escalate the murder rate, for us niggaz

Krumb Snatcha Mobsters,"Uh, '97
Premo, D&D why'all, that's right, I want to speak a little truth
'Bout what guns is really about cause me being victim of guns
Was an experience of gettin' Closer To God

Since the day I was young I had preminitions of an ending to come
Behind the barrel of the next man's gun
It used to be fun, when I'm the one doin' the clappin'
Now I'm facin' my death, doin' fast breath, no laughin'
How can this happen, holdin' my chest to the floor
Laid up, or spraid up dreamin' to even the score
Bright lights all I saw my life flashed before me
From a distance I heard a faint voice steady call me
I guess my time is here, suppress my fear I'm ready
Tryin' to breath steady, feelin' my legs gettin' heavy
Lord, don't let me..die this young, without leavin' a son
To carry tradition, listen my life has just begun
A nightmare flip visions of swingin' the poolstick
Defendin' my near if I turn left the pool quick
Lost control of my mind, flipped the safety of the nine
And squeezed tastin' down this judge and roused, then fell on my knees
Weak from my heart feel my chest gettin' hot, I got caught
Vivid memories of how my gun dropped, bullets in stock
Lost all thoughts of me rappin' try to catch one for I die
For self satisfaction, get up off my knees begged him don't please
Picked up the squeeze dipped behind cars bullet shelves hittin' the trees
Curse my enemies will be as smart enough to take cover
Feelin' my body shudder as I drop right in front of
The boot place as hot shells hit the cheek of my face
Catchin' bloody taste, watch my blood leave trace
Hennessy got me trippin' plus the brew I was sippin'
Feelin' more blood drippin' I see them load a second clip in
Betreated, I been defeated my life is ice like popsicles
Open the door hit the floor of the hospital
It's on

""Gettin' closer to god in a tight situation""
""Let me be your angel and I be your protection""
""I stopped breathin' damn I see demons""

My heart's racin' a casualty and convertation
Hopin' one day I'll awake and feelin' my body, start shakin'
I been mistakin' retaliation to come
Soon holdin' my gun boom on the floor of the hospital room
Or shall I cry for help as I look up at the ceiling
My inner feelin' tellin' me to start healin' not in a million
Years I would want to end here, whipin' my tears
Thinkin' of my long lost career, in this business of rap
Now flat on my back, tryin' to put it place to face on this enemy cat
Cardiac control, I put a hold on my soul
Twenty-two years old and my life gon' took her some toe
My body fall for numerous feelings I fell layin' here lonely
Watchin' my homie scream for help I hear a doctor
Yellin' directions to the meds cut open my friends
Bring me to the nearest bed half dead
My inner head screamin' losin' my breathin'
""Damn I see demons"" -> Snoop
Don't remember the good Krumb, only the bad one
And now I can tell the depths of hell for evils I've done
Can't run, facin' my worst of fears
Leavin' my physical as my spiritual descends stairs
But wait, this can't be real, I feel the agents are real
Askin' my name, overlookin' my bloodstained gold chain
Easin' my pain from where we came I don't know
But he's tellin' me it's not the right time to go
Back in my fo' tubes suckin' the ooze from my mouth
As nurses run about, tryin' to send me down south
Who shot ya? That's word from the detect' and the doctor
Before I got flown to Beantown in a helicopter

""Gettin' closer to god in a tight situation"" 
""Let me be your angel and I be your protection"" 
""I stopped breathin' damn I see demons""
""Gettin' closer to god in a tight situation"" 

I awake with cold feet feelin' weak and can't eat
Seein' homies stand around, but no sounds I can't speak
Cheap hospital clothes a badged up of holes got me depressed
As I'm lookin' at my legs and my chest
They patched up five, lucky that I had survived
Layin' in bed with a naked head, but alive
We call it a night, before, we tryin' to make sure
I was staggerin' in to the hospital door
Whosader, the flash to a honourable respitator
The flashback to me gettin' respect form my savior
I can't understand it, must been the way that they planned it
And my commandment I've never takin' live for granted
Rememberin' on my knees, beggin' please
Don't let my soul get seized, lost track of my thoughts
Cause the d.t.'s came and question me, testin' me
Guess havin' thoughts arrestin' me
Stop stressin' me cause ain't no confession see
Funny ain't it thought I was back in an inseignment
Now my image is tainted coughed on my crutches for enreignment
Damn..",Closer to God,1998

You got gats and bats we get those too

Bloodthirsty, star what the worst be

Coming forty niggaz like a jail yard

Blood on my silk shirt, choke niggaz out
Scuffed up my Timbs, we bang 'em in the mouth
You niggaz want a concrete rebel
Pulling out busting like war in the jungle

Mad 'cause my crew lay bubble in the tunnel
Most humble, we send shots when we come through
Get praised but still blaze in the battle
The ruff days, these two bullets niggaz tattle

I'm immune to them tuff-talk, them big boy stanze
You coming in pairs, then two bodies by the stairs
Nigga we bang with the best, the models to rest
Create drama, rock armor, Smith & Wess-ons

Blood shot, gun cocked, mingling shotting
Lost in this world I'm in, feeling money rhyming
Eyes roaming, zoning, looking with a Nottz beat
Label most dangerous, police lay and watch me

Harts start jumping, we peeping niggaz fronting
We come through thumping, pulling out dumping
Tangle with your best entourage

We coming in yards to face off with any yards
Soldier you're dust on the fully loaded shotgun
Whistling throughout the air, just to mock one
Blood for your socks son

Watch us comin up in the fast lane, Henney'd up
Never worry 'bout beef, fire arms already tucked
What the fuck, niggaz been about to the Don
And give it up to Krumb, I live it up for my son
And you industry niggaz, you really lost it
First you slept on Boston, then you kept on flossin
Shouldn't do that, around us hungry niggaz
'Cause we the chosen godly warriors, tuffer than rugby niggaz

Temper so short, turn ya face to a gun range
Switch it up, nice chain, lift it up
Too much talk about juice, is why'all bitch or what

Murdered over a fifty, hometown ain't it shifted
I travel the map but I always come back
To burn it down behind 24 tracks

[Verse 7: Krumb Snatcha]
Shoot outs fit niggas get twist in the Bean
Below the exploded magazine leave my head on the scene
Long time to Glocksbury twist your nine on the spot
Either you out to get this paper, or you work for the cops
My don stylo finally ya niggaz know how it go
Most hated at the back with the gats at the show
Quick to die with the stripes on squeezing like a python
Half the industry ya already dead before the mic's on

[Verse 8: Akrobatik]
My rapstyle's changed like Rodman's head
It's Akrobatik representin' Common Square (Hell yeah)
Where you can hop on the Red Line
And catch me at the Middle East
Wippin' hoes close to headline
The winter's east Stone Cold like Steve Austin
But I promise my heart will never leave Boston
And that's the bottom line cause Akro say so
Intimidatin' with my pitch changed up like Pedro

[Chorus]

You pussy niggaz, we incredible
And don't push us, to put led in you
We 'bout to be them niggaz on top, instead of you
The Beantown beatdown, unbelievable, see now
Push ya dough up, we want more than some G's now
Watch us comin up in the fast lane, Henney'd up
Never worry 'bout beef, fire arms already tucked
What the fuck, niggaz been about to the Don
And give it up to Krumb, I live it up for my son
And you industry niggaz, you really lost it
First you slept on Boston, then you kept on flossin
Shouldn't do that, around us hungry niggaz
'Cause we the chosen godly warriors, tuffer than rugby niggaz
Live lovely niggaz
Although the time's is harsh, all my soldiers now it's time to march
All you punks, huh, you better find a heart

[Hook]

[Krumb Snatcha]
A child with a destiny, ain't no testin me
Mental menu, send you a recipe
Chef like Rae how I bake a track
Give the streets mo' yeast until the cake is back
Stack to my own bakery, why niggaz hatin me
Can't see this fake industry makin me
Anti-flossin, poppin at the bar
This is ashy-ass knuckles and razors in the jar
Far from the norm, so they say son strange
Temper so short, turn ya face to a gun range
Switch it up, nice chain, lift it up
Too much talk about juice, is why'all bitch or what
Like vanity, shine with your rims and ice
Until a hooded figure come through to dim ya lights
Timbs and mics, all a nigga need
Just to proceed, to make another rapper bleed, indeed

[Hook]

[Guru]
Sleep? Nah I wouldn't do that on no one
Creep? That's what I like to do like a Shogun
Load one, buck it, cold one as fuck it
Colt two, loads of power you but let's not discuss it
Babylon got us holdin on the tephlon
We deaded some but we gon' spit, 'til all the rest gone
Respect to your hood, I know the O.G.'s there
Yo I dare when we fear none, play low-key here
[Krumb Snatcha]
Yo, me and the God expose frauds frontin hard
The type want to fight get jumped in the yard
Any odds oppose, get the deadliest blows
In the form of these toxic flows
Pumpin the glock, send shots through your clothes
Incredible game how we knock why'all hoes
Stop all foes, deadin their tracks
And since niggaz got mouth, give head to this gat, for real

[Hook]",Incredible,2003
