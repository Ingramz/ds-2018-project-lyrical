Tracy Bonham,"Whether it's the sunshine
Whether it's the rain
Does it make a difference
Do you complain

Whether it's the water
Coming in from the roof
Does it piss you off 
That you're not waterproof

Whether you fall
Means nothing at all
It's whether you get up 
It's whether you get up

And you hate the silence 
As it fills up the room
And there's not much to say
To your blushing groom

Maybe all eyes are on you
As you finish the race
And the world sees you struggling
For last place 

Whether you fall
Means nothing at all
It's whether you get up
It's whether you get up

Whether you fall
Means nothing at all
Whether you get up
Whether you get up

Whether you fall
Means nothing at all
It's whether you get up
It's whether you get up

Tracy Bonham,"I'm tough as nails I'm made of stone don't you know?
I don't want you to see me wilting like a flower

Look away look away look away

I am a rock that's what I do for a living
Please look away as I'm wilting like a flower

Look away look away look away
Love me anyway love me anyway love me anyway",Wilting Flower,2005
Tracy Bonham,"There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep.

Now it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep.

Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the breath of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way.

Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long

Tracy Byrd,"Well I was really feeling down
I'd really been uptight
About to lose my mind
When I came in here tonight
Things have turned around
Since they turned the jukebox on
I laid my money down
And somebody played my song

And I'm back in the swing of things
An amazing change takes place
When I hear them twin fiddles play
Oh there's a difference of daylight
And dark in my heart over music
Chases my blues away
When those playboys are playing
I'm feeling no pain
I'm back in the swing of things
I'm back in the swing of things

Say would you like to dance
And join me in the fun
Here's your one big chance
'Cause the night is almost done
Girl can you believe
How good it makes you feel
I have to pinch myself sometimes
To find out if it's real

And I'm back in the swing of things
An amazing change takes place
When I hear them twin fiddles play
Oh there's a difference of daylight
And dark in my heart over music
Chases my blues away
When those playboys are playing
I'm feeling no pain
I'm back in the swing of things
I'm back in the swing of things
I'm back in the swing
I'm back in the swing of things",Back in the Swing of Things,1993
Tracy Byrd,"All at once here I am in this barroom
Oh and most any night I'd be home
But those old thoughts of her are beginning to stir
I need to be anywhere but alone

When you close you can call me a taxi
Until then you can call me a fool
So just bring me a glass and don't bring up the past
If you did I don't know what I'd do

I'm right on the edge of a memory
Lord knows I don't wanna fall
'Cause it tells me she'll always be gone
And reminds me where I went wrong
Yeah, I'm right on the edge of a memory
And just hanging on

So bartender just keep 'em coming
Till she and I go out of my mind
Tonight I refuse to take on the blues
I'll just put off the truth till closing time

I'm right on the edge of a memory
Lord knows I don't wanna fall
'Cause it tells me she'll always be gone
And reminds me where I went wrong
Yeah, I'm right on the edge of a memory
And just hanging on

Yeah I'm right on the edge of a memory
And just hanging on
",Edge of a Memory,1993
Tracy Byrd,"I'm face to face with an angel
How'd you get those eyes so blue
You're a vision in white and I've been waitin' all night
Just to have one dance with you
Now all my dreams are comin' true

I'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight
Everything about you is so perfectly right
I've never been there but I think I might
Be holdin' heaven in my arms tonight

I'm not sure where you came from But I thank my lucky stars above That I got the chance to have a dance But one dance just ain't enough I think I'm fallin' in love

(Repeat Chorus 2x)

I'm holdin' heaven in my arms tonight",Holdin' Heaven,1993
Tracy Byrd,"Today an old heartache came calling
An old flame I thought died out like some falling star
Instead it's rekindling some memories
That may start an out of control raging fire

That look in your eyes brings back memories
You still have that same smile that once won my heart
The bittersweet feelings still linger
That once fueled our out of control raging fire

An out of control raging fire
Pain has no memory when you burn with desire
The flames grow higher and higher
Till we've reached an out of control raging fire

Inside us the passion is burning
It's too late to stop what we've started tonight
How can we resist this temptation
To restart an out of control raging fire

An out of control raging fire
Pain has no memory when you burn with desire
The flames grow higher and higher
Till we've reached an out of control raging fire
Yes, we've reached an out of control raging fire
",Out of Control Raging Fire,1993
Tracy Byrd,"I could search from now till the end of time
And never find another you
I'm so glad because I know you're mine
Someone to give my love to

Now I believe my love that you're one of a kind
For there's no one else like you
You're the light of my life so let it shine
Someone to give my love to

Chorus
I found happiness is loving you
And I'll do my best to make your dreams come true

I will follow you to the end of the earth For my place will be with you I have taken you for better or worse Someone to give my love to

Tracy Byrd,"Well I woke up this mornin'
And I was feelin' fine
But with my first cup of coffee
Came the last thing on my mind
It hung around uninvited
The whole day through
It didn't care that I'd been trying
To keep from missing you

That's the thing about a memory
It's got a mind of its own
It can take an old flame
And chill you to the bone
Just when you think it's long gone
It'll roll back around
But that's the thing about a memory
When it comes to misery
It'll never let you down

I already know that it's not welcome
It's just a fair weather friend
Who wants to be reminded
Of things that might've been
It don't matter if I'm drivin'
Or walkin' down the street
It's never far behind
It does it every time
It knocks me off my feet

That's the thing about a memory
It's got a mind of its own
It can take an old flame
And chill you to the bone
Just when you think it's long gone
It'll roll back around
That's the thing about a memory
When it comes to misery
It'll never let you down

When it comes to misery
It'll never let you down",That's the Thing About a Memory,1993
Tracy Byrd,"Where in a barroom
When last night
What was I doin'
I was holdin' someone tight
Who oh just someone
Who didn't mean a thing
How well I just slipped off my wedding ring

Why I don't know
I didn't mean to hurt you
I don't want to see you go
Girl you know me well enough
To know that I don't lie
And I can answer every question but why

Where at her place
When around closing time
What were we drinking
Tequila, salt and lime
Who but a fool like me
Could hurt someone like you
How can you forgive me
For all I've put you through

Why I don't know
I didn't mean to hurt you
I don't want to see you go
Girl you know me well enough

She's history
Don't ruin good beer with tears
Get up off those knees
She ain't coming back, Jack
And if you think she will
You're on the wrong track
Hearts get broken every day
And life goes on without her here
It would be so clear if only it was

Anybody else's heart but mine
I'd say hey that's the breaks
It'll mend in time
I'd know just what to do
If it was anybody else's blues
If it was anybody else's heart but mine

Hey what's goin' on
It's a little bit different
When it's my love that's gone
Now old platitudes
Like find somebody else
Now they just won't do
I was so wise when giving free advice
To every body else
But now hearing it myself I wish that it was

Anybody else's heart but mine
I'd say hey that's the breaks
It'll mend in time
I'd know just what to do
If it was anybody else's blues
If it was anybody else's heart but mine

Tracy Byrd,"It was no accident me finding you
Someone had a hand in it
Long before we ever knew
Now I just can't believe you're in my life
Heaven's smilin' down on me
As I look at you tonight

I tip my hat to the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what he was doin'
When he joined these two hearts
I hold everything
When I hold you in my arms
I've got all I'll ever need
Thanks to the keeper of the stars

Soft moonlight on your face oh how you shine
It takes my breath away
Just to look into your eyes
I know I don't deserve a treasure like you
There really are no words
To show my gratitude

I tip my hat to the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what he was doin'
When he joined these two hearts
I hold everything
When I hold you in my arms
I've got all I'll ever need
Thanks to the keeper of the stars

I was a rebel in my younger years
I'd...drink with the devil if he bought me a beer
Wore out two pickups just running around
Mama thought I never would settle down
That was before I met sweet Irma Jean
She made a new man outta me

We got pink flamingos in the front yard
Picture window with a view of Wal-Mart
Blue collar heaven domestic bliss
It just doesn't get any better than this
We got pink flamingos, pink flamingos, pink flamingos

Sweet Irma Jean is a den mother now
With a station wagon and a charge account
Bubba Junior pitches for his baseball team
Little sister's running for Rose Bud Queen
And me I'm doing good at the used car lot
Is this a great country or what

We got pink flamingos in the front yard
Picture window with a view of Wal-Mart

It just doesn't get any better than this
We got pink flamingos, pink flamingos, pink flamingos

They wave and smile but there's envy in their eyes

Not so long ago
On his way home from work
He'd stop by the side of the road
Step out of that old beat up Ford
That he drove
And he'd walk around
Searchin' the ground
For a handful of wildflower blooms
Thinkin' of where he'd be soon
There with her

She called them redneck roses
'Cause that's what they were
A simple gift of love
From a country boy to his girl
She called them redneck roses
They didn't cost a dime
But they brought a smile to her face
Every time

Now it's years down the line
She sits home alone
It's the usual end of the day
Once again, he's still workin' late
And never calls

They've got a house on a hill
No problems with bills
And a baby that's on the way
But her heart longs for those yesterdays
And his love

She called them redneck roses
'Cause that's what they were
A simple gift of love
From a country boy to his girl
She called them redneck roses
They didn't cost a dime
But they brought a smile to her face
Every time

They could still put a smile on her face
If he only had the time",Redneck Roses,1994
Tracy Byrd,"Right about now she's brushin' her hair
Slippin' on her gown, wishin' I was there
She just hates these lonely nights when I'm gone
Right about now she's turnin' back the sheets
Asking God to watch over me
She'd never dream what I'm thinkin' about right about now

Right about now temptation's knockin' on my door
I'm one step away from doin' what I've never done before
I can hear the devil whisper, Go ahead, she'll never find out.
But, if I did her wrong I could never feel right about now

Right about now she's reachin' for the phone
She knows it's me calling home
I can almost see the smile on her face
Right about now if she only knew
What a lonely man could do
It would break her heart in two right about now

Right about now temptation's knockin' on my door
I'm one step away from doin' what I've never done before

Oh wild Billy told me even I would have a chance
If I took a trip down the Georgia highway and asked some girl to dance
Billy said he'd been there - had the best time of his life
He went to stay for the weekend and he came back with a wife

It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta, I'm gonna get lucky tonight
The girls are in my favor and if I play my cards just right
I might find an angel whose fire I can light
It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta and I'm on my way tonight

I can't wait to get there I know she's waiting for me
With eyes as blue as Texas skies like I ain't never seen
And as I think about it my heart starts to pound
I throw this thing into lower gear and crush that hammer down

It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta, I'm gonna get lucky tonight
The girls are in my favor and if I play my cards just right
I might find an angel whose fire I can light
It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta and I'm on my way tonight

Here comes a confrontation with the highway patrol
I hope beneath those flashing lights there's an understanding soul
I've only got one story - I'm a man without love
Can we talk about it ma'am before you write me up

It's 4 to 1 in Atlanta, I'm gonna get lucky tonight

I hate to say it heart I told you so
You wouldn't listen you just had to go
And take her back again
Knowing you couldn't win
She's put you through all this before
And you don't need that heartache anymore

I feel the hurt that's inside of you
I've seen all the things she's put you through
Now you're alone and ache
She's finally made you break
Your troubles just walked out the door
You don't need that heartache anymore

Maybe in a while you'll feel better
Try real hard to forget her
She ain't worth your teardrops
Or walking the floor
It's gonna take time but I know you'll do it
Come on heart you can get through it

I can't say looking back right now just where our love went wrong
But the hard cold fact is she's not here she's gone
Made me a promise she'd be true till the rivers all ran dry
The rivers still runnin' but she's long said goodbye

That's why I'm down on the bottom
Where the Moccasin's King and the big tall cypress grow
Seems the only place that a country boy can find some peace of mind
And get back up, is on the bottom

Got friends in the world outside but none quite like ol' Cajun Joe
He lives down a slough where the river used to flow
Worked real hard most of his life till the pushin' came to shove
Gave it all he had but he just couldn't rise above

That's why he's down at the bottom
Where the alligator swims and the old grey moss hangs low
Seems the only place that a country boy can find some piece of mind
And get back up, is on the bottom

I can get back up here on the bottom

It's cold this time of year and the people in this city make it colder
They've all forgotten what it means to lend a hand or cry on a shoulder
In this land of opportunity we fight like hell to make an extra dime
It would surely get the best of me without the heaven in my woman's eyes

It's the heaven in my woman's eyes that make life's hell a better place to be
It's the heaven in my woman's eyes that gives the inspiration that I need
Sometimes it seems a man is born to lose no matter how hard he tries
Life on earth would sure be hell without the heaven in my woman's eyes

Simplicity was once a way of life but now it's buried with our past
A dollar used to go a long long way but now it just goes fast
Oh how I wish that I could be as free as our union eagle flies
But the only time I'm free is when I view the heaven in my woman's eyes

It's the heaven in my woman's eyes that make life's hell a better place to be
It's the heaven in my woman's eyes that gives the inspiration that I need
Sometimes it seems a man is born to lose no matter how hard he tries
Life on earth would sure be hell without the heaven in my woman's eyes
Life on earth would sure be hell without the heaven in my woman's eyes

Tracy Byrd,"I could tell she was a hot rod when she walked in all alone
Made a pit stop at the front bar, in a puff of smoke was gone
I followed her smell of perfume, cause she was too far out of sight
Tried to catch up but the girl was running one hell of a race tonight

She's a real low maintenance, country music beat driven, honky-tonk dancin' machine
All it takes to keep her tuned up is boots and Wrangler jeans
She scoots about fifty times around the floor on one shot of Jim Beam

I dressed up in my best
My Ropers and my vest
And waited by the door with these roses
Till you came walkin' in
With your high falutin' friends
So busy lookin' down your noses
Now here you are ignorin' me
Girl I might as well be

Walkin' to Jerusalem
Marchin' with Methuselah
Readin' signs in Arabic
Ravin' like a lunatic
By the time you tell me I'm the one
I'll be stickin' out my thumb
And walkin' to Jerusalem

You wore your boots last night
You kissed me and held me tight
You said you'd always be my cowgirl

You looked at me as only you can look at me
You touched my cheek and told me not to cry
But you said you'd found somebody you loved more than me
And you told me I'd forget you by and by

But you lied to me, yes you lied to me
You said time would close the wound that bled inside of me
But every breath I take brings back your memory
You said I'd forget you, but you lied to me

Monday, I said Tuesday you'd be off my mind
Then I gave myself 'til Wednesday then on down the line
Funny how September turns to June so fast
And you told me this pain was not the kind to last

Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine

Let me show you something that you ain't never seen

Threw dinner in the microwave
Beside it on the counter lay
A letter from my wife addressed to me
It said I know you're workin' hard that's easy to see

She wants to go back home and change

Pay the bills and feed the kids

Ask that man whose family stayed around 
When he finally put the bottle down 
Now he fights that battle everyday

How far it bends before it breaks
And to keep the world from folding in How much strength does it take
Well don't ask me

Ask that couple in the waiting room

Its their little girl All they can do is pray
Ask that little boy who's gotta choose

This chemistry between us feels so wonderful

Find a way to mess it up

Just let me be in love

Don't concern me with reality
Don't convince me she's too heavenly
Forget the future, disregard the past
Those are questions I don't want to ask
To my heart, all that matters is tonight
Just let me live this moment in her eyes

Baby, I'll be right there
You're having one of those days
I can see right through this phone
Nothing's out of my way
You can't ask too much
I'm just thankful to be
The one you lean on

So lay your troubles on me
It's what I live for
It makes me feel so complete
It's the reason I was born
Baby, what makes love love
And gives my life meaning
Is to be needed

I know this ain't easy
Sometimes we try so hard
That we just end up overworked and overwhelmed

And two arms open wide
You won't ever have to do it by yourself

Stranded with your heart broke down
Reminds me of everything
Wrong with the world right now
Seems nobody takes pride

Maybe I'm old school, behind the times
But I still believe if a man does something
He ought to do it right, so?

When I make love
It's made to last
And when I build trust
It's built to stand fast
Everything I start
I see it to the end
If you let me fix your heart
It's never gonna break again

Whoever had your heart before
Left it in pretty bad shape
If he gave it the time
And the care it needs
Well, he did it too late
It's gonna take a little work
But it's nothing that I can't do
Piece by piece I?ll put it together
Back better than new
And it comes with my
Lifetime guarantee
Just put your heart in my good hands
And, girl, you'll see

When I make love
It's made to last
And when I build trust
It's built to stand fast
Everything I start
I see it to the end

The singer couldn't carry a tune in a bucket
Was on a mission to drown her memory but
I thought no way with all this raucous

But after one round with Jose Cuervo
I caught my boots tapping long with the beat
And after two rounds with Jose Cuervo
That band was sounding pretty darn good to me

Then some stranger asked me to dance
And I revealed to her my two left feet
Said don't get me wrong I'm glad you asked
But tonight's about me and an old memory

Then after three rounds with Jose Cuervo
I let her lead me out on the floor
And after four rounds with Jose Cuervo
I was showing off moves never seen before

Well around five or round six
I forgot what I came to forget
And after round seven or was it eight
I bought a round for the whole damn place

And after nine rounds with Jose Cuervo
They were countin' me out I was about to give in
And after ten rounds with Jose Cuervo
I lost count and started counting again

I can't stop believin' you're everything I need
That's a place my heart just won't go to
Tryin' not to love you

On a dark, flat land she rides
On a pony she named wildfire
With a whirlwind by her side

And the pony she named wildfire
Busted down his stall
And in a blizzard he was lost

It could be a thousand miles
It could be as many days
But when it's sweeping over me
I'm so powerless
It just caries me away
And where it's taking me I never know
The only thing that I can do is hope
It's somewhere I wanna go

Not that January night under that street light
With the snow falling all around
And I'm telling you things that I don't really mean
But they just keep coming out
And I see your unbelieving tears
Your speechless breath hanging in the air
And I watch you throw your ring out in the snow
And there I wait until your memory goes
Somewhere I wanna go

Like that weekend when we just took off
Driving in that April sun 
Anywhere the feeling went
We ended up in Montreal
Couldn't understand a word
But we learned to laugh in French
Where you memory wants to take me I don't know

On a day hot enough to make the Devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign written in red
Rind County Watermelon Festival ahead
Well, I wasn't in a hurry so I slowed down
Took a two lane road to a one horse town
There was a party going on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl

When the band started playing the watermelon queen said
Let me show you something that you ain't never seen
She grabbed me by the arm said come on let's go
She dipped down spun around and doe-see-doed
She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
Crawled across the floor then she jumped back on her feet
She wiggled and she giggled beat all you ever saw
Said this is how you do the watermelon crawl

She said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some but obey the law
If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl

Well if you're ever down in Georgia round about July
If you ain't in a hurry then you oughta stop by

Tracy Byrd,"Before I die
I wanna hit the Mississippi in a boat I've yet to buy
And take it out in the gulf where the water meets the sky
To where nothin' on God's green earth looks dry

And I wanna see
That stadium in New York from a right field seat
Maybe catch a home run when a new all star goes deep
And pretend that's Maris and Mantle pointin' up at me

While I can still breathe
While this old heart still has another beat
It's time I put some livin' to these dreams

Before I die
I'm gonna learn all about how man swallows pride
And find the strength to tell my daddy he was right
And tell mama, I'm sorry 'bout that night

Before I'm called up
I wanna be the kinda man that a woman wants to love
And find a side of me that's a different, kind of tough
And who ain't ashamed to need the man above

While I can still breathe
While this old heart still has another beat
It's time I put some livin' to these dreams

And Lord I know
These are things I should have done a long time ago
And when I close my eyes I wanna feel at ease
And if I left right now, I couldn't rest in peace

While I can still breathe
While this old heart still has another beat

Saddle on my back, my Raybans on
A dusty old cowboy hat, scuffed up jeans

When a turquoise elder ado with horns on the hood
Slowed down to help me out like I hoped someone would

She said, “Hey cowboy, where's your horse?
I said I lost everything but this saddle in my second divorce

And if you don't mind
I'll keep the rest to myself

And dancin' every night for a garter belt full of bills
Just wasn't the Broadway she dreamed about

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new bluejeans

Is a suitcase and trunk

Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what i have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the rising sun

Well, i got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to new orleans
To wear that ball and chain

In your heart is gone
Any touch of sincerity
Any trace of compassion
What hardened your heart?
What turned it to stone?
What made you forget?
You were in love with someone
Your hands don't reach out
Your voice doesn't call me
I know you've stopped listening
Your eyes look straight through me
If nights are like this
I'd rather be alone
Who said you could forget
You were in love with someone?
Tell me what hardened your heart
Tell me what turned it to stone
Tell me what made you forget
You were in love with someone
Was I wrong to forgive
Your indiscretions?
Should I have been more hysterical
Less understanding?

Go on assume the role
But don't say that it's my fault
That you're not in love with someone
Tell me what hardened your heart
Tell me what turned it to stone

From time to time
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart

But I asked before
Your reply was kind and polite

When one's denied

I lose all self control

To give affection to
And from whom you can receive
I guess it's just the draw of the cards

You caught me off guard
Somehow you reached me
Where I thought I had nothing left inside
I've learned my lesson I've been edified

Where the sleeping dogs lie
Not by your side
It feels so lonely
Once again I've left to much to chance

I'm feeling sorry for myself
It's quite a sight
But I have you to thank
For reminding me
We're all alone in this world
And in matters of the heart

I'm already missing you
Although we won't say good byes
Until tomorrow afternoon
Maybe when and if I see you again
We'll see eye to eye

I have no harsh words for you
I have no tears to cry
If the moon were full
I'd be howling inside

As if redemption was in sight
As if the search to live honestly
Is all that anyone needs

The earth's gravity has pulled me down
But now I've reconciled that in this world
Birds and angels get the wings to fly

If you can give it a try
Then I'll reach inside and find and give you

Tracy Chapman,"There was a little boy once upon a time
Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind
For every copper penny and clover he would find
Make a wish for better days the end of hard times
For no more cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

His clothes were always clean
His face was always scrubbed
There was food on the table enough to fill him up
His house was full of life - His house was full of love
But when winter days arrived
There was never money enough to shod his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He grew up to be a worker determined to succeed
He made a life for himself, free from worldly wants or needs
But with nobody to share the life he'd made
No body to keep him warm at night
When he'd go to sleep he'd sleep alone with his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

One night he walked the street looking to the heaven's above
Searching for a shooting star a benevolent God
When a woman passing by brushed his arm
He turned and found love
He then wished for the courage to ask this stranger
Who she was to not have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He thought she'd like the party life and want the finer things
So he promised more than he could buy
And he promised her the sun and moon to not have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He worked day and night his fingers to the bone
Hi worried mind guilty conscience drive him on
He can't give her what she needs
He wants to give her what he thinks she wants
Her sad-eyed face, his empty pockets drive him on and his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He'd struggled all his life to be an honest man
Proud that the dirt on his palms was the soil of the land
But some guys he knew from high school days
Said they had a plan to get rich quick
And they could count him in if he don't have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He thought about their offer accepted it without qualms
Dreamt about the life he'd buy
The comfort that would come without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He decided to tell his wife things would soon turn around
He said the little boy is dead
A man stands with you now without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
Without cold feet

He thought he'd set his clock right, He though he'd read his watch
He left in such a hurry he didn't think to wish for luck

And chains stretched across all the entries to the inside
There's a gate and a fence
And bars to protect from only God knows what lurks outside
Who stole your heart left you with a space
That no one and nothing can fill
Who stole your heart who took it away
Knowing that without it you can't live
Who took away the part so essential to the whole
Left you a hollow body
Skin and bone
What robber what thief who stole your heart and the key

Who stole your heart
The smile from your face
The innocence the light from your eyes
Who stole your heart or did you give it away
And if so then when and why
Who took away the part so essential to the whole
Left you a hollow body
Skin and bone
What robber what thief
Who stole your heart and the key

Now all sentiment is gone
Now you have no trust in no one

Who stole your heart
Did you know but forget the method and moment in time
Was it a trickster using mirrors and sleight of hand
A strong elixir or a potion that you drank
Who hurt your heart
Bruised it in a place
That no one and nothing can heal

You've gone to wizards, princes and magic men
You've gone to witches, the good the bad the indifferent
But still all sentiment is gone
But still you have no trust in no one

If you can tear down the walls
Throw your armor away remove all roadblocks barricades
If you can forget there are bandits and dragons to slay
And don't forget that you defend an empty space
And remember the tin man
Found he had what he thought he lacked
Remember the tin man
Go find your hear and take it back

Who stole your heart
Maybe no one can say
One day you will find it I pray",Remember the Tin Man,1995

So I burned a path to figure out
How to get me some of what you got 

I've got a red hot heart
If the talk is true yours is the same
We should be together
And let our passions fan love's flame, oh yeah

When I looked for you I almost passed you by
You were so cool and calm
I thought my friends had lied
But I thought so much reserve must make you wild inside
It was there and then that I knew 
I had to get some of what you got 

I've got a red hot heart
If the talk is true yours is the same
We should be together
And let our passions fan love's flame, oh yeah

I thought I'd won your heart when I held you hand in mine
I thought it was true love the way we complemented each other
But my right is your wrong
And when you're right then I'm left with nothing
Your light and your heat have all been spent
Leaving only smoke and ashes
Only smoke and ashes baby 

I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby 

I'm crying all the time
Salty stinging tears
And mourning for the past carbon-dated years
But knowing now for certain that you were always right
Because if a breeze could blow you out of my life
It's only smoke and ashes, baby
Only smoke and ashes baby 

I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby 

I was blinded by devotion
My unwavering love for you
So blinded that I thought all your lies were true
But now I know for certain since you've gone away
It was just a smoldering fire I mistook for a blaze
Only smoke and ashes baby 

I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins (your heart's as blue)
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby (only)
Only smoke and ashes baby, baby

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Fortune walk through the door

But the same shuffle once again
Running all the time
Ain't going nowhere

It's a new game with the same rules

Fade to black on the set
And we ain't seen nothing yet

Saddled with bonds
Broken and in disrepair
Forty acres to a forty-ounce
Don't seem fair
The sirens rise and wail
Shadowed by Liberty's torch
As the boats that brought us over
Are slowly sinking off the shore
And we ain't seen nothing yet

This life a crime
A blessing and a curse
Chosen and unwanted
Displaced and usurped
I'd run away

So I'll stand and fight
And hope and pray
That the best is yet to come
And we ain't seen nothing yet

I sit mourning

And any words to say except
Does heaven have enough angels yet?

And I've gone cold

There's no one but you standing

It's all in a day
One day in a life
It's all in the one word

Though you've tried to be kind
It's all in the words
From the lips that once touched mine with a sigh
Goodbye

For you
It's all in your face
The laugh and worry lines
It's all in the one word
You hope will make you young again

Someone speaks the line
It's all in the one word
That stops and steals the time

In groups of three
Fast girls walk slow
On side streets
Sometimes the girls who walk alone

And cruise you hard
Bullies laugh and grin and beat
Your soft skin against
The cold concrete

Make you bleed 
Make you cry

Take turns to push and pull you down
Forget trying to live and be happy
I'll take safe and terror free

Shut off the lights
As the bullets fly

Who didn't bail
And couldn't sell
When color made the grass less green

But fools and innocents believe
That love and faith and truth and beauty
Can make a garden of this human factory

Between a man and his wife

Then a silence that chilled my soul

You can wait 'til morning comes 
You can wait for the new day 
You can wait and lose this heart 
You can wait and soon be sorry 

Now love's the only thing that's free 
We must take it where it's found 
Pretty soon it may be costly

Tracy Chapman,"The life I've always wanted 
I guess I'll never have
I'll be working for somebody else 
Until I'm in my grave 
I'll be dreaming of a live of ease 
And mountains Oh mountains o' things 

To have a big expensive car
Drag my furs on the ground 
And have a maid that I can tell
To bring me anything 
Everyone will look at me with envy and with greed 
I'll revel in their attention 
And mountains Oh mountains o' things 

Sweet lazy life 
Champagne and caviar 
I hope you'll come and find me 
Cause you know who we are 
Those who deserve the best in life 
And know what money's worth 
And those whose sole misfortune 
Was having mountains o' nothing at birth 

Oh they tell me 
There's still time to save my soul 
They tell me 
Renounce all 
Renounce all those material things you gained by 
Exploiting other human beings 

Consume more than you need 
This is the dream
Make you pauper 
Or make you queen 
I won't die lonely 
I'll have it all prearranged 
A grave that's deep and wide enough 
For me and all my mountains o' things

Mostly I feel lonely 
Good good people are
Good people are only 
My stepping stones 
It's gonna take all my mountains o' things 
To surround me 
Keep all my enemies away
Keep my sadness and loneliness at bay

Tracy Chapman,"Why do the babies starve
When there's enough food to feed the world
Why when there are so many of us
Are there people still alone 

Why are the missiles called peace keepers
When they're aimed to kill
Why is a woman still not safe
When she's in her home 

Love is hate
War is peace
No is yes
And we're all free 

But somebody's gonna have to answer
The time is coming soon
Amidst all these questions and contradictions
There are some who seek the truth

And the speechless speak the truth",Why?,2008

Tracy Chapman,"About what's real and true
What can not be proven
What can be assumed
Once when I was younger
In the bloom of youth
I received an honest answer
When a lie would do

[Chorus:]
And now all I do is sit
In my darkened room
And on occasion break my silence
To howl at the moon
To curse every nerve
And neuron in my brain
That won't stop the pain I'm feeling
And let me stop thinking

I used to think
Galileo would agree
That the world was round
And you'd come round to me
But I have looked for you
And you're nowhere in sight
The world must be flat
The Babylonians were right

[Chorus:]

I used to think
Consider gravity
If I placed you on a pedestal
You'd slip and fall for me
But you floated on the air
Far away at light speed
I guess some objects do defy
The laws that we conceive

[Chorus:]

I used to think
It took all my time
Analyzing you
Your mind on my mind
Your name my mantra
Repeated on my lips
That once tried to kiss you
A memory unrepressed

Stop thinking of you
Stop thinking of you",Thinking of You,2008

As majestic bells of boats struck shadows in the sun 
Sayin', it may be the chimes of freedom crashin'

Flashin' for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight 
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night

And then through a cloud-like curtain in a far off corner flashed 
There's a hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly liftin' 
Well, electric light still struck like arrows 
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin' 

Well, tollin' for the searching ones on this speechless, secret trail 
For the lonesome haunted lovers with too personal a tale 
And for each young heart for each channeled soul misplaced inside a jail 
Yeah, we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Well, starry eyed and laughin' I recall when we were caught 
Trapped by an old track of vows for the hands suspended 
As we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look 
Spellbound and swallowed ""Has the tollin' ended?"" 

Yeah, tollin' for the achin' ones whose wounds cannot be nursed 
For the countless, confused, accused, misused strung out ones at worst 
And for every hung out person in the whole wide universe

Tracy Colletto,"Left my job, I was spent, then paid two months rent
Bought an open end ticket, hopped on a train
Through midnight mountains, next stop windy city
And when I saw bison, I felt my heartbeat again

Got lost in great stories from whom I thought plain folks 
And plenty of others I met on the way 
Gave into the strange and the beautiful scenery
My little life fading with each word they’d say

Went camping with strangers and caught a few dollies
Played sugar pack checkers while the city awakes
A detour through Canada, last minute Vegas
Shot cans in the washes with my newfound friends

And up on some mountain so far away
I knew this was where I was supposed to be
Complete peace, peace, peace

A free lift up Route 1 when stranded at Big Sur 
Standing room only to see War and Peace
A wake up to laughter and a chocolate happy cake
A time to reflect over Japanese tea

Before on my way home, a huge double rainbow
Oh, daddy I want you to know I’m okay 
To give up my false sense of security
I’d gladly do it, in a minute again someday

Miller take me and miller grind me,
Scatter by bones on the wild green tide.
Maybe some roving bird will find me,
Over the water we'll ride.

Over the mountain, the mountain comes to me,
I see the mountain and that is all I see.

Some build temples and some find altars,
Some come in tall hats and robes spun fine.
Some in rags, some in gemstone halters,
Some push the pegs back in line.

I see the mountain, the mountain comes to me,
I see the mountain and that is all I see.",The Mountain,2003
Tracy Guns,"He's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Woah, woah
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

Woah, yeah

She treats me any old way she wants to
Just as sure as clouds bring showers
And springtime brings May flowers
And a mountain breeze blows cool

Like a frightened runaway child, I always return
To the games she loves to play
Where she always gets her way
Although it hurts I never seem to learn

And we know its safe inside
But we have slammed it shut before
And locked our hearts outside

When we let go of our pride

Sometimes we put words and walls between us
Lose our heads and gamble with our hearts
There've been trials and tears,doubts and fears
Between us
But when all things pass
It's  love that'll last between us

We'll say some things we regret
But love keeps a workin on us
Aw cause we ain't perfect yet

Well there've been women and lovers
Lots of miles in between
There've been barrooms,and bedrooms
And lots of nights with Jim Beam
Been tequila sunrises, times which I wish I'd never seen

On Bible readin' gospel songs
Church doors opened up you'd see my face
Sundays twice, Weds too, I'd take my seat on the front row pew,
Singing Rock of Ages and Amazing Grace

Preacher said heavens the place to go
With pearly gates and streets of gold
I guess for the preacher that's alright
But I hope heavens another story
 With a good ole boy bound for glory
A little bit like of Texas on a Saturday night

With a 5 pc band,
Cowboy boots,and bluejeans are  part of the master plan
And I hope Hanks on the jukebox, Bob Wills has a fiddle in his hand
And I hope heaven has a honky tonk with a 5 piece band

I hope those hardwood floors are just like glass
The girls I ask want to dance
And each and every waitress is divine
I hope that mean old bouncers got a big halo
Those neon lights will always glow

And I never had you hold me that tight
And I never saw you dance with your feet off the ground

Tracy Lawrence,"There's a little house I drive by everyday going into town
And it just kills me to see how he's let it run down
When I built it, to hear you tell it
I'd built you a mansion on a hill
and even now that's where part of me still lives

Tracy Lawrence,"It was where my mama sat on that old swing with her crochet
It was where granddaddy taught me how to cuss and how to pray
It was where we made our own ice cream those sultry summer nights
Where the bulldog had her puppies, and us brothers had our fights

There were many nights I'd sit right there and look out at the stars
To the sound of a distant whippoorwill or the hum of a passing car
It was where I first got up the nerve to steal me my first kiss
And it was where I learned to play guitar and pray I had the gift

If the world had a front porch like we did back then
We'd still have our problems but we'd all be friends
Treating your neighbor like he's your next of kin
Wouldn't be gone with the wind
If the world had a front porch, like we did back then

Purple hulls and pintos, I've shelled more than my share
As lightening bugs and crickets danced in the evening air
And like a beacon that old yellow bulb, it always led me home
Somehow mama always knew just when to leave it on

If the world had a front porch like we did back then
We'd still have our problems but we'd all be friends

I went crashing at the speed of a fool

She was serving all night coffee
At a San Antonio Cafe
She was headed nowhere
I was headed her way
With a trusting soul and a naive heart
There was nothing I could do
So I went crashing , at the speed of a fool

Or bound for letting go

Slipping 'cross the truck seat trying to make a pass

And played among the trees

Is the silence of the men
Who will never pass this way again

It never shown more beautiful
As how it looks today
We never miss the things we love 
Til they go away
But I have heard the bugler's call
And it's time for me to leave
For there comes a day
When a man must say
I will die for what I believe

I have often thrown pennies
In that old wishing well
And if I had a quarter
I would wish me a spell
I would kneel and pray
That here I'd stay
Forever, amen
But I'll never pass this way
No, I'll never pass this way
No, I'll never pass this way

'Cause her heart doesn't notice when it's breaking mine again
Still I sit here like a fool and watch the world go round
Till she comes back to her old stompin' grounds

She could find her someone else to hold
She could even wake up in his arms
But when it's time to come in from the cold
She always ends up right here in my heart
Her old stompin' grounds

She thinks I don't hurt, no she doesn't have a clue
When we said it was over, she thought we were through
When it all falls to pieces in the new world that she's found
She comes back to her old stompin' grounds

With some dime store candy that I never bought

They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh there's no way around it

He bought me my first ball and glove
Even taught me how to drive his old truck
Circling that ol' town square
He spoke of life with a slow southern drawl
I never heard him cause I knew it all
But I sure listened when I got the call
That he was no longer there

Question number one - Does he still kiss you goodnight?
Number two was if he does, does he still close his eyes?
Three - Does he still call you just to hear you're voice?
Four - Would he be home right now, if he had a choice?

Five's a little tricky, do you think he's being true?

Six said do you ever cry when you're all by yourself?

I got people that I love
Blue skies above
And a rainbow promise made some time ago
I've got children still to raise
Songs to sing in praise
For the gift of light and love we all know
There's all of this and more I'm thankful for
Dear Lord

The mark we make we leave behind
If only in the hearts and minds
Of those we touched

It dealt me a hard hand to play
I felt betrayed and forsaken

I'm done

I spent my last night in that prison
Where anger and pride were the bars
Hey, I'm hear to tell ya I'm making peace with the past
And I'm not ashamed of my scars

But I'm done

I'm done harboring grudges and nursing old wounds
Done clinging to grudges and singing the blues
I'm done pointing fingers at everyone else
I'm taking a long, hard look at myself
A new day has begun
And I'm done

I called up somebody who'd hurt me
We finally settled that score
I had a right to be bitter revenge would've been sweet
But forgiveness is what ended that war

I'm starting to see the big picture
These days, I'm getting high off of that
No more killing my pain with a three day binge

Done clinging to grudges and singing the blues

Tracy Lawrence,"He was begging at the mini mart
Who'd have guessed he had a purple heart
Scars underneath his bearded chin
I bet you don't remember him

'Cause you were running twenty minutes late
And he was only getting in your way
But when you brushed by that wounded soul last Thursday afternoon
You met somebody who would die for you

The phone rang at eight last night
Who'd call at such a crazy time
Getting kids into bath and bed
""I can't talk"" is about all you said

All he wanted was a Saturday
Morning conversation down at Baker's cafe
You weren't thinking when you told your dad
""Try back in a week or two""
But you hurt somebody who would die for you

Somebody who cares so much
They'd gladly give it all up
If that's what they had to do
It runs deeper than flesh and blood
Heaven knows no greater love
Than the sacrifice they make to see you through
Somebody who would die for you

Just another Colorado day
Morning practice for a high school play
From out of nowhere, the bullets came fast
They shattered more than the library glass

They asked her if she believed in Your name
And she didn't even hesitate
God, I can't help but wondering if I'd been in her shoes
Would I be somebody who would die for You

Somebody who cared so much
They'd gladly give it all up
If it's what they had to do
It runs deeper than flesh and blood
Heaven knows no greater love

Tracy Lawrence,"Every now and then,
Soft as breath upon my skin,
I feel you come back again.

And it's like you haven't been,
Gone a moment from my side.
Like the tears were never cried,
Like the hands of time are holding you and me.

And with all my heart I'm sure,
We're closer than we ever were.
I don't have to hear or see,
I've got all the proof I need.
There are more than angels watching over me.
I believe, oh I believe.

Now when you die your life goes on,
It doesn't end here when you're gone.
Every soul is filled with light,
It never ends and if I'm right.
Our love can even reach across eternity,
I believe, oh I believe.

Forever, you're a part of me.
Forever, in the heart of me.
I will hold you even longer if I can.
Oh the people who don't see the most,
See that I believe in ghosts.
And if that makes me crazy, then I am
'Cause I believe

Oh, I believe
There are more than angels watching over me.
I believe, oh I believe.

Every now and then,
Soft as breath upon my skin,
I feel you come back again.
And I believe.

Tracy Lawrence,"I heard you saw her last night
At that dive down in Jamestown
I haven't seen her since the 4th of July
Did you get a chance to talk, did she mention me at all?
Was she there alone or with some other guy?

Well, I'm dying to know 
But I'm scared of the truth
So before you say a word
Consider what this heart's been through

And lie, don't tell me that she looks amazing
Just lie, if she's with someone else I just can't take it
Tell me she looks sad and lonely
Tell me she's been missing me like crazy
Yeah, just look me in the eye and lie

Was she over by the jukebox?
Playing songs we used to dance to?
Staring at the door, sipping makers on the rocks
Did she ask you where I've been?
Was she hoping I'd walk in?
Just take her by the hand
And pick up right where we left off

Well, I know she's moving on and it's killing me to see
And the words you want to say are strong enough to be the death of me

So lie, don't tell me that she looks amazing
Just lie, if she's with someone else I just can't take it
Tell me she looks sad and lonely
Tell me she's been missing me like crazy
Yeah, just look me in the eye and lie

'Cause I can't throw away the dreams we've shared
I've tried reaching out, but she don't care
It's pretty clear that I ain't ready to let go

So lie, don't tell me that she looked amazing
Just lie, if she's with someone else
Then lie, don't tell me that she looks amazing

Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, cause still don't nothing move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thing
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full [echoes]

And I’m not to sure why I thought of you now
Time has a way of numbing your touch
But as I recall when you left me just how much it
Hurt me to stand there, just watching you leave

I couldn’t believe it was true
And for moments we shared
And for souls that were bared
I’ve never loved anyone more

But like I said, I don’t think of you much
There’s someone beside me, who helps me forget
And he showed me how not to think of you now
But when I remember you, I won’t regret
That we didn’t hold on to the dreams that we shared

The dreams that were there to believe in
And for all of the pain, I will love you again
I never loved anyone more

And for moment we shared and the souls that we bared
I‘ve never loved anyone more

",I Never Loved Anyone More,2007

The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk together
And I still miss someone

I went out on a party
To have a little fun
But I found the darkest corner
'Cause I still miss someone

But I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if he's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

I never got over

",I Still Miss Someone,2007

I know that I should have some fun and paint the town

Flirtin' with the girls with all his charms
I still love him so and, honey don’t you know
I’d welcome him right back here in my arms

There must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new

Tracy Nelson,"Cain slew Abel, Seth knew not why
For if the children of Israel suppose to multiply
Why must any of the children die

Man means nothing he means less to me
Than the lowliest cactus flower or the humblest yucca tree
He chases round this desert 'cause he thinks that's where I'll be

I recoil in horror from the foulness of thee
From the squalor and the filth and the misery
How we laugh up here in Heaven, prayers you offer me
That's why I love mankind
The Christians and the Jews were having a jamboree
The Buddhists and the Hindus joined on satellite TV
They picked their four greatest priests
And they began to speak
They said Lord the plague is on the world
Lord no man is free
The temples that we built to you have tumbled into the sea
Lord, if you won't take care of us
Won't you please please let us be
And the Lord said
And the Lord said
I burn down your cities, how blind you must be

As I go walk about

Hey, boss!
When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide?

Reggie who?
Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored

Hey, boss!
Oh, what is it?
We got a bone to pick with you
There's no food, no water
Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no
stinkin' entrees!

Oh, you and your petty complaints. You don't know what real hunger is. 
Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being

I had that once. It was worms
No, no, no... it's like an itch... deep, persistent, profound
That's it-- worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is
hunker down and scoot
Thanks for the tip. Ingrates! If it weren't for me you'd be beating off
buzzards for your next bite! 

Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?
It doesn't matter if it's fresh
I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in

Are you blaming me?
Oh no, it's the lionesses
You are so adored
Oh, you are so adored

That's more like it
But what I'd give for one more hit
Of wildebeest kielbasa
Or maybe hornbill on the spit...

Oh, how I miss Mufasa
Mufasa?! Mufasa?! How dare you! I told you never to mention that name! 
Note taken. I shall never mention ""M-m-m"" again
Even in death, his shadow looms over me
There he is!
No! There he is!
And there!

Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting
headaches! 

I am perfectly fine!
I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered
I am reviled
I'm idolized
I am despised
I'm keeping calm
I'm going wild!

I tell myself I'm fine
Yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am, no you're not
I tell myself I'm fine

No you're not, yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am
No you're not
Yes, no, yes, no, who am I talking to...?

Oh, pull yourself together, Sire!
Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu...?
Yes, Sire?
Nobody loved me, there's the rub, not even as a cub
What did my brother have that I don't have?

Do you want the short list or the long?
Whatever!
Well, he had adoring subjects... a loving family... a devoted queen... 
That's it! I need a queen!
A what?
A queen, man! A queen! Without a queen, what am I? A dead end, no line, no
descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will
be mine! Immortality will be mine!

Scar
Ah, Nala... Your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My how you've
grown

Scar, you have got to do something. We're being forced to overhunt
She's got those assets feminine
You're the king. Control the hyenas
I have to make her mine
You're destroying the Pridelands
Nobility in every gene
If we don't stop now.. Don't you see...
She has to be my queen
...there's still a chance for things to be all right again... 
Come, sweet Nala
It's written in the stars

What are you doing? Are you listening to me?
We'll create a host of little Scars
What are you talking about?
Tell me I'm adored
Get away from me
Tell me I'm adored
Oh, Nala... you know how I loathe violence... One way or another, you will
be mine

Never, Scar. Never!
You belong to me
You all belong to me",The Madness of King Scar,1997

Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler ""Woo woo woo""

I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things,

For the childhood I've never known

Beyond what I could say, what love can do

Thought he had it under control
In the end he found himself begging for God's mercy
In the end he found he'd lost his soul

There is victory ahead for those who hear and listen
Who trust in God in spite of great despair
For Jesus is our shield and our great high tower
And he promised to deliver us with prayer

Many pieces be separated, when slugs pop out
Some niggas chase paper, some niggas try it
Some niggas want a piece, some want the pie
Some niggas wanna skeet, me I want a lot
I'm the same cat, crossed over by my change black

If you real, won't you go and throw your hood up

Throw your hood up, everybody get crunked up
Parking lot we dropped up, on buttons we cocked up
Creased out and we rocked, for hatas we clocked up
If your bopper mouth open, fa sho they get stopped up
Guerilla Maab who we be, me, Z-Ro and Dougie D
Representing for the S.U.C., with P.O.K to the E
Why we so fly, but gangstally motivated
From corners we educated, so hatas get confiscated
Rated by these pit bulls, and these untamed guerillas
Mic wreckers and head bustas, we owe ya then we gon get ya
So niggas better get the picture, if not then you long gone
Throw your motherfucking set up, 'fore you get your chest gone

Made to the back, it ain't time no for the champ 'plexing
I grab for the gut, tell everybody be dropping flat
And ducking from the S.L.A.B.er, wood grain when I grab a
Drop it trunk knocker, on choppas looking for boppers
And wrecking the parking lot, at every club
Sideways tripping and tipping, when I'm on Dubs
Put it up for the west and the west, and I represent
With that room, we hiding behind tint

If you real, won't you go and throw your hood up
And if you skurred, all you bitches gotta raise up
Then off to the South, the streets would of made us

If you real, won't you go and throw your hood up
And if you skurred, all you bitches gotta raise up

I'm a southsider, Houston Texan to be exact
Down in the dirty dirty, Dougie representing that
Look I'm a hood nigga from hood callers, and hood blocks
Ducking hood shots, and bob and weaving the hood spots
Niggas try to hate me, and violate me and prosecute me
Never knew nothing to me, cause I'm too thoed for them rookies
Look the streets made me, streets love me and streets hate me
So the streets pay me, motherfucker it's all gravy
Want it all baby, never gon let the money change me
Only thing that may change, the way I just done roll updated
Got a large family, it's a bunch of us need to be happy
Them hood daddies, on the grind and making me happy
Pimping pens and graphics, this ain't no lolly gagging and capping
I mask the track and trae po' codeine, and Jay Ton back me
Nigga holla at me, motherfucker you know the deal
We south side for life, and nigga that's for real

If you real, won't you go and throw your hood up
And if you skurred, all you bitches gotta raise up

Trae,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw 

[Chorus]",Oh No,2004
Trae,"[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
My nigga Redd been assisting me with holdin' my head
But I can't focus cause so many niggas in the street owe me some bread
And if you fuckin' with my mind lately, how could it be greed?
If all I want is just to touch whatevers mine baby
My forty-acres, and my new mansion, and my yacht
Might take a little time for me to see bigger living plus or not
But I want stop until I'm touchin' my figures, you better move(bitch)
Cause I be bustin' my nigga nobody knows all the trouble I been through
Been so broke and embarrassed couldn't afford a tooth brush fool
If it wasn't for my nigga Sherman Miller, me and great 'O
Offered me food when I was hungry, plus a place to lay low
Runnin' up and down Houston slangin' dimes and nickles
Performing for my hood niggas spittin' rhymes and riddles
Forever stayin' on our grind because of the shine it give us
And fuck jail, we didn't care how much time they give us

Everyday it's like I can't maintain
But still I feel I'm in it for the same thing
All I ever wanted is just to get my change
Living strength is my only type of mind frame

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
It's in my blood, it's in my body, it's in my soul
Gettin' paper been so important since I've been on my own
Don't nobody love me in this cold world
Fuck these bitches 'cause the hatred I got for my old girl
Is a motherfucker I ain't tryna' hear it, I ain't tryna' know ya
Unless you be a hustler tryna' come up on some mo' bucks
I'm like a male-nun with a rail gun
I'm so focused on my mail son I need a bail bond
Fuck you bitches, I love my riches go get it forward march
Cannibal in these killing fields tired of hangin' on this cross
Witness the J.Prince runnin' the south
Rap-A-Lot mafia like wide receivers cause we all be runnin' our route
I'm goin' long, it ain't no mercy for the weak better get strong
Cause it be crucializing everything that be goin' on try to maintain
Cause if you don't they pop you, drop you, and leave you slain mayne
Win it just to stay in the game (mayne)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Association bring about stimulation that's what I witness
Kickin' it with the jealous got me beggin' for forgiveness
This record label presidential think they live like me
Think they could jump in this rap game and survive like me
They living fantasies nigga tryna hold onto my name
But they can't sell records without me that's a goddamn shame
Hoe nigga get ya roll up, every time I flex you cats in check
Cause you can't lift it with you're on muscle, weak bitch!
Every time I speak bitch niggas steadily be plottin'
On removing me from my throne to throw me in the fuckin' prison
But it's all good I can take it cause I dish shit out
But me you've seen I'm havin' things in my dreams I can't get it out
God blessed the child that can double his fetti
Duckin' and dodgin' trouble cops and trouble times come get me
I'm tryna get a big ass piece so leave me alone
And live a life where I can leave both of my pistols at home

Damn, I hope this state of mind'll never leave again
I wanna see my nigga Screw get to breathe again
And wanna see Dinky and my nigga Donny break free again
On the block, never thinkin 'bout Plix
Twenty-fo' years of mine I've been blitzed
Dawg, don't you get it twisted
Cause 19 years of those have been stress
Never thought that I'd see this time
And it ain't no way that I'ma let it get by
Ain't no lie, deep down inside
Just to hold it close it wanna make me cry
No mo' drama, likin no laws
No mo' jail, no more collect calls
No mo' hate from these roach-ass niggaz
and my dawgs on the block'll ball 'til we fall
Plus Peewee woulda never got locked
Plus Greedo woulda never got shot
Plus Mello woulda still been here
With a white Kangol about to body rock the pen
Misty, then the rest of the click like
Full speed then runnin without a red light
Whole life I'll be one of a kind
Go deep in the wind I promise I got my head right
And I hate it's gon' be like this
I wonder why everything come to me like this
And if only fo' one night I finally get my smile
Lord, I don't wanna leave like this

[Z-Ro]
It'll be nice to have Emo and Jody and LL back
My nigga Best and his big brother E. Roy Love
Dem people ain't never comin back
But if only for one night
My nigga could make a decision he shoulda made
Make it where the situation turned out another way
And ain't a day go by
I don't wish I didn't have to miss my momma
This ain't livin my nigga this just drama
If only for the night when the storm'll live calmer
Cause seem like they wanna give a lifetime sentence
to a nigga with a pistol and a pound of marijuana
Wish it was legal to be in public wit'cha eyes red
I've seen a lot of B.I. cases go fed
Got pulled over, no seatbelt on the shoulder
Let to a 70 year stand and coda
If only for the dead nigga
Didn't have to wait to make a safe walk to the sto'
Just to get his niggaz and a six-pack {?}
But there never been a cakewalk to the sto'
Fuck around and see the head concussion
If the hood decide you gotta fake walk to the sto'
They fully fronted to everybody with animosity
Bitches'll take 'em 'fore they walk to the sto'
A nigga from the Southside, and a nigga from the Northside
And a nigga from the Eastside
Could all get along with each other, like we knew each other mother
No reason to wanna take our own lives
By losin a son, losin a daughter, losin a child
I'm battered by life, too rude to smile
I liked it better when I used to smile

You are 'cause you the real ice cream man and my favorite rap group is T.R.U. 
'Cause I'm true 2 da game, aha
I'm true 2 da game too son. You did your homework?
You got any studying to do? 

Yea dad. Studying this just how to be a true playa
Wanna ask me some questions? 

Yea son. Let me see this
Oh they didn't have questions like this when I grew up son
But I guess whatever 

It takes to make you be a man son. I'm all for it
Son, the first question is, if you rap about another 

Rapper on a record, what are you? 

You a sucka! 

Aha, you got that right son. Next question
If you hate another for being successful, what are you? 

You mean like, you rollin' in Benzes, they be like P.H.ing you 
The pigs be pulling you over cause you 

Be black and you be sittin' on triple gold
Like the niggas in the ghetto be hatin' on you cause you made it out? 

Yea son, what is that, what you call that? 
Dad, that only be two words. PLAYA HATA 

Huh, you got that right son. Look like you gonna past this test
But I got one more question for you
Son, if any man depends on another man and can't think on his own
Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

Family, you know what I mean son
I mean, you were put in this world by yourself
You're supposed to depend on you 

And nobody else. I mean son
When a man can't function on his own and put his problems on another man
son, what type of man is that? What do you call that type of person? 

Dad, can I curse? 
Son, if you have to express yourself. Tell me, what type of man is that? 
That a punk ass bitch 

Hehehe, damn little P, you bout it, bout it, just like your daddy
Oh wait, one more question before I leave though 

What you want to be when you grow up? 
I want to be a G like you. A No Limit Soldier for life

Trae,"Man fuck y'all

Nigga fuck all y'all
Fuck all these niggas, and fuck all these hoes
If I needed a ride, I called on niggas
If I wanted some ass, I called on hoes
But not no mo' though, I get around in a tinted out fo' do'
And ain't got no mix to motion, is a for sho' thang
Don't fuck with Ro hoe, I dun' lost all of my love
Razor blade to the wrist, damn near lost all of my blood
This is to all my thugs, fuck y'all niggas
Y'all just come around, 'cause I got them drugs
When all my drugs gone, nigga all my thugs gone
And I'm scared to eat, the last of the bread and the butter
Because after that, all the god damn bud gone
I'm a mo'fucking struggler, I wish I was a bubbler
Mama said that, it would it be days like this
But not a life like this, so I take a knife like this and slice like this
Take life like this, fuck around and I take my own life like this
Or click me a bitch nigga, in the windpipe like this
That's right bitch, I'm a ign'ant son of a bitch
And I do click quick, it might be halves and zones
To break a nigga bones, but never be stones and sticks
I ain't the shit bitch, I'm the motherfucking commode
And fuck everybody that ain't Z-Ro, that's on my soul
Finally, I found me

Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me
Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me

I used to be a cool cat
Now a victim of the blues cat
I got tired of motherfuckers, taking a nigga for granted
All I got is my mind, I can't lose that
I'ma use that, even though a nigga mind gone
It ain't lost, 'cause I know where it's at
Just on another level than boys, around here
For the paper stack, 'cause I'ma go where it's at
I sound like a (big nigga), but I'm a (lil' nigga)
Damn though, some of y'all try to bogart
Piss a nigga off and get that ass caught, late night
On the backstreets, hollin' oh Lord
It ain't no mercy, I still wanna see you bleed
Because, I don't give a damn no more
Niggaz see 3D-2, and but hollin' out fuck you hoes
Finally, I found me

It's still Guerilla Maab, and ain't a damn thang changed
I just peeped the game, and these niggas be shife
Over the years, I seen a lot of niggas turn fake
Riding thick on the cool, and then I have to erase
You see me and the Maab, done learned without a thang
Man most of these niggas, be around for the fame
It ain't no more love, therefore if you ain't kin
And if you get up in mine, you gon' meet your end
I'm one of a kind, I think you better check yourself
And it don't mean a damn thang, if I shake your hand
If I ain't too enthused, and I got on a mean mask
You better stay on note, 'cause I'll beat your ass
It's Guerilla Maab this, and Guerilla Maab that
I think you better get back, and shut the fuck up
For you straight step off, and get fucked up
Nigga Trey and Dougie D and Z-Ro, take nuts
So don't come around now bitch
When you showed everybody, all kinds of love
And I ain't got none left, didn't nobody wanna care
How we thug, that's why I'm fin to be alone till I meet my death
Everybody we was cool with, fuck you too
And everybody who was hating us, fuck you too
It just took a little time, for me to find myself
And that's why we getting rich off ourself

Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me
Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me

Better watch your back, and identify yourself
Nigga one mo' step, and I'ma cock back every weapon
I pack, fuck around and fry yourself
A punk ass patty melt, no remorses gon' be felt
When I be dealing, with a less than G individual
Nothing but a AK shot, is gon' be felt
I never did trust no bitch, and I don't trust no nigga
Fuck all of my associates, but in a life of a life
This motherfucker like me, you get what you suppose to get
Pussy in the middle of the fo'head, I wanna see my foes dead
And I smoke, one of these old busted up ass hoes
Old trailer trash ass hoes, I live life one deep
And I don't speak to the non-kin no mo', nigga they know
Coming around my neck of the woods, is a no-no
'Cause I got a .44, lay low please
Everytime I open my mouth, mo'fuckers would never believe
That's why a nigga trip a lil' bit, with a razor blade
And the reason, I wear long sleeves
Y'all can't help me, I don't want your help
I just want some, leave me alone
I don't wanna go to the club, I'm cool in the streets
Bitch, just leave me to roam
Don't call my cell phone, give folk don't give a damn
If I get one in my dome, fuck you dealing
Y'all don't understand my zone, finally I found me

Drop it trunk knocker, on choppas looking for boppers

And everyday a nigga repping, and riding for Screw
I was keeping it in my chest, now I'm getting it out
I know you spectators in the game, better close your mouth
I got a lot of my time invested, up in this game
It's S.U.C. till I'm dead, ain't no need to explain
I'm in the Maab with guerillas, and we coming in packs
The only friends we got deep, and coming with black gats
So niggaz'd back back, I'm a man dude with a attitude
And I'm too quick to click, Lil' Trae is a damn fool
In my zone leave me alone, I ain't trying to be fucked with
Everything that I got, is everything that I want to roll with
Me and me and myself, you niggaz bad for my health
Now I'm pumped up like Superman, with a uppercut to be felt
I ain't playing with what I'm saying, you cats better start praying
For Deebo commits to spraying, and everybody be staying

Why, these fellas talking down
Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make somebody slide, beware

Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make these bustsas hot, beware

I'm chilling in my 1's, chopping game on my celly
My iced out cross, hanging down to my belly
Got your lil mama, butt naked shake her jelly
I'ma put her on a tape, and play it back on the telly
Boys hate to love the street show, when we showing up
I give me back the same middle finger, they be throwing up
They can't afford the pints, by the case that we po'ing up
Young in the game, it's time to start growing up
Get you some hustle, get you some grind
Show me some muscle, show me some shine
Fuck trying to crime, off another nigga name
It's just a matter of time, 'fore I run you out the game
Because I can't believe the nerve, of these hoes
Trying to use my nigga Pimp name, for benefit shows
Fin to start kicking in do's, with the macks
Trying to let that shit pass, now I'm coming for your ass fool

It's the return of the mad rapper, industry nigga subtracter
That be greed up in the fists, that be clinched like a black panther
I'm sick and tired of you fakers, that try to twist up the game
So now you gotta see me, like the 84's that I swang
My glock I cock and I aim, my name you fin to respect it
You let me off in your world, then I swear to God I'ma wreck it
You must of thought I forgot about you, acting sue a crowd'll watch you
I gotta get that up out you, your people gon be without you
On top of that, niggaz be using my homie name
Saying the Screwed Up Click, so they can get them a little change
Hopping from dick to dick, and I ain't even gon say no name
I feel like I want to click, so now you gon feel my pain
I'm Trae, and I ain't bar nan nigga in this drama
Or mama, I weave and I swang sending em through a trauma
They tell me to let em make it, but really I ain't the one
Them bitches did it, so now they gotta see me when I come

Where the real niggaz at, cause I can't find none
Everybody be talking shit, when they be packing they guns
Quick to shoot a motherfucker, to keep they face from sweating
But when the laws come to bang one, snitching and telling
Be these ol' buster ass niggaz, killing all in they music
Showing a four pound around town, but never gon use it
I'm registered by my gangsta, you barely touching me G
Now feel you got the edasity, to come and see me
Fuck it whoever want to get some, can come and get dropped
I'm a grown man I don't get people sued, I get people shot
If you ain't shot, I wonder who gon be standing behind the trigga
Z-Ro the Crooked, cause ain't no love for none of these niggaz
Straight Profit to Presidential, trying to scandalize my name
They can't sell records without me, that's a god damn shame
I ain't to blame, why these niggaz ain't selling and losing weight
But I'm to blame, when I go off and get the bruising they face

I'm writing, writing a letter to my loved ones

[Trae]
Dear Dinkie, more it what happened everytime I think about you
It's like the world been on my shoulders, everyday I been without you
My way of living ain't healthy, but I'm trying to be a man
I swear to God I'm fin to lose my cool, and people don't understand
Cause they be coming at me with drama, not knowing I'm going through it
I've been running from suicide, but they pushing me to do it
My nigga I'm telling you, I be needing you by my side
But when I see Danny Boo face, I be knowing I gotta ride
Deep inside it's tearing me up, since I'm praying it'll be ok
I mash the gas a hundred percent, till we together one day
You got a nephew on the way, I forgot to tell you the news
That mean just one more part of us, that'll give them hoes the blues
Our baby brother Jay'Ton, been doing his thang
And since he the youngest, you know mama won't hesitate to complain
And it's the same old thang, one day I'm coming to get you
As long as I'm in these streets, I promise they'll never forget you

[Hook - 2x]
[Trae]
What's happening baby girl, it's been a long time
You know I'ma rep you forever, with every word coming out this hard time
Lori, I'm never gon forget the day that you died
I couldn't cry, but all the pain inside was killing my pride
I had to be strong, for the sake of Dinkie in his cell
I knew he would lose it, missing you is what put him through hell
Your unborn child, didn't even get to see the day
I never understood why, the Lord'll let em come take you away
And I turned out how you wanted me to be, somebody special
Made the Lord bless you, now you don't have to deal with this pressure
On earth I really miss you, reminiscing bout how we use to be
I was your brother, you was my sister for L-I-F-E
My mission ain't over, till the day that I get the nigga that did it
Whether living or dead, somebody he close to fin to feel it
And I mean it, cause he took one of my loved ones
Now I'm losing focus, writing a letter to my loved one

[Hook - 2x]
[Trae]
Brenda what happened, Donnie we gotta keep the Lord first
The paining is burst, got me visualizing us living life in the worst
Way, I try to smile but it be hard sometimes
Knowing that you facing murder, due to the fact these niggas be out of line
I can't explain life, but still I understand
Everything happened for a reason, just part of becoming a man
And I can't tell you how I feel, when I heard that your mama passed
Knowing the last time you seen her, was in visitation through glass
Lord knows keyendation, ain't need to be in your life
So I'ma mash it to the fullest, and make sure they iight
And every night I'm on my knees, to ask the Lord to help you out
Inside my mind without a doubt, I know he bout to let you out
But don't you lose faith, cause faith is important at this time
And I'm your dog to the end, no matter what I'ma be around
South Klique forever, through the sunny and rainy weather
I love you my nigga, that's the reason I'm writing this letter

I'm missing you, I'm mis-sing you",A Letter,2003
Trae,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

Trae,"[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
My nigga Redd been assisting me with holdin' my head
But I can't focus cause so many niggas in the street owe me some bread
And if you fuckin' with my mind lately, how could it be greed?
If all I want is just to touch whatevers mine baby
My forty-acres, and my new mansion, and my yacht
Might take a little time for me to see bigger living plus or not
But I want stop until I'm touchin' my figures, you better move(bitch)
Cause I be bustin' my nigga nobody knows all the trouble I been through
Been so broke and embarrassed couldn't afford a tooth brush fool
If it wasn't for my nigga Sherman Miller, me and great 'O
Offered me food when I was hungry, plus a place to lay low
Runnin' up and down Houston slangin' dimes and nickles
Performing for my hood niggas spittin' rhymes and riddles
Forever stayin' on our grind because of the shine it give us
And fuck jail, we didn't care how much time they give us

Is a motherfucker I ain't tryna' hear it, I ain't tryna' know ya
Unless you be a hustler tryna' come up on some mo' bucks
I'm like a male-nun with a rail gun
I'm so focused on my mail son I need a bail bond
Fuck you bitches, I love my riches go get it forward march
Cannibal in these killing fields tired of hangin' on this cross
Witness the J.Prince runnin' the south
Rap-A-Lot mafia like wide receivers cause we all be runnin' our route
I'm goin' long, it ain't no mercy for the weak better get strong
Cause it be crucializing everything that be goin' on try to maintain
Cause if you don't they pop you, drop you, and leave you slain mayne
Win it just to stay in the game (mayne)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Association bring about stimulation that's what I witness
Kickin' it with the jealous got me beggin' for forgiveness
This record label presidential think they live like me
Think they could jump in this rap game and survive like me
They living fantasies nigga tryna hold onto my name
But they can't sell records without me that's a goddamn shame
Hoe nigga get ya roll up, every time I flex you cats in check
Cause you can't lift it with you're on muscle, weak bitch!
Every time I speak bitch niggas steadily be plottin'
On removing me from my throne to throw me in the fuckin' prison
But it's all good I can take it cause I dish shit out
But me you've seen I'm havin' things in my dreams I can't get it out
God blessed the child that can double his fetti
Duckin' and dodgin' trouble cops and trouble times come get me
I'm tryna get a big ass piece so leave me alone
And live a life where I can leave both of my pistols at home

[Hook :x 2]
In the ghetto, I'm living in a ghetto world
In the ghetto (in the ghetto), it's a struggle but I gotta maintain

[Trae]
Welcome to the ghetto, where forever be the same
Hard times, got my people unable to maintain
Everytime I look around, it's somebody doing bad
That'll put you in the grave, for som'ing they never had

Everyday in the hood, it be the same thang
Poverty running my people, so they love pain
And I don't know if it's wrong, but still I know it ain't right
I seen a lot of people die, in the street life

The other day it hit my heart, when I watch the news
A lil' girl got killed, while she was 'sleep in her room
And she ain't deserve to die, cause that's a kid dog
Them niggaz took the life, that she ain't get to live at all

Sometimes I want to help the ghetto, but it ain't gon do a thang
'Cause I know that they ignant, and that's a god damn shame
It's an everyday task, trying to live a good life
Inside of the ghetto, where everybody be shife

[Hook: x 2]

[Yung Redd]
Welcome to the South, niggaz ain't sleep at all
Everybody out on the block, stay ducking them laws
A couple niggaz on parole, hustling by the sto'
I'm telling that ain't the way to go, play your role

But you don't hear me though, this what I'm living fo'
Hustle till I get mine, grind cause I need mo'
Shots release, too late for you to scream peace
This how it is in the street, leaving is obsolete

And still I maintain, seeing the same thang
Sometime I scream, my brain just looking for a change
But day in and day out, I move in and move out
Keep my bidness discrete, I'm on a paper route

I wasn't broke for nothing, still I was learning some'ing
If you ain't been through nothing, then you ain't seen nothing
This how it really is, around my way
Where anybody can get it, anytime of the day

[Lil Boss]
I analyze the block, babies are running round with glocks
Dope in they socks, can't skip hot so fuck the cops
Moving from crumbs to bricks, nigga these slums are thick
I try to tell my lil' niggaz, but they think they slick

These white folks don't play, they gon hot your way
They try to give you twenty years, just for living the wrong way
And who's to say now-a-day, right from wrong
They ain't living how we live, so they can't get in my zone

We get chased home for stones, and laws want to break our bones
In places in and out a high cell, to roam
And that's prolly the reason, we going crazy
Pissed at poverty, cause the system trying to fade me

Lately, I've been trying to stay out of trouble
But it's hard to stop from copping, the sack and flipping the double
Don't catch the wrong route, when you on that Metro
There's a sign in front of the hood, that says Welcome To the Ghetto

[Hook: x 2]

[Spice 1]
I wonder, if heaven got a ghetto
But be	-burning down the be	-block, I put the petal to the medal
Running with my cousins in Texas, Lil' Cross and Big Money
My nigga Trae and Lil' Joe, nigga all action

In the ghetto, I've been riding through the hood for years
And ain't a damn thang changed, mama still shedding tears
Niggaz fresh out the Penn, some niggaz just going in
Some niggaz gon run and stutter, turning they self in

Never seen a black man, flying dope on a plane
But they lock us up for it, shackle us with chains
Welcome to the ghetto, ghetto starts and mob cars
With bullet holes in it, niggaz shot up and scarred

But still living, driven by the game itself
To stay alive in these cold streets, mashing for wealth
Up in this ghetto, O.G.'s P's and see's
Thugs, pimps, playas hit the 6-4's or 3's

Stop all that damn begging, and go on get your own kid
You know you wrong dog, just cause I'm on dog
Think every time you stick your hand out, like I'm suppose to give you what ya want dog
That shit done ran out, when I was doing time you clowns ran out
Now you wan' keep eating off mine, that shit don't pan out
They bout to cut your lights off, you tell me that shit ery' month
That's just what Loc talking bout, this time dog ain't the one
Ery'time a nigga fell, you'd be right there to catch him
But the one time you deny him, now that clown mad at ya
Look fuck that, take it how you wanna
Better get you a sign, and stand ya ass on the corner
Get off ya ass people, and go on get your hustle on
We all created equal, stop singing all them sad songs
So all you dead beats, won't you please stop calling me
Begging for cheese, but man that ain't what ya need look thug

[Chorus]
We don't owe you fuck you, go get it on your own
Everyday I've been grinding getting it all alone, without you
We don't owe you fuck you, go get it on your own
Everyday I've been grinding getting it all alone, I don't need you

It seems I can't understand, why the fuck my people trip with me like I owe em some'ing
Get off your ass don't look to me for handouts, cause I can't give you nothing
Plus I heard niggaz got a lot to say, about how I live my life
Get this right the reason that I ride alone, is cause half of you niggaz ain't right
Shife maybe just a tad bit, see I can only call what I see
To each it's own do what you do, but the fact remains I'm still a G
Who I be it really don't matter dog, but just know I'm still the same
I grind full time, while you niggaz don't squab a heavyweight in this game
I was told you gotta get up and get it, depending on what you want not what you need
We all need a lot of thangs, but say dog can you succeed
Only time'll tell inside this life, while some of us left alone
And I ain't mad at all I'm a better man, when I get shit on my own

[Chorus]

I was taught, that you gotta be your own man
But everybody that I know, holding out they hand
Looking at me, like I owe they ass something
Stressing me everyday, wasn't part of the plan - 2x

Why they whining, I just do what I do
Please don't waste my time, get off your ass and get you
Look why you trying to count mine, you need to focus on you
I'm out here trying to survive nigga, just like you
They searching for a free ride, that's what a lot of em do
But they ain't nowhere to be found, when you be needing them fools
Look they don't play by the rules, like they ain't even got a clue
So it's best that you keep moving, cause Loc ain't got nothing for you

[Chorus]

Don't need you, I don't need you

I've been doing it, on my own

Sitting on top of the world

[Trae]
I really wish that I was, sitting on top of the world
Cause lately I've been in my own zone, stressing so much I'm about to hurl
I don't want to lose my focus, in case you ain't noticed it's hopeless
In the ghetto, cause niggaz'll hold you down and never let go
But I maintain, ducking and dodging the rain
Wishing one day I'll get away, and be on top of my game
Cause for Trae, everyday struggling is what I get to feel
If I feel anything else, I swear to God it wasn't real
So I mash on, and get my cash on
Fuck being broke, everyday I get my stash on
It ain't no telling, if I'ma get to see the better days
I would rather be living, so mama say I better pray
And forget what them niggaz say, I know they be hating mine
I've been stuck on bad luck, I don't think they want mine
So I remain, hoping God gon put me on top of his list
I'll probably never get to see it, so for now I sit and wish I was

[Hook - 4x]

[Trae]
My mentality of being broke, done got me trying to get it
But I don't rest, so everytime I touch the game I'll be the best and never less
I ain't got shit to lose, and I want the bottom to the top
So everyday I give it all I got, a hundred percent and never ever stop
I ain't gon quit for shit, even though my pain is forever
I lost a lot with paying dues, and tried to keep it together
It's like I'm zoning everyday, and then I'm lost in a daze
Since I'm addicted to reality, I'll be stuck in my ways
And I can't change it if I wanted to, with what I'm going through
It ain't nobody, trying to help me through
That's why my attitude be out of control, with all the time they gave my dog
I bet he losing it slow, but still I tell him not to fold
I'm gon ride for the team, and try to make it to the top
And if I never make it, least I'm still respected on the blocks
I know it ain't a lot, but in the hood I'll be a legend
Helping people make it through, they hard times for a blessing like I'm

[Hook - 4x]

[Trae]
I never knew, if I would end up being po'
And if folks but still I knew, that I would end up being realer than most
And maybe that explains, why I haven't made it yet
I can almost bet that you niggaz, don't get no respect
Selling your soul and playing dirty with the devil, I choose to be a rebel
Never teaming up with that sucker, cause I'm on another level
And it ain't too many on it, I promise I'm a loner
Ever since me and my brother separated, I've been goner
On the corner trying to get it, the best way I can
That's why I choose to get up and get out, and be a man
And it ain't no giving me respect, I'd rather take my own
And ain't no running from death, I'd rather be toting chrome
And I don't think that they want to see me, on top of the world
Cause if they did then they would fear me, when I be stopping this world
From all the bullshit, these niggaz be filling it with
And if I can't, then I'ma never be calling it quits I wish I was

I ain't forgot about you, say you
I ain't forgot about you, ah no-no yeah

[Hook: Dallas]
Time after time, you still on my mind
Sometimes I wish that I, could pull the hands of time for you
And though you gone, you still on my mind
I often wish that I, could kick it one more time with you
Time after time, you still on my mind
Sometimes I wish that I, could pull the hands of time for you
I wrote this song, to let you know I'm down
I know you know I'm down, I know you know I'll ride for you

[Trae]
I just thought that I'd clear my mind, off the top and represent my dog
DJ Screw you know that I miss you mayn, so every chance I get I gotta mob
Never thought I'd be doing this song, but time after time I feel like I'm alone
I could recall kicking it like G's, but now I reminisce going down my songs
It really hurt to see your T. Jones, feel the wrath that he reaching fo'
Everybody wanna be, Screwed and Chopped
But they don't know, it's bout to be smoked
They don't feel the pain that I feel, the love that I got for you is too real
We been down since back in the day, if you was still here I'd be down still
Everyday I gotta ride for the team, S.U.C. for L-I-F-E
It's bout time I let 'em know who we be, you the Don and now the world gon see
Ain't no way that I'm gon forget ya, in my mind I gotta paint my picture

Everyday, I'ma hold it down
Even though you locked up, for a hell of a time
Ain't a day that pass, you ain't on my mind
I love you mayn, never put no one up above you mayn
So you know, that I gotta keep thugging mayn
Still all about you, and ain't nothing changed
You the reason I wreck, trying to get a platinum plack
For my brother Dinkie, I remember just what you told me
That niggaz in the game, can't even see me
Me and Jay'Ton, fin to get your shine on until you get free
I'ma get my grind on, me and you
On another level it'll be that way, even when my time gone
I had to show, that you part of my heart
And it really hurt, when they split us apart
All I know is I still remember, I've been repping you since from the start
Everyday on my pen and pad feeling sad, seeing shit that we never had
All I know is what's mine is yours, for the good times or for the bad

You been gone, for bout three and a half
All of the times, is bound to get better
All I could say, is that we gotta ride
For the last and the time, you locked up inside
One day gon come, you bound to be free
When you hit that gate, I'll be right outside waiting
Donnie, you gotta hold your pride
I ain't forgot about you dog, everyday I ride
Everyday of the year, right by your side
Better believe, I'm keeping your name alive
And that's on the click
Even though, my pain might make me sick
My day coming up, and I'ma hit that lick
Then me and you, both'll have time to kick
Raise our kids like grown men, reminiscing like back when
Bleeding our block in a dead end, if time went back would I do it again
It's really hard to say, but I prolly would
Just to see your face, everyday got a time and a place
All I know is I miss you dog, South Klique for life and I'm still your ace

Trae,"[Z-Ro]
Houston Texas is my city, Ridgemont 4 is my block
I put my trust in no man, only my motherfucking glock
Cause she ain't never let me down, before
Fuck a gang I follow my bitch, cause she be busting rounds for Ro
Unlike my homies, cause they phony than a motherfucker
Even my broad, cause she might be fucking some other brother
Lord knows, that I couldn't take it if I found out
Premeditated, cause I'm about to let them automatic rounds out
A prisoner of my own mind, losing it swiftly
Clicking on motherfuckers, until the reaper come and get me
Fuck a friend and a click, and a partner in crime
Cause when you doing your bid, they won't be partners in time
I bet they be the main reason, why you locked up in a county
That's why I strive, to keep all the busta bitches from round me
So take it how you want to take it, i don't give a damn
I'm an asshole by nature, nigga this is who I am

[Hook - 2x]
I know they told y'all, deep down South we don't play
Don't get too close, cause nigga I'm gon spray
Everyone of y'all, piss me off and you gon see me touch
Your noggin y'all, that's who I am nigga fuck you

[Z-Ro]
Don't worry my nigga, I'm coming to make your bail
Wait a second, how this buster know I'm going to jail
I seen the hatred in they faces, when the prince wanted to see me
When they thought I was leaving, they wanted to D-E-A-D me
Dropping salt on my name, saying I sold my soul
And these suppose to be my people, damn my people so cold
Why not be happy for a nigga, when he make a major move
Chill you playing with this game, but I've been paying major dues
I can't tell a motherfucker, how to fly a plane
If I ain't never been up in the cockpit, you feeling me mayn
I got a bunch of records sold, and y'all ain't sold shit
Your foreign's at a standstill, but my Houptie's on the road bitch
Beef with me nigga, and you can find out
How I murder niggas with my lyrics, I ain't gotta pull my iron out
Take it how you want to take it, i don't give a damn
Fuck them niggas who say they down, one deep is who I am

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I'ma follow the truth, and never follow lies
So I'ma ride on Watts, until his fat ass apologize
For saying what he said, about Screw
Look who your style is named after motherfucker, you number two
And you know what come before one, nigga this mouthpiece
Z-Ro and S.U.C., Southside super hero
Fucking with you pussies, cause it's time you be tampered with
When you see me look me in the eyes, and pull up your pamper bitch
My nigga named Tommy, say he's coming to get ya
His people gon be swinging, everyone of em'll hit ya
Holding on to my grudges, until my brain get a blister
I love drama so much, because my life is so rough
So when you see me out in public, don't you come at me wrong
Disrespect me if you ain't, hoe I'ma fuck up your dome
You can take it how you want to take it, I don't give a damn
Street Military was my father, Z-Ro is who I am

I wanna see my nigga Screw get to breathe again
And wanna see Dinky and my nigga Donny break free again
On the block, never thinkin 'bout Plix
Twenty-fo' years of mine I've been blitzed
Dawg, don't you get it twisted
Cause 19 years of those have been stress
Never thought that I'd see this time
And it ain't no way that I'ma let it get by
Ain't no lie, deep down inside
Just to hold it close it wanna make me cry
No mo' drama, likin no laws
No mo' jail, no more collect calls
No mo' hate from these roach-ass niggaz
and my dawgs on the block'll ball 'til we fall
Plus Peewee woulda never got locked
Plus Greedo woulda never got shot
Plus Mello woulda still been here
With a white Kangol about to body rock the pen
Misty, then the rest of the click like
Full speed then runnin without a red light
Whole life I'll be one of a kind
Go deep in the wind I promise I got my head right
And I hate it's gon' be like this
I wonder why everything come to me like this
And if only fo' one night I finally get my smile
Lord, I don't wanna leave like this

It'll be nice to have Emo and Jody and LL back
My nigga Best and his big brother E. Roy Love
Dem people ain't never comin back
But if only for one night
My nigga could make a decision he shoulda made
Make it where the situation turned out another way
And ain't a day go by
I don't wish I didn't have to miss my momma
This ain't livin my nigga this just drama
If only for the night when the storm'll live calmer
Cause seem like they wanna give a lifetime sentence
to a nigga with a pistol and a pound of marijuana
Wish it was legal to be in public wit'cha eyes red
I've seen a lot of B.I. cases go fed
Got pulled over, no seatbelt on the shoulder
Let to a 70 year stand and coda
If only for the dead nigga
Didn't have to wait to make a safe walk to the sto'
Just to get his niggaz and a six-pack {?}
But there never been a cakewalk to the sto'
Fuck around and see the head concussion
If the hood decide you gotta fake walk to the sto'
They fully fronted to everybody with animosity
Bitches'll take 'em 'fore they walk to the sto'
A nigga from the Southside, and a nigga from the Northside
And a nigga from the Eastside
Could all get along with each other, like we knew each other mother
No reason to wanna take our own lives
By losin a son, losin a daughter, losin a child
I'm battered by life, too rude to smile
I liked it better when I used to smile

I remember when Joseph wasn't able to have thangs
Now I'm able to flip a 300-M and grab grain

I'm the future of rap-a-lot, quit livin' in the past mayne
Remember flippin' with a brick, in the dash mayne
Now every time I roll up bitch give me bomb-ass brain

Probably be somebody, baby momma, I ain't ask mayne
Baby, daddy got a problem, we can hit the grass mayne
An asshole by nature, livin' in the fast lane
Stay rilla fo' reala, fuck with me and that's yo' ass mayne

Ain't got a diploma, but got knots of cash mayne

I guess they never seen a guerilla when he stompin' and pissed

My attitude, fuck, watch how you approachin' me bitch
Asshole and ain't gon' fake it 'cause I had it by nature
And that's the result of everywhere you go niggaz hate ya
And I ain't trippin', I'ma catch one of them marks on the back street
With the black heat, slugs run up like a track meet

I'm an anybody killa, but everybody can get it
Servin' suckers in neighborhoods got it crackin' like a stick
I didn't come to hurt nobody but you bumped into mine
But we gangsters I pull a fo' and told you po' out that wine
If I wanted flex, I coulda got a strap at that moment
I'd rather keep ca-cash, ca-cash, 'cause I'm already wanted
I'm an asshole by nature, my flag's on the left side
Gave him a pass before I stepped [Incomprehensible] side

Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around
And bust your brain

Now I don't wanna hurt nobody, but that's a lie
Cause it's a delight for me to bust a lip or black an eye
Or smoke a nigga like a syrup covered black 'n' mild
So don't fuck with me when I'm tryin' to make money stackin' piles
Some niggaz trie to rob me before, try to jack me now

But still show up at my funeral services 'n shit
I ain't fin' to let it happen to me, you gon' respect me
Ain't gon' be no bad actin' with me, homie
And to you haters I'm a waiter waitin' to serve somebody
I kill all you motherfuckers but I

Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone

Speaking my name you better quit, 'fore you lose your jaw

Who gon represent for Texas, like I represent for Texas
And who this nigga talking down on Dirty South, niggaz rapping reckless
Scared took him out of the hotel, 'cause when Ro swang Ro swell
Eyebrows and jaws, so in my presence Mr. don't tell
I'm a motherfucking murderer, you the wanksta
Popping that gangsta shit on the radio, and it's disturbing you
Big Moe nigga that's my big dog, and my love ain't never gon withdrawal
So we clicked up coming to get why'all, my nigga Ja said you's a bitch dog
I'm a soldier, these niggaz ain't never gon learn
Fucking with the fire bitch nigga you freezing, then you burn
This is M-O-E, Murder Of Everything in front of us
And can't nobody stop it, because the reaper's coming to cancel every one of us
And it's all gravy, all of my niggaz are hard plus we all crazy
Wishing I can be a peaceful man and, hoping that the Lord save me
Fuck a nigga named 50 Cent, you nothing but change
I'm a whole dolla nigga, hanging one in your brain


Now can you picture see smoke out choked out, with Guerilla Maab
Mob figgas representing, and we here to do the job
Got my step-on nigga shoes on, 'case it get dirty
'Cause man it's going down, in the Thirty
It's for war thirty, fuck President Bush
If he was close to the edge, then I'll give him a push
And do this whole world a favor, hey there howdy neighbor
Shit, I'm sorry I took so long to save you
I was getting my dick sucked, by my secretary
She asked me my sign, I told her bitch Aires
I stay on Barbary and Scott, 5000 block
I paint the white house black, and start renting it out

In this underground game, I'm rolling with S.L.A.B
Black H2 Hummers, when we holding the Avenue
Got a itching trigga finger, when I'm holding my strap
Nigga they call me hit man, don't get your wig pushed back
Man some of these niggaz, is bitches too
Steady riding my dick, like bitches do
You a gangsta or a hoe, nigga which is you
Archie Lee been real, before I had a crew
Get it right don't get it wrong, I stay's in the zone
Plus my piece got yellow stones, like I stayed on the Stone
I spit that hood shit, that wood shit
Hershelwood for life, matter fact it's all good bitch

I heard a nigga in the game, was saying my name
But now my glock is fully loaded, and ready to aim
S-L-A-be until I'm gone, and I'm repping it strong
You don't want to see these gorillas, running up in your home
Everybody better clear the lot, when the lights off
I set it off, when I luger ride for the cause
And fuck the law, I'ma mash till I'm finished and done
And when it's all said and done, I'ma be number one
And I bet that I'm a soldier that'll fold you, I done told you
Niggaz getting ran over, in a Rover
Trae forever staying sober, like a Jehovah
Witness I'm at your door brah, door brah

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Let's take it, to the streets
Any one of you, motherfuckers got beef

Get the nine millimeter fitted up in my denim, on my creep
Who that want to do that, bitch or come through that
And sweep up, that street
I'm a motherfucking G, and bitch you gon' listen to me
When I speak, ain't got no time to try to be friendly
Motherfuckers, must didn't hear me
Move around bitch, before you feel me
We smoke em, and choke em
Then fry a motherfucker, just like a poker
The game is now over, be the next
To the thoedest cats or now open, are you playing with me boy
Watch a nigga bob and weave, and then we break jaw
We ain't barring no law
Snap rugged and rough, and playing this game raw
Bitch we ready for war, anybody running up is bound to get scarred
D-O-you-G I are, dropping bombs up on you bitches going hard


These niggaz be plexing and talking down, on a G ass nigga
Sweet pea ass nigga, fuck around and catch the heat ass nigga
Beefing with me a nigga named be	, you silly rabbits finna see
A guerilla thriller will kill a nigga, in these H-Town streets
Ready for war boy we raw, I thought I told you cats
Who was the nigga that had to bust, and make the crowd move back
Never slacking or lacking, still attacking like I'm Sadaam
Set it off like the chirp that's going off, on the alarm
Doing harm nigga we swarm, on any and every hater in sight
Fuck around and call a nigga Teddy, steady turning off your lights
Night lights gon get burned, fucking with paper that I earned
S.L.A.B. gladiating on hating, see you cats gon learn

It's Jay'Ton, motherfuckers and if they don't know the name
From the wild wild West, slugging em like Jesse James
Dog better get the fuck back, 'fore I fuck around and leave a nigga flat
With a cardiac heart attack, slugs stuck off in your back
See I ain't tripping mayn, I'm one of the young guerillas
That's stacking scrilla, slash a killa cause I'm a made nigga
You don't want to get hauled on, or straight clicked on
I've been a G ever since the day, that I left home

S-L-A-be	, one of these motherfuckers finna see
I've been a sad cat with a fat cat all the way back, still spitting with heat
One of the rap game phenomenon's, me and my click be ready for war
You better get your entourage, 'fore you get calicoes through your car
Or you'll get a 44 to your jaw, ain't no love boxing we raw
And if you really think that we playing, step in the ring so you can get scarred
Guerillas ready for havoc, on a mission to let you have it
To tell the truth I done had it, this game is really fin to get tragic
I ain't having when I'm busting on first and ten, I'ma be rushing
Till a nigga left with concussions, bring the end of discussion dog
You don't want to get me pissed off or ticked off your ass is fin to get pissed on
Not dissed on but clicked on, for stepping inside my zone

50 Cent, baby that's nothing but chump change
Shooting slugs at my partna, disrespecting the game
So feel this verbal cocaine, your whole tape was trash
Now the whole Screwed Up Click, gon beat that ass
So when you come in H-Town, don't hide behind your circle
We gon' tear the club up, leave both your eyes purple
Hurt you bitch nigga, that's from the Boss Man
I'm known for slapping boys, knocking em out with my hands
Understand bow down, and show some respect
We clicked up and heated, with knives hanging round our neck
I'm a cold blooded killa, do a murder for the price
So call the ambulance, and put this bitch up on some ice

Matter of fact if I lose I bet they move quick
The same ones who accept my help
Don't give a damn about the pain I felt unless it boost they wealth
But I'm a true solider quiet is kept
You know it's death before even if I get swept
Damn why the hood ain't made of G's
Because if it was then these cowards wouldn't be able to breathe
If it was then these cowards wouldn't be able to leave
Haters worse then a disease that's what I believe
I know my real niggaz feel my tone
If you ain't ninety-nine plus you ain't in my zone
Better feel a nigga vibe if I'm flippin' alone

Trae,"I'm in town, girl, for just one night
You're so fine, girl, you're just my type
You just might make me miss my flight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

We gonna spend time, you name your price
I don't trip but for you, I might
Tryna get deep, girl, don't make me fight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

Open up ya eyes and ya see quite clear
No more crying, no more tears 'cause ya champion is here
I'm the superman you seek, I sweep ya off ya feet
From the moment our eyes meet, girl, you in for a treat

The attraction is so unique, the conversation is sweet
Love making under the sheets, it'll make the mission complete
Your body language is loud, girl, you speaking it well
But maybe I do the fool, put you under my spell

I'm suave and debonair, you sexy with long hair
This chemistry's so rare, just kick back and chill
Let the moment take control, ya Prada goes my gold?
But baby, let's take it slow, lemme show ya I'm real

If them looks could kill, ya be wanted in every state
Ya body shape is great, collaboratin' is fake
When you open up the gates, be ready to love make
I'm ready to back break, girl, you wet as a lake, I can't wait

I'm in town, girl, for just one night
You're so fine, girl, you're just my type
You just might make me miss my flight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

We gonna spend time, you name your price
I don't trip but for you, I might
Tryna get deep, girl, don't make me fight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

Go on and let ya hair down, you in the midst of a playa
I'm the answer to ya prayers, we make a perfect pair
I handle with great care, I'm packing, girl, beware
Go on, come back to my lair and I'll make you believe

Some slow jams and candle light, make the mood right
I do it just like ya like it, sweat ya out of ya weave
From the second you arrived to the moment you leave
I'll have you huffin' and puffin' but please don't forget to breathe

Ain't no tricks up my sleeve but I know you still debatin'
But baby, no more waitin', it's time for Mr. Slayton
Them other clowns been fakin' but I'm here for the takin'
No worries of baby makin' 'cause I pack a Gary Payton

Me and you layin' naked in them birthday suits
Is reserved in body rockin', baby, knockin' them boots
Now you know you lookin' cute but it's time to decide
All playing games aside, you gon' ride, baby

I'm in town, girl, for just one night
You're so fine, girl, you're just my type
You just might make me miss my flight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

We gonna spend time, you name your price
I don't trip but for you, I might
Tryna get deep, girl, don't make me fight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

Get closer, baby, tonight, I'll give you what you need
From the moment that our eyes met
Girl, I knew that you were meant for me
You and me and chemistry

So what you wanna do tonight?
I'm tryna be with you tonight
'Cause you're lookin' so nice
So nice

A bowl of strawberries and some ol' wet rose
Some ya sweet talkin' in ya ear, make ya come out them clothes
When the moon light reflect off the sweat of your skin
I'ma demonstrate, then separate the boys from the men

Lemme swim inside ya ocean, ya body is smooth as lotion
Let's get full of that potion and leave ya head full of grouse
Baby, it ain't no jokin' when I tell ya it's real
So baby, tell me how ya feel, what's the deal, baby?

We gonna spend time, you name your price
I don't trip but for you, I might
Tryna get deep, girl, don't make me fight
And lay your body down tonight

Is about it, in this motherfucking song right here
You know, it took two real niggaz to collab
And make some motherfucking shit happen, man
It's your boy Yung Joc, you know, Block Entertainment
And my motherfucking nigga Trae, asshole by nature
Ay, Trae, tell me what you is nigga

[Trae]
I'm a gangsta to the end, riding for the set
Black Chevrolet, with the paint still wet
J's on my toes, locs on my eyes
Crawling on fours, every time I slide by
Nothing less than the truth, on the streets of the South
Hos on my swag 'cause the diamonds in my mouth
But I move low key, posted in the trap
Raw with the rap, to put my hood on the map
I'm a do this one for H.A.W.K., and his brother named Pat
And my partna named Screw, so I let the trunk crack
What they know about that, haters better chill
Plus I'm packing something, that they classify steel
Repping my block, still doing my thang
Trunk full of bang, holding A.B.N. gang
Screwed up click, I'm a let the world know
Before it's all over, we gon' make the world slow

[Chorus]
You can find me in the hood, swanging in a drop
Trunk popped up, now I'm letting back the top
Locs on my face, and my grill so clean
Thirty grand talk, boppers hopping on my team
Moving so slow, banging my screw
Moving so slow, banging my screw
Moving so slow, banging my screw
Hop out on the block, still hollin' 'what it do'

'65 Impala, Chevy SS
The top disappear, see the clear VVS
I guess you know the name, I ain't even gotta say it
When I say it's going down, SK start spraying
Block E-N-T, and A.B.N. niggaz in charge
Ery'body mugging, nigga face different starch
I'm a let you pull your card, but watch how quick I pull it
Ay fuck a semi-auto, my niggaz pack fullest
We bullies on the block, the hustle don't stop
It's eat what you kill, that's the motto off top
Yeah, it's the A-Town, and the H-Town
Tell 'em this the shake down, lay face down
Me and my nigga Trae, getting cake now
Split it down the middle, 50-50 that's the break down
Baby, keep your face down, and don't talk back
You can find me in the hood, nigga distributing packs

[Big Pokey]
My guns go off, when my fists is hard
Mobbed up 'cause nigga pistols'll scar
You got your knife on you, homie, that's for twisting cigars
I got my knife on me, homie, that's for twisting your guards
These niggaz, wanna play you for weak
It's going down, motherfuckers drizzown when they playing it deep
I do the damn thang, niggaz talking about it
I'm a problem run into it, you ain't walking up out it
Sensei'll fade the pack, I get mean
Lean on you with this beam, till you fade to black
Cuffing broads, cause I mack on chicks
I go hard same nigga hit your hard, put your Lac on bricks
Niggaz a trip, crock bull give niggaz the clip
Slap niggaz in they trap, when they giving me lip

Hop out on the block, like I'm still hitting stangs
Platinum in the hood, so they tend to know my name
Yellow VS-1's, got me switching up the game
Might hop fly, top dropping like the rain
Hoes talk down, Trae never get mad
Niggaz old school, still jacking my swag'
Y'all concerned about a playa, since the day of my birth
Grab a couple mill, and I can show you what I'm worth
Sitting so low, every time I come down
Trunk just popped, so I'm showing my surround
84's got me tipping, so low to the ground
Still hitting licks, moving off the Greyhound
Watching for the laws, I ain't fucking with the time
Bitch I'm in my prime, ain't no stopping my shine
I advise, that they lead the truth to the throne
If you say I ain't the realest, say bitch you dead wrong

Yeah, real talk for my niggaz on the block
I been wrecking for a second, but I promised that I wouldn't stop
I been in it with my niggaz, for a long time
But they gotta give it to me, cause they know I wouldn't drop
Same nigga, with the flow
Same nigga that'll spin a nigga's ass up, throw his ass in the trunk
I'm a representative, for the Assholes
Try to run up on me, I'll teach a nigga how to stunt
Southwest, you better get your hands up
'Fore I send a wave of niggaz, that'll hit your man's up
While you wanna-be thugs, better pull your pants up
Then the shit, hit the fan
Then I fuck, your fans up
These niggaz, really got a nigga fucked up
Hating motherfuckers, I'll show you what the beef is
Show you niggaz how to lose teeth, keep running off at the mouth
And I can show you niggaz, what the sleep is
Better give it up, when you hear the name Trae
When I hit the block in black, your ass better pray
Tell the five in the hood, I don't play
And I got more niggaz, in the slugs
In the tip, of a K
And I run with the see's, and the be's on the block
And the G's, and few B.D.'s on the block
And I kept it real, so I got the keys to the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'll put it on the pack, and I'll ride for it first
Nigga jump, gonna be the first nigga that'll slide for it
They don't wanna see me in a zone, when I try for it
Any real nigga, stand up and get an eye for it
Cause I'm oh so real, though homie
And I'm next in the line, finna show the world what it was
H-Town, till the death
Intuition of a nigga named Pac, finna let it rain for the thugs

[Trae]
Somebody better give me the crown, these niggaz out of line
And I see, I gotta put 'em in they place
Everyday it be the same old shit, I gotta click on a bitch
I don't really, wanna pay another case
Whey they niggaz wanna try a nigga, like a nigga soft than a bitch
I'll lean on a nigga, like Boss on a switch
Better chill, 'fore I get to going off on a bitch
Lace the Nike's, and break a nigga jaw in this bitch
Everybody, wanna know about the South
But I promise, you niggaz'll wanna take another route
A.B.N., fin to hit a nigga's ass in the drought
In the town right now, (no doubt)
If you got a problem with Trae, let's get it on
Iggy on lock, so I'm back in a zone still packing the chrome
I was late for the hood, so I'm bad to the bone
Since I roll on the block, it's half of the bone
Shit just got wrong, you can hear it in my tone
(I'm pissed), but I'm still moving along
Yeah Jay?Ton, still grooving along
So the niggaz in the blue, got love for the Home
For the H, and the West state
I""ll put it on a nigga, in the worst way
That'll be your worst day, and I put it on Trae
Motherfuckers better get in a line, or the dirt where you gon lay
This right here, for my nigga named Nick
In a hospital bed, half gone
I'll run up on a bitch nigga, who that out that shout out
Feel I gotta hit his ass, with the chrome
Nothing less, are-E-S-T-L-E double S
Stress, got a nigga on amp
So I got mob for life, like 24/7
And I promise, I'm about to be the champ

Trae,"Intro (Fat Pat)
N****z betta see a n***a roll
Shorts down and I'm rollin' on 84's

Chorus (Fat Pat)
Swang-swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk yep, yep, yep, yep (x4)

Verse 1 (Trae)
I'ma swang I'm a swanger slab lean to the left
Pop my trunk and show what I'm about so Houston, Texas gotta be felt
I'm a vet so it's automatic when I be swingin' my wide frame
4-4's to 24's I'm subject to glide man
Like a pimp without the numbers still so fly when I slide man
Plus I'm lethal fully loaded ain't no takin' my ride man
We gangsta 
And it ain't too much you can do to stop us
Don't try to knock us 'cause these diamonds got boppas try'na jock us
We the best and what we gon' be and these haters know it
So haters hate us to death and I know 'cause these haters show it
I only ride alone so they can picture me rollin' 
And for them jackers thinkin' fly just picture what I be holdin'
Them hollow points'll make you picture just how fast they'll be foldin'
A few of them'll have you leakin' 'til you dead or you swollen
But still I ride like the law
Floatin' above everything
I'm Screwed Up Click until it's over n***a fresh off the chain
Beat the slang

Chorus (Fat Pat)

Verse 2 (Big Hawk)
I'ma swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop my trunk for Fat Pat's death
I would give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact bring the whole crew back
Only God can do that so I'ma leave it alone
Movin' on
Groovin' to this soothin' song
I'm cruisin' along
Still got a Screw tape on
Still in the zone
Wishin' Cory Blunt was home
Ridin' on chrome
Bangin' with my bub lights on
Ridin' home
South east of the astrodome
I'm Fat Pat's clone
It's J go see Harry's own
His heartbeat pumps through my flesh and bone
Flippin' with Trae
Mobbin' down MLK
He's blue up with grey
On tint on southern deuce today
It's Dub K
Chiefin' on some lovely
And we on the boulevard actin' ugly
We gon'

Chorus (Fat Pat)

Verse 3 (Trae)
ABN is my type of nature my understanding is nothin'
Stacks in the back of a 'Lac on this glass you finna see me struttin'
Cuttin' corners on a daily basis
Move fast like Kanye West samples when I be chasin' faces
I'm known to tip like a waiter when I be leaned to the left
I brung the city through the dark with a fifth of boppers and belts
I'm ABN the Impala 67 Chevy be spinnin'
Invisible set displayed everytime they catchin' me grinnin'
Off in they face it ain't too much that they can do to a G
But try to hate me
Every second due to the fact who I be
And it don't bother me
'cause I still be toppin' my game
Just don't come off the side of my range I might be leavin' a stain
Whether my slab or beam 
N****z gon' respect that we gangsta
T-Shirt and Dickies plus the kicks that I lace up for you wankstas
Everyday is still the same
I be so loud when I bang
And thanks to Screw and P-A-T we got 'em diggin' our slang huh

Verse 4 (Pimp C)
I'm a Screwed Up affiliator strictly rollin' red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn heads
I've been watched by parole, task force, and by the feds
'cause they know I got 'em for 10 and they know the game ain't dead
It's too late
I'm deep up in it ain't nuthin' about me scary
Chiefin' in the club try'na find me somethin' hairy
Dippin' at the bar 
Smokin' on the stokey
Since I came home from the pen seems like everybody know me
You got lots of friends when you up and when you ballin'
Just like Pookey all the haters started callin'
They see the diamonds and the Bentley and the candy thing
They know I'm mob stompin' Texas they know that I'm rollin' with Jane
They know it's UGK for life and that I'm down with Bun
They know we grindin' bitch'll hitcha with another one
It's UGK records right now we need distribution
Since Laura Rebel free the pimp is goin' down in Houston

Trae,"My life
My life, really feelin hard times

Lookin' out my window, holdin' my weapon like Malcolm X and
And it seems I'm over-stressin', feelin' like hatin' is your profession
And I know a couple Texans that got killed for over-reppin'
So I never be oversteppin' boundaries bounded to my weapon
When they ask me how I'm doin, I just tell 'em ""I'm doin' super""
I got a date with Destiny, allow me to introduce ya
Her little sister Fate told me I'm gon' be the future
And legacy's everything to a Martin Luther King Koopa
This recession is so pathetic, got me feelin' like I'm athletic
And success tryna get away from me and I ain't tryna let it
When they told that Pimp was gone, my reply was ""I don't get it""
And I'm still havin trouble believin' it happened the way they said it
Had to cut some partners off, swear to y'all it ain't my fault
I've been grown since I was seven and I was born to be a boss
But I know there's a bunch of haters tryna see me take a loss
So I be sleepin' with one eye open and put cameras in my vault
I've been thinkin' and gettin' deep and they tryna tell I been preachin'
But I know that they can't see how much of the world that I be reachin'
So stop reachin, stop leachin, I'm a fade 'em out like bleach and
In the spots where they can't get out to is the spots I visit frequent
Europe to UK and Germany, travellin' currently
Made so much in millions that I could cash out in eternity
Accustomed to hittin' customs with that duffle full of currency
When God created hustle, looked at the world and he inserted me, Koopa

[Chorus: x4]
I'm just livin' my life, so cold
In the streets so I'm takin' it slow

Uh, yeah
I'll tell you my story, I only speak the truth homie

It a terrible situation, throwed on the curb within the hands of time
But since I'm blistery breathing I guess a nigga livin' fine
I live a life that's filled with dramatistic people cryin'
And since the hood depend on me, they'll never lose a hand of mine (I gotcha)
I'm paralysis when it come to the good times, I'm used to the pain
Feelin' like a bum under the bridge, I'm so used to the rain
Anything I do is from the heart so it reflect my name
Forgive me for my sins father, I feel like I'm goin' insane
Media criticizing me for checking niggas, fuck it, oh well
I just wasn't raised a little pussy disrespected nigga
I'm tryna live on my own by the ways of a gangster
So every time I leave out I pray so I'm prayin' for a gangster
It's bad enough the world we livin in all about money
Since we runnin' out I choose to believe it ain't nothin funny
I've been stabbed in my back so much I deal with it
I'm tryna kick it with my life before heaven come chill with it

[Chorus: x4]

Last year was a hard one but life goes on
Thinkin' bout my nigga Pimp while I write this song
And the list goes on, all my niggas is gone
I'm tired of hearin' bad news, scared to pick up my phone
Got a call, my nigga Eddy died from Acres home
Just seen him at my video shoot, now that shit wrong
Kelvo, Arborea, even my girl Shantz
I just heard word she got stabbed to death today
Dear Lord, I pray that you take away the pain
From their family and their friends, please help us change
Still warm my niggas sleep dog, stessle and stank
My girl Dee Dee, they got me pourin' out my drank
It's fucked up, all my friends is dead or in the pen
Seem like soon as your life begin it's beginning to end
I'm frustrated, but you gotta smile, your time is dated
You never know when showin' your love might be related, ha ha

[Chorus: x4]",My Life,2006
Trae,"Don't come around my way, cause I don't need a
'Nother fat weather friend, with a trick up his sleeve
Acting like you really my nigga, but he after my cheese
Y'all niggaz get me congested, move around and let me breathe
I remember when you niggaz, ain't want me to hit the weed
Now that I'm rapping, you see me and tell me to hit the weed
Thinking you can get a VIP pass, and get in free
But Joseph McVey, is enough company for me
Wanna kick it with me, cause I kick it with the high class
Y'all didn't wanna kick it, when I was down on my ass
In my cordoroy britches, y'all was in Louis Vatone
Laughing and pointing at a nigga, trying to ruin my fun
For using the millennium, or money by the ton
You niggaz ain't help me get it, I did it with no one
Fuck showing love back, I ain't showing none (y'all niggaz don't have to)
Come to none of my shows, or buy none of my tapes
'Cause who the hell should I support, I'ma still be straight
The less niggaz around me, the better I can concentrate
When I came face straight, or open up my chest plate
It could be ya death date, get beside yourself
We ain't cool, I think you better rewind yourself
Before a cemetery, be where you can find yourself
So beat your feet, and let the do' close behind yourself
I don't need no friend, I don't need no broad
Only thing I need, is the help of the good Lord
Trying to kick it, but motherfuckers sing to hard
'Cause I'ma be keeping it real, they gon be keeping it fraud
A hundred and fifty-two percent, are real with me
So instead of keeping my niggaz, get the steel with me
I can do bad one deep, so I chill with heat (fuck y'all niggaz)

I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody, until I can shine
So when my money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely, like you did last time

I'm a asshole, and I ain't trying to be rude
But I don't really give a damn, about none of y'all
You use to hate a nigga tough, from way back in the day
First off, fuck each and every one of y'all
I be a loner on my own, alone hang with my chrome
These motherfuckers play, life so fraud
I peep game, to the T
'Cause I don't want nobody, to catch a nigga slipping on the Boulevard
And on the other hand, just to make matters worse
I feel, they want me headed to the grave
And I ain't ready to leave, I got my back planted against the wall
With a nine, about to misbehave
Same old shit, with a friend or a foe
Pack your shit, and get the fuck out the do'
Ain't no way, you hoes finna be a part of my life
A.B.N, is all that I know
You can try what you wanna, but I ain't gon fail
Look at me now, and all the shit that I sell
I'ma beat a nigga trunk off, coast to coast
And everybody who doubt that, can go to hell
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong
And I don't give a fuck, cause I'm in my zone
All that hate you got, it only make a nigga strong
So I like how it feel, when I'm left all alone

I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody, until I can shine
So when my money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely, like you did last time

You must of thought I forgot, when I was stuck on the block
And I was broke, everybody laughed a lot
And now the tables have turned, you niggaz fraud
And you know see Trae, with his foot up on the gas a lot
'Cause I don't trust you niggaz
Give me fifty feet, 'fore I rush you niggaz
Move it around, cause I don't fuck with you niggaz
To tell the truth, I'm allergic to you niggaz
Asshole for life, until a nigga fly
Nigga don't stop, better go on pass by
And hoes, don't call my cellular phone
The only thing, that y'all know how to do is lie

Why y'all niggaz wanna rob wanna steal, that ain't real
How the fuck I'ma kick it with you, you ain't gon get me killed
I done seen a lot of blood, on the battlefield
Even though I'm tired, I be climbing up the ladder still
Ain't nobody words gon hurt me, even if they dessert me
I'ma still be grubbing, and drink a drink when I'm thirsty
Just to be in my position, motherfuckers ain't worthy
So they feminine conversations, don't even disturb me
I'm a gangsta, don't need another nigga to grade me
If I'm in trouble, don't need nobody to save me
Steady losing composure, like my kon folk Trae be
I'ma handle my bidness, ain't nobody else made me

I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody, until I can shine
So when my money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely, like you did last time

I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own

Trae,"Why you by the window?, what's wrong daddy?

I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He's just stand by the goddamn window
With that fucking AK all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't
You don't do a goddamn thing

I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the, corner, any day
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Struggling and striving, my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never should of had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress
I'm out of breath

I no longer trust my homies
Them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
Got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest
Under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin I die the way I lived,
Straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
Who was buggin'
My homie told me once
Don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
But they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
Who done passed away screaming, please

I can't give up, although I'm hopeless

I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thing in my household,
And drinking liquor til' you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Busting on them niggas til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, coming for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
'Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless
Them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you til you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And getting high was a way of getting free

One nation... twenty-one gun salute

I'm hopin my true mothafuckaz know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke

21 gun salute, dressed in fatigue, black jeans and boots
disappeared in the crap, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas thinks he live like me
Talkin bout how he left the hospital took five like me
You living fanatasies, nigga I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now we out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why nigga blowed them out
Next time grown folks talk, nigga close your mouths
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
I see too many real playas fall to let these bitch niggaz to beat me
Puffy, lets be honest you a punk
or you gonna see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said in vibe about me being a Thug
You can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But, you and I know what's going on
Pay back I knew you bitch niggaz from way back
Witness me strapped with macs knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas looking like, Larry Holmes flabby and shit
Trying to playa hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known this is how you made me
Love it how I got you niggaz goin crazy, against all odds

[Chorus x2]

I heard he was light skined, stocky with a haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashing (what's his name)
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale, about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was working for the feds, same crime different trail
Niggas picture what he said, and did I mention
Promised a payback, Jimmy Henchmen, in due time
I knew you bitch niggaz was listening, The World is Mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggaz stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine on everything I own
I'll destroy everything you touch, play the game nigga
All out warfare, Eye For An Eye
Last words to a bitch nigga, why you lie?
Now you gotta watch your back nigga, watch your front
Here we come gunshots to deck, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game nigga, nigga This M.O.B
So believe me, we enemies, I go, against all odds

Puffy gettin robbed like a bitch, to hide that fact
He did some shit he shouldn't have did
So we ride em for that
And that nigga that was down for me
Restin dead, switch sides
Guess his new friends want him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend or even the dead
Lord listen to me
God don't like ugly It Was Written
Hey Nas your whole damn style is weak
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-in with authorities, felonious capers
Now you want to live my life, so what's the deal
Niggaz that don't ride right
You've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie, you die, goodbye
Let the real life niggaz hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me (nigga), against all odds

If the rappin stops I load up a couple bricks then I'm gone

So want you ride with me, my ghetto queen
You're all that I need
Cause she my ghetto queen, I give her what she need
Money ain't a thing, she stay down like a G [x2]

Girl I done been around the globe and you the realest lil'lady I know
Don't wanna ever let you go - cause oh
Everytime I call you be there for me
Baby girl I love you by my side
So anything you need, that means you got me
So just my ghetto queen gon' take that ride

[Verse 1: Trae]
Look here lil'momma I'm gangsta
Prolly nothin like you done delt with on the day to day
Some say that I'm a star, but in the hood I'm better known as Trae
I'm from around the way - where not too many make it out
And even if I did it's in my blood I'll never take it out
You say you got a man but I ain't tryna take his spot
I'm tryna be ya partna while I'm late night flippin on the block
So we can post up on this glass, tippin the Chevrolet 
And get it, how we get it, then I'm gettin right back out ya way
I'm in my zone so all that drama you can leave at home
Ya man can lock you down, but me ain't nothin - rollin stone
And if you wanna chill tell his ass to leave you alone
Cause if he run up on me, I'm a run my fist upside his dome
Understand when I say I'm grown, and on that other shit
I'm tryna make a team but I ain't feelin all that lover shit
I'm tryna hit the lights and take it to you on that rubber shit
And keep it G, and leave it on that undercover shit

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Ay lay back with me, feel free lil'momma
We can go the Bahamas in the summer
Lookin for the fat[? ], fuck the dumb hoes
And know that you'll ride with me baby fuck the po - po's
No pressure I ain't gotta test ya
I can leave you in my house with a hundred thousand on the dresser
Me and you - my beautiful bitch, so glamorous
So bad niggas pullin out they cameras
Together baby the world can't handle us
Hoes can't compete, no challengers
Summer time, we float on the boat
While I sip a lil'lean, and you puff a lil'smoke
I'm married to my money, but you could be my honey
The groupie bitches dump me - but I know that you love me
So on that note you can take this
Me and you be shinin harder then them diamonds on my wrist, M.O.B!

[Chorus: Lloyd]

[Verse 3: Rich Boy]
We can ride in my drop and spend some money on some Fendi
You never ask what type of gold diggers try to get me
Them hoes are silly, but I pass 'em in the Hemi
If a mothafucker touch you - I'm a hit 'em with that semi
You down like my nigga, so you know I got yo'back
Anybody put they hands on you, I'm a lay 'em flat
So spread ya wings baby come on let's fly
I'm down with my lady till the day that I die

[Verse 4: Trae]
Say lil'momma what you waitin on - actin like you don't know no better
You say you tired of that shit, then roll with me and it's whatever
When in the presence of a gangsta don't worry I got ya
And fuck the stress, give me a sec - I'm a get that up out ya
So get ya spot I'm on the grind right now
I'm prolly less then two seconds away from shine right now

Man, you know da game, same shit different hoes yea
We cut the ears and the tail off, Mickey Mouse...
Never been a rat never had him in the house
Call me Captain Kangaroo 'cause I got money in my pouch 
And, I don't mean loose change when I say, money in the couch 
I'm gettin paid on what I already said
Can't see these niggaz, like to ??? on these niggaz

Say bitch ya betta chill 'cause I beat ya dude up
Put him on da sideline and have his face bruised up, all screwed up
Oh yeah, these diamonds in my mouth show'em I rep tha south

Trae,"You know
I never did understand why they always told me to smile
Shit
It ain't too much shit I gave a smile for
Real talk
Yo still a asshole by nature
Peep game

I remember comin' up able to love nigga watchin' niggas fuck over 
They over sea I kept it reala
But bein' real ain't really always what niggas make it to be 
I never thought we'd make it and I'd have niggas hatin' a G
I got enough shit that I deal with on the day to day
Penitentiary's the life after death don't seem to go away
Even though I never know the outcomes it's always safe to pray
And try to do my best to understand he write a rhyme away
I got a call from Mr. Rogers just the other day tellin' me he by my side
I'm like what the fuck you talkin' 'bout 'til he told me Lorna died
It f***ed me up so much I couldn't even go to the wake
But if her family called I'm gon' make sure that they straight
It's like this part of my life I live is damn near mastered
The more people I love the more they get took away faster
Sometimes I feel I talk to God a lil more than the pastor
Prob'ly been livin' to make sure my son never become a bastard
I've never been the one to quit I've always been the leader
But I feel this world is like a bitch and I know I don't need her
If I ever had this I never took the time to meet her
So I feel a frown across my face the only way to greet her
In the process of bein' Trae I missed out as a child
Prob'ly 'cause reality must stop
And they told my cousin death before he thirty after checkin' his pile
He died at 28 so how the fuck am I supposed to smile shit

I don't know my nigga
I ask myself the same shit everyday
How the fuck am I supposed to smile
Life's real over here though
Ya know

Styles don't smile 
The hood too foul
The lil' niggas is wild
Men lost trial
Hit 'em with some numbers he ain't eatin' doin' chow
He ain't even sleepin' he been thinkin' 'bout his child
It's real fucked up but he won't see him for a while
Same bullshit try'na get you a money pile
You don't see the reefer or the jail doors locked
I keep a tech with the air holes cocked
Now I don't wanna shoot or get shot
But Pinero's not
Gon' fuck with these fuck niggas or air those Lox
It's real hard to sleep when its money on the mind and
Murder on the mind 
Puffin' on the dutch with a fist full of iron
Somebody mom cryin' 'cause somebody boy dyin' 
It's the same ol' shit
Wait till the funeral
Same ol' trip 
Crack money rap money
The same ol' grip
As Trae could've smiled out in Texas
Livin' reckless
If the cops gon' get you but niggas 'll leave you breathless
shit I'm a winner
More like a sinner
Try'na make it to dinner
Then live after breakfast
Ya know

S.P.
How the fuck are we suppose to smile
Man
Answer me that
Maybe I'll fuckin' smile 
Why'know

Nothin' to smile about
These lil' niggas is wildin' out
Do somethin' to 'em they dialin' out
Everybody lookin' at you like you foulin' out
Every hood everywhere that's what it's now about
The shootas is half your age
Give you half the gage
Daily news half the page
Known as a thug now he ain't just fly
Couple months in the group home in D-F-Y
Truthfully what could have been pended but never did
And he slid
As a youthful offender 'cause he's a kid
Problem is
The person he shot was connected
He comin' home thinkin' he's sweet and don't expect it
Big but he's still young
To him it's still fun

I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I been chasing
These hearts I been breaking (Sorry)
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck them from behind
Fuck them with their clothes on, put it to the side

Got a hotel, Crib

Trae,"Um hey, comin' from Where I'm From (I'm from) oh yea

Kids get killed in ghettos, shot up over the car limos
While they mom was at home, tears hittin' the pillow
Where women in the middle in a serminal funereal
Shed a tear cause he lost his son the same way a year ago
It's the same ego-spiritual, we thuggin' in harmony
They say death brings life, there exchange no robbery
If I'm wrong pardon me, me I'm just tired of poverty
Why them niggas in the hood never hit the lottery
Unless they go lottery, first round in the draft
First we Dustin off the rounds and we slip in the mag'
Then we slip on the masks, and go out and mash
And we call it feeding our family
Y'all call it a tragedy, Damn
How I could just kill a man
His blood flow like a river and rinse his blood off of my hand
If you hearing me speak please Lord give me a chance
Please forgive me of my sins, cause we cleansed where I'm from

[Chorus] 
Me and my niggas ride
Even when the sun don't shine and its cold outside
I never run in or hide, cause some niggas hate it
But I can't get faded cause I done made it
Instead of struggling or strive
Survive my weight how these ghetto streets of mine
This is coming from Where I'm From (I'm from)
We all walk back in line (yeah)

Now everybody know that everybody said nobody can hide from beef
Except but us, who surprised when these kids get killed on the streets
Look how these animals eat that's how they talk bout us
While they shed they joke and laugh puttin' a choke round us
Can I get a moment of silence
Cause they claimin' it's the niggas that's causin' all the violence
What bout the ones that protect to serve our honor
Poppin' the blue colla', with shots soon to follow
The ghettos in horror, cause in this boy shot went back
And now the neighborhood hot and he can't move the crack
When it's all about the dollars
And he'll individually get murdered cause money is power
But then these snitch's get to talking and it's colder than ours
Cuffed and crimed on the bus heading straight to the Island
He was only 13, but tried us in the dope and as high as the coast
Cause ain't no more children in the ghetto where I'm from

[Chorus]

We ain't all killers in prison
Matter fact that's a stereo typical thought of livin'
Cause they don't know about the hood and them love in it
Summer time top down with the wood finish
Pushin' hard uptown windows slightly tinted
Back to back Benz and jeeps, blowin' weed with my niggas
On our way to a house party, gonna fuck with some bitches
Let's get some liquor for shorty who said she make us some chicken
And if we get 'em drunk enough we probably could freak em, and do it every
Other weekend
If I don't have to kill niggas, I never would leave the ghetto
I'm like an angel that put on a halo, cradle the grave of my niggas that we
Lost in the ghetto
Cause where I'm from in the ghetto we rock white tee's and Nike's
Roll 3 dice and name our dope ice cream
Set trends and y'all follow our lead
But in New Yitti niggas follow they dreams, where I'm from

[Chorus]

Now I lay me down and sleep
And I pray to the Lord, for my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
Pray to the Lord, for my soul to take (Pray to the Lord, for my soul to take)

Safe to say I paved the way, for you cats to get paid today.
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day.
Consider them my prot??g??, homage I think they should pay.
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way.
I never been a hater still I love them, In a crazy way.
Some say they sold the yay and no they couldn't even work on Labor day.
It ain't that black and white, it has an area that's shaded grey.
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away.
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid.
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away.
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away.
Like I once made them spray, now I could make them plead their case away.

He ain't messing with a G no more
'cause I'm on my grind
And you said it's either or
Coming late at night
And you fussing when I walk in the door
And that ain't nice
Girl, you make me wanna leave for sure

I'm in the studio laying out tracks
My girl keep tripping off that
Blowing up my phone like where I'm at
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

But baby I'm on my grind

Trae,"Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
The ghetto motherfucking alarm clock
Wake up nigga

Lord forgive us for sinning, give us this day and our daily bread
Cause if a nigga don't call you back when you beep him, he might be dead
Look at this world we living in, everybody got a bad attitude and a glock
Seem like we living just to become a victim, of a random shot
Everytime I turn my back, another y'all motherfuckers turn and crack
It seem like just yesterday, a young nigga stepped up to the plate and
Learn to bat, military minded at a early age bread to live in a murder maze
I don't want to go to the early grave, a motherfucker like me
Ready to murder maze, I want to go to heaven but not right now
Bout to pushing infrared like dimes, what you want to do it like that
I can play eight to the Penn, cut your lights off right now
Mean what I say and I say what I mean, nigga like me don't play with a beam
When I pull my gun, then I'ma use my gun
And I ain't tripping, I'll put you in a murder scene
But I try to stay humble, and hold what I got
Never let a nigga know what I got, keep my bidness to my own
So don't bring none of that there, to my home
I love my people, and that's a fact
But I want to know, where's the fucking love at
I don't want to put a motherfucker, in the grave
But I will to keep on, keeping on busting back

[Chorus: x2]
Wake up before you get caught up
Don't keep on selling your soul, until your life bought up
And my eyes on the prize, and never fall off the straight and I roll
When you slip, hollow tips are sharper than an arrow

I decided August 31, 1999
There's no more time for fake partnas, there's only time for my grind
All of my friendships came about, because of the verses I say
That nigga Z-Ro got partnas, but what about Joseph McVey
Everytime I'm on the microphone, nigga want to tag along
Want to see me, when I do my song
Or when a nigga be smoking the marijuana, and the dope all gone
A nigga right back, all alone
I had to regulate, or be surrounded by fakes
At all times looking over my shoulder, but I came out of that as I got older
Cause I realized, if it's written scriptures don't lie
That's why I'm thugging cause life is a bitch, and then a nigga die
I rap about the struggle, cause balling is foreign to me
Z-Ro be t-shirt and Dickies, ain't no Ralph Lauren you see
Cause every dolla that I make, is a dolla well earned
And I'm putting it back in the game, to sco' some crack
And a strap, to dip sherms
Hopefully I can make it, to see the sun rise
Fiending for them back in the days, of hide and seek
And throwing mud pies

[Chorus: x2]

Bout to swang by that sun, is wait for me be right back
I'ma roll a optimoe fat as a wiener, and light that
Cause it seems I can't confine without, clutching a sack
Puffing the sho' dipping the black, or raping the track
And I be tripping and sipping, and pimping this rap
I'm writing my rhymes, through my fetty's no slack
I'm ready to the sell the, the better my chedda
Tell her to the fella, I doubts the shredder
A better competitor, I dwell I'ma get her
Better get fella, I sell-a my yella
To hella thoed nigga, that wreck accapella
The fella that tell it, nobody he got em
He got 'em and shot em, and don't talk about em
Plotted and followed, to get where I started
Out of my product, the plot of my problem
Got off my bottom, to talk to my father
My ceiling is ending, my ending is finished
These women keep grinning, to swim in my linen
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
What's up what's up, had lean in my cup
Been asleep ten years, and I just woke up
The alarm on slow, all my ten minutes up
Gotta make my bed, gotta watch my butt
Gotta clean my room, gotta iron my stuff
Gotta wash my car, gotta shine my buck
Gotta change my oil, cause the road is tough
Keep my eyes on the road, and don't slow up

[Chorus: x2]",Wake Up,2008
Trae,"[Chorus]
Hard times, look over your peoples cause everybody dying
Osama Bin Loden is dropping bombs man, in a situation like this
How can I reach calm man, calm man, my nigga
This is hard times, like its so much gun smoke and see the stars
Shine
We living on dreams but is they coming true, what I'm gonna do
Make a million and pull a stunt or two, a stunt or two

Step into the world of a mob nigga, live in so much pain
The rain steady pumping me up, locked down on hard times
But I'm knowing that I gotta make it, running on my deadline
Giving out flat lines, cause if you think that I'm feeling
Fucking up by mine man, I gotta maintain
Its like everything that I had, it won't ever be the same
I feel I'm sicking home the cemetery
'Cause that's where all of my people rest
I can't take the stress, I'm fin to send it through somebody chest
That's why I walk around pissed off, strapped with a vest
I done been through a lot, ready to release the glock
Vicinities South, a brother on my Dickie, I be ready to ride
And I'm sick of this shit, I ain't fin to be hiding out, lately
Street life's got a nigga lost, will I wind up in a coffin
I don't know, I'm about to blow, I don't wanna take no mo'
But when I bust in a rush, you better hit the flow
Reality is a motherf**ker, that's what they was telling a nigga
That's just the truth, I lost my nigga Screw 
And Relay too and Andrew, now what about Danny Boo
That's fucked up, growing up in a childhood all alone with nobody
No mama no daddy, Z-Ro I see why these niggas can't relate to us
'Cause we them thugs of another kind
Making these niggas feel us two rhymes
'Cause if they lived the life that we live
They'd probably be broke down, crying and dying

[Chorus]

Living in the ghetto, everyday is a motherfucking test
And I just can't rest, gotta keep a vest around my chest
Seem like everybody wanna start a little plex
Nigga but not me though, I'm trying to focus 
On bigger and brighter thangs
Steady trying to come out the storm
From hurricanes, to heaven and lighter rain
Running away from the police

Nigga fuck peace, its all about war
Nothing but a A-K and a H-K and a Tommy Gun
Sitting in the back of the car, I just can't cope
Everybody is a suspect, even if you don't bust I'ma bust back
We down to ride and, all you little 
Bitches and niggas get off my nut sack
Been eighteen lonely years, since I buried my T Dogs
When I be shooting the breeze
But I'm still conversating like she ain't gone
You can take a look at this light of mine
Never did glimmer, never did shine
'Cause I resort to a life of crime
And I know I'm wrong, but I gotta get mine
Fools don't understand me, a nigga be nervous 24/7
Puffing on sticky, eyes redder than period candy
Look at my pockets, I might as well stop it
Because them hoes on flat, look in the freezer
And a sive, ain't nothing but a stomach, these are hard times

[Chorus]

Ro pass me the AK, one of these niggas
Fin to pay for everything that I'm feeling, ain't no more healing
To the head with lead, is the only thing I'ma be drilling
My nigga this hard times, and the way that it look
I don't think that it's gonna get better, the only thing that's here
Is to suck it up, inside I know that's why we not giving a fuck
Ready to bust, on anything this life feeling, like we on our last breath
I'm quiet as kept, my nigga don't start 
Or else somebody gon see they death
Or hate us like that, but this side of Trae it be like that all times
The only thing that I know more than pain, is pain and me never dying

Poverty stricken and headed to prison
Running because of the life, you looking for codeine
Or amphetamines, I got em at the cheapest price
Living by the rules of the street life, fin to get niggas
Better beat the street light home, after dark I par-park
Everybody be tripping, attempting to get rich
Dig a bigger ditch bitch bleed, I'm a motherfucking man
Trying to do all that I can, I always held my ground
And I never ran, got shot for taking a stand 
I need a plexing, because I'm stressing, losing my mind
Smoking Wesson, my head I'm pressing, hard times

Trae,"I remember dreaming like a king but misery ended up fucked up
Pain turned into fame and had me looking like I locked up
Cherishing every moment, time running so far away (So far away)
Instead of looking for hope I take hate and call it a day
I feel it in the air, tension crowding up my atmosphere
I take it as it is, it ain’t no happy feelings passing here
It’s hard to say who love me, money got the picture faded
You can’t explain going through shit when people think you made it
Everybody got opinions and don’t know what’s going on
I tell em leave me in that zone and end with fuck alone
I’m feeling trapped inside my home, the pressure got me nervous
Praying like a deacon at a church, still ain’t been to service
I feel like this attention left my baby momma with a grudge
I give my kids the world, so why the fuck I’m stuck in front this judge?
I try patience but it’s hard to use it round this motherfucker
Somebody help me ‘fore I lose it round this motherfucker

I’m less than a minute away
Going upside this wall with either my head or hand
I help myself to live for what I love, I’m watching it sink in sand
I feel it down so much the anger got me like I’m trippin’
It’s hard to be a stand-up nigga when ya life is slippin’
Sometimes I wish to bring my partners back up out the ground
Instead of me crying out through this pain and letting it out the sound
I’m on my own 'cause when I look for help, it’s not around
They say they on their way but end up lost like they was out of town
My home is faking any breath of air that snuck up out it
I need to vent before I take these walls the fuck up out it (I'm going crazy)
I’ll burn this bitch up for I let it hurt me any longer
Shit got me rough as hell, I doubt it’ll make me any stronger
The only peace of mind I get is looking at my ceilings
Sometimes it ain’t nothing, other days it’s a wonderful feeling
I close my eyes and end up headed where they say it’s danger
I rather be there 'cause here is nothing but familiar strangers",Tear,2010

See you see it, know it, not me cause my money don’t need it

Giving me head, I call it blowing the mind out

I’m an asshole baby, ain’t no rules

Everywhere I go I see another stank ho
Asking me why I ain’t never hit that
Hit that bitch in the back of the trap house
See me and she holler out there how you gone act now
Run it, and like that I done it
Shove some’ fat into her flat stomach
I have no I
Dea why the bitch gotta be so fly
And why the pussy so good, head so fine
Trying not to bust, nigga can’t hold out
All over everywhere
She hit me, I’m sending her checks just to get her there
I bet she leave that nigga there
Look at her underwear area
Long as the quanity’s quality, the more the merrier
Bet they break up like T-Mobile carriers
Told her, she thought that shit was hilarious

Sendin' me mail

Ain't nothin' changed 
Niggaz slangin' at the same place

Reckon now they feel us 
In this act of war 
more casualties 
no survivors 
Any man the defies us 
Quickly dies

In my quest for chips 
We wear vest 
Equipped with automatic fire 
We reply when my enemies trip 
Me and you against the nation 
Whispering while we conversatin' 
'cause niggaz died over information 
How much more can we take? 
Expect us all to wait 
The world ain't ready for us yet

It's a lotta fucked up shit that go down man,
You don't even know the half)

Man I been in and outta trouble since an adolescents
Spoiled rotten, dead fresh, wit no daddy present
I got two uncles, Quint and Man and they keep me straight
7 and 8, I'm counting money while they moving weight
My daddy send me clothes and always tell me come and see him
I say alright but still I feeling like my momma need him
They sending letters home from school, nobody read mines
And plus my uncles, doing 10 years F.E.D. time
Then I started rebelling, began crack selling
The littlest thing on the corner wit a Mac 11
After school I hear my momma holla homework
I say alright ma, but look I got my own work
Started interacting wit fiends at the age of 13
Now my momma finding rocks in my socks, glocks in my toy box
Like damn, why do trouble come to me like this
But on the real, it ain't even have to be like this (fuck)

I still ain't forgave myself

At 14 man, thought I knew everything
I'm slanging slabs, trapping hard, moving heavy Cain
I bought an '85 cutlass on some dane-a-danes
Now I'm the shit, huh, the motor blew in 30 days
Hardheaded man I ain't listen to anything
I'm getting money so, I'm right and I got plenty game
Besides why I need school, I'ma be rapping momma
If that don't work, then I guess I'ma be trapping momma
But hey I promise I'ma make it cause I'm damn good
I'ma get us out this hood and off these can goods
School just a white man game, and it's ran good
At 16, here's my introduction to manhood
Blue lights behind me, damn what I'm gonna do
Cause I got 2 pounds of weed and a 3.80 too
I guess everything'll be alright if I just keep it cool
How ya doing officer, what ya mean why I ain't in school
Can you search the car? Yea but, I rather that you didn't
Besides it's just a waste of yo time cause ain't nothing in it

3 in the fed, 1 doing life, and 2 dead and gone
Knew there was more to life than selling blow and chopper busting
But what's the good in knowin' better if I ain't tell 'em nothing
I knew I coulda told Cap not to kill shawty
Put down the gun, get in the car let 'em live shawty
You'll probably get locked up, and I'll probably have a deal shawty
Naw, I ain't scared, I'm just telling ya like it is shawty
Could of told Endae, Quint, and Kern, man ya covers blow
Leave that country town alone, y'all needa come back home
Bankhead and J-Rue, I just feel like if I was wit 'em 
They would of never got killed that night if I was 'em
Seem like I could of done mo', said mo'

Sometimes at night I close my eyes, and dream that y'all wit me (damn.)

See the same old things:same dope fiends cops
Just an average day in the streets of California
5-0 find a young girl dead around the corner 
Mommies on her knees she had tears in her eyes
And nobody knew why the young girl had to die
People look ashamed it's been life this fo' years
Bloody sheets on her body face wet from her mama's tears
She couldn'ta been over 4-5 
And if mommy wasn't based she would still be alive
But now the street is a place you could be swallowed by death
Brothas takin' each other's lives
And goin' to REST IN PEACE

My cousin died last year 
And I still can't let go
I walk the streets of my city of my neighborhood
Seein' dope fiends livin' off can goods
15 niggas on the corner
And niggas die young in California
5-0 'll get a dope case and flaunt it
Have your ass on ""America's Most Wanted""

Cause my reflection is a 9 millimeter Gat 
I think about genocide
And have thoughts of my homies who died
Everybody back stabbin
But I ain't the one to talk I'm into gafflin'

Seein' 24 brothas die by the end of the year

Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

Family, you know what I mean son
I mean, you were put in this world by yourself
You're supposed to depend on you 

And nobody else. I mean son
When a man can't function on his own and put his problems on another man
son, what type of man is that? What do you call that type of person? 

Dad, can I curse? 
Son, if you have to express yourself. Tell me, what type of man is that? 
That a punk ass bitch 

Hehehe, damn little P, you bout it, bout it, just like your daddy
Oh wait, one more question before I leave though 

What you want to be when you grow up? 
I want to be a G like you. A No Limit Soldier for life

Makin money ain't shit to me

Fuck the beat up so bad won't nobody get up on it, I
Flow sick, nigga how sick, sea sick
Got your hand out, don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I have some wins, some losses
Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off, lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as it get,
Dope as a mother fuckin' acid trip, 
Fly as 57 passengers
This finna be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it, then get at it
But I ain't gon have it,
No I ain't gon have it

Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt 
Gon' head, spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt,
Fuck you nigga, I know I'm dope
Felt Like I couldn't really give it my all,
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall,
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me,
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top, ain't no where to go now
Instead of me, she gon' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down if I knew what I know now 
I'm scooby, I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin' old, well it's good I'm young
'Fore my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one?
I guess it's gon' be what it's gon' be
But here's one thing ya'll got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me,
Fuck ya'll niggas, I'm out of here

Never mind what haters say, ignore them 'til they fade away.
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away.
Safe to say I paved the way, for you cats to get paid today.
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day.
Consider them my prot??g??, homage I think they should pay.
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way.
I never been a hater still I love them, In a crazy way.
Some say they sold the yay and no they couldn't even work on Labor day.
It ain't that black and white, it has an area that's shaded grey.
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away.
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid.
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away.
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away.
Like I once made them spray, now I could make them plead their case away.
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break.
You'd rather see me catch a case, and watch my future fade away.

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid.
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics.
Articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick.
Whoever having problems with their record sales just holla tip.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow tip.
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it.
Could do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy.
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguing.
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in.
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'.
The cheques into your bank account and you up out of poverty.
Your values is a disarray, prioritizing horribly.
Unhappy with the riches cause your piss poor morally.
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning.
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we?

Lost playa type of cat

Tellin' you that you fine, but he ain't spendin' no time
I be pourin' wine, tryin' to, knock out your spine
Make you mine, from behind, to some slowed down ""Bump n' Grind""
His thang like a dirty Sweet, from off the street
My thang like a O' of indo, from Sacramento
Lately y'all been monkeyin', he, call you a bitch
Keep me all up in yo' shit, try'na dig you a new ditch
Now I admit, that he rich, and that his money is good
Got my dicked sucked in his 'Six, I'm fuckin' on leather and wood
I'm just a yougin' from the hood, with some dick if ya good
With him, you know that you shouldn't
With me, you know that you should
Go pussy thug, like a glove when I push and I shove
Knock a dime out the climb, cause I ain't makin' love
See yo' man the type of guy, to get jealous and hit'cha
But me, I lick ya where he don't, and suck real hard on yo' nipple
My game is sharp as a cicle, she love my pickle
And if you gave her a dime, nigga she gave me a nickel

Don't take it personal my nigga

Well naturally, I have to be, dead serious, maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me

Yea son, what is that, what you call that? 
Dad, that only be two words. PLAYA HATA 

Huh, you got that right son. Look like you gonna past this test
But I got one more question for you
Son, if any man depends on another man and can't think on his own
Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

Family, you know what I mean son
I mean, you were put in this world by yourself
You're supposed to depend on you 

And nobody else. I mean son
When a man can't function on his own and put his problems on another man
son, what type of man is that? What do you call that type of person? 

Dad, can I curse? 
Son, if you have to express yourself. Tell me, what type of man is that? 
That a punk ass bitch 

Hehehe, damn little P, you bout it, bout it, just like your daddy
Oh wait, one more question before I leave though 

What you want to be when you grow up? 
I want to be a G like you. A No Limit Soldier for life

But now that nothing is something, and I be bringing 'em down

Up out of Texas, with diamonds all over my necklace
I keep they head checking, pass to profession
And can't nobody contest, 'cause that's the way we are a legend

Sipping on mud, trying to keep my head long from slugs

Nothing, now collecting dividends to ride a Benz
Down I-10, dropping the top in the wind

So want you ride with me, my ghetto queen
You're all that I need
Cause she my ghetto queen, I give her what she need
Money ain't a thing, she stay down like a G [x2]

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Girl I done been around the globe and you the realest lil'lady I know
Don't wanna ever let you go - cause oh
Everytime I call you be there for me
Baby girl I love you by my side
So anything you need, that means you got me
So just my ghetto queen gon' take that ride

[Verse 1: Trae]
Look here lil'momma I'm gangsta
Prolly nothin like you done delt with on the day to day
Some say that I'm a star, but in the hood I'm better known as Trae
I'm from around the way - where not too many make it out
And even if I did it's in my blood I'll never take it out
You say you got a man but I ain't tryna take his spot
I'm tryna be ya partna while I'm late night flippin on the block
So we can post up on this glass, tippin the Chevrolet 
And get it, how we get it, then I'm gettin right back out ya way
I'm in my zone so all that drama you can leave at home
Ya man can lock you down, but me ain't nothin - rollin stone
And if you wanna chill tell his ass to leave you alone
Cause if he run up on me, I'm a run my fist upside his dome
Understand when I say I'm grown, and on that other shit
I'm tryna make a team but I ain't feelin all that lover shit
I'm tryna hit the lights and take it to you on that rubber shit
And keep it G, and leave it on that undercover shit

[Chorus: Lloyd]

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Ay lay back with me, feel free lil'momma
We can go the Bahamas in the summer
Lookin for the fat[? ], fuck the dumb hoes
And know that you'll ride with me baby fuck the po - po's
No pressure I ain't gotta test ya
I can leave you in my house with a hundred thousand on the dresser
Me and you - my beautiful bitch, so glamorous
So bad niggas pullin out they cameras
Together baby the world can't handle us
Hoes can't compete, no challengers
Summer time, we float on the boat
While I sip a lil'lean, and you puff a lil'smoke
I'm married to my money, but you could be my honey
The groupie bitches dump me - but I know that you love me
So on that note you can take this
Me and you be shinin harder then them diamonds on my wrist, M.O.B!

[Chorus: Lloyd]

[Verse 3: Rich Boy]
We can ride in my drop and spend some money on some Fendi
You never ask what type of gold diggers try to get me
Them hoes are silly, but I pass 'em in the Hemi
If a mothafucker touch you - I'm a hit 'em with that semi
You down like my nigga, so you know I got yo'back
Anybody put they hands on you, I'm a lay 'em flat
So spread ya wings baby come on let's fly
I'm down with my lady till the day that I die

[Verse 4: Trae]
Say lil'momma what you waitin on - actin like you don't know no better
You say you tired of that shit, then roll with me and it's whatever
When in the presence of a gangsta don't worry I got ya
And fuck the stress, give me a sec - I'm a get that up out ya
So get ya spot I'm on the grind right now
I'm prolly less then two seconds away from shine right now
You can post up and be the bitch I'm tryna find right now
And if you can't see that I'm tha truth baby you blind right now, Yeah

I’m a player so I can’t choose

Pimp truth, me and Pimp got the same views
Fly with it like I’m Jordan, nigga same shoes
Anything she talking bout she better be about

Turned up like the seventies
Sex tape filmed in 7D

I fucked your bitch and filmed it

Begging me to [?] whip it like baking soda
Her nigga [?] so I’m taking over
Look at that ass, she might get the business
Talking so much, you might never finish
The way you sit up, talking broke a Guinness
I’m like a four door old school
Double slide through the city, Truth so cool
Ain’t no telling what might happen when I roll through
I’m an asshole baby, ain’t no rules

I’m the king of the bankroll
Rubber band ain’t even gone fit that
Everywhere I go I see another stank ho
Asking me why I ain’t never hit that
Hit that bitch in the back of the trap house
See me and she holler out there how you gone act now
Run it, and like that I done it
Shove some’ fat into her flat stomach
I have no I
Dea why the bitch gotta be so fly
And why the pussy so good, head so fine
Trying not to bust, nigga can’t hold out
All over everywhere
She hit me, I’m sending her checks just to get her there
I bet she leave that nigga there
Look at her underwear area
Long as the quanity’s quality, the more the merrier
Bet they break up like T-Mobile carriers
Told her, she thought that shit was hilarious
Thought that shit was hilarious
Shit, I’ma bend her over right quick
I’m sick of waiting on that pussy, finna go and get it over with
Put that ass in motion, and send her home to her man later on

You ain't never had a friend like me 
Believe dat 
Cause you ain't never had a friend like me 
See at night I watch the sky 
I take another breath 
I smoke my new joint to the bud 
Like it's the last muthafucker left 
Just me and you evading enemies 
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy 
Ain't never had a friend like me 
Remember memories so vividly 
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G 
Who can I call when they all fail 
Collect calls to my Dogz from the County Jail 
Sendin' me mail 
Heard the blocks in the same shape 
Ain't nothin' changed 
Niggaz slangin' at the same place 
The same faces 
We suppose to alwayz hate our foes 
This lifestyle is forever 
Watch the game unfold 
Shedding Crocodile tears 
Just got Life plus 
And you wonder if these white judges like us 
Just Stay Strong 
We'll appeal 
Nigga You'll be free 
Down with cha to the very end 
Cause you ain't never had a friend like me 
[Chorus X2] 
I'm down for you so ride with me 
My enemies your enemies 
Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me 
Nobody knows where we'll be 
My Enemies your enemies 
Cause you ain't never had a friend like me 
How can I be blamed 
Forgive me Lord I'm insane 
In search of fame 
Won't hurt to change 
Follow in foot steps of past dealers 
Equipped with ski masks 
No witnesses, as we blast fearless 
Reckon now they feel us 
In this act of war 
more casualties 
no survivors 
Any man the defies us 
Quickly dies 
'cause we Ridahs 
In my quest for chips 
We wear vest 
Equipped with automatic fire 
We reply when my enemies trip 
Me and you against the nation 
Whispering while we conversatin' 
'cause niggaz died over information 
How much more can we take? 
Expect us all to wait 
The world ain't ready for us yet 
So lets make Clinton pay 
(haha) 
They never wanted us to make it 
Everything that we posses 
We had to fight and take it 
I think the president is smoking weed 
Bumpin' his beat 
Makin' a livin' out of my misery 
Till he got a friend like me 
[Chorus X2] 
Promise to visit 
I know it's rough in your cell 
Receiving mail to the county jail 
This is hell 
When I was young 
I could picture livin' 
In Luxury 
So how the fuck did I end up in prison? 
Fuckin' snitches 
They got me crossed by my own side 
I found him by his self 
No drama, he alone die 
Nobody cry 
Should have never testified 
You got my nigga 25 
So now I sacrifice your life 
Help to separate me and my dog 
Broken ties 
Why the fuck should I let you live? 
When I'm dead inside 
Rapid fire my delivery 
I'm bustin' at their whole crew 
Nigga remember me 
Hit up my Outlaw set 
Then throw my pistol in the ocean 
Ditch my ski mask 
And get to straight coastin' 
It's visitin' day at San Quinton 
Always there to see your closest row dog

Trae Tha Truth,"(Still ain't forgave myself, damn
It's a lotta fucked up shit that go down man,
You don't even know the half)

Man I been in and outta trouble since an adolescents
Spoiled rotten, dead fresh, wit no daddy present
I got two uncles, Quint and Man and they keep me straight
7 and 8, I'm counting money while they moving weight
My daddy send me clothes and always tell me come and see him
I say alright but still I feeling like my momma need him
They sending letters home from school, nobody read mines
And plus my uncles, doing 10 years F.E.D. time
Then I started rebelling, began crack selling
The littlest thing on the corner wit a Mac 11
After school I hear my momma holla homework
I say alright ma, but look I got my own work
Started interacting wit fiends at the age of 13
Now my momma finding rocks in my socks, glocks in my toy box
Like damn, why do trouble come to me like this
But on the real, it ain't even have to be like this (fuck)

Mistakes made on this road to wealth 
I still ain't forgave myself
Hey, what I am today 
I made myself but I still ain't forgave myself
For running to the grave getting closer to death 
I still ain't forgave my self
For anyone who ever wondered how I felt
I still ain't forgave myself

At 14 man, thought I knew everything
I'm slanging slabs, trapping hard, moving heavy Cain
I bought an '85 cutlass on some dane-a-danes
Now I'm the shit, huh, the motor blew in 30 days
Hardheaded man I ain't listen to anything
I'm getting money so, I'm right and I got plenty game
Besides why I need school, I'ma be rapping momma
If that don't work, then I guess I'ma be trapping momma
But hey I promise I'ma make it cause I'm damn good
I'ma get us out this hood and off these can goods
School just a white man game, and it's ran good
At 16, here's my introduction to manhood
Blue lights behind me, damn what I'm gonna do
Cause I got 2 pounds of weed and a 3.80 too
I guess everything'll be alright if I just keep it cool
How ya doing officer, what ya mean why I ain't in school
Can you search the car? Yea but, I rather that you didn't
Besides it's just a waste of yo time cause ain't nothing in it
(Laugh) I guess that's when I seen, that I ain't know shit
When stuck in a place wit freedom I ain't gone get (Damn!)

Mistakes made on this road to wealth 
I still ain't forgave myself
Hey, what I am today, I made myself 
But I still ain't forgave myself
Guess these the chances ya take, when dealt the cards I was dealt
But I still ain't forgave myself
For anyone who ever wondered how I felt
I still ain't forgave myself

Outta all the niggas I was wit when I was doing wrong
3 in the fed, 1 doing life, and 2 dead and gone
Knew there was more to life than selling blow and chopper busting
But what's the good in knowin' better if I ain't tell 'em nothing
I knew I coulda told Cap not to kill shawty
Put down the gun, get in the car let 'em live shawty
You'll probably get locked up, and I'll probably have a deal shawty
Naw, I ain't scared, I'm just telling ya like it is shawty
Could of told Endae, Quint, and Kern, man ya covers blow
Leave that country town alone, y'all needa come back home
Bankhead and J-Rue, I just feel like if I was wit 'em 
They would of never got killed that night if I was 'em
Seem like I could of done mo', said mo'
Why all my partners gotta be dead or in the fed for??
All the time, I just wish that y'all could ball wit me
Sometimes at night I close my eyes, and dream that y'all wit me (damn.)

And even though they say I can't blame myself
I still ain't forgave myself

Trae Tha Truth,"Welcome to the ghetto

Livin' day by day in my hood on the spot
See the same old things:same dope fiends cops
Just an average day in the streets of California
5-0 find a young girl dead around the corner 
Mommies on her knees she had tears in her eyes
And nobody knew why the young girl had to die
People look ashamed it's been life this fo' years
Bloody sheets on her body face wet from her mama's tears
She couldn'ta been over 4-5 
And if mommy wasn't based she would still be alive
But now the street is a place you could be swallowed by death
Brothas takin' each other's lives
And goin' to REST IN PEACE
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto 
My cousin died last year 
And I still can't let go
I walk the streets of my city of my neighborhood
Seein' dope fiends livin' off can goods
15 niggas on the corner
And niggas die young in California
5-0 'll get a dope case and flaunt it
Have your ass on ""America's Most Wanted""
But I don't slang or either gang-bang
And though my old school homies do the same thang
I still got love 'cause you gotta live
So you can give
And raise a family G
But you gotta do your best slangin D-O-P-E
So keep a grip on yourself and stay mellow
And welcome to the ghetto

Welcome to the ghetto 
(welcome hard up with it to my life) 

From across the seas comes cocaine
But you never seen a black man fly the plane
Look at the news:a young black death
Was it drug related,take a guess
I flash when I look in the mirror black
Cause my reflection is a 9 millimeter Gat 
I think about genocide
And have thoughts of my homies who died
Everybody back stabbin
But I ain't the one to talk I'm into gafflin'
Death gives a shit about your color
But yet I see mo dead young brothas
I'm goin' crazy out here
Seein' 24 brothas die by the end of the year
And I still gotta deal with the 5-0
And I stopped sellin' dope in 9-0
But if I came to it 
I probably still do it
Put a Nine in my draws get straight to it 
I hope that I never see the day  
That I get 20 years for a cake 
B-K-A as a key
So open up the door for the mo money
But I ain't gotta do that G
Cause I'm down with the F-A to the see to the you to the L-T-why
 G-nut X-tra Large and S-P-I-see-E make niggas feel like jello

So loud that a nigga can't hear you

Niggas shot out my windows, they jealous and envy
They spit on my 'Rari, they keyed up my Bentley
They went at my top dog like Ab-Soul and Kendrick

Somebody gon' give it to me, or get one up in the brain
Mama used to stroke it just to feed me scraps
Every Saturday, it was YO! MTV raps
Got sick of looking at other niggas that ain't deserve it
So I followed my older brother to beat these traps
I ain't worried about the love, I've seen everything
The hood hot, like the devil had it off in his hands
Send a strap your way, I seen a couple of fans
Last pack, I took that and a couple of bands
If I ain't hustle to eat, I was doing that sippin' Screw

But I need that money, better not crumb me
Pockets fat as my codeine tummy
Trying to get blow like my nose was runny
I work for mine, you can't take that from me
Wrap it up, like Egyptian mummy
And have it ready when I roll on up

Brother had bricks, but didn't give me shit
So when he went to the pen, I ain't send him shit

See dopamine is what your brain is makin' when your feelin' happy
So, if your tryna' feel what I feel then yo get at me
And me? I get me fix from all sorts of shit
Every night with a glass of milk with some Oreo's I can dip
Fresh pot of mom's sauce, macaroni, meatballs
That smell of Sour Diesel when I open up the jar
Break it up and rollin' somethin', breakin' off a ho I'm fuckin'
Pop a little ecstasy and get that serotonin pumpin'
Goin' commando in a pair of sweats
Reruns of Sopranos up on my TV set
And that dopamine be flowin' on stage
Feel it every time that shit is goin' my way
It's chillin' with your best homies
The spittin' game and it's gettin' laid and that after sex bogie
Any time you feelin' good, it's what your brain produces
So my fans will get their fix every time they bumpin' my music

I'm like a Power Ranger the way I'm mighty morphing
Into a rocket ship, that's taking off into space as I get lost
Thanks to stimulating endorphins, brings me closer to the coffin
Walk on the edge, cuz' I'm on the ledge
Wake up, when they go to bed
Got these cowards runnin' a bounty hunter like a Boba Fett
Life is like a drug, born addicted like crack babies
Tryin' ta' get that fix, you gonna hurt your back, like the Bag Lady
Goodbye dude, I expose these niggas', I got to
These niggas' heads bigger than yakoo, it's not cool
Lyrical mournings, gettin' us gory as biblical stories, you ignoren' the allegories
Tryin' to feel good; it's Aleister Crowley
Rush of that adrenaline is my medicine
My fuel is my kerosene
You ever live the life of a heretic?
That, dopamine, from the smoke the coke the lean
Is temporary when your third eye ain't opening

I'm just tryna' get my fix

Bitch on my lap, gyratin'
Loud so loud, my lungs vibratin'
High as a bitch I'm up skyscappin'
Annihilatin' some kind of [?]

And the fire's escapin', though your fire escape em'
Until I lie in your basement
Arise in the pavement just to arrive from inside of a spaceship

I chase Hennessey with dopamine
This is dope, I mean, I ain't sober
Promethazine in my soda, I'm suppose ta lean
My momma cookin'? Encore

The two beautiful kids I stay alive for

You feelin' loud with me and Webby, rockin on that trill shit
Feelin' bliss, like its that fattest joint you ever hit
Higher than you've ever been, of course you know you're feelin' this
With that fellin' that you get when you open up your
Bag of weed waiting for the first hit anxiously
With the rush; when the Lakers beat the Celtics
The smile on your face when the joint lit, and ya smelt it
We the vibe at the party, when that shits about to turn up
We the ""hell ya"", ya thinkin' when the dabs about to burn up

Shoulda' been cased on it
Causing panic, now the living shoes laced on it
Haters on dick, look like they want to face on it
Money, long slates, givin' a open chase on it
I'm fully sober, my fix is chicks and change
And ride, n' lookin' amazing, n' something so strange
I hit the hood, just to kick it with homies
No, they need it for support, everyone that promote it
I best to dodge the phoney, cuz' I don't understand them
And I ain't tryn'
I'm the truth and I don't fuck with that [mind?], stay from [?]
Hit the studio to blackout, maybe try gettin' packed out
Just like somebody wanted this as soon as I blow it back out
I might just give a laugh as I proceed to knock a track out
And burned up the speakers in trunk tryna' act out
Say [?] [?] [?], I'm on my turn up
Get [tightest?] in them [?], [?] me a drink, you bout to turn up

Trae Tha Truth,"I just wanna show the world

And it ain't no mistake that I'm this good
I just done seen a lot, know what I'm talkin bout

The definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel this lil' nigga

I got my own voice (blessed)
Sing my own hooks (blessed)
Fresh fade nice smile I got my own look (fresh)
I just like to make people happy (for real)
4 kids I just like being a good dad
But I'm a gangsta and I rock shows (you ain't see my shows)
A people person so you know lil' boosie got hoes
Damn hoes that's a figure speech
Get a lotta shit like that when you listen to me
This for my fans I love y'all
Straight up y'all a part of me so when they hate
They hate us
Money keep a nigga going, do better things
Man I take it to the bank, I don't make it rain
But I'm fly like weezy
Plus the hood niggas man they believe me like jeezy
And I just like to have a good time
Hit the yo smoke one and put my life in my rhymes

Father forgive me I was raised on some real shit
So I can't sugar coat shit, not a lil' bit
Inside I'm sad about my dad
Since I lost my grams ain't been giving a damn
But I still hold my head high
And sometimes I cry
But when I cry man I don't know why
I feel trapped to be a superstar
100 thousand worth of jewelry to end it
And I spend it, no problems
You don't like badass then that's your problem
M.o.b wouldn't give a damn if they hoes holla
Love cars love broads with a passion
Ain't never have shit so I'm flashy
I work hard go and get it on the road
Seven month run 750 out for shows get it?
I'm hood rich still smokin' that good shit
Still got the same hood clique straight up

We gon' show the world

You gotta feel this lil' hustla (boosie badass)

She ain't even look surprise gave me another f

Still in the trap, keep it real like Madea

Damn, young ni**a attitude, like f**k it
Still tryna make it out the bucket
Light feather all time low still
Tryna figure out how the f**k he finna duck it
He gotta ride it out before he crash
He on his hustle tryna get the cash
Can’t focus, s**t’s spinning fast
Laws on him, hope he’s got his work stashed
Loud work, hope it don’t smell
Can’t afford to take another L
First class, no feeling
F**k school he about to fail
It’s all him, he ain’t finna tell
He on his own, he ain’t finna bail
Either way, he on his way to jail

Oh, don’t recall all the tears, all along
Children of men, children of men

Look, now we in the prison cell

Fresh shakes take him to the mic he hit it
They gon' catch bi**h he on his way
Try to stop him and it’s gonna be on today
Solitary confinement every day
F**k em all only thing he know to say
Now it’s time up, he a free man
Gates open, thinking of another plan
Where he finna go, what he finna do
Finna be a couple those, he coming through
Then it’s back to the hood S on his chest
F**k Super, that nia stressed
He going through hell like he never blessed
Every day in pain, nothing less
Pills in, zoned out, right plan, wrong route
Opportunity present itself in the kitchen
Guarantee he shows what he’s bout
Under pressure no slack
F**k jail he ain’t going back
Only way you leaving is a box
And you can tell everyone that’s a fact
Had my back, on his pistol
Black clouds, black rain
To his head, where he aim
Feel the same now the bullet in his brain

In the trap still tryna get this load out
Fast money I would never take a slow route

I recommend you role with it or get rolled out
I dedicate it to the n****s who done sold out
I guess I was chose

I am the s***, no need to check your nose

Cut a few n****s off that were bringing me down
Now I'm on top like three lid
Why you never really see a n**** trip out, pray this s*** gon' really out, blessed to be here
I'm just a n**** from the slum, now I'm rich with a get money gut like a n**** drink beer
Made it out the hole, almost ended off the road
Now I'm on and out the road state to state doing shows
Came a long way from kicking doors, stealing n**** bowls
Or sleeping on the floor
And walkin' to the store
Now I might pull up in a roll when you walkin on more
Whoever knew that the streets did take me this far
Used to rock G shocks now I might rock the rollie or flaunt that Audemar
Bosses be the magic used to make Paris
Now I got Houston just to order seafood salad
Thank god for the times that a n**** did struggle
(Everything happens for a reason)

If I had to take the choice between the deaf man and the blind
I know just where my feet should go and that's enough for me
I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea

Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing all towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, Just look behind

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt

When I was a young boy I lived for rock 'n' roll
We spent our time playing gigs and traveling on the road
And we didn't have much money and the gigs were sometimes rough
But playing music for the people seemed to be enough
And the music is so sweet that it makes me tap my feet
And my mind is very high, I can almost touch the sky

Now I am a young man dressed in sparkling coloured clothes
A country house and sixty acres are a heavy load
We still have no money but we have some nice things
Possession is, possessions are the trait that money brings
And the snowflakes are so sweet as they fall around our feet
And my mind is very high, I can almost feel the sky

Now I am an old man, I know exactly what to do
Never ask a question or ever give an answer to you
And when you pass me by and you drop a penny in my hat
Don't feel sorry on my account 'cause life can be like that
And the music is so sweet that it makes me tap my feet
And my mind is very high, I can almost feel the sky
And the river rolls along like a never ever ending song
And the river rolls along like a never ever ending song

Ouais c'est Rako Charlie Delta j'ai fréquenté
J'ai charbonné toujours cagoulé ganté
Ces bouffons disent qu'on n'sait faire qu'danser et chanter
Mais ça graille, c'est la B, plus besoin d'se présenter
Si on s'déplace c'est uniquement pour chiffrer
Salope on est chibrés
Et s'il y a haja calibré
Avec lui t'as grandi, mais il t'as péta tes quettes-pla
Méfie toi de tes amis un ennemi ça ne trahit pas

Tragas,"Today I took some paper from the closet
And wrapped the wedding ring
You left behind
And I addressed it to the man
Who vowed to love you
And on the little card
I wrote these words inside

[Chorus]
Merry Christmas to me
Just one gift beneath my tree
For the fool who let you leave
Merry Christmas to me

Then I sat down in my chair
And thought about you
About the many reasons why you're gone 
And I opened up the present that I gave me
And realized how much it hurts to be alone

[Chorus]

I'm the fool who let you leave
Merry Christmas to me",Merry Christmas to Me,2008
Tragédie,"Maintenant qu'on se connaît mieux qu'avant
Je peux te faire part de mes sentiments
Nos cœurs se sont rapprochés
Je désire le toucher
Et te prouver malgré tout
Que nos différences
Ne furent que délivrance

Il m'a fallu du temps pour comprendre
Mais aujourd'hui je sais ce que j’ai trouvé
Quand tu me dis que je suis
Celui que t'as choisi
Mon cœur s'emballe
Sous ton charme
Je ne peux te dire ""bye bye""

Tu es ce que j'ai toujours recherchée
Celle que mon cœur a toujours désirée
La lumière quand dans le noir je me perds
Graver le temps
Toujours ensemble
Éternellement

J'ai fait mon choix
Il ne reste que toi
Déclarer ma flamme
Ne suffirait pas
Je veux te montrer tout ce qu'il y a en moi

Tu as bouleversé
Toute mon existence
Je ne peux pas demeurer dans le silence
Quand je te verrai
Il me faudra trouver la force
De te dire tout ça

Prends le même chemin que moi
Jamais se séparer
Vieillir au près de toi
Je l'ai toujours désiré",Eternellement,1995

Tragédie,"Quand rien ne va
Et que tout est livide
Quand les tracas
S'installent dans ta vie
Et si parfois tu doutes
Que ca entrave ta route
Positif, attentif tu dois etre
Pour etre au bon niveau.

Aux soucis dis bye bye
Ton ancienne vie bye bye
Au passe dis bye bye
Tout c' qui est gris bye bye
Ta tristesse bye bye
A ces pleurs bye bye
Chante avec moi bye bye.

Et ! Quand tes paroles
On discerne l'amertume
Ne laissant qu'une place a un coeur en tumulte
Et puis que tout s'envole
Que tout seul tu t'isoles fait ce qu'il faut
Reprend le dessus t'en seras pas decu
Tu verras le bonheur, saura vaincre tes peurs
Sache te relever et puis recommencer tout ce qu'il faut

Carpe diem, cette vie je l'aime
Malgre ce passe qui coule dans mes veines
Je viens de la ou le soleil danse avec les peuples
Ou on pense avec le coeur
Ou on panse les douleurs
A l'oeil l'espoir et l'envie de vivre
Plus envie de survivre
Et de te lever que pour les vivres
Comment se dire qu'ici tout est lege
Alors qu'ailleurs des momes du meme age
Ont la faim en guise de cage
La life est short bonhomme
Pas le temps de se perdre dedans
Vis sans te demander si le monde t'attend
prends le train s'en attendre
Affronte, risque, confronte sans te vendre.

Laisse-moi te conter l'histoire 
De la fille de l'autre soir
Elle me plaît mais j'avoue
Qu'entre elle et moi tout est flou
Saurait-elle deviner
C'est sur elle que j'ai tout misé
Alors j'y crois j'baisse pas les bras
Je ne la veux que pour moi 

On s'est promis de s'attendre
Un gentleman sait comprendre 
oh, oh, oh, oh amicalement vôtre
Et je ne saurais résister 
Quand ce corps sait m'appeler 
Oh, oh, oh amoureusement
