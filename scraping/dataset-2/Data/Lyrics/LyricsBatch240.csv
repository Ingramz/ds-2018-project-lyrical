Esquire All Stars,"Do nothing till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seams
Of other one's dreams, is over my head

Do nothing till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word
Of others you've heard, I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please, do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never will

When they see you out with me

Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong

Esquivel,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part
",Canadian Sunset,1962
Esquivel,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing

Esquivel,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1994

Esquivel,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream

Esquivel,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Esquivel,"Desert shadows creep across purple sands.
Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,
I see my long lost blossom of shalimar

You, Misirlou, Are the moon and the sun, fairest one.

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.

Esquivel y su Orquesta,"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie
 
Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be

Esquivel y su Orquesta,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Esquivel y su Orquesta,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2006
Esquizito,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2006

In and outta trouble 
But I focused on the hustle 
While still remainin' humble 
On this road to success 
You meet a lot of hatas

Never under estimate the power of the mind 
Never under estimate a kid that wanna shine

In the prisons doin' time 
Or in the streets dealin' dope 
This is for my women raisin kids without a man 
Workin' 2 jobs doin' everything they can

Never give up on the fight

Est Chester University Of Pennsylvania Gracenotes,"Fred sits alone at his desk in the dark
There's an awkward young shadow that waits in the hall
He's cleared all his things and he's put them in boxes
Things that remind him: 'Life has been good'
Twenty-five years
He's worked at the paper
A man's here to take him downstairs

And I'm sorry, Mister Jones
It's time

There was no party, there were no songs
'Cause today's just a day like the day that he started
No one is left here that knows his first name
And life barrels on like a runaway train
Where the passengers change
They don't change anything
You get off, someone else can get on

And I'm sorry, Mister Jones

Streetlight shines through the shades
Casting lines on the floor, and lines on his face
He reflects on the day
Fred gets his paints out and goes to the basement
Projecting some slides onto a plain white
Canvas and traces it
Fills in the spaces
He turns off the slides, and it doesn't look right
Yeah, and all of these bastards
Have taken his place
He's forgotten but not yet gone

Und hast es so oft geschafft mir das Leben zu retten
Ich würde weniger sprechen, wärst du nicht ein Teil von mir
Wir haben noch so viel vor, dürfen keine Zeit verlieren
Du bist mein Tatort, du bist mein Sprachrohr
Mal bist du ganz sanft, mal bist du Hardcore
Doch um dem ganzen Stress hier zu entfliehen
Bist du immer noch die beste Medizin, was da los huh?
Man kann dich mit jedem Lifestyle verbinden
Du bist zeitlos, ich will mit dir die Freizeit verbringen
Und geht es mir mal schlecht heute
Bist du morgen immer noch für mich da

Denn du bist immer da, wenn mich der Rest enttäuscht
Und bin ich mal am Fallen oder schlecht gelaunt
Bist du meine Rettung, wie ein Halt, denn du fängst mich auf!
Ich mein ich könnt das nie alleine schaffen
Du machst den Unterschied, die größte meiner Leidenschaften!
Du motivierst mich immer wieder zum Weitermachen
Nur wegen dir genieße ich gerade den Hype der Massen!
Yeah und ich fühle den Beat, jeden Tag
Es geht gar nichts über die Musik

Esta,"Es war 2005,
Ich scheiterte am Takt, niemand glaubte es,
Doch ich war stehts der Meinung das ichs schaff'
Ich hab mir alles hier alleine beigebracht
Ganz alleine meistens schrieb' ich meine Zeilen in der Nacht
Ich saß wie besessen daheim
Und war ständig auf der Suche nach dem besseren Reim
Nächtelang am Texteschreiben, schlafen wurde Nebensache
Keine Chance, ich konnte Rap auf einmal nicht mehr gehen lassen

Und ich blick' in die Gesichter,
All' die ganzen Hater sind erstaunt,
Ich hab's durchgezogen, keiner von euch hält mich jetzt noch auf
Das geht an alle die mir immer wieder schlechtes wollten,
Weiger mich noch irgendeinem Hurensohn Respekt zu zollen.
Kein Image, kein Fake, ein echtes Statement.
Alle Zweifel sind beseitigt mit EstAtainment.
Ich bring die Wichser jetzt mit Ehrlichkeit zur Strecke.
Es zu dem tA, es spricht mein Herz wenn ich hier rappe.
Ich würde diesen Weg nie gehn' wenn er einfach wär'.
Man ich bin so stolz, dass hier ist mehr als nur mein Meisterwerk.
Ganz egal, dass ich nicht bekannter als die andren bin.
Sie solln nur wissen wo zu ich verdammtnochmal im Stande bin.
Mir ist egal, ob sie mich hassen oder lieben,
Denn ich bleib mir einfach treu, niemals lass ich mich verbiegen.
Auch wenn sich mein Schicksal irgendwann einmal zum Schlechten wendet,
Bin ich trotzdem aus der Szene einfach nichtmehr weg zu denken.

Kann schon sein, dass viele Leute mich hassen,
Doch es war nie mein Ziel mir irgendwelche Freunde zu machen.
Auch wenn so viele prophezeien, dass ich Falle,
Bleib ich steh'n  immer noch alleine gegen alle.
Ich muss hier keinem was beweisen beim Rappen,
Schreib' die Zeilen nur um einfach mal ein Zeichen zu setzen.
Auch wenn so viele prophezeien, dass ich Falle, bleib ich steh'n,
Immer noch alleine gegen alle.

Und ich frag mich ernsthaft, was ist nur passiert? Alle können mich seit Neustem leiden.
Auf einmal will jeder Pisser, mit mir befreundet sein.
Als hätt' ich mein Stolz mit Füßen getreten.
'Lass ich mit jedem Handschlag eine neue Lüge entstehn.
Das ist nun vorbei, die Zeiten haben sich geändert.
Die Gesichter sind auf einmal nur noch farblos wie Gespenster.
Auch wenn ich das VBT nun hinter mir lass',
Spühr ich im Nacken einfach immer den Hass. (Immer den Hass)

Sie haten weiter, warum unterscheibst du bei Saad?
Mal im Ernst, hab' ich euch je nach eurer Meinung gefragt?
Ich geb' ein Fuck das ihr behauptet ich sei als Halunke fehl am Platz.
Bleibt mal schön in euren Foren während ich Karriere mach'
Ihr wisst doch selbst, nur ein toter Fisch schwimmt mit dem Strom.
Neun Jahre gegen Pol. Am Ende hat es sich gelohnt.
Ich bleib für immer provokant und kontrovers.
Und wenn es irgendwelchen Leuten so nicht passt, dann kommt doch her.

Ich war die ganzen Jahre stehts auf mich alleine gestellt.
Ich hab mir das hier alles ehrlich verdient.
Es zu dem tA, sieh ich charte mit dem ersten Realease.

Doch ich hab einfach immer weiter daran festgehalten.
Früher wurd' ich nur belächelt wie ein schlechter Witz,
Heute rap ich Hits und alle rappen meine Texte mit.

Esta,"Das hier ist mehr als nur ein Song, das ist ne Herzenssache
Weißt du noch wir waren beste Freunde seit der ersten Klasse
Wir teilten alles, teilen war für uns ne Ehrensache
Doch nun ist so vieles anders und das macht mir schwer zu schaffen
Ich kann mich gut erinnern wir hatten die Schule satt
In den Ferien jeden Tag ab 10 Uhr auf dem Fußballplatz
Regen oder Schnee hat uns damals nie etwas ausgemacht
Den kleinsten stets ins Tor gestellt, mann hab 'n wir so laut gelacht
Dann ging ich weg, eine Welt ist zerfallen
Doch du und meine Freunde haben hier die Stellung gehalten
Ich kam zurück, wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Da erfuhr ich von den Jungs du bist mit anderen unterwegs
Ich war erstmal geschockt, doch ich wusste auch das ändert sich
Denn wir waren wie Brüder und einen Bruder verlässt man nicht
Alles das hat uns zusammengschweißt, was alleine ? Tzz
Dann waren wir halt zusammen allein!

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen

Was ich denke schreib ich heute auf Papier
Wir waren unerfahren und wollten so viel Neues ausprobieren
Doch, leider zählte zu dem Neuem auch die Drogen
Und die ganze Scheiße stellte unsere Freundschaft auf die Probe
Doch, war ich mies gelaunt, abgefuckt und stur
Hattest du stets ein freies Ohr, wie bei ner Undercutfrisur. Yeah
Weißt du noch wir waren so oft die ganze Nacht on Tour
Manchmal lösten wir Probleme nicht ,doch andere mit Bravur
Und ich weiß du hast jetzt eine Familie, die dich braucht
Aber was ist mit deinen Freunden, ey wir brauchen dich doch auch!
Man ich freu mich echt dich glücklich zu sehen
Aber Freundschaft heißt auch auf die Freunde Rücksicht zu nehmen, Diggah
Du bist doch wie ein zweiter Bruder für mich
Sagst so oft du wirst dich melden warum tust du es nicht ?
Vielleicht haben wir uns auseinander gelebt
Denn jeder geht nun seinen eigenen, einen anderen Weg

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen

Schade, dass sich unsere Wege nur noch selten kreuzen
Früher hat mir nur die Zeit mit dir die Welt bedeutet
Jetzt ist einfach nichts mehr wie es war
Aber solltest du mich brauchen bin ich da keine Frage Mann !
Ich blick zurück mit 2 lachenden Augen
Wir sind schon 20 Jahre Freunde, man ich fasse es kaum
Und ich schätze dich sehr, du bist ein herzensguter Mensch
Doch ich schätze umso mehr, dass ich dich kenn ! Geh dein' Weg Bruder !

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen",Lass dich gehen,2013
Esta,"Ich seh' Neid in ihren Augen sie zerreißen sich das Maul
Lektion Eins schnell gelernt man darf keinem hier vertrauen
Ich bin's Leid warum labern alle hinter meinem Rücken
Junge du willst mir was sagen man dann triff mich in Saarbrücken
Und wenn du vor mir stehst lass ich nur noch Taten sprechen
Erster Schlag, Vorbereiten zweiter Schlag, Nase brechen
Du meinst du würdest viel besser rappen als EstA
Find ich geil sag das doch mal meinem messerstechenden Backup
Zu viele Maskenrapper machen aggressiv oder
Anders gesagt, verdammt ich hasse was du liebst
Du willst Beef huh was ich klau dir Opfer die Kette
Und wenn sie fake ist polier ich dir halt nochmal die Fresse
Ich stell jetzt die ganze Szene auf den Kopf

Ich lass euch reden, ihr könnt sagen was ihr wollt
Juckt mich null denn ich habe jetzt Erfolg was habt ihr huh?

Und mein Lehrer? Who gives a fuck
Bin der immer noch mit Abstand produktivste hier von allen MCs
Das VBT beherrscht und nebenbei ein Album releaset
Doch dass du kreativ bist wie Hauptschulklassen
Ist ein Widerspruch in sich wie das Wort aufzumachen
Und bekomm' ich für 'nen Song einmal negative Presse
Hau ich dem Redakteur einfach die Zähne aus der Fresse
Das geht eins, zwei paam und die Dritten sind fällig
Ich nehm' die Leute nicht mehr ernst, denn jeder Dritte verstellt sich
Deine Featureanfrage wird gekonnt ignoriert
Du fragst dich wieso? Tja, sie kommt halt von dir

Esta,"Sie hat klasse, sie ist einfach anders als die anderen 
Lächelt mich nicht an da ich jetzt ein bisschen bekannter bin
Nein sie strahlt und haut mich mit ihren blicken um 
Betritt sie einen raum ist sie automatisch der Mittelpunkt 
All eyes on her keiner stiehlt ihr die Show 
Ja sie liebt das genau wie ich es liebe zu flowen
Klar in Sachen Styl hat sie so gut wie gewonnen 
Denn ihre Blaue Jacke passt zu ihrer Louis Vuitton
Doch sie gibt damit nicht an hat sie kein bisschen nötig 
Und brauch nicht die Bestätigung sie was das sie schön ist
Sie könnte so oft lästern aber schweigt für gewöhnlich 
Man sieht ihr gar nicht an das sie reich und verwöhnt ist
Sie ist Einzelkind doch dafür ziemlich gut erzogen 
Diszipliniert hatte immer gute noten ihr ist egal ob man sie hasst oder nicht 
Denn man sieht ihr einfach sie is 'ne klasse für sich

Eine Frau die weiß was sie will 
Ja sie fährt ihren eigenen Film
Denn sie ist perfect, little Miss Perfect

Sie hat klasse sie ist einfach anders 
Als die anderen nicht nur weil die schuhe von Manolo Planik sind
Nein ihr lächeln ist charmant sie besticht allein 
Durch ihre Eleganz wenn sie tanzt
Es ist ganz klar das die Männer alle auf ihren Hintern blicken 
Sie könnte alle mit einem blick um den Finger wickeln 
Sie genießt diese Aufmerksamkeit doch auch die Fraue
Sind am staunen denken wow dieses Kleid 
Aber nicht nur ihr Style macht sie perfekt nein 
Ach das sie alle männer abblitzen lässt dieses Mädchen verliert 
Wirklich selten an reiz mit nem' hauch von Chanel Number five 
Sie ist der star in jeder Diskothek und natürlich 
Gibt es viele die das nicht so sehen 
Doch es ist ihr egal ob mann sie hasst oder nicht 
Denn man sieht ihr einfach sie is' ne klasse für sich

Nur ein Blick und der DJ hat sie liebgewonn' 
Zwei Minuten später spielt er ihren Lieblingssong
Sie ist single doch hällt nicht wirklich viel davon 
Ihr freund hat sie verlassen doch sie weiß 
Dass er bald wieder kommt und natürlich 
Wird sie ihn zum täufel schicken denn 
Sie will nie wieder was von so einer Enttäuschung 
Wissen ihr ist egal ob er sie hasst 
Oder nicht denn man sieht ihr einfach 
An sie ist ne' klasse für sich

Bitte bleib wie du bist
Auch wenn du nicht immer leicht hast, ich weis wie das ist
Hör diesen Zeilen genau zu, denn ich schreib sie für dich;
Ich könnt sie irgendwann bereuen oder eigentlich nicht
Yeah
In den letzten paar Wochen wurdest du langsam zu 'nem Freund
Auf dich ist verlass, du hast mich noch nie enttäuscht
Schon komisch ich hab sogar Nachts von dir geträumt 
und obwohl wir uns nicht lange kennen hat es mich gefreut

Ich hab dir wirklich schon so viel anvertraut
du hast dabei zugehört und mich dabei angeschaut
Du weist mehr als die meisten da draußen
ja manchmal ist es gut, manchmal scheiße gelaufen

Und du weist genau wie ich, keine Ausrede zieht
Du bist nicht cool nur weil du immer einen Ständer hast
Ficken kannst du trotzdem nicht, also sag was ändert das?
Ja was denkst du Spasst?
Dein Horizont beschränkt sich doch im Leben 
nur auf Dämmstoff oder nen Fensterplatz
Ich hab schon high oder besoffen auf dich eingeredet
Musstest meine Fahne riechen, konntest nicht zu Seite gehen
Du wartest stehts die ganze Nacht bis ich nach Hause komm
Bist vielleicht kein Waisenhaus doch hast schon viele aufgenommen

Am Anfang schüchtern das hätte ich jetzt nicht gedacht
doch am Ende hast du bei den Battle-Runden mitgelacht
Du weist echt alles von mir, so viel kriegt keiner mit

Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)

Estaban,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose

In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence,2001

Nas the name I used to holla at dames
Let em ring the bell at the stock exchange
Put her in chanel her Reeboks were lame
Had her front row at the boxing ring
What happened to you girl you're not the same
Top floor [? ] we're not playing
Feeling better than I ever did
Nothing negative niggas talk rhetoric
I'm a soldier of love ask Sade

I grew up in the 1980's
In a 4-bedroom house my family my Grandma
3 or 4 Aunties Uncles and Brothers

In and out of prison daily
At certain times when there was no heat
We stay under covers
There was life like you never seen

Daddy taking extra people in 
Come dinner time It was tippin' 18
Boil a big pot of water on the stove to take a bath
Rub my face with Olive Oil all my mates used to laugh

And my cousin's moved out and we all got divided
As I started to get older I seen god providing
I've seen £50 last 3 months solid
I got my first pair of Nike we were still eating porridge

Me and my cousin used to play Mel and Kim
Practicing dancin' coming down the stairs and ting
I touched Africa and came back darker
Knowing myself feeling my roots a little bit harder

89 I started to get mine
99 I started to write rhymes
Come, walk with me baby this were my life
1980 year that God made me
89 I started to get mine
99 I started to write rhymes
Come, walk with me reminiscing my life

So then we moved up thought I was the Fresh Prince
Dynasty was re-runs and Dallas was faded
With 3 beds this time and 6 kids
Still we got a doggy (yes that gog loved to shit)

My brother got his first pair of LA Gear
He thought it were to take pictures of instead of wear
We started hanging out my jeans got tighter
My weird neighbours set their own house on fire

Church was All day every day and every week 
That's where I learned how to sing
Hearing that Master Preach
Benediction was all we went for

So we could run home and play connect 4
Mum worked late and we learnt to cook
Sasparilla and stew pea soup
In the room watching Kung-Fu films
And Cleopatra films wishin we was the cosmic kids and the matchstick girls

The man downstairs was dead for 3 weeks
His own cat started eating him, the house starts to wreak
That's when we moved out, our house was bigger
We had a large garage and the attic was killer

We used to pray for 3 hours in the morning
Sitting on the school bus believe we was yawning
All our hair was stuck down to our forehead jam and spritz do rags and pin curls yes
Sexy boys walking round showing interest

In what I don't know 'cause we all had flat chests
Don't think we never mastered the Kid 'n Play steps

[Estelle: Speaking]
So I'm in love and I keep telling this guy and it's like he thinks I'm jokin every single time I tell him it's like
""Alright, OK. I love you to yea OK"" and sometimes you know when you don't know what to do
And your heart is just exploding and you look at them and it's just like
So I sing it like:
Wake me up in the morning with a kiss and make me some breakfast
And in the evening a candlelight dinner
Or when I feel restless
Give me a soft massage and my neck starts to tingle
Even when we didn't have anything you still made me feel like your queen
Now crystal and their glass is clean
Sleeping on on the floor,
You know what I mean
And I love you because you hold me down
When the world thinks I'm brave you see my frown
I love to be loved like this and I love and I love your kiss
So thankful
Yeah this is all I was trying to say to you:

You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again

[Royston:]
Your like my angel
Perfect for me, that's all I ever wanted you to be
Understand when you said that you loved me
What kind of man would I be if I told you I loved you constantly
You probably wouldn't believe me because your frontin like you don't even need me
Still I just wanted to tell, wanted to tell
You are my wife, my lover, my sister, I'm your brother
I feel you
I just wanted to tell you

[Both:]
You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again

[Estelle:]
Lovin you is like the song that I am singing
Like the snow and the stars and the sun and the conditions
Take it lots like the northern lights
Seeing you bounce my heart like the candle lights
I feel different didn't think this was me
I'm seeing wisdom, didn't think that this could be
I wanna kiss him got me being super girly
Head swirilng all because the love ain't hurtin
Thinking he was worth it

[Both:]
You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again

Ok Ladies,
Why'know you got a man,

I want you to hold him real tight, like,
Put one hand round his waist,
And one hand in his hand,
And step to the left,
Step to the right

You showed me how to love
You showed me how to be, a part of you,
Somethin' about your touch,

This is out to the ladies and gents tryin' to do for them self they ain't waitin' on nobody else
You could say this life is a laugh and I would say it's cool but we're here in the last half
Fix up be real to yourself would ya
Sell yourself for a ring or a belt or a ki of drugs and a nine
Start blazin' 'cause your heavy and no-one can tell you nuthin
You're an idiot, life ain't real you should go to Iraq then talk about real

'Cause we only get one life and then it's gone for good
And you're the only one who seems to be stopping you
So when you step make sure it's true 
And take your time I'm telling you
People we need to be 

Free, don't think about being less than yourself
Free, negative people never good for your health

This is a dog eat dog world 
But it belongs to the man, 
But it's not without the love 
Of a woman's understanding 
Hurting ourselves for no reason that you have, 
Was already yours, anyway, 
If you see somebody I want you to smile instead of frown, 
Just because they look angry 
Don't mean they want to beat you down, 
And it, don't cost you nothing 
But you pay for a gun, 
To kill our sisters and sons, 
People we need to be

Estelle,"Hey girl I Love you so and
It's so sad that we can't even talk no, we can't even no more
Hey Girl, I'm so sad today.
And my life just drifted away.
(Can this be real girl, can this be so
Girl have we drifted so far that we can't even talk no more)

Uh huh, listen yo
We can't talk no more blood
'Cause you never ever really understood blood.
My heart was open but you stepped right on,
You never thought that I was up for being number one, yep
How long I know you, we kept in touch through college.
Never the type to give you brain I'm giving you knowledge.
We be like old school, 
I seen you fucking with some other birds. Yep
I let you roll right through.
Gave my soul to another home dude,
But you're calling me telling me your problems
And I was going through my own kind of problems
But ? you took a piss like you were care ?
Yup I had that there.
And now you're shocked when you see me
Wishing we were cool to talk wanting you to see me 
Working out your numbers to call me, come and see
But you ain't real enough to see me, I'm making it clear babe.

Hey girl I Love you so and
It's so sad that we can't even talk no, we cant even no more
Hey Girl, I'm so sad today.
And my life just drifted away.
(Can this be real girl, Can this be so
Girl have we drifted so far that we can't even talk no more)

I always knew you were the one to play the parts then
And now I see I should have kept you at arm's length
I thought you changed from the past and then you make me waste my time.

Obviously, I got you wrong from the start 
I should have never let it get that far
I can't deal with your attitude
Erase my number from your phone, I've had it with you
And it's so classic that you want to blame the whole situation on me
Now let's see, I ain't saying I was perfect
But you played your little games
Was it worth it
And everything that I did you deserved it
And these days I hardly walk out the door 'cause you blow everything
Out of proportion 
I'm not surprised we don't talk any more 'cause you just played with my mind 
But it's all good.

Hey girl I Love you so and
I'm so sad that we can't even talk no, we can't even no more

Well I get these gaps in time
Where I've been spacin you on my mind

I like how bad it seems so wrong
To feel this weighing it feels so strong
You better sing me a lullaby
So baby come on come one

You come over and you kiss my face (you kiss my face)
Felt like I want you more without saying a thing ??
Memorizing this moment believe I la la la la la
You took my hands you kiss my lips

(Yeah, uh huh, Jake you stupid for this one son, y'know)
Hey yo, actions speak louder than words
My middle finger speaks louder than yours
I'm in the hood, feet poundin' the curb
Jealous of nothin', mine is bigger than yours
Standin' still, y'all runnin' with herbs
I stole the soul motherfucker, I ain't bringin' it back
Whack niggas like Jamsport, holdin' me back
And I don't care if you're friends with Jay
Or Dre, or Kay Slay, you're still garbage
Learn to parlay, before you look this way
I'm heinous with mine, Kardinal made this
I don't pay to get on any playlist
Niggas in the street was waitin' for someone to say this
I ain't suckin' dick for y'all DJ's to play this (let 'em know)
My records spin like rims on an Avis
Look at me wrong, and say what's up to Sammy Davis
I'm heavy nigga, the biggest libra couldn't weigh this
Before you kiss your TV, you should kiss my whole anus

At all costs I'm doin' it the fly way
So I never say que sera sera

I got the most superior mainframe in the game
Flows like a fifty-paper, ain't a damn thing changed
On the mic I'm deranged, off the mic I'm just crazy
Spit-shine my letter combos, that's what pays me
In other words it's the nouns and the verbs
That buys the X5's and the cribs on the lakesides
I run this shit, I don't take sides
What you see is what you get, most of these rappers are in disguise
With no persona, so they diss guys
You want to lose your profession? I suggest you test this guy
The best buy in any Best Buy
I'll straight burn the place down like a throwback Left Eye
Ahead of the class, nobody ever left I
I'm so right, I can't even open my left eye
You're dead wrong, tryin' to correct I
I'm like the dead in one way: no choice but to respect I, yeah!

[Chorus]

Yo, everything I do is strong when I rap
I don't bust no verses, I talk in thunder claps
Give black hands daps, and X marks the map
Dot city on my chest, show the world where I'm at
Lift you higher than a three hundred dollar weed pack
And a G4 smuggled in my jacket in the back
Yeah, some question my heart and dedication
Why? I'm into the pulse like a palpitation
Some man dem dat I know hold down the +Big Macs+
And they come and watch you air the beef out (Blak, blak)
That ain't me though, I'm regal like a pharaoh and them

Estelle,"A star was born

It's taken 9 long months
To prepare for the day
When my life started change
Endure these hours of pain
And all that runs through my brain
Is that I'll never
I'll never do this again

It only took one second
And one seed
At the drop of a dime
I'm on this life long journey
Falling in love with a person
I ain't never seen
Never seen

I remember the beat
And the pressure of you feet
Kicking inside
Inside of me
Made me smile
When I heard your beat
Now my heart is yearning
Something like a dream
I brought life to you
You bring life to me
You bring life to me

Now my heart is yearning
Something like a dream
I brought life to you
You bring life to me
You bring life to me

Yea
With a little bit of extras
You go from to start life
I thought before I'd have you I could get my heart right
I figured I could change
Hoping I could be that
100% that
Ready for some real life
I guess I wasn't but I still made a break for it
Yea I was eating for two
I made a stay for it
I'm so emotional
I cried a rainforest
If I could have seen it coming
Yea, I would've ran for it
I thought aborting it would be a better time for it
Until I saw a scan for it
A blessing in disguise
You're the apple of my eye
It was just one second
But you made me realize
In just one second
Things change over night
So I start seeing things in a whole new light
One night of pleasure could bring a lot of pain
Sometimes it's worth it to walk in the rain
Sometimes treasure ain't a whole lot of gain
But you're my treasure
Even though it felt stranger
If I had to
I would do it all again.
Yea, yea, for sure I would do it all again

Now my heart is yearning
Something like a dream
I brought life to you
You bring life to me
You bring life to me

I remember the beat
And the pressure of you feet
Kicking inside
Inside of me
Made me smile
When I heard your beat
Now my heart is yearning
Something like a dream
I brought life to you
You bring life to me
You bring life to me

Now my heart is yearning

'Cause I can't do it no more, I won't be there when you call
So you besta move on, move on
'Cause I couldn't be your, your substitute no more

Listen I see you called my name like I'm going outta fashion
And turn around and act like nutting ain't happen
Like nar nuttins crackin'

Only when you need a chick
Only when you think about dis hotness you get itch
That's when you get the itch, baby, let me be a bitch

With a blind fold on
No hands on the wheel
Hopin' God will lead me my way
And I know he real
So my grandma say what I
Feel a sweat from the sun
Cause I work construction
I gotta take care of my son
I got one in the oven on the way
Rents late, two months
Cause my land lord talks too much

Hands full of calises
And I still got the magic touch to make wife blush
I been workin' it out since a high school crush
Fix on the clutch
Minds on my money
But my money ain't there
But I will not resort to welfare I care

Could God do me a favour?
I could really use a favour
Could I get it tonight?

No
Christmas here
I'm taking time and a half
Gotta make that cash
Even if a nigga gotta drive that cab
I'm gonna treat it like a limo
Didn't know? y'better ask
Somebody told me
Closed mouths don't eat
Closed eyes may never ever see
So I try with everything I've got to not sleep
But it's hard to run if at first you don't creep
After work take the long way home
See a lotta whips stick out in chrome
Thinkin' about a house but I can't get along
So I day dream on my way back to my zone
Thinkin' about my son look when he full grown
Will he be raised right or another street clone?
Everything I know God knows gotta shown
Lettim know he is not alone
He on
He on
On

Drownin' in a world o' failure
But
I can't stop 'til my suits are tailored
Well
I really can't trust my neighbours
Some
Only trust in the Lord to save me
I
Gotta believe in the fact
That he must want better for us
Like young C gotta do it for us
My car broke down
Fuck the bus
Fuck the million
Fuck the city laws are unjust
It's like why do I try
When I feel I'm gonna die
Without a tear left in my eye?
I work the hard to see the lease
It's like cultivating the harvest
Not seeing the feast
I don't wanna get philosophical go-to deed
I have faith but I'm afraid to take the lead

I know holds me back
Instead of learning
I want that lack

Some of my friends are terrorists
Some of my friends deal crack and I am not OK with this
Some niggas I know only back me because I rake dough like a Gardner
And fuck it I work harder
I don't like most hip hop out
There's a secret society of niggas who wanna shout
""turn that bullshit off!""
I should shut my mouth?
Next thing you know I ain't welcome down south
Of the border
I don't believe in turfs or a section
I believe in community
Where anybody can walk good without protection
I believe that Dyla was the numba one dude in rap
But there on the slaps of haikus
I spite you for not givin' it up
Fuck what that nigga say, nigga give it up

Why black people act like little kids?
Make mad excuses when they know what it is
Be like them white folks invest that shit
Instead niggas clownin' on the red carpet
Showing my niece that a million on the neck
Is the hot shit
Is bloodclated disrespect
And growin' up poor don't make you ignant
Act your age
Don't act your pigment
Race to the top
Don't let your race stop you
From revolution
Open your mouth and bust shots

Let's be more than friends.

I think you see me as your play thing
Your Friday to Sunday thing
I'm not your weekend love, your secret fuck, brother I'm not playing
And if I wanted to be part time, I'd be working at the check-out line
At the liquor store, the picture show, let me give you piece of my mind

[Rap]
Why don't you put your arms around me huh?
Acting different when your friends around
See nah, when we together we fire and no I never tell my friends your a friend
You're my guy we're together uh huh
Calling my phone about we needed a break
How we gonna break up when we ain't willing to date?
You say you want that real woman, when you get her you run
How come I never met the family like your dad and your mum?
And I don't wanna hear it, stop being a bitch
You making me respect you less, I'm really starting to switch
You're saying that and this and your heart broken
Yeah, you sound like shit like you're taking a piss
Somebody wanna see ya chick, ya see the problem with dis is
I'm waiting in vain, I'm waiting for you to change
We ain't kicking it No, we ain't chilling NO, we ain't doing a ting blood
I'm more like a full time thing
See fam' you got your own sock drawer, you can call me much more
More then just your friend much, more than before
Don't play me like an extra, I got speaking roles
I am NOT that ho, I am so much more

I wonder why

[Chorus]

Don't act like I'm try'na press you
It's just you know
It's obvious, it's all there, like
What you waiting for

See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see 
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease

Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and  yeah they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood

So they came to test 'cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear [Boo !]
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the brothers leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me ?
'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me

I am everyday people (Repeat 2X)

I told the niggaz please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube (who?)
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a brother and get stomped by an African

See the morale of the story is
Everybody needs to change their way of thinking
Being ignorant never got nobody nowhere

She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is dumb right
The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils
I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on in the possible
She blushes, as I kept splashing her compliments
Polite thank yous, is all around, she crush the mints
Developments, smooth keys from the piano
Changed the mood, like we changed the channel
This is art, Picasso, I got him beat in the flesh
I'm staring at beauty, Nefertiti, heaven bone in the chest
Yes, everywhere she step, went off like a flare gun
Stilettos on, parquet floors
Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three
Bad little mama, she built like Alicia Keys
No facade, her strut is hard, based on books by
Intelligent jail crooks, writing to let the time fly
She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down
Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand, I picked it up
I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes, as I gave her, her jewels back
Miss thing started rubbing her gut
Excuse me, are you pregnant? Not to be rude
But if it means anything, I can get you some food
Cheese crackers, in the back there's sauteed shrimp
(Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp
See my due date is January, my first, and it's kinda scary
It's only June, and Christmas, I'll be getting married
And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name?)

And I've got mine, but baby its OK

Because my heart has made it's decision
As soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision
I fell in love, sweet love
And no infatuated 3D glasses to see
That your the one I need
And the situation don't matter to me

If that's crime, then fuck it, I'll do the time
But they tryin' to give me twenty five to life for every line
Go ahead and lock me up, throw away the key
But just imagine the monster you gonna make of me
And the moment that we all feared
Guilty on all charges for the dopest album of the year!

I was blind but now I see
Super high can't touch the ground
Life tested me but god blessin' me
Every sixteen bars is testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
I have find myself then remind myself
Woke up I'm grown I gotta blame myself
Streets taught me everything I train to sell
Did wrong so long know didn't know nothin' else
Then my lima crew was like me a member
Think every man worth, enemies himself
Glad as well but I'm mad as hell
Cause my best friend probably gon' die in jail
I ain't no lie to tell prolly cry like hell
If I dwell on it 'cause he got a eighty years
I'm going hard see I might as well
Guess I gotta a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy dad my great great great great
Grandpa had a really crazy swag
So I stand a day
Diggin' down a grave
That if I can change now
And my mind is made
A got a point and prove
And a sign to raise
Can't let them make mistakes
That his daddy made

This crazy summer ain't feelin that
I guess they wanna see us kill each other
If im dead who the fuck gon' help my mother 
I done struggled to hustle im too hard for this
I done rushed and killed ain't proud of that
Smoke weed took pills sold powder patches
I'm a solider I understand where the cowards at
My home boy gone where the flowers at
Out of money and the work can't bring that back
If I had one wish, wish momma there
Could come down now and see me rap
But she see me now and I believe in that
Wanna script of that, I ain't going back 
So I put my family on I my back
Lost so much I cant pay that back
I was lost but now I'm found

Tailor made black linen
Escalade with a made man in it
Rose gold shades with the rozay lenses
Pink champagne and the flow so endless
All I seek is perfection
Ain't no secrets I'ma eat that for breakfast
Keep her close to me like lyrics
She spoke to me in the middle of the winter
So I'ma let her close to me

All these stars out
And these people know my name
I can be so pretentious
But he likes, all the same
And these lights are glowing
But he don't want none
He rather chill and hug me
Baby, he could be the one

You want me to trust you
But how can I trust you
When I don't know the first thing about that
There's so many questions

Messing with my heart and I just got it back

I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby

I've been here before
I don't know if you're the type
Who's gonna be keep me sure
When the dark creeps in my mind
Will you be there baby?
Or will you let me go?
Can you stand the pressure?
This is what I need to know

You want me to trust you

I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart

All white in the winter
Green in the summer
Painted the Lamborghini same color marijuana
Floating in the six til I made her seasick
Wetting these niggas up with this amg kit
Earned a reputation repping up and down the boulevard
Me and baby Bonnie and Clyde off in the rental cars
Propositions through politicians are common now
My money tall we can never be on common ground
Peel the top back getting higher than the higher power
Making love in the penthouse then it's cianara
Fell in love with shawty blame it on the chemistry
Tools on the low fools really envy me
Money multiply s600 Benz
Me and my shawty lie we a team to the end
Monopoly shopping sprees imagine what we can spend
Me and my shawty live we gonna do this shit again

You could be a millionaire or broke

You know you're more than a friend
Just because you love me
Imma love you 'til the end

In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this
From right in time when I was nine years old
I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers
Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest
I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school
Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox
Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand
Sold three looseys, just to get on call plan
R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers
Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping
All my kins blew up, we grew up with
We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping
Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby
You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby
The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah
Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Ra

Reunited, another LP, we're all excited
That reckless eyeballing will get your girl indicted
My touch like Midas, I cramp your style, arthritis
These niggas is food, I eat they food, nigga-ritis
Your man don't snooze, insomniac
This The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who?
Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you's a cannibal
And stopping me, is what you cannot do
Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through
I ain't different Method Man like you
But you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough
And little kids in my community cuss
Y'all be showing your guns, but the ones in my community bust
And when they do, you give the jewelry up

Your heart was always for me but as we grow
Something changed down the road
Ain't nothing I could say that could bring us back
To the same as before
Your head is over there you don't feel the same
You don't want me no more
We got to play the game I ain't keepin' scores cause

I'm much clearer now than I've ever been
Aha, thought I'll be with you till the very end
Oh the road got long and things have changed
And you moved on and that's okay because
I finally found my way back to love again

Yeah we changed and we grow
Some things will stay the same as the others pass
Takes a while, a while on the road
And so begins the ad as we reap and sow
Then the hurt, when you're hurt
Stays pressin' on your heart, stings and lets you know
That I feel how I feel
Cuts deeper than a wound I refuse to heal but

I'm much clearer now than I've ever been
Aha, thought I'll be with you till the very end
Oh the road got long and things have changed
And you moved on and that's okay because
I finally found my way back to love again
I finally found my way back to love again

It's time to move on
Time to let go
This is nothing like we dreamed
We will end up
If I love you, I should let you go and change you

Didn't take long before the archer with the wings heard it
Shot us in the heart with a contract, he knew we were a hit
The right amount of soul with a parallell amount of grit
But the archer couldn't see the target of depature

It's understood you would
Label me the mate who wronged you, cause I kept wanting a feature

Telling me I have to go because I chose stereo for stereo

But chance showed up at the wedding
I guess I didn't read the heading

Put you behind the finest steering wheels 
Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy
Told you grow up, but shit you was my baby
Bits and pieces never made nothing decent
When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger

A part of what I did then

It's like speeding down the highway
With a blind fold on
No hands on the wheel
Hopin' God will lead me my way
And I know he real
So my grandma say what I
Feel a sweat from the sun
Cause I work construction
I gotta take care of my son
I got one in the oven on the way
Rents late, two months
Cause my land lord talks too much

Hands full of calises
And I still got the magic touch to make wife blush
I been workin' it out since a high school crush
Fix on the clutch
Minds on my money
But my money ain't there
But I will not resort to welfare I care
Can't stop
Won't stop
Couldn't even do it if I tried
If I said I did I'd die

I could really use a favour
Could I get it tonight?

No
Christmas here
I'm taking time and a half
Gotta make that cash
Even if a nigga gotta drive that cab
I'm gonna treat it like a limo
Didn't know? y'better ask
Somebody told me
Closed mouths don't eat
Closed eyes may never ever see
So I try with everything I've got to not sleep
But it's hard to run if at first you don't creep
After work take the long way home
See a lotta whips stick out in chrome
Thinkin' about a house but I can't get along
So I day dream on my way back to my zone
Thinkin' about my son look when he full grown
Will he be raised right or another street clone?
Everything I know God knows gotta shown
Lettim know he is not alone
He on
He on
On

Drownin' in a world o' failure
But
I can't stop 'til my suits are tailored
Well
I really can't trust my neighbours
Some
Only trust in the Lord to save me
I
Gotta believe in the fact
That he must want better for us
Like young C gotta do it for us
My car broke down
Fuck the bus
Fuck the million
Fuck the city laws are unjust
It's like why do I try
When I feel I'm gonna die
Without a tear left in my eye?
I work the hard to see the lease
It's like cultivating the harvest
Not seeing the feast
I don't wanna get philosophical go-to deed
I have faith but I'm afraid to take the lead

I know holds me back

I want that lack

Some of my friends are terrorists
Some of my friends deal crack and I am not OK with this
Some niggas I know only back me because I rake dough like a Gardner
And fuck it I work harder
I don't like most hip hop out
There's a secret society of niggas who wanna shout
""turn that bullshit off!""
I should shut my mouth?
Next thing you know I ain't welcome down south
Of the border
I don't believe in turfs or a section
I believe in community
Where anybody can walk good without protection
I believe that Dyla was the numba one dude in rap
But there on the slaps of haikus
I spite you for not givin' it up
Fuck what that nigga say, nigga give it up

Why black people act like little kids?
Make mad excuses when they know what it is
Be like them white folks invest that shit
Instead niggas clownin' on the red carpet
Showing my niece that a million on the neck
Is the hot shit
Is bloodclated disrespect
And growin' up poor don't make you ignant

Don't act your pigment

All the little birdies go tweet, tweet, tweet.

That when she kisses me I sure stay kissed

Estelle Swaray,"Her face glow like I was exposed to sunlight
She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is dumb right
The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils
I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on in the possible
She blushes, as I kept splashing her compliments
Polite thank yous, is all around, she crush the mints
Developments, smooth keys from the piano
Changed the mood, like we changed the channel
This is art, Picasso, I got him beat in the flesh
I'm staring at beauty, Nefertiti, heaven bone in the chest
Yes, everywhere she step, went off like a flare gun
Stilettos on, parquet floors
Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three
Bad little mama, she built like Alicia Keys
No facade, her strut is hard, based on books by
Intelligent jail crooks, writing to let the time fly
She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down
Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand, I picked it up
I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes, as I gave her, her jewels back
Miss thing started rubbing her gut
Excuse me, are you pregnant? Not to be rude
But if it means anything, I can get you some food
Cheese crackers, in the back there's sauteed shrimp
(Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp
See my due date is January, my first, and it's kinda scary
It's only June, and Christmas, I'll be getting married
And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name?)
Tone Starks (Peace, I'm Gabby, well I gotta go, my husband is waiting)
But before I go, can I give you one last statement
You the most beautifullest queen, I ever seen
And I would love to have a thing like you, on my team, you take care

Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight
'Cause this was love at first sight
It's OK

You can tell he must be on a mission
Because my heart has made it's decision
As soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision
I fell in love, sweet love
And no infatuated 3D glasses to see
That your the one I need
And the situation don't matter to me
'Cause this is love, it gotta be love
Love at first sight

Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
'Cause I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
'Cause this was love at first sight

Our love suicide
Our love suicide

Ah, love suicide is killing me,
You’re getting into my head like a guillotine,
You’ve got me grasping for air in your
And now you’re saying some things
That you don’t really mean, that’s really mean,
How the hell I’m cut up between?
I forgot, trying not to intervene,
Putting up a fight like it ain’t a thing to me!
I swear it’s gotta be the worst position to be in, be in,
I guess you thought like you’ve been ignored,
And the ? turning to a jigsaw,
Cause when you’re down you gotta let
And we just can’t seem to find time to sit and talk,
I know she is in shock!
Ah, what happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house,
And everything becomes so cold,
Baby, that’s the only thing I wanna know!

Tell me the reason why
You commit a love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Tell me get outta here
You made it very clear

You did it on purpose
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

I feel like I’m about to break down,
Why you’re acting like kid up on the playground?
If you gonna sat on your mind, why don’t you let it out?
So the end of us is coming any day now, any day!
I thought we’d never separate,
I could be the.. but no defeated on the…
You know is probably for the best, anyway,
Cause my suspicions now…
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house,
And everything becomes so cold,
Baby, that’s the only thing I wanna know!

Tell me the reason why
You committed a love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose

Time to get outta here
You made it very clear

You did it on purpose, purpose
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Why would you hurt us?
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

Does it make you happy to see me down?
Does it make your day to see me drown?
I guess I'm your entertainment
You don't know what you wasted
But soon you will see!

What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house,
And everything becomes so cold,
Baby, that’s the only thing I wanna know!

Tell me the reason why
You committed a love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose!

But I do have time to grind

Crunk and command
Fight and we'll stand

Live a life to god blessings
Big papers long acres
Top flight no security

Black ice on me call a jury
Yeah trick yeah trick and we call it magic
My style may change you can call it drastic
Money so long? measures
I love my business and I love my pleasure
Live now dies later Internet genius
Self proclaimin' he for the fortunate of fame
He'll run through the rain
For a meanin' to change
Taking over the game
18 years old with a drop top phantom
Kidnap the world till they pay my ransom

Four words to say

I hear them loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

As my, world turns
The heart beats
Not only in my chest
But the heart of the streets
So when they feel this, they feel me
But I can't feel nothin', outside these Dre Beats
I am from the city of people who came from the bottom
Standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin, what's up?
Exception shows me as the dead man walkin',
But reflections show this kid's still got it
Better be known I got the throne like I don't know that there's a king
Never grew up around a family 'cause I'm not a human being
And anyone under my bubble that's coming in my spot, the top
Let 'em have it, cause when I leave, the whole world drops
Lace up Kells

I hear voices in the air
I hear it loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

Telling me I am invincible,
I am invincible
I am invincible, oh oh
Was telling me I am invincible,
I am invincible
I am Invincible, oh oh oh

Waking up sweatin from the stress of being caged out
Everything I write is played out, like what is this?
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes on the wall but they don't know the past
Even if I told them at all they wouldn't know the half
So maybe I fill up my luggage with all these dreams
And pull on my black coat and my black chucks and nothing in my jeans
It's just one, til the day come like Rocky's movie scene
And I'm on top of the world, look up the screen like this is me this is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city but clearly I never failed
Lost myself from the game when I found myself from the cell
And I found myself from the fame when I lost myself to the pills
And you cannot mess with me still, seen the boys and they winning
Underdogs of the year Cleveland boys in the building
What the fuck is a ceiling I'm taking us to the top,
And when I leave the whole world drops, Lace Up Kells

I hear it loud and clear

Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy

Esther Ofarim,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon [From Finian's Rainbow],2006

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low [From One Touch of Venus],2006

Wrapped around my heart

Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed

Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

I'm on my way home
I left three days ago but no one seems to know
I'm gone

Home is where the hatred is, home is filled with pain
And it might not be such a bad idea
If I never, never went home again
Stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why

Hang on to your rosary beads
Close your eyes to watch me die
You keep sayin', kick it, quit it
Kick it, quit it, kick it, quit it

God, but did you ever try to turn your sick soul
Inside out so that the world can watch you die
Home is where I live, inside my white power dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now
With my silent screams

Home is where the needle marks
Try to hear my broken heart
And it might not be such a bad idea
If i never, never went home again

Kick it quit it, kick it quit it, kick it quit it
Kick it, can`t go home again

Tomo ese tono oscuro de callejón
O acaso aquel romance que solo nombra
Cuando se pone triste con el alcohol

Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Tu canción tiene el frío
Del último encuentro
Tu canción se hace amarga
En la sal del recuerdo

Yo no sé si tu voz es la flor de una pena
Solo sé que al rumor de tus tangos, Malena

Te siento más buena
Más buena que yo

Que cruzan sobre el barro del callejón
Cuando todas las puertas están cerradas
Y ladran los fantasmas de la canción

There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Esther Williams,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2007
Esther Williams,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2007

Yeah, check me out now
The other day I was chillin
In the crib with two women
We just finished swimmin
Now I'm ready to slid up in 'em
They the horny type, bout to get it on
With the only dykes, now I hear the alarm
I'm like, ""Holy Christ!""
Is somebody tryin to come up in my crib?
I'm like ""Who the fuck is this?""
like Notorious Big, he wore a black suit
With a black mask that match
I'm bout to blast his mask off
Push his cabbage back
Make spaghetti out his brain
'cause I'm steady with the aim
Niggas comin sideways, gettin petty wit da game
Musta heard about the half in the safe
The stash in the base, iced out
medals in the case
Niggas comin wit da chrome
Tryin to sneak up in my home, rumors out
I spent a Mil' on the pump piece alone
I got the heat in my palm
Nobody's seein it though
Step your feet on my lawn
I'm puttin 3 to ya dome!

Screamin fo' they life
Peein on they nice
Gotta funny feelin that
They teamin on the heist
Scheemin on the ice
won't get you nothin but killed
Front if you will, get chopped up
Stuffed in the quill
Back to the lab, got these niggas
After my math, these hoes try to play it off
But they captain is back
They must have teamed up
With some niggas thinkin they sweet
Like I just rapped and
I got a ho waitin in the street
I'm playin for keeps, I see 'em
Creepin on the moniters
Got my temperature risin faster than thermometers
I burn banana clips, make all
My victories unanimous
I'm accurate, once I catch a peak
Hey man, yo ass is hit!
Now I see 'em creepin through the front door
I think not! We exchange shots
Like cops into getting blocked{*gunshot*}
He busts, I bust back{*gunshot*}
He caught one in the chest

Kissed her breast, and then he found, he found
Forty days and forty nights before this day
Said that she would always be the man until she found herself

She's gonna find it (she's not too far behind it)

Broke the glass and stole the fate that she didn't earn

It's Thursday night and the night is young
Four day weekend, time to have some fun

Now
Now what do you believe?
Who do you receive?
Where do you go next?
And through what exit do you leave?
The questions that I believe confessions go to He
Count your many lessons and blessings that they bring
This is for my breed and all life that is conceived
Energy told me you manifest your destiny
What is energy?
It's what you eat
It's what you breathe
It's what you think
It permeates throughout your being
And serves a link to all other energies
That's anything and everything
Moving light that you have never seen
And light carries information
Without hesitation vibrations glean
Through the constellation, manifestation stimulated
Better destination, total creation realizations
And mental concentration
Alienated from the truth
Is why we conversated
Savin' the nation for the youth
Is for my observation

[Chorus]
Are you free or are you guided?
Do you make your own decisions?
Our only responsibility is love (love)

Let's touch on Christianity
I question all humanity
Is God so full of vanity?
That children enter this family
Who haven't yet to see that Jesus is the key
Or suffer this calamity, I cast you down for an eternity
Insanity
You can call me what you want to
But the man in me
Separated from this false reality
Would never be the victim of casualty
For my lack of understanding there's a guarantee
Spirituality has immortality
No matter your status or nationality
What's your locality notice the fallacy
We're all separated by principalities
Billions of galaxies and all you see is this
In the totality of eternal bliss
A life of sin it's all the kin

[Chorus: x2]

You see, we like to make things complicated
You don't have to read books and go to church
To learn about God
And find out
We don't know how to talk to each other
You know if we all just be quiet
Then we'll realize that we can really hear each other
And then you'll realize that you already have the answers

Esthero,"1993, shortly before Thanksgiving
I got the call, she said Jamal Derek is not longer living
Softly she spoke, is this a joke? Man you gotta be kidding
As my question was raised this explanation was given
A meaningless death made me question the meaning of life
Does my body remain at rest like when I'm sleeping at night?
Will I burn in eternal hell or will I find paradise?
Be rejected or resurrected like the body of Christ?
Is it like purgatory, the story described by the Catholics?
Or Nirvana that Buddhists honor in both theory and practice?
Like I study in my college philosophy classes
Or do my molecules and atoms travel back to the gases?
I mean, what I like to know, is where my spirit goes?
After the curtains close, on my final show?
Is there a pain it brings? Enjoy my favorite things?
Visit ancient kings? Hear the angels sing?
Who'll answer these said the great MCs
My man Gribbles battling a debilitating disease
He said you see a brother like me is willing to fight
And everytime I question death my only answer is life

[Chorus]
One life, yeah
And my God will set me free
Am I living in this moment
Am I living righteously
It gets hard
But I know I got to keep on
I'm trying so hard to be strong

Paralyzed on the bathroom floor by pain
Last month I endured, but now I can't ignore
Feels like railroad spikes being stuck in my liver
Am I dying? Eyes crying, body starting to shiver
Crawl upstairs from the basement calling my sister
(Sniff) Dawn help me, I ain't feeling too healthy
Stomach walls burning, head spinning and turning
Waiting for the EMS; 3:10 in the morning
Rush me to the emergency screaming like a newborn
The pain's too strong maybe my soul's trying to move on
They hook me to the I.V., put me through some X-Rays
Gave me Demerol to kill the pain that was the next phase
Early the next day in the hospital room
Moms and pops in the room, three or four docs in the room
Test results suggest your colon and your liver
Is so cancerous you got three months left
Me and Death is playing chess ever since then
My strength is the most high, my fam and close friends
The Last Emp and Set Free blessed me with a verse
Staying healthy comes first
Look at me things could be worst

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",One Life,2003
Esthero,"One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice
When she's ten feet tall

And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
Call Alice
When she was just small

When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know

When logic and proportion
Have fallen softly dead

And the Red Queen's ""off with her head!""

Esthero,"Remember when we used to? We can do that again
I know I said it was over but if you ever wanna come over
I think I got what it takes to make you feel nice
Because you gave yourself to another
But I suppose you haven't forgotten what my love tastes like
And she won't fuck you like I do and you know that it's true cause
I have what she hasn't got and I remember all your spots so

If tha mood should hit ya and ya wanna, baby I don't mind
A little taste may relieve the tension I feel inside

Curl up in my cozy web this unbelievably delicious bed
Oh, don't say no, that's not how this should go
I've thought about you often, this feeling hasn't gone rotten
Let's take a spin round that old block again you say
She won't fuck you like I did, she's not into that wild shit and
I have what she hasn't got really? Well then

So if tha mood should hit ya and ya wanna, baby I don't mind
A little taste may relieve the tension I feel inside

You always know what things to do to keep me wanting you,
And also all the things to say to keep me comin your way
Due to the beauty preferred, its hard for me to be true to my girl
Can't be trust wit you in my world (I'm glued to the kush, ya heard?)
No gas, my tanks empty, I'm stuck in your town
The plan's to gently buckle you down and fuck you now, I wanna fuck you now
Only the truth is wit me, now I'm phenen to screw you swiftly
Now I don't mean to be rude with tha lips b.

And everything's coming okay
So why am I confused if you love me

Cause I don't wanna let you go
And we're caught in the undertow
Cause I ain't losing my control
And we're caught in the undertow
I hold a prayer is all our own
But we need air we go alone
Cause I don't wanna let you go
Til we're caught in the undertow

I don't wanna cry every time we try it never fails
Change the illusion wanna be close set for sail
My hearts in your hand don't you go hurt me again

Wir rauchen Haze, baby, safe hier im Viertel wird gedreht
Dicke Dinger oder mal wieder einen richtig fetten J
Mach mal halblang, bin mal wieder zu stoned
Ich bin der Shit, viel zu dope, Bro wie Hits from the Bong

Wache auf und bin verwirrt

Nein
Und im Nachhinein tut es mir leid
Wir hatten jeden Morgen Streit
Denn ich kam nicht aus dem Bett
Hab die ganze Nacht gekifft und gerappt
Du hast alles versucht
Ich war draußen, baute Scheiße mit den Jungs
Doch ich hätte mir mehr Zeit nehmen sollen für uns
Denn jetzt ist es zu spät und du bist nicht mehr da
Und alles was mir bleibt sind Besuche an deinem Grab
Ich verfluche diesen Tag
Ich wünscht ich könnt' den Zeiger nochmal drehen
Doch muss mir eingestehen
Dass es wohl einfach nicht mehr geht und

Para tu corazón herido
Pero si me dejas esta noche yo te doy
Todos los besos que te debo
Ya sé que siempre digo que empiezo a partir de hoy
y que luego nunca me atrevo
Pero si me dejas yo te canto una bossanova
y no te voy a dejar
Ni un minuto sola
Si te dejas llevar como el mar lleva a las olas
Hasta las rocas

No preguntes por qué huele
Mi camiseta a pachulí
Ni que ruido de mujeres
Se escuchaba cuando me llamaste al móvil

Que hay tragos que son amargos
Hasta los del mejor vino
Unos cortos, otros largos,
Pero todos son dañinos",Bossanova,2000

Ocurrió una fría noche de Cornellá en un rincón
No recuerdo muy bien porque sucedió
Solo recuerdo que estaba en un bar
Porque será

La clientela bebí­a, futbolín encontraba
Las miradas perdías, los codos en la barra
En fin cerveza fría por mi garganta
Se derramaba

Que escalofrío se pudo sentir
Cuando entró un tipo bajito, pero eso si bacilón
Que poseía todo lo que el bar quería
Un toque mágico pa la aficción
Porque será

y el tipo era una máquina, un pasao de página, como las colaba
Como presionaba en fin se divertía y toda la gente le cantaba

Tu eres una fiera porque entras partiendo la pana
Invitando a la peña, invitando a cañas
A la hija de la dueña la tienes loca loquita loca

Tu eres una fiera porque entras partiendo la pana
Invitando a la peña, invitando a cañas

Se veía de venir el marrón, por lo menos desde mi posición
y el colega la empezó a bacilar del tirón
Pero la suerte a veces cambia de banda

y el viejo de la niña salto la barra
Menuda la panza, mirada desbocada, cuchillo jamonero
y toda la gente le cantaba

Tu eres un fiera porque entras partiendo la pana
Invitando a la peña, invitando a cañas
Repartiendo leña
Enseño la pipa que quieres mas señas?

Cárcel de cristal y yo sigo preguntando

Robarte un beso y después cerrar los ojos
No los cierro con cerrojo

Pause. Take a breath and go for yours
On my command
Now hit the dance floor
It's gonna make you sweat till you bleed
Is that dope enough indeed
I paid the price to control the dice
I'm more precise to the point I'm nice
Let the music take control of your heart and soul
Unfold, your body is free and behold
Dance till you can't dance, till you can't dance no more
Get off the floor and get a blow
Then come back and upside down
Easy now let me see you move
Next in line groove, work me all night

Il faut oublier 
Tout peut s'oublier 
Qui s'enfuit déjà

Moi je t'offrirai 
Des perles de pluie 
Venues de pays où il ne pleut pas

Pour couvrir ton corps d'or et de lumière 
Je ferai un domaine

Où tu seras reine

Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas

De ces amants-la 
Qui ont vu deux fois leurs cœurs s'embraser 
Je te raconterai l'histoire de ce roi mort
De n'avoir pas pu te rencontrer 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas

On a vu souvent 
Rejaillir le feu 
D'un ancien volcan 
Qu'on croyait trop vieux 
Il est, paraît-il 
Des terres brûlées 
Donnant plus de blé 
Qu'un meilleur avril 
Et quand vient le soir 
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie 
Le rouge et le noir ne s'épousent-ils pas? 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas 

Ne me quitte pas 
Je ne vais plus pleurer 
Je ne vais plus parler 
Je me cacherai là
À te regarder danser et sourire et 
À t'écouter chanter et puis rire

L'ombre de ta main 
L'ombre de ton chien

We'll stand in the sun then
That bright afternoon
'Til then
On days when the sun is gone
We'll hang on
And we'll wish upon a star

There are some days dark and bitter
Seems we haven't got a prayer
But a prayer for something better
Is the one thing we all share

Someday
When we are wiser
When the whole world is older
When we have learned

I pray
Someday we may yet live
To live and let live
One day, someday

Someday
Life will be fairer
Need will be rarer
Greed will not pay

God speed
This bright millennium
Let it come
And we'll wish upon a star

One day
Someday
Soon

One day

To stain the soul so pure
To wake the heart of the fallen

Kill the hordes of the sun

Let the blade of dark incise
As the moon of blood arises
Your master orders you

As the black dawn greets up all

We have to know writings of the sacred signs

Gotta pick up a date

Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.

There may be other springs as full and fare,

Ethan Freeman,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.

The young king sings a song for the lover, the leaver, the lonely alike
Young love waits, if I can't, then I'll meet you at 
The gate of Saint Peter when the fever takes my mind
My God she came singing my name, sounded like rain on the mountain where I burn alive
Young flame burn soft as a candle lit between 
Our two hearts just beats apart in the dark

Spent my summer riding high (high) on the whiplash
Head back
Blowing through the leaves
Growing up a preacher was all you ever dreamed

I got the holy roll
I got the holy roll
I felt the fever grip when I needed it close (and)
I'm at the Fever Pitch
Not quite but nearing it
Can't feed the fever yet I'm saving up my daily measurement

I'm at the grocery store
I'm buying eggs and toast
I'm looking at you and not where I walk, 'bout broke my nose facing doors
Don't let the fever get you
Got got already
Lost my soul in the seventh heaven making out on aisle eleven

Spent my summer riding high (high) on the whiplash
Head back
Blowing through the leaves
Growing up a preacher was always just a dream
All you ever needed were lines you could believe
Sing them to me sweetly
Only just a dream

Well I know you can't walk
With them heels in the dark
Kick 'em off
Let's talk
Let me get to know you
Well I don't know nothin'
But I'm quick pickin' up and
I think I could get you in a minute or two
Yeah if I could get a minute
Four, five at the limit
I think I might make you
Smile after dinner
Kick me under the table
I think that's my in
And I think I came for that
What comes with it?

Let it simmer
Let it simmer
Simmer down please

See, I've been praying for a signal
A sign that you haven't sent
You might be an angel falling from the heavens

Now and again I could never hope to keep them

I'm the type of fool to listen
They say a wise man lends his ears but not his thoughts often
The same is true of undercover cops

And the undercover bubbler got me doubly high as heaven
We're still under the radar, seven billion on the planet
Wading straight to the moon
Salutations to Apollo
While the Mission To Mars is surely soon to follow
And you bit my lip when I kissed you
I bit my tongue not to tell you that I miss you
We shared my blood for an instant and I would trade some more to have it back
Yeah I would trade all of this for that

I'm in the back of a fifteen passenger van doing an expose on feelings I don't fully understand
Started a matchbox guitar slow jam
With hope just as large as the room in my car
My career went as far as the can that I kicked down the road for awhile until I'm just settled in

Excuse me sir, miss could you spare a moment to

Sure, I could've been more social

I've been coping okay for the most part

Just above the atmosphere flying high
Just above the average fear to try
Keeping me grounded, holding me down for miles
Everybody I know wants the gleam
In designer tops and ten dollar magazines

Aggravated when I say what I mean
I mean, I mean

Ante up or just fold boy
Take a whirl or take to
Fakin' it baby

I've been patient watching you the way move
Detecting all of your clues
Feeding off of your cues like 1 2 3 4 5
I'll get it right and play nice soon as you do

Front talking it's a cakewalk till I miss a step
Make it there take a breath and start popping a sweat
This molly got me in all my days
I've never seen a show stopper like you
Calling out the moves soon as you make em up, just a touch
Could make a boy act stupid
Take my delusions grind up into your bowl
Puff on that till I'm blue green serpentine
Visions snaking out of our tea
Not sure what it all means
But I could get used to seeing your cool demeanor lighting my scene up
Tripping all day til we keeping our knees up
Dripping always til our sins look cleaner
Walking down mazes in our minds to find our ways permeate
The walls in your room

Permanent as all we been through

Face in
Placate
Flake out
For miles, for mine, for I know
You could sell me on anything
Reach for the telephone or let it ring
Teach me to let it go

I hate fighting when I'm driving
Leave me now or leave cagey for 25 exits

Service fell off in the underground
Caught the line back to your basement
Came with

Fear in my heart
Cold to the touch

Make us make amends
You and i, we've been friends through screens
The screens, the screen-door's coming off the rails
Come in, come in

Come off the rails
Failed to reveal appeals apparent to my soul
Call me back if you wanna talk
Long distance collecting love
Strong feelings ain't enough to break the silence holding us
Hold my phone
If you needed me then, then, then, why wouldn't you bring it up?
Then why wouldn't we be together if ""all that we need is us"" ain't too much as ask for?
