There's a tugboat, huh, huh, down by the river dontcha know
Where a cement bag’s just a'drooppin' on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten old Macky’s back in town

The Psychedelic Furs,"I see your pretty face
Go to check her and scan
I look in between the lines

And there's somebody new
And she don't know my name
Waiting for a life to change

I've been wasting my time
In the back of a new dream
I've been wasting time
In the back of a new dream

I've been wasting my time
In a brand new dream
Waiting for life to change

I see your pretty face
It's so shaken and blue
I've been looking between the lines

I've been wasting time
In the back of a new dream
I've been wasting time
In the back of a new dream

Nobody's gonna fake
Every time you tell the lie
And nobody's gonna tie my shoes
Or tie me up in chains

As a girl I want it all
To tell you everything she knows
And that anything to sleep with you
When your eyes are closed

And I've been wasting all my time
In the back of a new dream
I've been wasting all my time
In the back of a new dream

I've been wasting all my time
In the back of a new dream
I've been wasting all my time
In the back of a new dream

The passing time is not my life
The thorn that's in my side 
Is all these scenes that we regret
The wasted words we can't forget

Someplace miles away
Make promises pay
Shame, will shake this house
Shame, will shake this house
Your dreams are not my life
These broken words are not my life
Your lies are none of my invention
Your promises were not plan

I hear the rattle of their heels
Before their footsteps fade
Make promises pay
Shame, will shake this house
Shame, will shake this house
The passing time is not my life

I had everything I wanted
Nothing I can't rise above

To be there when you sleep

Here's a nail to hang the wall
It pays to lose it all
A note to hide behind the door

Where you sleep, I laid awake
I saw every time you fake
I held on the hand that takes
And you hate it when I break

It's a fashion with a gun my love
In a room without a door 
A kiss is not enough in

Love my way, It's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

They'd put us on a railroad
They'd dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces
And making it our way
There's emptiness behind their eyes
There's dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all 
And take us all apart
But not in

What type of drugs do you do? 
And what do you do to get your hands on your shit mothafucka huh??!! 
What kind of dirty tricks you do to get yourself fixed? 
You're all sick; is it lack of love? or lack of your withdrawal? 
Drugs!! I need femine venoms in the system 
In order to function in the rhythm 

You get hook to the look of wild vomen 
And want to live in the land of the unforgiven 
Habits turn bad ones 
Individuals make 'em poison rituals 

Gotta have it a have it, a habit 
Welcome your traces of an addict 
God forgive me for my bad habits, 
Drug addict needle in my vein, I gotta have it 

To kill the pain, you silly rabbit 
I dig a hole under the sun to hide from the static 
Automatic pressure got to kill it 
Give some act-right juice so I could feel it 

Ah, now everything is all right 
The eye of the needle cries out to the dark side 
Looking inside through the outdoor knocking 
But society won't let me in so I grab my stocking 

Put over my head and get the dough 
'Cause the needle is my God and smack is my soul 
Parahernaila in my domain brings conclusion 
That I'm using but the question is, am I abusing 

Infested in the residence of pico union 
Drug intrusion, color fusion 
Invasion! of your senses maintain relapse 
Dilate eye lenses, my dependence on these chemical artificial dreams 
Is what makes my habit obscene

What type of drugs do you do? 
And what do you do to get your hands on your shit mothafucka huh??!! 
What kind of dirty tricks you do to get yourself fixed? 
You're all sick; is it lack of love? or lack of your withdrawal? 
Drugs!! I need femine venoms in the system 
In order to function in the rhythm 

Tinted like the darkest shadows, my mind is cloudly subliminal 
Commands will penetrate then I get rowdy conditions 
Drowsy, the sedative brings negative enemies 
I slump down and stay ahead of me 

Powerful like metamphetamines my state is altered 
This here's no lie hydroponic, chronic 
Got you feeling all erotic aphrodisiac, who's got it? 
Alvarado maniacs risk poison time buying dimes 

When you got the fix get in the mix 
There's no denving drug's the only factor 
Got me in the rapture making an addict out of you 
And proceed to capture you mind 

You're mine, choke hold to your whole skull, substance uncontrolled 
Who holds straight keys to locks and unlocks key holes 
The structure of my trip is unstoppable 
I'm 50 hits of the dot all powerful 

We go deranged and remain living the last days in the haze of purple micro 
I remember when I was a high school star 
Had the proom queen, scholarship, brand new car 
It's funny, you never know who your friends are 

'til you lose all your sensibilities to the act-right 
But I'm all wrong; no wonder my family 
Don't want to have nothing to do with me 
Humiliation, neglect, no respect 

The concept of rehabilitation has been swept 
I wish I was clean a far fetched dream 
But what other way am I going to blow of my steam 
Heaven's all in this bottle of juice making me feel high 

Making me feel loose, get nowhere turn to no one

One of the chosen few
Leavin' you confused, dazed 
And what got you all amazed
How the fuck we could be so blazed?
It takes one block to fill your life with terror
Think of all your bullet holes 
Embedded in your area
Bullet, bullet and in the end, 
Who gets shot by motherfuckers making hip hop?

Represent underdogs world-wide
On the hustle leading crooked lives
We don't die, we multiply; but we divide
So how are we gonna survive?
You got your role, I got mine; don't cross paths
Cause an intersection's just another form of Clash, we crash

And the tune is death

We get stoned, tripped or wired

My people's exodus results in prejudice
You ask us why, in poverty, 
We become terrorists
Now let me tell you this
We don't choose to tote gats
And sellin' on the corner is to avoid tax
If you gun talk or hip-hop 
There's too much division
So find a new mission or it'll stop
We do our thing, talk slang, live on fast lanes
Some do it for money, and others for the fame

That's why a gun is kept I will employ its services 
If I need to stop their plot from being murderous 
Can't be a victim of fool who stick 'em 
They walk through life with the wicked smiles and piles of loot 
Don't hesitate to shoot in the quest for dead residents 
They're getting rich at the expense of dead presidents 
A lot of rascals causing deep fiascoes

Blast those who ain't down with me 
They got something I want and I'll take it 
If they resist it's permanent sleep 
Don't try to be brave; you'll end up in the grave

Leave shook with no question and then break

For visine disguises the red so his eyes gleam

The Psycho Realm,"I got mad visions, pictures and premonitions
Of war drums and suicide missions
Prosecution, execution, revolution, mass confusion
All over ready for war, I'm a soldier
Nightmares of cross-airs, concentration camps
And electric chairs marking you with the stamp
Prepare yourself

Am I paranoid? Why in my dreams, have I seen 
The whole world destroyed?
Civilization raped, ain't no escape
Situations escalate in the date of 2001
Revelation, or is it just my imagination?
Invasion dreams reoccuring
I can't explain it but it's the same one everyday

Televisions trackers citizens massacres
And cashless systems
The new order with no border renegades
The rule over the new age Malaise
Picture the gray haze consuming the world
This dream never goes away
I wish I knew the meaning of all this
Cause the pieces of the puzzle just don't fit

Premonitions of war cloud my every tought
Battles fought, won and lost a holocaust
Always the same ending, don't ever change
But I refuse to believe we all go down in flames

Making wicked smiles wicked frowns, we get down
With our own gangster sound
Static kingdoms break you and your manhood shallow
With shanks of venom metal
Rattle fuckin' snakes I'm as high as the stakes
Quarter ounce of weed to the head no breaks home wait
Street wars we get in them
Furious fist on my wrist is gonna get them and you

Out of frictions comes static causing mad panic
On the streets, the dramatic battles increase
We see more wars, less peace, we're even fighting police

Spread your body parts all over the continent
I'm a dominant mothafucka, but you're the opposite
Turn around put your hands on the side
Are you aligned by the sunshine on your gun
The outcome: you're just another one soul
Flyin' into the heavens hit by the '57

You think my music is crazy like tony montana
Fumando marijuana con santana tomorrow
I might not be alive, so I wanna bring all the enemy's sorrow
I rock the block with the music maniac
Tar back locos seekin' that warpath
Why don't punks be legit, they ell bring havoc in their head
A psycho one will shoot them dead
That's the fundamental to a fucked up mental

Just a flow in a party strike down the ungodly, unoriginal, hypocrites

Temporarily losin' my head steadily falling heavily on my shoulders

Getting me on my Achilles hell, I fell like somebody pulled
The plug from my brain signals indicate I'm on my way
Open the gates, be insane, psycho babble, constant battle
With myself pop the top on the pain killers on the top shelf

I'm doin' what it takes to get my shoe in the door let me win

Therefore you're makin' me go cyclone all pursuits go in a stole lo, lo, lo

I'm going through a quick view of what I thought
Was my mind being torn apart?

More painful than watching R. Kelly piss on your kids

Here's the ultimatum mothafucka
Give me that ass cap
Or give America Biggie and Tupac flashbacks
Some niggaz don't think the Underground is grimy and dirty

'Til they find your body on a fucking highway in Jersey
I fire rockets at generic topics
Your lyrics don't hold weight
Like two-dimensional objects

'Cause jail culture didn't give you that fitted hat
To memorize a ghostwritten shit verse and spit it back
I won't let your wack rhymes redefine lyricism
For a whole generation with their fathers in prison

You live inside the image of an Era that's gone
Like government officials trying to justify Vietnam
I'll leave niggaz traumatized like they momma died
And they was responsible for the driveby homicide

And I don't market revolution, I live it

To fill me.
And the lovers who will be. 
For, you see, love is one thing I do well.

Let's live on dreams...
In my dreams such beautiful lovers have found me.
Story book lovers surround me. 

Nothing is real, but I'm flying,
Sighing: Where, where, where is my story book
Ending?
Why does my golden pretending

Leave me with nothing to hold...but
My dreams?
Oh is it only in dreams that we find out ideal love?
Are there lovers with real love? 

If you know how to feel love, show me how.
Ah, but my prince, if you can't be as sweet as you seem, 
I'd rather dream!
Come and wake me! Come be the love I can hold now.

Storybook love leaves me cold now.
Show me the way to stop dreaming! 
There is only one perfect story book ending. 
That is the end of pretending.

With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That old top hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Was alive as he could be

The Puppini Sisters,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few

And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2011

But that's where my room is, that's where I keep my stuff

Women around here don't fare all too well
There's usually a comment or a taunt from some loser who smells
The ones who get married or shack up don't last too long
Their men like to fight - sometimes with guns

Things out here can get a little crazy
People are aimless - not so smart - a bit lazy
Things in my neighbourhood can get a little rough
But that's where my room is, that's where I keep my stuff

Some of the old ones have lived here for years
They keep their places nice in spite of everything
Once they had a meal for the lonely and downtrodden
Now they lock their doors tight - those days are forgotten

At night there's a lot of yelling at each other and to themselves
I hope I never hear somebody's final cry for help
There's a lot of hate out there so I keep my head down
Past the 7-11, down my dark street till I get home

Things out here can get a little crazy
People are aimless - not so smart - a bit lazy
Things in my neighbourhood can get a little rough
But that's where my room is, that's where I keep my stuff",Little Platoons (My Neighbourhood),1990
The Pursuit of Happiness,"Don't make me speak in a new language
Just let me tell you the way that I feel about you
I sure don't want to offend anyone
But if you take away my words how can I tell you the truth

An old-fashioned boy and a modern girl
And the way that we talk turns our heasds around
Your passion is real when I'm in your arms
But when you speak it gets watered down

I know I'm not very articulate
I can't express myself innocuously
But what I say - it comes from the heart
Must you distort the real meaning

[Chorus]

I know it's been said that talk is cheap
But we know the power it really has
Must it be rigid and so benign
Can't it be free and efficacious

[Chorus]",New Language,1990
The Pursuit of Happiness,"I've got a little girl, though I know it won't be long
Before she finds another boy who will sit her by the fireplace
And sing her a song
It feels like there's no safe place

In a world that's come apart
And the deafening sound of a bursting bubble
Wakes you up with a start
Is there nowhere that is safe

Why can't we change the rules so I win
All I need is an escape
A temporary place to hide
When she's coming in the door when she's walking out the door

Hard to tell which is worse
That false feeling of relief when she comes in
Or the empty feeling when she's gone
And every night on the streets the forces of darkness

Score another victory
And I stand with the timid waiting for the devil
To make a martyr of me

[Chorus]

Fold up the tents and load up the trucks
'Cause it's time to move on
If we only knew where to go
I hope that we'd already be gone

And even when we're lying together, I make sure she falls asleep first
It seems when things are at their best, my mind starts to wander
To things at their worst
So do I fall asleep and dream of a peace that never will come

Or do I roll over and let her break the glass around my heart
And set off the alarm

[Chorus]",No Safe Place,1990
The Pursuit of Happiness,"I'm no ladies man - I don't run around
It's really not my style
I mean I like to flirt but I don't want to hurt
You could say I'm just a friendly guy

It doesn't often happen but sometimes I'll get a girl laughing
That's if she'll even give me a look
But when it comes to matters of the heart I'll tell you right up front
I'm playing by the book

Baby, there is one thing I am saving just for you
Darling, I got one thing I ain't giving to nobody but you
Sometimes if she's not shy I like to steal a little kiss
A little kiss if she's willing and young

Sometimes she'll be a little too eager
(I hate it when they almost choke you with their tongue)
That's when I back off and try and catch my breath
And think of what I've got to lose

She might be pretty and witty and fun but between the two of you
I know who I'll chose

[Chorus]

Sometimes I go too far - the girls just think I'm icky
They can see the boner in my pants
I know I should keep my hands to myself
But I can't -- I just can't

My skin gets creepy crawly and I'm so alcoholly
That I know it's time for me to leave
'Cause it all means nothing
I belong to you and that's something you'll just have to believe

[Chorus]",The One Thing,1990
The Pursuit of Happiness,"Paula's sister has legs as long as hers
Maybe a little bit longer
They're tan and shiny and newly grown
And they fit so easily on her

Paula's sister's eyes sparkle and flair
With the promise of her youth
Paula's eyes are beautiful but dark
Because they know the truth

[Chorus]
I guess that beauty runs in the family
I guess that beauty runs in the family
It's as easy as DNA

Paula's sister has no lines on her face
Nobody's hurt her yet
Paula's smile is still devastating
But I see it less and less

She looks a lot like Paula did
When we first met
Before I wore her spirit down
And filled her with regret

I'm talking to her like an older brother
She's talking to me with her shoes off
She looks at me with innocence
I look away

The Pursuit of Happiness,"If you shave your legs I'll stay home every night
I'll defer to you, I'll let you win every fight
I'll forget about all the things that you said
All the times you've hurt me and left me for dead

If you Need your legs I'll lie at your feet
I won't come home drunk and fall fast asleep
I'll ignore the fact that you've broken my spirit
That contempt in your voice, I'll pretend I don't hear it

I'll do anything that you want
If it means that we can stay together
I'll do anything that you want
Can't we keep the peace and stay together

If they're soft and smooth I'll be faithful and true
I'll forget all my friends that take time from you
I know you're not attracted to me any more
But we can keep that hidden behind our locked door

If they're sleek and shiny we can have a child
You can call it want you want, you can let it run wild
Just rub yourself against me once in a while
Let me run my lips down them, give me a reason to smile

If it means that we can stay together

Can't we keep the peace and stay together",Shave Your Legs,1990
The Pursuit of Happiness,"His kisses are like drugs... They turn your eyes inside your head
Your skin comes alive... And your brain shuts off.
Then he turns on you and he's cruel and heartless
You can't figure out what went wrong

He's a hungry baby far from his mother
And you're no comfort at all

There's something physical between you
That keeps you tied to him
Like chains, it'll drag you down

When he's not around it's easy to intellectualize that he's no good
So you sit at home and you sleep and you dream a little more than you should
Then he opens the door
There's liquor on his breath, and perfume in his hair

He holds you close -- he's so warm and strong
And gradually you don't care

[Chorus]

Sometimes you don't hear from him at all
And the voice in your head becomes a shout
What has he got that you can't live without

The Pursuit of Happiness,"When you get scared you come to me pleadingly
I must be there whenever you call
To betray your faith would be my greatest sin
Your love's so deep it makes me feel small

[Chorus]
Now it's me, not your father, keeping the ghosts away
When we kiss it's a bond that I cannot hide from
I can't hurt the one I'm trusted to care for
It's not love any more - it's survival

When we're apart I cannot comfort you
But your heart is safe with me every night
When temptation's hand pulls me away from you
I must resist or forfeit my life

[Chorus]",Survival,1990
The Pursuit of Happiness,"You're a rebel, you're a dude
You tried to be aloof
But she tamed your wild heart
Now you're just another lovesick goof

You were hard but you broke down
You let your guard down for a minute
Turned sweet, turned nice
You gave a shit and now you're in it

You got down on your knees
You said she was your queen
You treated her like royalty
But it only made her mean

Now she's bored -- bored of you
You killed her love with kindness, buddy
Now she's bored -- bored of you
Nice guys finish last

Hey bad boy, too late to cry
You're already out of mind
She's got a new mark in her sights
She left you standing in the dog food line

Your love made you weak
But your hate will make you strong
You're blinded by pain
But you won't be for long

You didn't have the strength to resist her carnal forces
Now she's cut you loose to run with her other broken horses

The Pursuit of Happiness,"Your footsteps are Pavlov's bell
Your touch makes me young

You satisfy my ego
But still I'm pathologically restless
I hopelessly wander away from you
I know in my heart I should want no one else

But I do
I know in my heart I should want no one else
But I do
I hear your words in their idle chatter

I smell you on me over their perfume
I think of you when I'm with them
I'm so ashamed
But my heart is a liar

It betrays and confuses me
When I'm disabled by sorrow
It's to blame

The Pursuit of Happiness,"Cigarette dangles - makes me hard
Kidnap me throw me in the back of your car
Take me to your room where the flowers hang like bats
Poison me with liquor then break out the party hats

Kiss me till you hurt me, then again until I'm numb
Burn holes in my neck with the venom of your tongue
Remind me again how lucky I am right now
Laugh at my body but then turn off the light and put out

Cigarette dangles 
(I want to ride the big wave)
Cigarette dangles

(Open up the bomb bay)
I want to ride that wave
Your cigarette dangles, my flesh is weak
Pedal to the metal darlin', 'cause I'm about to peak

Now sit up straight, hook your legs through the rocking chair
I want to find a new way to show you how I care

I start talking real loud about something he don't care about

One more coffee, three more aspirin, two more vitamin be	
Much regret now that the morning's crashing down on me
A few beers later I felt like mating
I asked the girl how old she was, she told me she was eighteen

I never would have done it if I hadn't got so stinking
Good thing I found out before I brought her home
But then forgot to get my change from the cab driver, oh no

In her dreams, her toes spike the air
Her fingers running through long greasy hair

The Push Stars,"So she went to the bar on the corner
With some friends who were buried alive
And a man leaned over to tell her
That her luck had finally arrived
Said he drove a Cadillac
They could sneak out through the crack
And he'd never bring her back here again

Watched her finger twirl a circle in her drink
But if you think too much then you'll never decide
You end up like an ice cube sinking down to the bottom
So you do what you must to survive
So she walked out by his side
Two strange shadows in the night
Disappeared in the streetlights and were gone

And here I am
And here I am

""So where's it parked"" she said ""we've walked so far and I'm getting so tired""
And he looked like a crook who'd just been caught
He said ""I don't own no Cadillac
Don't even own a paper sack
To carry the confidence that I lack... and my lies""

So she said ""you know I just can't believe this""
He said ""go ahead, just leave, I understand""
But instead she rested his head on her shoulder
But how could he love her with nothing to give her
But empty pockets and a crooked man?

Well she said ""You can love me with your hands
You can love me with your eyes
You can love me with your voice
And your lies""

Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now, give me more

Sway me, make me
Thrill me, hold me
Bend me, ease me
You have a way with me

Hey, yeah, sway me
Sway, sway, sway

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak, I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins

You wanna look but you don't wanna see

You better stop if you're making more plans
'Cause everything you do makes you look like a fool

You're looking for some dirt,
I'm lifting up my skirt
I'm searching for a light under me in my purse
You always think the worst,
I just wanna flirt
You found me on my knees,
Next thing you're saying ""tease""
I'm trying to find my phone and my keys, not your sleaze
My spell is like a curse,
I just wanna flirt


I gotta know, don't you really understand
One syllable words old man?
You got a problem with my space?
Get your look out of my face

You're pretty damn close to being unfine

Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer

All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers

And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
Cause I see sunset in your eyes

Who you trying to impress
Think you better check your style
That might have worked before
But I ain't having it

Show me that you got the touch
Hear the words that I don't say
Gotta read between the lines
You gotta learn this song

'Cause I wanna be played like a sweet guitar
Played like a slow jam in the dark
Gotta find the groove
You know what to do to get to me
I wanna be played like a violin
Make the strings talk with your finger tips
Never go to fast
Gotta understand
The way I need too be played

It's not about the way you roll
Your making it too obvious
Try to be original
You gotta learn me
Don't be in such a rush

I can be your symphony
Listen to me all night long
If you give me what I need
I could be your favorite song

I wanna be played like a sweet guitar
Played like a slow jam in the dark
Gotta find the groove
You know what to do to get to me
I wanna be played like a violin
Make the strings talk with your finger tips
Never go to fast
Gotta understand
The way I need too be played

You make it just like that
Come on do it again
We're going to get this right
Even if it takes all night

Do you feel me?
That's right
Take it nice and slow

I wanna be played like a sweet guitar
Played like a slow jam in the dark
Gotta find the groove

 Everything dropped in the game cause I'm rowdy
 Carry on I will take a hammer to your Audi
 I met a soldier from Saudi
 Not bad round me
 Wanna see D try and how me
 Cause next week and you still aint ground me
 The phone starts ringing when a drive thru grounds me
 Where's lethal he aint in boundary

The Quiet Five,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

And all the weak I'm goin deep, and I can roll deeper than you
Half breed rock the mics to survive
And I might not make it out alive I'm spittin to save my life
Tryin a make it right welcome to the world that we live
And all that I did was crawl up out the stuff for my kids
So rest in peace to Little Eazy

Ride to the rythme of the nickel put the pen in the pack now
And I know you fear me, I done been there
Done that, run that, fun that covered around
And let me kill 'em with the venom we killin 'em with the sound
Every city, every little bitty town
Everybody want to break me down
Nobody gonna take me down East 99 has been abandoned

I'm sick of the drama, sick of havin beef with my momma
And beef with my sisters my brother got murdered
Over marijuana bless the bewilders
Strugglin, hustlin all of my life, watching my back
They already tried to murder me twice
I smoke the herb that I like, I never done coke in my life
We buy but I lie if I did it I'd tell entertainment tonight
Ain't no slackin in my rack it ain't no shame in the game
It ain't no slippin and the pimpin ain't no crack on the brain
You gotta be jealous of me and my fellas
Ain't that what they tell us sell us anything
We helpless give me a little bit faq and help us
We strugglin, jugglin, thugglin, hustlin, thuggin up in the club
No one to talk to, you step on his shoes
You really fucked up, poppa you was a roller
But his pockets are all swollen, you met the dope man
And now we on the block ask who told 'em
Sell 'em  some soap man that's for all the times you played me

The Raconteurs,"I'm not sure if there's a point to this story
But I'm going to tell it again
So many other people try to tell the tale
Not one of them knows the end

It was a junk-house in South Carolina
Held a boy the age of ten
Along with his older brother Billy
And a mother and her boyfriend
Who was a triple loser with some blue tattoos
That were given to him when he was young
And a drunk temper that was easy to lose
And thank god he didn't own a gun

Well, Billy woke up in the back of his truck
Took a minute to open his eyes
He took a peep into the back of the house
And found himself a big surprise
He didn't see his brother but there was his mother
With her red-headed head in her hands
While the boyfriend had his gloves wrapped around an old priest
Trying to choke the man

Ah Ah Ah

Billy looked up from the window to the truck
Threw up, and had to struggle to stand
He saw that red-necked bastard with a hammer
Turn the priest into a shell of a man
That priest was putting up the fight of his life
But he was old and he was bound to lose
The boyfriend hit as hard as he could
And knocked the priest right down to his shoes

Well, now Billy knew but never actually met
The preacher lying there in the room
He heard himself say, ""That must be my daddy""
Then he knew what he was gonna do
Billy got up enough courage, took it up
And grabbed the first blunt thing he could find
It was a cold, glass bottle of milk
That got delivered every morning at nine

Ah Ah Ah

Billy broke in and saw the blood on the floor, and
He turned around and put the lock on the door
He looked dead into the boyfriend's eye
His mother was a ghost, too upset to cry, then

He took a step toward the man on the ground
From his mouth trickled out a little audible sound
He heard the boyfriend shout, ""Get out!""
And Billy said, ""Not till I know what this is all about""
""Well, this preacher here was attacking your mama""

But Billy knew just who was starting the drama
So Billy took dead aim at his face
And smashed the bottle on the man who left his dad in disgrace, and
The white milk dripped down with the blood, and the
Boyfriend fell down dead for good
Right next to the preacher who was gasping for air
And Billy shouted, ""Daddy, why'd you have to come back here?""

His mama reached behind the sugar and honey, and
Pulled out an envelope filled with money
""Your daddy gave us this,"" she collapsed in tears
""He's been paying all the bills for years""
""Mama, let's put this body underneath the trees
And put Daddy in the truck and head to Tennessee""
Just then, his little brother came in
Holding the milk man's hat and a bottle of gin singing

La la la la, la la la la, yeah
La la la la, la la la la, yeah
La la la la, la la la la, yeah

No place on earth do I love more sincerely,
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born.

There let me live 'till I wither and decay,
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
There's where this old darkies' life am passed away.

Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore.
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.

In the days of my childhood.
In the evening when the sun was sinking low,
Walking in the wildwood.

We'd go hand in hand.
Looking back on all the happy hours,
Anyone could understand.

Sure 'nuff got to be, babe,
Birds of a feather.
We should be together
Like birds of a feather.
Got to be together
Like birds of a feather.

You and I didn't have a lot of friends,
Didn't have too much to say.
So they never would let us join in,
All the games they used to play.
Seems like it was only yesterday,
Down at Lincoln Junior High.
I remember what the kids used to say,
As we'd go strolling by.

[Chorus]

Time goes rolling by.
They say that you and I must go our separate ways.
But birds of a feather will always be together.

Your folks didn't want me hanging 'round.
Said that I was bad for you.
So we'd meet on the other side of town,
Down a long dark avenue.
But they can't keep the two of us apart,
As long as you really love me,
I got a feeling way down in my heart,
That's the way it's gonna be.

The Raincoats,"I met her in a club down in Old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola
C-O-L-A cola

She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L-O-L-A Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola

I’m not the world’s most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she almost broke my spine
Oh my Lola

Well I’m not dumb but I can’t understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh my Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola

Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said dear boy won’t you come home with me

Well I’m not the world’s most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola

I pushed her away

I fell to the floor
I went down on my knees

That’s the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It’s a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola

Well I left home just a week before
And I’d never ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said ""Little boy I’m gonna make you a man""

Well I’m not the world’s most masculine man

Well, me and Mark Twain were having us a ball
Telling each other lies, floating down from Hannibal
With a bottle and a worm and a cane pole
We were fishing for secrets where the catfish crawl
And the Mississippi River's flowing downstream
Meet the Gulf of Mexico somewhere downstream
Meet the Atlantic Ocean somewhere downstream
Gonna meet you in the water somewhere downstream
Well, we picked up Harry Truman floating down from Independence
We said ""What about the war?"", he said ""Good riddance""
We said ""What about the Bomb, are you sorry that you did it?""
He said ""Pass me that bottle, and mind your own business""
And the Mississippi River's flowing downstream
Meet the Gulf of Mexico somewhere downstream
Meet the Atlantic Ocean somewhere downstream
Gonna meet you in the water somewhere downstream
Well, we're rounding St. Louis and heading for the coast
When we pick up Chuck Berry in a little rowboat
With one oar in the water and one in the air
A lightning rod for a white guitar
And lightning struck once, and lightning struck twice
And I said ""If there's a God, He sure ain't nice""
And Chuck said ""God is an Indian giver
I don't trust nothing but the Mississippi River""
And the Mississippi River's flowing downstream
Meet the Gulf of Mexico somewhere downstream
Meet the Atlantic Ocean somewhere downstream
Gonna meet you in the water somewhere downstream

Well you've come to the wrong place
You might find lines, but no valentines
Written all over my face
I bear no grudge, I wear no frown
I just come with calloused hands
And I don't mean to bring you down but
There is no romance.

I've spent too much of my life waiting
Hoping, dreaming, wishing, believing,
And way too little of it living
Smashing it up and taking and giving
I wish someone had warned me
While I was still a young man
And saved me lots of time and money
There is no romance.

No romance, no romance, no romance, no romance
No romance, no romance, no romance, no romance

Save your stories for the bartender
And your crying for the theater
And your poems and your diary pages
To kill some time in your old age.

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh

There may be gods who hear your prayers
And honest men who, men who care
And young lovers who say they will wait forever
Lives that look like movies and books
But the sooner that you learn this
The sooner you free your hands
To get on with things that really matter
There is no romance.

Writing paperback novels like a man possessed
Every name was changed every story was true
Every priest was me every stripper was you
And they danced like angels cast out for being lovers
I wrote their life story on a matchbook cover

I ate a big dinner and went walking around

I'm stuck like a half-smoked cigarette
Between mates and the chances of something happenin'
She's in a group, she might be leaving soon

For a club or just a taxi home
I'd like to be in a taxi by her
Take a chance, make my move
Could be knocked back and they would all see

My mates and hers, it will be ugly
Or maybe it'll work and this night would be
More than just jabber to my mates and me
She's just leaving holes in your memory

Swing test to a heart in her sleeve
Instead I'll be back at her under the sheets
With TV on and she would smell good
We'll wake up and go to work, the world would be alright for once

(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
There ain't no home tonight
(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
There ain't no home tonight

(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I asked her for a light
(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
There ain't no home tonight

Yeah, I have to use your toothbrush
I know that you may not like that much
But stop for a second Freda while you touch
Most girl's magazines, blah, blah, blah

(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
I ain't going home tonight

Fall asleep again

Sprinkle a motherfucker that will leave you split
Tore back ass out bringing you your hat
Flat broke, talking about fuck that nigga S-P-I
But you can't go one on one Spice 1 because I'm born to die
I gets even up on they ass like punk bitches in ditches
The gangsterism resulting in murderism
Bailing up in your hooptie at the gas station
You facing the killer for real-a punk ass nigga where the scrilla
Jacking you for your shit, taking your ends pull off my mask
Hitting the corner, hopping up in my Benz with your cash
Mobbing I mash out, you ass out
Left you shot up in your seven-trey glasshouse
Because you don't know me like you think you do, I'm
Down for thefetty
Ready to die for them presidents, high powered and deadly
I ask to ball or not to ball, partner answer the question
I meet a nigga running up on my hooptie with Smith
And Wesson

One time for your mind
Here to represent the pimps, playas, hustlas, ballers
All my niggas on the grind, packing nine millimeters
Nine lives like cheetahs, but your still in ?
Drug dealers peep the shit that I kick
Hustling, busting down zips making chips
If we ain't making it we taking shit
To the extreme hit the scenery with machine
Gun, get the creamery and ice cream, nobody scream
Nobody run, I come like point blank
Mobbing the motherfucking bank, looking like Benjamin Frank and Itake
So many penitentiary chances, to make
Scrilla scratch niggas must have more stack in the safe
I mean ? nigga your safe is my safe
And I'm gonna make sure that my safe ain't your safe
By putting a .38 up in your face
For running up in my place and shake the spot
And not expect to get your ass shot
Yeah, another one bites the dust, the shyster busts
Caps at your house
Matter fact, niggas don't like the Yukmouth
About to L-U, didn't they tell you
I'm a youngster trying to have something like my
Nigga L-Q
Ballin'

Put a gauge between your throat and tell you that
Your out of place
Motherfuckers don't be knowing we vicious and vicious
To get the cheese
More tickets to G's, cruises overseas
Can't be no punk about the shit that we're in
Got to be a soldier to the game or nigga you'll never get your dividends
Balling til I die, until I die I'll be a baller
Let my riders do the dirt and I'll be the shot-caller
Whatever I got to do for the lifestyle that'll pay them forever
Never slip stay on my toes nigga walk with the yellow stripe
But pull me back, because they cowards and shit
I be the nigga that take your drama and put a twist
In your the shit

The Rally Boys,"Game  street lessons  game  game 
Chapter one  alright go  yeah yeah  yo yo yo 
Haha  one two  this is what is up  nigga (freeze) 
Only the survivors survive in the world of survival 
Where your rivals always want to make it seem 
like they're gonna do things and always concocting schemes and plots 
You know exactly what it is (you know!) 
You know exactly how it's gonna be (ha) haha (you'll never catch me fool) 
What  five lessons  five chapters, I'ma start 

How you gonna make a couple dollars 
When you roam in zones filled with cowards 
Ain't no way to make no real cash nigga 
Conceal your canning, all you do is flash nigga (motherfucker) 
I can tell, fool, you'll never get paid 
'Cause niggaz like you ain't got no real game 
With all them niggaz that you got by your side 
You learned by yourself that the only way to ride 
I'ma put you up on (game) 
This whole world revolves around (game) 
Pure indeed game, and let it obtain 
I roll with my girl and weeds 
All oversees with loot like I'm flipping keys 
I heard niggaz gonna catch me on a slipping tip 
Come through with the auto's, cock, flip and shit (hell no) 
But I knew from the giddy-up, like EST

Once you realize you'll never live without (game) 
Get paid without, no moves made without (game) 

It's the force, the call of the holocaust 
Go against the source, end up lost 
The portrait of a wild puma 
Silent penetration like poison, pinpointing 
Isolating hearts, poetical poisonous darts 
Puncture like needles, I always take care of my peoples 
Verbals vital, no rivals, there's no equals, no sequels 

With no one to help us 

I'll leave you crying for help and helpless and healthless, wealthless 

Oversellers envious and jealous 

Bitches and sneaks, pants and muscles 

I saw a view through the eyes 

Fake ass, bitch ass niggaz in disguise 

Keep calm, release the neutron napalm bomb on young hawks 

Splitting wigs like logs, cloudy visions like fogs 

When the pump gets to pumping, 

niggaz get to jumping like frogs, smoke like bungs 

Get to stepping, stepping with your weapon 

Pause, creep crapped and left in the puddle in seconds 

Fuck 'em with veterans, with game... 



Chorus (2x) 



One time, on time 

Give it to me all, 'cause I want it all 

Give it to me all, 'cause I love to brawl

One time, yeah I love to brawl 

One time (give it up), one time (give it up) 

Check it out 



It's hard to sustain and maintain through life 

With these motherfuckers throwing niggaz three strikes 

The homie big Lou got a fo' on deez 

That's the word, came up from flipping birds 

Words travel like black talents 

The homie's loud at silence, real G's move in silence 

How you gonna make it to the next stage 

If one second you're broke, the next minute paid 

Now you got the police planning 

Niggaz on the street scanning, loading up cannons 

If it was me, I'd move silently 

Prepare warfare, react violently 

Lou is too flashy, new clothes 

(???) with hoes, and got penetrated 

He had too many hoes knowing where he resides 

Soon as he got home niggaz was waiting in sight, no game 

Shh... 



Know what?

As merry as can be

Ma sì, davanti a te non freno
II resto non lo so
L'hai capito o no?
Ti avrò con le mani
Sciogliendo I tuoi capelli
Difenditi però
Ti prenderò
Oh Jo non dirmi di no
Tu mi piaci come questa birra

E sì, mi hai steso e mi va bene

And her earrings touched her shoulders.

I live there with my mommy""

She arose to let me in
Her mother chanced to meet me.
She caught her by the hair of the head
And down to the room she brought her
With the root of a hazel twig
She was the well beat daughter.

Will you marry me now or never?
Will you marry me you sildier lad?
Can't you see I'm done forever?
I can't marry you now my bonnie wee lass
Can't marry you my honey

Hold my hand and leave me leave me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary I haven't seen Mary in years

To see a bit of heaven shoot across the sky
The one and only time Daddy saw it fly

It came from the east just as bright as a torch
The neighbors had a party on their porch
Daddy rocked the baby, Mother said ""amen""
When Halley came to visit in nineteen ten

Now back then Jackson was a real small town
And it's not every night a comet comes around
It was almost eighty years since its last time through
So I bet your mother would've said ""amen"" too

The papers wrote about it every day for a week
They wondered where it's going and where it's been

To dream a little dream of a comet's charms
And he made a little wish as she slept so sound

We called an ambulance without any reason

Funky time!
It was the best thing on that boring Saturday
While we made plans what we're gonna do that day.
My friend's dog little Muffy got a heart attack.

It was real but we both just laughed at that.
It took some time to get that dog was dead
'n' lying feet to the roof on my friend's bed.
We called an ambulance without any reason

'n' told the man it was dog hunting season.
The man screamed, I guess he felt some pain in chest.
He left up but I think that was best.
'n' all thought we got two bodies in the house

In the shadows for my time
I've been searching, I've been living
For tomorrow's all my life
In the shadows

They say that I must learn to kill before I can feel safe
But I, I'd rather kill myself than turn into their slave

Sometimes I feel that I should go and play with the thunder
Somehow I just don't want to stay and wait for a wonder

I've been watching, I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time
I've been searching, I've been living

Watching, waiting for something
Feel me, touch me, heal me
Come take me higher

Beneath the northern stars
We cried from the laughter
And died in each others' arms

Remember and live forever
Remember to live for love

I got back my letters
Ages ago
Your address unknown
I passed a stranger
Who had your eyes
Or was it you?

We ran through the graveyard
To catch the midnight sun
We danced drunk and naked
Until the summer was gone

That it came to this,
You paralyzed my body
With a poison kiss
For forty days and nights
I was chained to your bed,
You thought that was
The end of the story
Something inside me
Called freedom came alive
Living in a world without you.

You told me my darling,
""Without me, you're nothing""
You taught me, to look in your eyes
And fed me your sweet lies!

Suddenly someone will stare
In the window.
Looking outside at the sky
That had never been blue...

Ahh!, there's a world without you
I see the light.
Living in a world without you.
Ahh!, there is hope to guide me
I will survive!

You put me together
Then trashed me for pleasure
You used me again and again
Abused me, confused me!

Suddenly naked I run
Through your garden.
Right through the gates of the
Past and I'm finally free...

Ahh!, there's a world without you

The Raspberries,"I can remember Summer skies and your eyes
And in September, when I first realized
That I needed you to be
The other half of me

And my love long locked inside itself
Had finally been set free
I can remember Autumm skies and goodbyes
Hurting so badly that I thought I would die

The more they stay the same
And the lonely ones get lonelier
With every passing day

From the day we met I knew that I should
Never let you
Get a hold on me 'cause noe you see I
Can't forget you

Oh I, I can remember midsummer skies

In the Spring, the sun will shine and make the
Ice surrender

But it will not warm my heart as long as
I remember
And I, I will remember midsummer skies
Love in your eyes

And I, I will remember the times I've cried
Since you say goodbye
I nearly died when you said,
""I, I can't let you down anymore

So I guess this goodbye""
What, what did you do it for?
Everytime I think of you and him together
I break down and cry

Oh I, I can remember the tears I've cried

The Rat Pack,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'Til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues/Closing,2006

No armoured knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

Just make it one for my baby, and one more

You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
So when I'm gloomy, won't you listen to me
'Til it's talked away
Well, that's how it goes

And Joe I know you're getting anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear

Must be drowned or it soon might explode

Stay with me, sway with me

There's my lover
Just imagine she comes running to me
For love

For I mustn't show my love

Those are the lips that kiss me
Those are the arms that hold me
Those loving hands caress me

Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the faker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show

(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
