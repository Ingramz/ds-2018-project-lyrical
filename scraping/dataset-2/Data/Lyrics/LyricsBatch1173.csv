The Rockmelons,"I'm flat on my back and
Just staring at the ceiling
Breakfast in bed
Confusion and coffee
Upside down and hidden meaning
Technicolor dreams in my head

I could spend a lifetime
Just contemplating
Whoa yeah, oh yeah
I could tell now by the way you look
You're all through with hesitating
Cos you just wanna hear

That word, say it clear now
L.O.V.E. love
That word, how can four letters mean so much
That word, L.O.V.E. love
That word, said L.O.V.E. love

All style and no substance
You can think but keep it to yourself
I can't sleep at night and I can't be somebody else
I've got power, I'm gonna use it
Put the message in your music
Realize the dreams in your head, wo-oh

Baby don't you know around the world

The Rockmelons,"Well I've had love before
I should have known what was goin' on
I can see why you have chosen to ignore me
My fault for being so cruel
I should have know
That you would hear about us
Well I don't know what I was thinkin' of
If you can find it in your heart to forgive me
I'll be waiting here for the two of us 
Cause it's not over till it's over
Till I'm over you
Cause it's not over till it's over
Till I'm over you

You know this love that we both once had
Was simply too good to be true
But I was tempted by another
And I abused you
I saw you standin' there
At the end of our street
And I remember how we used to live
If I could change your mind
Or turn back the hands of time
Well you'd be in my arms
In my arms
In my arms again

The Rockwells,"Who's watching?
Tell me who's watching.
Who's watching me?

I'm just an average man, with an average life.
I work from nine to five; hey hell, I pay the price.
All I want is to be left alone in my average home;
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and

I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Tell me is it just a dream?

When I come home at night.
I bolt the door real tight.
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid.
Well, can the people on T.V. see me.
Or am I just paranoid?

When I'm in the shower.
I'm afraid to wash my hair.
'Cause I might open my eyes
And find someone standing there.
People say I'm crazy.
Just a little touched.
But maybe showers remind me of
""Psycho"" too much.
That's why. . .

I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Who's playing tricks on me?

Who's watching me?
I don't know anymore . . . are the neighbors watching
Who's watching?
Well, it's the mailman watching me:  and I don't feel safe anymore.
Tell me who's watching.
Oh, what a mess.  I wonder who's watching me now,
(WHO?) the I.R.S.?

I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.

The Rocky Mountain Playboys,"Let me be the one to walk with you
When you want somebody to talk with you
Anything that makes you happy I wanna do
Oh darling let me be the one
Let me be the one who means the most
The one you wanna love and call your own
And when you choose your partner I wanna be the choice
Oh please let me be the one

Let me be the one to sit with you
And when you want some lovin' I'll know just what to do
Lots of lots of huggin' and a kiss or two

To your favorite places you have no doubt
And when the evening's gone we'd kiss goodnight

All your little pleasures and sorrows too
In all kind of weather I wanna be with you

The Rocky Top X-Press,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

The Rodeo,"A magic wand
Now in your hand
Time to make a change
How can I teach you?
A better way to do
Something you won’t do
Up high in the sky
With butterflies
The setting is so nice
Add more colour
Make the world wilder
‘Cause I feel bored and sad

I’m a dreamer every night
In your shadow, here’s the light
Here’s a place I want to be

And see the world through your eyes

Dazzled by the sun
My feet won’t burn
It’s warmer in my heart
In your kingdom
The trees in blossom
The branches are my arms
A thrilling feeling
I try to explain
My mouth is dry

I’m a dreamer every night
In your shadow, here’s the light
Here’s a place I want to be
So crazy and unique

And see the world through your eyes

Turn the sandglass round
It’s time to fall in love
Turn the sandglass round",Here's the Light,2010
The Rodeo,"I live in a ditch with my friends and enemies
We’ve thrown all the thorns to dry my inspiration up
I have no more words, I have no more patience
I have only sounds that hardly come from my mouth
My skull is like a cracked ballot box

But when the darkest night’ll come to us
The light won’t shine it will make me nervous
And who’s gonna hear your message on the radio
(Radio, I’m on the radio)
We’re not even deaf but I scream to stay out of this nightmare
And who’s gonna hear your message on the radio
(Radio, I’m on the radio)

I live in a ditch where too much waste piles up
Where my fallen dreams are more important than your talk
I’m a zombie for myself but for you I’m still a baby
My mind is half empty what the hell am I gonna do?
My skull is like a cracked ballot box

But when the darkest night’ll come to us
The light won’t shine it will make me nervous
And who’s gonna hear your message on the radio
(Radio, I’m on the radio)
We’re not even deaf but I scream to stay out of this nightmare
And who’s gonna hear your message on the radio
(Radio, I’m on the radio)",On the Radio,2010
The Rodeo,"Love’s a bird, a hard creature to tame
When its large wings sweep your door in vain
The weight of love is heavier than it seems
But, unexpected, it looks like a dream

And the wind blows through the mountains
Icarus was not insane
All the forsaken souls sing their hard times in chorus 
But you went away

One fine day the feathers fell off one by one
Now the animal looks nothing like a swan
You can hardly speak you’re not so strong
Time to put your own bird in a cage for so long",Bird,2010
The Rodeo,"You wished the Earth would swallow you up
To live under the stars above
Underground with beautiful shapes
Hand shadows

Move both hands very slowly across the screen
A silhouette appears suddenly through the beam
Your fingers are the most nimble I’ve ever seen

The light is too faint
To see your face
But I can feel
That you’re out of breathe

You wished the Earth would swallow you up
To live under the stars above
Underground with beautiful shapes
Hand shadows

Make two baby birds or a woodpecker
An elephant or a snake
Make an Old King Cole or a clown
An Old Mother Hubbard and her dog

You wished the Earth would swallow you up
To live under the stars above
Underground with beautiful shapes
Hand shadows",Hand Shadows,2010
The Rodeo,"High, high, resolution world
No flaws, no mistakes, nothing blurred,
Connected to the computer
What are we gonna do?
Not found, a message error on the screen and then you hung around
Beyond us there’s a wall of sound
Baby don’t you know
I’m good inside
You know I’m feeling good inside
Good, good, inside

I know you can’t
You can’t direct my hand
You can’t control my joy or my pain

Now, enter the word “alive”
My heart’s compressed in a desperate file
Let’s erase the codes we apply
What are we gonna do?
True, it’s true and funny how things you escape from and think about
Are maybe the links to our lives?

I know you can’t
You can’t direct my hand
You can’t control my joy or my pain",High Resolution World,2010
The Rodeo,"I’m on my way to tell the end
The end but not a happy end
My mouth is full of razorblades
But I keep thinking of the past

I should have said
Everything’s gonna be ok
The tape is on
Recording all the words that come

‘Cause I’m gonna leave you
You know how much I care for you

I don’t know why I slow down my step
Maybe I know but I’m afraid
You’re really like the first day we met
I shouldn’t have any regrets

I should have known
The tears come, easy come
I should have said
Everything’s gonna be ok

‘Cause I’m gonna leave you
You know how much I care for you
For you",I'm Gonna Leave You,2010
The Rodeo,"I’ve been wandering like no one my whole life
Leaving all my partners, what a big surprise!
But maybe one day, someone’ll make me stay

But I’m still loving, that kind of living
If you don’t respect it, run!
...
You’d better know where I come from!

Sometimes I keep on cheating like a child
When my mom spanked me, I never cried
The more we deprive me of  love, the more I’m wild! 

But I’m still loving, that kind of living
If you don’t respect it, run!
...
Or you won’t even notice when I am gone

I was dreaming about an army
Where I will be, lonely

If I’m just a little soldier
With no armour
What should I be?

Authority is part of me, 
It will lead me
To the next story",Little Soldier,2010
The Rodeo,"I remember this pier where we were
Walking like two lonesome friends
The sky was our trophy
A beautiful dream
As far as the eye can see
You told me in a low voice:
“Heads or tails”, 
“Tails” we can get away from it all

But I can’t get out
Of my modern life

Listening to the ocean
Curled up in your arms
I didn’t expect that much
I was not in the mood
For being back for good
You told me in a low voice:
“Why can’t you see, we could get away from it all”

But I can’t get out
Of my modern life",Modern Life,2010
The Rodeo,"I need a friend who well understands
All these ghosts in me that haunt my memories
Oh my God
I saw you there just sitting next to me
-
I need your hand to forget my pain
All these clouds I see
Draft proof my memories
I thought you here from behind, so real
But it was someone else

All the angels are gone
From your back all in one
To a place where all began
Like a baby in your mother’s womb

I need two hours to swallow my saliva
‘cause I’ve licked the ground where they buried you
And I will keep a dirty taste of your last days in my mouth

I need a cello to soften my song
‘cause I cry inside cause’ death is sometimes wrong
Oh my God I’ll think of you

From your back all in one
To a place where all began
Like a baby in your mother’s womb",My Ode To You,2010
The Rodeo,"I’ve got nothing planned
No road maps in my hand
But can you give me a ride?

Man you drive me nuts

To forget who I was

‘Cause now, I’ve packed all my bags
And if you still try to make me see reason it’s no use
‘Cause now I’ve made up my mind
To get away from it all

I’m a little child
When everything goes awry
I’m sick and tired of playing

I think I’ve lost my bearings
Being nowhere is harder than it seems
You know I’m passing through

No need to keep me, I’m in a hurry now

And if you still try to make me see reason it’s no use
‘Cause now I’ve made up my mind
To get away from it all",Passing Through,2010

Where have you been?
Take me in your arms

You’re paranoid
And fanatic
But you’re lovable

Son tutte nel vento
Le dolce parole che invento per te,
Oh, per te,
Che vai così, lontana da me.

E guarda nel cielo
C´è sempre un sorriso sereno.
Ci segue dal cielo
L´amore infinito che provo per te,
Oh, per te,
Che sei così, lontana da me.

Sai che quanta strada tu farai,
Non potrai andare mai abbastanza lontano,
Tu sentirai ogni giorno qualcuno
Che ti chiama
E sono io

Ascolta nel vento
La voce che dice ""ritorrna!"".
E guarda nel cielo

Che più non vivo lontano da te.

Had my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

When she took a look at my palm
She said son are you feeling kinda warm?
And she looked into her crystal ball
And said you're in love

I said I could not be so
I'm not passionate with the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
You'll be looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me lies

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she made a fool out of me

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love

Well, I am married to the fortune teller

The Rolling Stones,"I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station
And the preacher said, you know you always have the Lord by your side
And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran
Twenty red lights in his honor
Thank you Jesus, thank you Lord

I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find
Much to my surprise, there she was sittin' in the corner
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear
Was a girl with far away eyes

So if you're down on your luck
And you can't harmonize
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime
Get a girl with far away eyes

Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send
Ten dollars to the church of the Sacred Bleeding Heart Of Jesus
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio
And all my dreams would come true
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got, well I'll tell ya

So if you're down on your luck
I know you all sympathize
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime

TV is just a blank
Looks like another dead end Sunday

What about an early night
Monday never feels so bright
Ooh the sheets feel cold and lonely

Who wants to brave the pouring rain
For a glass of French champagne?
Well grab a cab, grab a cap and baby, come right by

And she was hot, as she kissed my mouth
She was hot, as I wiped her brow
She was hot, she pinned me to the ground
She was quick, she knew her way around
She was hot, as she tore my clothes
She was hot, she had no place to go
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

Detroit was smoky grey
Nothing like the good old days
Well I got a fever that I'm fighting

I don't need your company
Leave me in my misery
I can take the rebound just like lightning

And she was hot, in a 50's dress
She was hot, her lips were flashing red
I was lost, in her burning flesh
I was hot, I was dripping sweat
She was hot, in the Detroit snow
She was hot, she had no place to go
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

And she was hot, and I had the blues
She was hot, honey, where were you?
If you were in my shoes
You would be excused

She was hot, you could never wait
She was hot, never hesitate
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

I think I'm going off the rails
Riding down the pleasure trails
I was taking passion where you find it

Honey when you're young and fresh
And you need the touch of flesh
Go take the treasure where you find it

And she was hot, in the melted snow
She was hot, in the molten glow
She was hot, she got it in the blood
She was hot, like the dam that bursts
She was strong, she was strong and true
She was black, and her eyes were blue
She was lost, and she took a chance
At just a brief romance

Down the avenue into the lost bayou
Into the tall bamboo, back to the human zoo
I wish you all the best, I hope we meet again
In a cold Chicago night

Pay for it, bust your ass 
Lie for it, cheat for it 
Forget about your past

You dream of it passionate 
You get a rise from it 
Feel the hot cum 
Dripping on your thighs from it

Sometimes you crave for it, cry for it 
Women will die for it 
Looking back, cut the crap 
Was it really worth the rap?

In the refrigerator, ate her piece by piece
Put her in the refrigerator, put her in the freezer

Oh no no! Don't saw off me leg, don't saw off me arm""

Come now, gentleman, I know there's some mistake
How forgetful I'm becoming now you fixed your business straight

I remember you in Hemlock Road in nineteen fifty-six
You're a faggy little leather boy with a smaller piece of stick

You're a lashing, smashing hunk of man your sweat shines sweet and strong
Your organs working perfectly but there's a part that's not screwed on

Weren't you at the Coke convention back on nineteen sixty-five?
You're the misbred, gray executive I've seen heavily advertised

You're the great, gray man whose daughter licks policemen's buttons clean
You're the man who squats behind the man who works the soft machine

Come now, gentleman your love is all I crave
You'll still be in the circus when I'm laughing, laughing in my grave

When the old men do the fighting and the young men all look on
And the young girls eat their mothers meat from tubes of plasticon

Be wary of these my gentle friends of all the skins you breed
They have a tasty habit they eat the hands that bleed

So remember who you say you are and keep your noses clean
Boys will be boys and play with toys so be strong with your beast

I remembered the things that I'd seen
I could still hear the things you said
With that bad dream in my head

It was a sad day, bad day
Sad day, bad day

So I called you on the phone
And your friend said, ""She's not home""
So I told her where I'd be at
And that you should call me back

Then I looked at the morning mail
I was not even expecting a bill
Your letter a-started, ""Dear""
And it left me with these tears

It was a sad day, bad day

But we patched them up somehow
Think of the times I tried to go
But you screamed and told me no

There is only one thing in this world
That I can't understand, that's a girl
I keep a-readin' the things you said

On the other side

She's been an outcast all her life

Lying on the floor
I'm just trying to do my jig-saw puzzle

With his Luger in his hand
When he gets home to his children
He's a family man
But when it comes to the nitty-gritty
He can shove in his knife

At being thrown to the lions
And the bass player, he looks nervous
About the girls outside
And the drummer, he's so shattered
Trying to keep on time
And the guitar players look damaged
They've been outcasts all their lives

Lying on the floor

Wave their hankies in the air
All burning up their pensions
And shouting, ""It's not fair!""
There's a regiment of soldiers
Standing looking on
And the queen is bravely shouting,
""What the hell is going on?""

With a blood-curdling ""tally-ho""
She charged into the ranks
And blessed all those grandmas who
With their dying breaths screamed, ""Thanks!""

Sad and broken hearted, salute me father dear,
And kissed me darlin' mother, drank a pint of beer,
Me tears and grief to smother, off to reap the corn,

Leave where I was born, I cut a stoat black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins,
In a pair of brand new of brogues, I rattled over the bogs, frightened all the dogs,
On the rocky road to Dublin, 1,2,3,4,5
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road,

And all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da!
In Dublin next arrived, and thought it such a pity to be so soon deprived,
A view of that fair city, then I took a stroll,

All amongst the quality, me bundle it was stole,
In that neat locality, something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle I could find, upon me stick a wobblin. Enquiring after the rogue,
Said me Connaught brogue, was not much in vogue,

On the rocky road to Dublin, 1,2,3,4,5
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road,
And all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da!
The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed, called meself a fool,

I could no longer stand it, me blood began to boil,
Me temper I was losing, for old Erin's isle,
They began abusing, horah say I, me Shelelagh I let fly,
Some Galway boys were by, they saw I was a hobblin',

With a loud hurray, they joined in the afray,
We quickly cleared the way,

Need a clearer view on the road ahead
Need to fill my tank, check the oil
Fix the air conditioner or I'm gonna boil

And sad eyed people and dirty dreams
And battered suit cases and cryin' kids
And resignation at how life is 

And easy money and wine that flows
And pretty pictures and centerfolds
And double dealers who take it back
If he should mud yer daughter, throw 'I'm back

Was wandering
We walked a steady line
When all our friends
Were wavering
We kept on trying

Now we're always suffering
Already lost
Always suffering
Already lost

Remember when
On summer days
I would sing a lovers son
How you would smile
Shower me with praise
And the sun shined on

Now the rain is falling slow
And the nights grow long
And the train
Cries out so hauntingly
She is gone

Now we're always suffering
Already lost
We're always suffering
Already lost

Please take these flowers
Smell the perfume
Let your soul come alive
Let there be hope
Hope in your heart
That our love may revive

For life is but a chance
On a wind swept hill
And the seeds of love
Are swirling above
Let them be still

But we're always suffering
We're already lost
Always suffering
Already lost",Always Suffering,1997
The Rolling Stones,"She confessed her love
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible

She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor

Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I realize
That she's really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd

I was flippin' magazines
In that place on mercer street
When I thought I spotted her

Getting on a motor bike
Looking really lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?

Salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared
Has she really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around

We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens and Manhattan
And The Bronx and Staten Island
I can’t forget New Jersey and Long Island
And all over the world, we came to rock for everybody like this

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen, anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out, I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around (lost, lost and never found)
I must have called her a thousand times
Sometimes I think she's just in my imagination

Sometimes when I'm blue it's seems like Lucille
Tryin' to help me callin' my name

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another, when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille, started singin' blues

Well, now when I'm payin' my dues
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say payin' my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always you, you know, like depend on Lucille

I guess, I'll let Lucille say

Like, well, for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she's misusin' me
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely
Well, not maybe, I am lonely

I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me, you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I can't even say nothin'
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin'

You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.
I don't think I still could do it
Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothin' but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille, sing Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, little Ray Charles

A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille, take it easy now

You know, I've met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar, Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two, three times
No kidding, really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin' over, it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me, really, it held it up off of me
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way, I, uh, I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night, the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin', you know what I mean

And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin' for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin' to save Lucille

Uh, oh, I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me

Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more?

Sounds really good, I think I'll try one more, alright",Paying the Cost to Be the Boss,1997

The Rolling Stones,"As I was drivin' home along the boulevard late one night
I saw a guy in the corner, bummin' all alone
As I passed him by, I heard him holler out, ""hey""
I slowed down to see what he said, he said um

""By any chance, are you goin' my way?""
I said, ""sure baby, hop on in and give me a cigarette""
Then he reached out in his pocket
And that was the moment I regret

""Well now boy, reach for the sky""
Y'all said, ""but I don't understand, sir""
""Don't you try no monkey business, I got a stopper in my hand""

And then he said, ""you see this rock I got in my hand?
This is a 38 pistol built on a 45 frame
It shoots tombstone bullets and a ball and chain""
He said, ""I ain't tryin' to shake you up, but I just want you to know
If the cops start crowdin' me in
You gonna be the first to go
So you just drive on like there ain't nothin' happenin'""
That's what he told me, he wouldn't even let me look back on nothin'

And he said, ""when you get to that red light
I want y'all to jump back to your left and then switch back to your right""
He said, um, ""I want you to park in the alley
Ah ah, not that, that one over there
And cool it behind that liquor store
And keep a sharp lookout at all times
While I sneak in that back door""
That's what he told me

He said, ""keep your foot on the gas
And always be on guard
'Cause when I come runnin' out the liquor store with all that money""
He wanted me to mash on it real hard

He said, ""now don't you come outta there and try me a double-cross
Because it's murder when the heat's on""

""Well now boy, reach for the sky""
""Yeah,"" but I said, ""I don't understand, sir""
""Don't you try no monkey business, I got a stopper in my hand""

Oh wee, while I was sittin' there just tremblin'
A spotlight hit me dead in the face
The cops pulled up behind me and said
""Move up a bit man, we wanna take your place""

And then the guy come runnin' out of the store with the money in his hand
He said, ""oh there you are""
He made a mistake in the dark and ran and leaped in a police car
As they put the handcuffs on him
I said, ""child, your crime must have outgrew him""
And they said, ""yeah, we gonna put him so far back in jail this time
That they gonna have to pump air into him""

Will my borrowed brain still compute the same
Or will my daughter suffer so much more

Here comes the girl, she's got her head screwed on
But it ain't screwed on right
Her ambition is to be a prostitute

That his virgin daughter has bordello dreams
And that he's the one she wants to try out

There's ma, she's living dangerously
It's a cinch she'll try it anything twice
She thinks she can run right to the whirlpool's edge
And stop herself just in time

The lovers will just be sucked into
To see what the colours of death are all about

Yeah, they're screwed on pretty tight

The Rolling Stones,"She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible

She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor

Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I realize
That she's really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd

And I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer street
When I thought I spotted her

And getting on a motor bike
Looking really lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?

Salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared
Has she really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around

And Queens and Long Island
And all over the world
We came to rock for everybody like this

I slowed down to see what he said, he said um

""By any chance, are you goin' my way?""
I said, ""sure baby, hop on in and give me a cigarette""

It shoots tombstone bullets and a ball and chain""

You gonna be the first to go
So you just drive on like there ain't nothin' happenin'""
That's what he told me, he wouldn't even let me look back on nothin'

And he said, ""when you get to that red light
I want y'all to jump back to your left and then switch back to your right""
He said, um, ""I want you to park in the alley
Ah ah, not that, that one over there
And cool it behind that liquor store
And keep a sharp lookout at all times
While I sneak in that back door""

He said, ""keep your foot on the gas
And always be on guard

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

The Ronettes,"Hello, this is Phil Spector, it is so difficult at this time 
To say words that would express my feelings 
About the album to which you have just listened 
An album that has been in the planning for many, many months

First, let me thank all the people who worked so hard with me 
In the production of this album and in my endeavor and desire 
To bring something new and different to the music of Christmas 
And to the recording industry which is so much a part of my life

Of course, the biggest thanks goes to you 
For giving me the opportunity to relate my feelings 
Of Christmas through the music that I love

At this moment, I am very proud of all the artists 
And on behalf of all of them, The Crystals, The Ronettes 
Darlene Love, Bobby Soxx and the Blue Jeans, and myself

May we wish you the very merriest of Christmases 
And the happiest of New Years, and thank you so very much 
For letting us spend this Christmas with you

Sleep in heavenly peace)",Silent Night,1963
The Ronettes,"Frosty the snowman 
Was a jolly happy soul,
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal.

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,
He was made of snow 
But the children know 
How he came to life one day.

There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found.
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around.

O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be,
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me.

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop.
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""

Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye saying,
""Don't you cry, I'll be back again some day.""

Tell my P.O. ask me where I work at
Think I woulda learned that sleeping in the bird trap
Living on the run like somebody tryna burn fat
I don’t give a fuck, now maybe that’s abstinence
Or the arrogance of someone who ain’t got shit
That think money over bitches is a stock tip

I live in a trap where fiends load crack
Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin’ he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer

I’m down to 95 dollars, that’s the extent of my riches
Out of 99 problems, 98 of ‘em is bitches
Out here hollerin' what’s ironic is
I’ve honestly been tryna do what’s right
But from your legs in the air tonight, like Phil Collins
I’m a sex-addicted introvert
Sucker for a pencil skirt
Looking for a shorty coming from work, that I can pervert
On my existential grind doing consequential dirt
Searchin’ for physical pleasure if I don’t go mental first
Molly poppin’, trolley hoppin’
Know somebody prolly watchin’
That ain’t stoppin’ me from coppin’ a feel
Karate choppin’ in this after-hours spot
Watching mommy body rockin’
First I feed her vodka shots then she eat my Jonnie Cochran
Livin’ fast, drinkin’ capt'
One of them hoes even had
The audacity ask me how long this thing would last
I said, “You wanna pay for class? Get on that stage and shake your ass”
She keep a dick in a box and in an emergency break the glass
I make her laugh
She makes it clap
And then she gives me lap dances and I’m thankful that
She keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at

I live in a trap where fiends load crack
Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin’ he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins but nobody cares

This is the Brother Question, broadcasting live 
Via satellite, from the Never Never Tunnels 
Now dig the rituals for today, is good music 
So sit back, relax and dig the groove 

Yo bust it, I digs hip-hop, and rocks for hip-hop

Blizz a five, off a Bob Marley spliff 
On the cloud I be relaxin' from last night and shit 
In studio today but hey Brother Question 
Was on the Westside asleep without a clue when 
I hollered down to Crumbs to pick up the phone 
And tell him to get ready (Question, what ya doin'?) 
(Ain't no thing) Yeah
Buttered chicken wings, so I met him in the West 
Where we had to 'lax and wait for Rubber Band and Bes' 
Bassey broke down on the other side of town

Nah, just the four of us 
Nuff nappy sweets on the transit, two fine 
(Three fine) fo' five mo' fine, uhh! 

A girl says, ""Hey ain't y'all The Square Roots?"" 
And I'm like, ""Heh, word,"" 
And then the shorty passed the sign 
Now we got to make out exit (where?) 
To the pavement (to what?) Crushin' trail mix 
(Oh word man, yo look out) Say what? (look out!) 
Question dropped a whole bag of drumsticks 
(Ain't no thing) but a chicken wing, so 
He bends down to pick up the sticks 
And his pants fall down (dang!) 
In my face, Question didn't frown, turned around 
And thought he felt a draft, so I laughed 
(Hahaha)

At the Rat Cave, mic I'm hand, I'm flowin' 
Tellin Question, to keep it, goin' 
What I'm doin', I'm not really knowin' 
But umm, to me see it sounds oh-and-kay'n (it sounds OK) 
Layin', to the sounds playin' 
Um, hi to hoe and, yeah, hey to hay'n (uh-huh) 
Trippin', I'm tryin', not to laugh, bust it 
It's the last paragraph, and I'm done half 
But Question's jokin', and I'm like hopin' 
That nobody comes in and opens, the door

The Roots,"Peaceful minds, in a land of war 
Seek peace of mind, through mental peacefulness 
Peacefulness, peacefulness, peacefulness 
Is in the mind of the beholder 

Behold, my mental piece 
Could shatter your peace, to pieces 
Pieces and portions of rhythmic distortion relax me 
The echos reverb and feedback of reality disturb my peace 

Forcing me to retreat, to the below beneath 
Down a step and a step and a step and a step 
And a step beyond 
To a level of my own 

Private, mystic, ritualistic, culturalistic sanity 
Yet some say that I am insane 
Is that not ironic? My soul not sonic 
As I flow through the tonic, of life I find 

That the strife behind, that pushes and pulls 
And pulls and pushes me 
Into all of the bullshit that I experience from day to day 
Is the reason for my search, or journey, or struggle 

To find, the broken pieces of the sign 
That combine, to form the crooked line 
That we call, peace y'all",Peace,1993

Yo, niggaz can not see me, can not be me or
Capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when I tour
I am but a messenger born to blow up
My niggaz knew it all the time, lyrically I was a dime
At the age of nine, shorty Black, could rhyme
On the mic I never wasted time, I'm, the exquisite wizard
When I visit shorties I hit it I'm cool as a blizzard
Nigga what? You wanna bust your fronts, with the butter, my
Black paper chase ya and then erase ya rhyme
Sucker, MC's how I hate it when you waste your time
My state of mind, shine like it's diamond studded
I'm rhyme budded on stage, word is bond, when I'm on, I rage
Got the twelve gauge had the reci-play, inter-terrestrial-ly
My everyday M.O. is gettin' dough cause times is rougher
Than a mother for brothers to scuffle shuffle your cards kid
Cause the odds is, niggaz'll hustle and live, foul
This wild environment hostile produce, the music in me
So my style's the blend of what is and was
You could get a buzz from it, but enter too deep
And reach a summit you fall and then plummit beyond real
Where you're killed if your raps ain't ill
Another crab motherfucker 'nother cap to peel
Through these amps, I motivate camps to dance
Niggaz too advanced, I warn, I'm just tellin' you what goes on

[Chorus]

Inside my head, you wish to see
The signs appear, the shit's not clear
What if I flipped, would you know how to maintain your edge
I'm takin' heads because, there's no fuckin' ledge
I pledge allegiance to my cosmic guide
I couldn't fit in three dimensions if I tried
Civilizations I can delete, so crews don't bother me
Battle with Jehovah gaining universal sovereignt
Niggaz run around like ?, I got planets and thrones
Throughout the galaxy my name's well known (my name's well known)
I'm all alone in my zone, you wouldn't understand
Stare in my face, fuck around and catch a scar man

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members
They shall ?, wavin' white flags, man we surrender
Those half-assed negroes know they're no contenders
In syringes, I can shoot up lyrical vengeance
And my grammar, might do a mandatory life in slammers
You should regret it, thinkin' about steppin' to me
Niggaz forget it, you'll get gassed with lyrics leaded
Most energetic, I never snag I'm tightly threaded
I flip scripts like pattern twistness in calisthenics
Black Thought, Elo and me a trio
Tellin' the the strong, word is bond
I'm just tellin' you what goes on

It's the 'I remain calm' but for jurge to erk
Come out my humble go berzerk and make you swallow your smirk
I splurge most and bash, capacitate mass
I fascinate as I assassinate and show task
Characters and egos, get crushed in trust
And my words stampede like herds in a dusk
Cream of all crops, topics I drop with Trotter
When heated up, I gets hotter cause I'm proper
You never knew the levitude the clever few
Different tax for revenue man if you ever knew
The tac-tic, strategies, of word, ca-pa-bil-ities
Display, de-cease
The rhythm, and man how it swerved and curved
Made a niggas dream but his hope deferred then stirred
Dig the mentals, Papermate, Bic's and Number 2 pencils
My credentials blow on instrumentals
I write an anthem throw a tantrum and remain handsome
Mysterious vibes, like I was the phantom
Erupt abruptly, then conduct amaze
You're fucked when the lyrics get bucked because I graze
Never animosity, on my property
Niggas acropoly, or they feel extreme monstrosity
Wreakin leak out the verbals ? don't forget it
The chief of edit then Malik'll shred it yeah I said it

I remain calm, lyrically I got the bomb, when you put me on, I remain calm

That nigga Thought flows like a river, I deliver styles like Domino's
Eyes closed I inhale, equality follow me now son
Listen, my divisions advance, I surpass one half of the rap mass
The other half want my autograph
Because I got soul, plus a ghetto stroll, similar to Shaft
It's the mic rapers, splittin Phillies in the cellar
My acapella verse, can stomp, I delete comp
My rated X, larynx, wrecks your context
I'm complex, confusin, lyrically amusin, I drink brews
Then when I'm groovin I'm no longer human
I'd like to take this time, to give a shout to all the money makers
In the house galore, they help me turn it out
I whip the cap to the max, I'm laid back, like your gramps
I make, niggas embarrased like they spendin food stamps
I take, my time when I rhyme lovely, me nah like
Ugly like, God we get odd to the rhythms
Rappers thinkin of steppin up, what the fuck you're doin?
I amplify the hymn, to bring your empire to ruin
Who's your girl screwin fellas? Jealous because I'm fly
Keep my sneakers dry, when you cry-baby
See, I can have you headin for the border, like a ReFugee from Haiti
Aiyyo, this brother drivin my cab, tried to flip, saying
""Pay me in advance"" -- I asked him if he ever danced
In the dark, with the rap devil, Black Thought
See niggas who get caught off guard remain scarred
Into air, with headphones remainin on the domes, they hair
I resound and astound and scare, I reign terror
Into another nigga rap era, my rhymes sedate
I lubricate, like aloe vera
I'm extreme, restin in the land of the plot and the scheme

My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grased in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbred for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin' through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin' over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jasz shit I hit your jaw

I be the nigga blowin' up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son

Get on the mic and perpetratin is void

Ya leave niggas missin' in action like their dads in the projects

I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
[he heh ha ha ha] I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice

Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin' handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin' on my arm

Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin' a train honey dip and I'ma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin'
If you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?

Used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass
Back in eighty-six
Easy with the chicks, I was a chocolate boy
Raised in the cellar with the rhythm like Ella
Walking mega-trife streets to the subway where I lay
Til the train stop, then a nigga hop
Used to do the pop dance to the Planet Rock
At the block party everybody jocked [who me?]
It's the MC sucka niggas envy
I got my contract in 1993 and
I shall proceed

I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic

I wake up early in the morning, I mean early afternoon
Break a lyrical hymn of the stem like boom
I'm flyer when I'm higher put my shit up on a tomb
That nigga represented on the 28th of June
I'm representing Philly on the 28th of June
I can make you feel that I'm a surreal cartoon
With my pistol in the face of hip hop, stick it for papes
Because I'm on a paper chase, yes I'm on a paper chase
My Timberlands are fully laced I be the Mr. Boogeyman
With records from 125th to Japan
I let them play like Donny Hathaway and shake a hand, shake a hand
Your lady tried to kick it, but I couldn't play my man
My niggas is my niggas ya see she didn't understand
I shake your hand and shit'll hit the fan, just think
Just think, what? What if you could, just blink, what?
Just blink yourself away?
As I proceed

I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic

Malik B get on the mic yo there's too much on my mind [say what?]
Malik get on the mic, there's too much on my mind

Johnny on the spot, got the rhythm and the rhyme
Fucking with The Roots, you know them niggas is the dime
I can make a hundred yard line start to dash
I can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
I can make Conan and the Titans clash
And I could Metallica and Guns 'N Roses crash
Used to smash crash parties like I was disturbed
Used to make plots against the herringbone herb
But now, all I do disperse the verb
And like a nerd I can make you say, ""He's superb""
Worded perfect, never ever shall you misinterpret
I move styles like bowels so now you know I'm worth it
Direct from Philly, the lands where niggas scheme
So you know I got the sheen in my gleam

I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic",Proceed,1995
The Roots,"MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

The rhythm just sways and like a sorceress I slays
Foes and ri-vals, who wanna come
This way, they better pay attention
Or a penchant not to mention suspension
From the microphone plus the tension
Trey-eight-o's will vacate those
If there's drama with my henchmen
So lamp to my man Mussolini
Go get your whole staff, call the calf
Cause half-and-half's couldn't cream me
The lyrics make your head knock
Malik B and Black Thought, the dreadlock
Mannn, transss-gressin
You'll catch lead I, crushing
Poundin on the drums like King Kong
We can ring your bellll, ding-dong
I styles with my vocabulary
The Roots the one to call your ultra adversary
Now you're all desert cause I'mma serv ya like a tray
To meet your doom Malik's the boom so you get swept away

MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

Yo hello everybody do I need introduct
I be the mic mercenary very un..clear
To your ear the exquisite pattern that you hear
It's known to be Black Butta Baby
Crazy cardiac my attack on any fat rhythm
That I capture kid I snatch the mic from tykes
While I proceed and continue to tend to
Business, cause this is, how I do
I'm insane, and go against the grain like freight
Never on no nigga dick, cause I'm just too hip
Plus I rest where niggas pack and never act
Other than ill, shit is real in Phy-double
So if you want trouble let's stomp
My mission is to flip on comp
You might aspire to be flyer than I, you must pay
Your dues while I bruise niggas new for the day
Shall be swept away

MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

There's somethin goin on
Because there's somethin goin on
Yeah, somethin's goin on
Yeah, somethin goin on
Y'all know there's somethin goin
Because there's somethin goin on
She knows there's somethin goin on
Yeah, somethin goin on
Y'all know there's somethin goin on

""Excuse me Miss, excuse me miss"" 
""No, I'm not havin it!"" I just got dissed 
I didn't get mad, was calm and collect 
I didn't call her bitch, I didn't break her neck 
Start to wonder why the brothers disrespect the cutie

The brown, rhymer organically grown, I've shown, while
Sip-pida-didip-styles and proceed, to flow
You know I'm flyer than G.I. so yo Joe
Fuck, I run amuck, cause I'm the father of the fattest skatter
Black is intellectual, cat that is perpetually
Ritually catchin wreck, don't step, I cut ya
I mix the Sector 6 and now I knowledge butter words
To prop up Afrika Bambaataa, a lotta, brother is out there
Waitin on that new shit, well this is how we do kid
The levels is correct one-two, call in a blunt too
The front two, run through, good for you
Brand new styles like Kung-Fu
And rip this from the front to the back
To all my peoples where you at I know you dig it when I kick

Datskat! I know you dig it when I kick it baby!

Wadibi-dee-doo-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
Skiggy-dang, skiggy-dang, you knows we gonna rock
And don't stop, just droppin off my bags you fags
When you define, the word behind, deserves you lags
We blast off like launchers, launchin off the rockets
If you bugs, if you act like plugs, you're gettin pulled
Out of sockets, the extra-curricular particularly this
Miraculous in lyrics they be callin me Jesus
Please just call me Malik I'm not a prophet
Pass me a topic and I'll drop it
Because it gets, hairier, never marry or flurries a throne
To hell with a boy upon the microphone
Will be convenient, I'm never bein lenient
On them folk who gonna slow-up cause they a dope

The Roots,"Yo, I'm every MC, it's all in me
That's the way it is, when ya gotta be
Indeed as I distort I proceed, I need
Gettin' hotter than sacks of boom, in my room at the Ramada
Four tanks in your memory banks to fill up
I provide the static, with scratch to match, while you catch the vibe
Most can play high post, but yo that don't mean shit
Because my click'll make a motherfucker sick
I flips, redder than pork, comin' to New York to mix
[It's Bob Powers] With the snares and kicks to fix
Rhythmically, you got ta be, static-why
Magically I appear, spark a L and drink a beer
With air smooth, takin' niggaz loot with dice
Then shoot The Roots, poetic, courageously kinetic
Vagabond, versatile and various, plus rap styles
Of mine are blunt, pain is in the mind, so I'm fine and five
Foot seven, inches in height
My mission to strike mics and lighten your tights
Ridin' in, like lightning
Fluorescent, incandescent, effervescently
I represent, Foreign Objects and Ill Elements
Very relevant, plus intelligently managin matter
That's makin' tracks fatter, revolve around
Saturn like rings and brins swings when I sings with bass
Then distort up in your face like mace
Bustin your dreams, I gasp with loaded magazines
I'm on the rap scene, re-color fellas like a vaccine
As I, rocks from under blunderin' I'm not, lyrically
Ya getm, shot, get caught so distort with thought, for real
It's the illest out the Phi, short for Philidelph-iada-fly
Money makin' move fakin' I isn't
Niggaz can nah front, I'm poetically exquisite
Wicked, with the visit while you're wonderin' what is it
Dig it, yo my mellow um whattup for the night
Like that y'all, and yo I'm flowin', my part of the song
It's goin, it's goin, it's gone

Now, go get your dictionary and your Pictionary
Cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries
Words and hers like some cattle in the steeple
People, there's no equal, or no sequel
SO policies, of equalities, get abolished
Demolished, distortion of the static's gettin' polished
Urges of splurge and words will just be merged
Together, damn it's quite clever, however
You never, can sound alike, lyrics don't be poundin' like
These, troops, who be's, Roots
Insult ya, mellow of culture, rhythmical vulture
Approach ya, with Magnetic shit that's Ultra
I make MC's dangle like a bangle
Strangle from every angle, my lingo hingles and it jangles
Under Kangols, nahh them niggaz don't want to tangle
Cause Roots get loose, negroes get juiced like the mango
To be particular, extra-curricular, for pleasure
Measure, in any weather, value more than the treasure
Baby, you say you maybe, then come in to flex
Now you wonder what's next",Distortion to Static,1995

I inflict properly, ain't nobody risin on top of me
I be droppin more plot in my mic monopoly
Got to be, got to be reality, Stevie Wonder see
Black Thought be me, I groove ba-by
Or I clue they say baby
Would you get with this? Not even maybe
It's the mister gravy and shit
To explain what's goin on inside my brain
You're scared, jealous
No analyst can maintain or handle this...
Mind train, yo
I'm on some old snap a rapper neck shit
You know what I'm sayin?
So niggaz best get out of my path
Kid, I'm on point like a gat
The basket case, I waste MCs with rapture taste
Facing these leads to cats diminished
They be pullin the mic out that ass when I get finished

The Roots,"Lyrically versatile
My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grazed in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a--motherfuckin-rap--muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbread for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jazz shit I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetrate in this void

Ya leave niggas missing in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
[He heh ha ha ha] I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin that I'm insane
When I'm taggin my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice
Nigga de Raw, never take a bad fall
Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin a train honeydip and I'mma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin
If you wanna know better ask brother question
Cause he know the time like I know the time
When I grab the microphone

Caramel-complected, body like heaven
Met her through the sister of my man Big Vince
Like some shit from out the flicks we been in love ever since
She called me her chocolate brotha, I call her my sugar sista
Knew Shorty could work it since before I ever kissed her
I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit
But because sex she wasn't with, she started flippin an' shit
Like, ""Listen man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and
That game is weak and keep tryin to hit I could quit speakin'
Tariq in fact, you bein BlackThought don't get ya closer
I dig ya but won't bone ya because I'm so-called supposed ta
Most o' them would, but that couldn't be me, that's not my flava

Steady pursuin' screwin', gettin' nothin' but the silent treatment

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Crazy frustration, about my lovin' situation
When patience was a virtue, but I wasn't used to waitin'
I want some Marvin Gaye healin', feelin' is real inside
I slip and slide, my ride'll keep you occupied, I'd
Love to get wit it like that, but my baby's kitty cat's capped
And locked, Love Boat is docked at the shore
And what for? Later for groupies on tour
Why won't my sugar call me no more?
I mean, my Queen gets upset, rejectin' and sexually neglect
Then sayin' I'm more sewer than Das EFX, and closed-minded
It's like I'm blinded by the skinnin'
I'm into women; because of that, this one's into communication
Temptation played the vandal, freakin' my brain, my mind
Rippin' the handle on physically scandalous acts
Yo! She knew what I wanted, but she fronted
Bust it

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Well umm
Movin' right along with the song, plus the strong
Feelings on my mind, desire to intertwine
Combine and blend, baby bust a message that I send
Ain't no need to pretend, cause shit is real til the end
I provide a place to hide from crime, hard times
And livin' trife, while I open ya mind, you're in my life
Like love, it ain't no way no one can rise above what's real
That's why I'm feelin' like you're makin' me bugged
I puff an El on fifty deuce while I walk in the rain
Heart feelin' killa pain while I hop the train
Dial her number to the rest, and ain't no messages left
Regardless, my chest thumps from stress, yo it's a mess
I don't know what I got to do to make you understand
I'm for real and that's no question, no frontin' or no guessin'
Undressin', carressin', in the span, that I contain in my hand
Could touch and make you say that I'm such a man
And call my name, so let me set your body aflame
I'll never treat you like a dame or run game
Now who's to blame?
I know you're not a hoe for niggaz with a lot of dough
But I just wanted you to know

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Girl you know that you need

The Roots,"I the voyeur, peer, as she begins her, ritual 
Paying sexual ties for few and untrue 
Words of admiration, translation: 
Sucker ass, lines, of trash 
Spewing from First One's unskilled lips 
That beg for pussy tricks that make his dick go quickly limp 
She pimps her innocence as Second One demands entrance 
Through the back door 
""Bend over bitch, you know this is what you were born for; 
To dig those soft and lotioned knees into the floor 
And take it in, that sweetly spread ass like a real pro whore"" 
Her subsequent screams seemed to praise 
Sent messages of pleasure and pain to his fuck tainted brain 
But her screams masked laughs at his dumb ass 
As he quicker comes, then Third and Fourth One just as dumb 
Invite themselves to join in 
Third One wants to hit the skins old-fashioned style 
While Fourth One says, 
""Don't she got some DSL's, make a nigga joint just swell, 
To think? I want to sink my inches, into that bitch's, 
Berry-framed mouth"" 
So one goes North, the other South 
To sanctified places where in-house spirits 
Will later wash away all traces, of their ill-spoken words 
And complacent faces 
And then, like their Minutemen, predecessors 
Lude, aggrandized sexual endeavors, end up rough 
Cause neither one of them could keep that weak shit up 
Corrupt, Fifth One steps to her 
Hip-Hop clothed just to, think he gonna impress her 
""Hey Slim, I heard you was a spinna, sit on up 
Top this thing, black dick, and work it like a winner"" 
With the quickness he got his pseudo-thickness all up in her 
But suddenly he, stops mid thrust 

Seems she nameless to 'cause, got his stuff in a death cunt clutch 
He fast falls from the force of her tight pussy punch 
Just like the rest of that sorry ass bunch 
Now here comes Six ready to add his inactive shit to the mix 
Talkin' smack at that 
Saying, ""Girl, I'ma wax that ass, and stick that slit so hard, 
You gonna be calling me God"" 
So he proceeds to poke and prod 
With clumsy finger and wack sex slinger 
""Condoms make me last longer,"" wrong, cause her 
Motions of snatch, however detached from the situation 
Cause his pre pre PRE-ejaculation 
It seems she just wastin' 
Good pussy and time on dudes like Number Seven 
Who ain't learned their lesson 
He wants to enter the flesh divine 
By dropping a kind of semi-sweet line 
""Your honey hole so fine and mile deep; I'm gonna leap 
Into you like an ocean do you right and make your head spin"" 
So he jumped in and then, he drowned 
Got lost and found in her Tart Canal 
Slave to the waves, made him cum for days 
Eighth and Last One turn arise 
Plys her with familiar lies 
Even more familiar still, cause 
Him she used to love 
But he never could quite see above, her mound 
A pound of flesh is all she was, no name no face or even voice 
So poised, she rises, Phoenix from the flame 
Finally bored with their feeble fuck games 
She smooth reaches behind her and takes straight aim 
At eight shriveled up cocks with a fully loaded Glock 
Parts lips, not expressly made for milding dicks 
And then, she speaks: 

Your shrieks of horror bring me bliss, I must admit 
The thought that I could shred your tips with eight quick flips 
Excites me, see y'all fuck with the pussy 
But I fuck with your minds 
Lack of soul and respect is the crime 
This, was a set up, now tell me what, what's my name?",The Unlocking,1995
The Roots,"Do you wanna know what goes on?

Yo, niggas can not see me, can not be me or
Capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when I tour
I am but a messanger born to blow up
My niggas knew it all the time, lyrically I was a dime
At the age of nine, shorty Black, could rhyme
On the mic I never wasted time, I'm, the exquisite wizard
When I visit shorties I hit it I'm cool as a blizzard
Nigga what? You want, I'll bust your fronts, with the butt of my
Black paper chase ya and then erase ya rhyme
Sucker, MC's how I hate it when you waste your time
My state of mind, shine like it's diamond studded
I rhyme budded on stage, word is bond, when I'm on, I rage
Got the 12 gauge at the rest so play, and into rest you lay
My everyday M.O. is gettin dough cause times is rougher
Than a mother for brothers to scuffle shuffle your cards kid
Cause the odds is, niggas'll hustle and live, foul
This wild environment hostile produce, the music in me
So my style's the blend of what is and was
You could get a buzz from it, but enter too deep
And reach a summit you fall and then plummit beyond real
Where you're killed if your raps ain't ill
Another crab motherfucker 'nother cap to peel
Through these amps, I motivate camps to dance
Niggas too advanced, I warn, I'm just tellin you what goes on

Do you wanna know what goes on?

Inside my head, you wish to see
The signs appear, the shit's not clear
What if I flipped, would you know how to maintain your edge
I'm takin heads because, there's no fuckin ledge
I pledge allegiance to my cosmic guide
I couldn't fit in three dimensions if I tried
Civilizations I can delete, so crews don't bother me
Battle with Jehovah gaining universal soveirgnty
Niggas run around like clones, I got planets and thrones
Throughout the galaxy my name's well known (my name's well known)
I'm all alone in my zone, you wouldn't understand
Stare in my face, fuck around and catch a sun tan

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members
They shall hinder, wavin white flags, man we surrender
Those half-assed negroes know they're no contenders
In syringes, I can shoot up lyrical vengeance
And my grammar, might do a mandatory life in slammers
You should regret it, thinkin about steppin to me
Niggas forget it - you'll get gassed with lyrics leaded
Most energetic, I never snag I'm tightly threaded
I flip scripts like pattern twistness in calisthetics
Black Thought, Elo and me a trio
Talent is strong, word is bond
I'm just tellin you what goes on

Do you wanna know what goes on?",What Goes on Pt. 7,1995

Street sands, are quick

With the lure of pure bliss if you kiss the dicks

Those witches and warlocks in blue 
Government gumshoe, keepers of the first zoo 
Who? Me?  
I'm the modern day vixen vampire slayer 
Unauthorized player, in the capitalist contest 
To see who ""Gets Money"" 
No milk and honey, in this land 
Cause justice has been banned 
So it's play dirty or die by the hand 
That's holding all the guns 
Plunged, deep into religion was my first decision 
To save me and my daughter's lives, but 
I can't thrive off spirit and scripture 
The picture grew clearer; I made the move to rear her 
In a life wanting for nothing 
So I got into this drug thing 
Not doing, but dealing 
Sealing fates and, healing struggle gaped, wounds 
Of the doomed became my mission 
Izm was just too small time 
I had to find the best design to 
Fuck with the massive motherfuckers minds, and pockets 
So I sold ? kits and, alleyway thigh splits for two bits 
And, five year old preschool pussy 
And, once strong now bony backs and stretched out 
Weary racks of snatch, in other words
I sold crack 
Morality was buried deep, beneath the new Jeep, 
Silk sheets and money heaps 
Still the good mother, I sent my daughter off to 
Boarding school to keep shit under cover 
All the while envisioning myself, a champion of ghetto causes 
Plus his, game I was playing, and winning 
While sinning, against myself and soul to get the gold 
I was the Female Don, the Crack Queen 
To me I seemed unstoppable, my coffers full 
I went buckwild, wanting more 
Like the pipe worn whores I began to deplore 
No time for playing with my coochie 
Counting my man's mad lucci 
While he was up inside some hoochie's loose piece 
I signed the checks and, I counted out the cash 
Wasn't saving ass for no niggaz sent upriver 
I thought my shit was tight
Til my empire started to quiver 
Taking every chance, under surveillance, being listened to 
And watched, like Assata Shakur 
My place on the top was no more sure 
Loose lips flipped the script 
The fantasy trip, swiftly ended 
It took no time to blend in, with the population prison 
My jaded vision, busted like a cherry 
Every, dream I had, now tainted bad 
I fucked and, I killed, to prosper 
Upheld each tenant, of the ghastly gospel 
Shift to a different Wonderland to pay the price for my vice 
A land of fields to toil in like slaves 
No lilies in this field just plenty of souls to save 
Plenty of fat uniformed rats with 
Below average size cocks that slither 
Through cell locks, in the night 
Lactating tits being licked, left and right 
Plenty of coochie, burning with desire 
Like black churches in the South 
Black prayers and pussy on fire 
Penned up behind barbed wire 
Me and my fellow female mammals, animals 
Bitches in cages, bodies racked with hormone rages 
Minds haunted by our children's faces 
They mace us, with promises of rehabilitation slash corruption 
Place smoking guns in empty hands of, native sisters and sons 
I joined in this nation's favorite pastime 
On a quest to gets mine 
Now I'm passing time standing on line 
In the commissary to buy Maxi-Pads 
Instead of shopping at Barney's for Chanel bags 
Nana who raised me, went to bed a-dazed 
Via my mistakes, and my daughter hates 
Me for what I did 
And I'm fucked, and I'm stuck 
Doing the Devil's bid 
Being locked in a moral corrupt crib 
Psst, missing my kid, psst, hey girl, 
You want to get finger fucked tonight? 
I swear I'll stick it in and up tight just right

Freestyle all the way son
Dice

First of all let's talk about these ill capers
And fly ass frontin' bitches that now caught vapors
Niggaz run up on you with guns, snatchin' papers
Outlined body chalk, is how they would scrape ya
From off the pavement, I hate gettin' locked up
Cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships
But then the bible never saved shit
I guess that's why every juvenile is in the same predicament
You want to slang crack, or hold tecs, and do the concept
You can't make loot, when your moms is smokin' up the product
I try to tell ya, don't let these streets fuckin' fail ya
The way niggaz be gettin' clapped shit'll fuckin' scare ya
But in the dark, we ran wild, so we killin' 'em
Niggaz scared, can't stand still, like fuckin' helium
Fake niggaz, they don't go platinum they go aluminum
Got em cloned the fuck up son, that's why we losin em
I'm lookin' at this niggaz longevity
To make a big play, but then it might be a mistake
Cause if I get sent to D.C., I'm sendin' Dice to DE
With three p's, so when I get out, he can see me
For real, 'cause the streets is filled with snakes and rats
The snake will be that bitch and that rat will be that cool cat
With swollen pockets we gonna take you back home
Master Allah Rule Savior, never clone

Yo, I use the mic to slap you in the face and erase your taste
Disgrace your date put your title to waste
Dominant lyrical grace, from a place called wild
Illadelph Isle Pensy, that's the residency
Consist in currency, my pockets never empty
Some cats, believe they MC but we know they all fraud
Do a show in Philly niggaz wouldn't applaud
Nobody know your record nor who you openin' for
Can tell your squad's artificial while approachin' the door
So you should prepare, for lyrical terror that's pure
Step up to the reservoir, of the soul proprietor style
Messiah or, the higher law down with Dice Raw
The matador, shorty connoisseur
Stompin' whatever you build to the floor
Similar to that of a dinosaur
I told you I'm the rap predator
You insist to imitate, what for?
Superstar niggaz is ten percent real, ninety percent invented
For a fuckin' record deal
Comin' with somethin' veterans can't feel
I hit you like a steel anvil
Because you grafted off the next man's skill
But still I remain mellow, seein' the theatrics of Othello
Run over tactics of the
See-L-O/N-E-S fess
The phoniest cats is felonious (word)

Dice Raw the juvenile lyricist corner store terrorist
Block trooper, connoisseur of fine cannabis
Focus never weak, blow up the spot like plastique
Leave a nigga shook, to the point, he won't speak
Never half-assed, always live and direct
On bitches try to punk smell the panty and raw sex
Mad lights I had to black out, when fake niggaz act out
Or step out of place, they get slapped in they face
All y'all niggaz is fake, tryin' to emulate my style
What grown man? In this game, to me you're a child
I trained wack MC's, in camps like ex-marines
Why the fuck you think you went home and had bad dreams
Of horrifying things, that your ass never seen before?
You traveled to the realm of Dice Raw
Where clones get they dome blown with chrome microphones
It's not your fault black, just the fact you wasn't shown
You'll come through this like a smurf
I got you rollin' stop off the earth
Represent while I been like this since birth
And I won't be the last but I definitely was the first
Dice Raw big car Logan's Isle sol-dier

Don't come across that line or pay a cost
Knuckle games and hammer cocked ain't nothing sweet or soft
Win lose or draw to the jaw take one
Deranger lyrical launcher, or station
No conversation is needed, my task completed
Read a nigga up and down in the cut where I'm seated
Snatch you from your cloud of cannabis you ignoramuses
You laid on your lap, when I attack your glamorous
Lifestyle, I banged your head up with the white fowl
My character a product of this two-one-fifth trife style
I breeze through areas niggaz would fear to walk in
Balance the talkin', that galactic style as of a falcon
Your Star Trek ass will wrinkle
Spill these words and form into a sprinkle
Cap you're brought up and the name of twinkle
My insight will crack the windpipe of y'all niggaz
Whether small, middle-sized, or tall niggaz
Just tie your name next when I start to X
Givin out flex pains of death so fuck a raincheck
The insane vet, whether you ganked the brain wet
You proceed to lame check, the opposite of same sex

Just push the panic button on your remote control
Then enter the zone where our patrolers will get round cold soul
Diddly Bo leave for feelin' a saga foretold
Who got caught pon the block for gold got the old
Heads froze, they peepin' outta closed windows
They not secure as they supposed I watched it all unfold
Well this another episode with titanic panoramic view is dismantle
Depressin' um, load with this gun hold
Wild like a sun sold for cash
Guns traded for sensi and hash crack for ass
Entire crews pass not making the news flash
Brews pass a memory and spark not to blast
Whatever have transform to the war path
Pure wrath from north down to 24th and Task
Games store the half the niggas you were prayin the streets
Tainted with camouflage, guerrilla sabotage
My cousin's da ratatard was livin tight large
Got caught then blast crashed off on Broad and Lambar
So many so called hearts scared they buried in the yard
Lick shots at Babylon de one comfy bombard
Kids run far from traditional credit cards scams
Veterans is nipped in the butt with large plans
Stick up kids is jumpin' outta played the Dodge Rams to jam
You and your man it's mad drama and

Better believe it, cause it is coming
You won't believe the site you see before eyes

This is for all of my niggas that are RIP
You ain't missin' of life ain't what this should be
I pass a car soon you know who's the enemy
Lots of shit has changed and it's kinda fucked up to see
You remember Top see nigga think slice of dream
Yo I'm fast for the buck do anything for the cream
Never seen a case like this although it's quite contagious
He even got his little bother actin' all outrageous
From dusk to dawn and from dawn back to dusk
They do anything and everything tryin to come up
It's kinda sickenin' how the cash is so fucking addicted
And when I say some bout they say that that's conflicted
Ain't nothin' but a contradiction in this world we live in
Cause the loot is for the takin' and not for the givin'
Then ya got this world well I say I'ma die hustlin'
Fuck everybody except my brother who I'm trusted in
I guess the couple just did not know the truth
Cause the following week I seen threw him of the roof
And sometimes I wonder what the fuck I think about that
How nowadays kids get whap for somethin' less than a pat
But I guess that's how it goes when there ain't no more rap
Thought he was his brothers keep but fuck all that
Niggas causin' mayhem from the p.m.'s to a.m.'s
Americas worst nightmare guns against hands

Better believe it, cause it is coming
You won't believe the site you see before eyes

It was the year of '84 I was tryin ta get in the mix
The year the niggas roll with sheepskins gazelles and kicks
Even got the patten leather Adidas snatched of your feet
Man that talk is cheap the crippled can't walk for weeks
The first sto was word to Penn and Teller's
Strolled in the dollar house parties and search for Cinderella
Was just a little man real bold
Tryin to act grown and old so da respect can be shown
A Hip Hop a little copped in and break dancing
When niggas wore wind breakers plot to take lamb skins
Remember Zigglers? Uptown the bottom to Natrona and
St. Charles in South Phil the ooh mob gang
H-are-M Ogontz Ave. Brickyard to hollow
Niggas was snatching gazzeles and flipping pockets for the dallo
You run ya little wolf chain in West Oak Lane
And niggas from Logan came to extort we know the game
You proclaim this gangster bullshit talk
And never even seen your man shot a bodies in charge
Aggravated assault another weekend in the precinct
Take everybody for their ring man that's how we think
Back then you catch a sucker punch off guard
Niggas will pull you card trying to walk around all hard

The Roots,"(The hypnotic, the hypnotic)

Yo, I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed in to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - Tariq Agenda how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Calm, sedated- I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

Driftin (the hypnotic, the hypnotic)

I would begin to dial
Her number but knowin it's been awhile it's hard to link
I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
Fightin the feelin I'm concealin apparently I first appealin
Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mic's and puffin reefa
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said ""Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana""?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
But if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental I never forgot it

This rebel stick your system like a cactus a boys sadness
Who knows what is concealed under the mattress
Ruegurs, losses and grindals when my minds in blackness
Then I act this way the beast unleashed
Rabbis, monks and priests always pray for peace
But it's deceased now only lives the true realance
Open up the mental deaths you rented through my palace
My thoughts contain the plus sign plus the malice
Not equating to your Wonderland so fuck Alice
My style is hostile on the external
But got plenty of love and warmth that's internal
The sin coronal
Surfaces from whispers from the lower
My noun like arks and 950 years of Noah
You're arch rival
You burn a cross I burn the bible
Because I'm liable, to do this
When my actions true this
But I'd rather choose to use my diction
Resurrect that blond blue eyed and put him through another crucifixion
Stay up in your jurisdiction (say what?)
My depiction is the drama
Though these eyes I've seen the trauma
Homicides in the source that was phenomenal

Between your raw legs like it's gynecology
You and your sorry ass style needs an apology
Cause an earthquake and make you shake you need neurology
These niggas kill me actin' like stars fuck they astrology
Imagin' with my badge I snatch the pagent
Turn your city to a smashing and grab it
Now it's time to burn the maggots my message stronger than Elisha
That backslap the ass like your father
Why bother?
Would any care for, lyrics I sling from my mic with cease your laughter
Mind of a bachelor to a master
What I thought that leaves you flabbergasted
Ask you what's the matter bastard?
These types of rhythms man you'd rather blast it
You hear the beats in jeeps over the weekend
Silence is golden and niggas get killed just for speakin'
The only deacon is death when ya left wounded
Layin' on the ground and meet your doom quick

No hallucination the lieutenant plus Illitant arean murder that's mental
Credentials is I am a hell residental with fire for the presidental
Officially it's havoc in the temple
I terrorize the heavens bring on the renaissance
With the seventh the civili the reverence reprimand
The deacon keepin' 'em from speakin'
Tell 'em seeks the false preacher and I step like a shadow on your way to
Hot concrete
And observe my peoples in the essence every weekend
We wonder what the fuck is school teachin'
Intoxicating soldiers at chaotic times reachin'
The dynasty is slim
But they only resemble what's when we attack
That split your back then we extort your specimen

That you can host a ceremony and the dose is never phony

Sabatoged, it's all camouflage like the devil and guns
And coke peddling, Olympic medaling flashback
That of a war veteran, blast at
The programmer bringing lashes 'cross your back
On some accuracy of a brainwashed Bosnian troop
That swooped down through your roof without sound
On a lyrical Nat Turner mission, reacting off of intuition
Continuously alert, no intermission
If your ears hurt, you shouldn't listen
That means you artificial and my style'll poison your brain tissue
Your inanes are crippled once the gamma rays hit you
My grains habitual and I should never go against
The ritual I've been mastering ever since
I was among the flavor youth, remain sharper than a saber tooth

Bad luck I walk under now show me where the ladder at
Pull up the urinal organs up in your bladder cat
Approachin' you with shriller rhetoric, as if you had a sac
Now crews down for it, your gas pedal floor it
With ammo and artillery and stash spots to keep and store it

Change your strategic plan, my man's getting bored
Your vocal chord is fraudulent, and not the true porcelain
I bring the fire, earth, and the source of wind

This mental murder pay the rent
Lyrically I'm the dominant ingredient, the swift extravagant
Smooth lubricant, down with the M-the-Ill-itant
(ch-ch-ch) That's the sound of the Dynasty chant
We surround your camp, assumin' the war stance
And bring it from the chest, now let's dance

M-ILL-ITANT, feel the 5th guerilla chant
Y'all talk about bodies but you would not kill a ant
My skill is amp, would peel a nigga like a stamp
Caliber is of Excalibur now you be damp
When I operate a crowd will copulate
My game'll make a room populate and 2-1-5th is the stock of hate
Peep the logistics, slump your squad of misfits
They all get they wrists slit, blast your ass if you insist it
Leave no trace so there's no trace for ballistics
Turn your soul and body to statistics
In particular I've got that extracurricular
Squad in the stash who could be stickin' ya
Slip and they vickin' ya
Harass your po-lice commissioner
Don't like chicks with weaves talking 'bout, ""I need conditioner""
That shit's deader than niggas with a morticianer
A jenazah, up in your flesh like plasma
Take away your last breath when you got asthma
Then meet Bad Lieu down at the plaza
Hip-hop extravaganza, tell your man I slump him with a stanza
Now ""Who's the Boss?"" not Tony Danza
My force not green but the force is obscene
P.O. took a piss test it came out not clean
Brody with my man Miz-Moose and Hakeem
My squad from deuce-four up to West Oak Lane
All the way to Takahwana and Frankfurt they know the name
It's like that M-Ill-itant

M-Ill-itant, lyrically hostile, Bad Lieutenant
Check it out, foul style check it out

y'all know the dynasty, the Roots repertoire
The lieutenant from the reservoir, serve the spar
The injurar, preditar of a competitar
I send MCs where the paramedics are
At first, I'm like ""nah"", I'm nonchalant from afar
Then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
With irregular balance of the cat burgla-rar
Known to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars
I know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual
We congruent, lay on the corner with the trauma unit
I'm from the lab where the bomb's distributed
So never try to duplicate the skills executed
Son you'd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed
Shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it
Some know me as the man that's from the Roots crew
Others as the bad lieutenant of Snyder Avenue
We go an eye for an eye
Behead like a samurai that'll command the dynasty until he die
Who will imply that I lack a-biliti?
Make your words known, amplify the you-tiliti
I'm crooked like the ""I"" on a toxic malt liquor
The land whipper, the Dom Perignon champ sipper
The fifth'll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
The bad lieu a bring the bad weather
So to whoever got riff, let it rest
Reflect, then recollect on the way it was set
It's the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex
Be on the low shotgun in the Lex
With my man low to flex
I'm restin where they handle the Tecs
And the lyrical vandal is next flow

When I breaststroke your wavelength of intensity

Your whole vicinity, I contaminate with hate

It's in mil, the elicit, you violate, you get a ticket
MCs you can't tell I expel, you get evicted
From out your misery, serve your ass with my delivery
Allah makes the ground you steppin' on shivery
Permanent tears run through your thoughts you queers
It's all upstairs, where there's a crowd, table and chairs
For years, been on the mic, I'm like a dike with stairs
When I strike, I stay severe, niggaz stay low in they glare
From over here, my Range Rover square to blast offside
Switch the pitch from southpaw to unorthodox

Yo, yo
Lost generation, fast paced nation
World population confront they frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money makin'
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man? Then stand your own
To emcee requires skills; I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin'
And roam like a cellular phone far from home
Givin' crowds what they wantin'
Official hip-hop consumption, the fifth thumpin'
Keepin' ya party jumpin' with an original somethin'
Yo, I dedicate this to the one dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said, ""Yo, we thought we heard you""
Joke's on you; you heard a bitin'-ass crew, but um

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured; it's nothing sacred
Aiyyo, it's funny when I see some rap niggas due to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine to five is just to hit ya; get the party live
I'm black thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhymes sayin' rent payin' life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me, from doin' tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds to send to stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music runnin' through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain; that's why my motto's to

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Livin' the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick to hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission welcomin' to the dark
When I first spark the arts, when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadel-phi
I've dealt more stealth than all the wicked wealthy
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short ""I want it made"" like Ed; 'nuff said
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark skin thoroughbred
And discover my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuin' to

 Look out the window, peep the high beams
 Medical figures is nursin the kid that got shot
 That pulled the trigga
 I woke up in the darkness at 12:17...to shots and sirenes
 Some innocent ak that would front
 To flip the rock on them at King Street block
 Similar to the blood now floodin his top
 I tried to tell him to stop 'cause yo, it's ghetto red hot
 And see the shorty wop heart blast out his back
 I take a step out the spot, to the point of attack
 It's still crime on the streets
 Damn, I'm thinkin it don't cease, it's no more peace
 Police level increase, but what the fuck...

 And hit the L, for the niggaz who fell
 In front of the flat your moms rented
 Bust off into the heavens for the nigga who fell

Freak on to the early morn 
Khadafi and Sue-kwon, you got it goin' on 
To my man Big Shawn, you got it goin' on, now, yo 
You got The Roots in the house 
We also got Bahamadia in the house, representin' lovely 
With you ears now proceed 
It's flavor you wouldn't believe as we proceed 

[Chorus]
I shall proceed and continue to rock the mic
I shall proceed and continue to rock the mic
 
Let's, kill all the small talk, and just elaborate 
The Roots collaborate I see myself as rather great 
How the words generate, whole crews disintegrate 
when I penetrate 
As if in the course flow with intensive force 
You best to go and check your source about my textual course 
Simplicity, it sounds complex, you might miss it 
But after you critique it you can kiss it 
I'm assisting fire force that leaves statistics 
When identify niggaz simplify you'll feel no sympathy 
My lyrics send you on a permanent excursion 
I never would decide when your lifespan was submergin' 
My style is urban not suburban when I'm splurgin' 
Gosh these MC's I wash more than detergent 
I can split the Red Sea but deadly 
Take heed, illadelph style as I proceed 

[Chorus ]

Bahamadia hits the melodies mellowly 
Brand new, funk doobie, choosy with the tactics 
when I gets Raw, like Dice, nice 
with the flavor, Do You Want More?!!!??! 
Of the Organix, pure 
Eargasmatic, from Distortion to Statics 
Automatic, systematic 
I'm nasty at it 
So hand me the five micraphones like they did Illmatic 
One time for the mind 
Rhyme be coming from an illadelph state of mind 
The real is not whole or half time 
all the time, and I shall proceed 
I'm movin on baby, I shall proceed 
To remain, on point like an infrared beam 
Succeed, in chasing out the ultraviolet dreams 
No Mas like Shorty, 'cause it's all about me

Black and handsome, holdin' MC's for ransom 
Thoughts command some, is this, a phantom? 
Crews I mangle, y'all know my anthem ain't the Star Spangled 
I hit you from the most bizarre angle, rectangular 
visions of papes my mind conceive 
Motivatin' me to achieve as I must proceed 
when I ride the train, traumatized to maintain 
but laid back, the tracks can relax the brain 
I got to deal with everything on this intelligent plain 
Servin' as a killer 
to the pain I live a High Life like Miller 
Me and the mic's mechanized 
Respect recognize with mind beyond wise 
Limitless when I bless the mic with speak 
Dialect never weak, y'all niggaz know Tarik 
From seven-fifth Snider Ave. got the flavor you need 
For the ingredients indeed so to the lead I shall proceed

Well here's a lil' somethin' that needs to be heard 
Rah, I was headin' Uptown, (Word 'Riq), word 
(Chillin') and all alone, no one to be with 
Hopped up on the train headed for 2-5th 
And saw this pretty girl (what?), so I sat beside her 
Then she went like she was Tony the Tiger 
I said ""Oh no, there's been a mistake 
Love, my name is Black Thought, not Frostie Flakes"" 
(Oh, golly wally) Well, she was raisin hell 
She said ""Aah, my name is Maggie but call me Michelle""

Yo,

She delt with reality never fed it to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - to read the gender how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Comps are dated - I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker

I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said ""Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana""?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
But if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental I never forgot it

I just got home from off another world tour 
I'm outside  in the rain  it's beginnin' to pour 
Can't understand why you changed the locks on the door 
Got all my drawers and socks outside on the lawn
 
What's right is wrong, we used to make love to this song 
Twice as long, especially when the nights were long 
Suga even in the dark, or when the lights were on 
Sista even in the park, lover my life is gone
 
I saw the flaws, now we both grabbin' for straws 
Over some love letters you found, in the top dresser drawer 
I'm missin' you more, the sweet scent of Christian Dior 
Kissin' you more, forever promissin' you more 
We need to communicate and start listenin' more 

Baby from experience, I've been through it before 
I found the message in a bottle washed up on the shore 
Signed from, 'sincerely yours', I can't take it no more 

[Chorus: ]
No I'll never turn my back on you 
I never want to do you wrong, Suga Sista 
No I'll never turn my back on you 
I never want to do you wrong, Suga Sista

Another episode, had the keys to the Yukon 
Tried to call her on the celly but she didn't respond 
Had my finger on redial now I'm callin' her moms 
Kept gettin' the voicemail now I'm losin' my calm
 
Though she's probably with the next man, wrapped in his arms 
Probably caught up in the mix, where she didn't belong 
On the topic of trust, misgivings was leading me wrong 
On the topic of us, misgivings was treating me wrong 

Reading me wrong, now we not getting along 
You never miss a good thing baby until it is gone 
The thrill is gone, you can hear my heart, spill on this song 

Wishin' once upon a time could stand still on this song 
If the feelings is strong, then a countermove would be wrong 
If the feelings is gone, then you know it's time to move on 
If the feelings is torn, then I was right all along 
If you think that I'm wrong, then pick my drawers off the lawn 

[Chorus: ]

At first I came to a halt, it was your fault 
Had me frozen on the avenue just watchin' you walk 
Up in your presence I was caught, breath, becomin' short 
I had to step to this to let you know you had my support
 
I said, ""I'm Black Thought, from out the 2-1-5th 
Maybe you heard about the Dynasty I do run with 
Me and The Roots done ripped, from Illadel' across the planet 
Ya see, we on some shit some find it hard to understand it
 
But back, to what you all about or how you are at 
What type of science did you knowledge was your mental intact?"" 
To converse, at first, let me know you knew the day and time 
I had to catch you, mentally makin' you mine
 
While I'm lookin' at you, physical chiseled that of a statue 
Type of shit to make you travel from Philly to the Big Apple 
It feels kind of crazy, reminiscin' back through 
No need to sweat the backturnin', keep it on the true and actual
 
As I get into your thought, for all infinity 
Shower you in masculinity, reinforcin' your sense 
Of femininity, bless you with this, the true identity 
Nothin' but respect in your vicinity 

Since, the Suga Brown from the level of Foun-dation of ground 
So together we forever bound 
We could make, heavenly sounds like a musical blend 
Throughout the bad times and beautiful things, it's like that

And it was all the same, but then the antidote came

The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back, the first five rows
But before the raw live shows
I remember I'se a little snot-nosed
Rockin Gazelle, goggles and Izod clothes
Learnin the ropes of ghetto survival
Peepin out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back my front plus my sides too
When it came to gettin mine I ain't tryin, to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you
Hip-Hop, you the love of my life and that's true
When I was handlin the shit I had to do
It was all for you, from the door for you
Speak through you, gettin paper on tour for you

Used to hit up every corner store wall for you

How she was desperately seekin to Organize in a Konfusion
Usin, no protection, told H.E.R. on _Resurrection_
Caught in the Hype Williams, and lost H.E.R. direction
Gettin eight/ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R.
An under the counter love, so _Silent_-ly I _Treat_ H.E.R.
Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R., eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggaz had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just a fuck
The Police, in her I found peace (like who?)
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, trickin off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight, losin weight, not picky - with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate, with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty, most of the niggaz she know is dirty
Havin more babies than Lauryn, she started showin early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testin me
In _Retrospect_ I see she brought _Life_ and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and white dudes
Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, makin the right moves
Besides God and family, you my life's jewel

Yo,
I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed it to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - to read the gender how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Comps are dated - I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

I would begin to dial -
Her number but knowin it's been awhile it's hard to link
I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
Fightin the feelin I'm concealin apparently I first appealin
Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mic's and puffin reefa
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said ""Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana""?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
But if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental I never forgot it

My vocal's a passport that never expire 
Crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire 
Screamin' out ""the roots"" while I balance wit the wire 
Yo, expert in this profession, the session 
In 1987, I linked up wit the question 
Eleven years later we shared crop wit Geffen 
In musical hell, but hip-hop forever heaven 
My thoughts, interwoven and deep like Beethoven 
This foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon 
Swollen wit minds that got stolen 
Fake-ass cops, uncontrollable patrolmen 
Torture, blood flow like bodies of water 
Fathers sexually assaultin' they own daughter 
Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle 
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle 
In a game of life, yo it's hard to roll a double 
Tryin' times, take lives and separate couples 
Kids thinkin' they grown, tellin' they moms ""fuck you"" 
Under they breath, livin' in the last times left 
Peep the imagery stretch across the sky like a canvas 
And we're the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness 
Time to set it off, let's spark this

We explore the whole states plus record 
In flight buds, trip that was a prisoner in war 
Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor 
But I could see the drop was a mile aboard 
To the bottom, electrical shock for rhymes 
I said ""I don't got em"", guess it kinda presented a problem 
When I understood, they said ""let him go"" 
I woke, during a center to London-Heathrow 
And now wit a past, fuckin' wit border patrol 
I'm findin' it out, I'm leakin' wit my people 
Hit the studio, spread this information 
In daze of frustration fogged the education 
From illa-fifth to switzerland destination

To the top hip-hop, check it out
It's like, word up, and it sounds so nice
Hip-Hop, you the love of my life, of my life

The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
Into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back, the first five rows
But before the raw live shows
I remember I's a little snot-nosed
Rocking Cazal goggles and Izod clothes
Learning the ropes of ghetto survival
Peeping out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back, my front, plus my sides too
When it came to getting mine I ain't trying, to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you
Hip-hop, you the love of my life and that's true
When I was handling the shit I had to do
It was all for you, from the door for you
Speak through you, getting paper on tour for you
From the start, Thought was down by law for you
Used to hit up every corner store wall for you
We ripped shit and kept it hardcore for you
I remember late nights, steady rocking the mic
Hip-hop you the love of my life
So tell the people like that y'all
And it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We bout to take it to the top

I was speaking, to my guy 'Riq and
How she was desperately seeking to Organize in a Konfusion
Using no protection, told H.E.R. on Resurrection
Caught up in the Hype Williams, and lost H.E.R. direction
Getting ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R
An under the counter love, so silently I treat H.E.R
Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R., eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just a fuck
The Police
In H.E.R. I found peace
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, tricking off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight, losing weight
Not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty
Most of the niggas she know is dirty
Having more babies than Lauryn
She started showing early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testing me
In retrospect I see she brought life and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and White dudes
Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, making the right moves
Besides God and family, you my life's jewel

Yo I'm in the eye of the storm, where the pressure's on
And MC's is dressed funny like a leprechaun
I chop rappers up like chicken seczuan
Sells a squads off like a slave auction
Aiyyo my zodiac sign read caution
On stage, I make your seed to an or-phan
Yo, my age an algebraic equation
Niggas want some? I hit em wit a portion
Son, The Fifth foursome, armed at the door son
M-illi-tilla, Dice Raw, quick draw son
You don't want no more son? That's when more come
And drag a nigga Eerie Avenue to Oregon, you're all done
Ladies and gentlemen
Select the weapon at the gate upon entering, The Roots instrumentaling
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit
We hit em like the L at 60th and Market
South Philly clip a hold into a nigga park it
Take sneaks, chains and rings and bracelets
Split back this like we the therapist
Adrenaline, Fifth mic terrorist, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Zigga zigga zigga tryin to get a grip but still slip, so lift me up
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt
You get to know me, you poke me slowly, when caught puzzin'
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't
Punked em wit a dozen of pellets all in they skelet
Transform, from the norm, start to brainstorm
Yeah Malik be from The Roots, he ain't gone
I took the wrong exit, the sign said Langhorne
I'm trapped up in about five worlds wit live pearls
Shouts to Armour Akquan who's name is Jalil
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand it
Demandin', takin' you back like Knots Landing
I'm Ralph Cramdon, we out, you'll see in Hampton
Yo what the what the what the, what the what the what the
Pivot on this concrete earth until I rot
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet but still I plot, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Beans passed the mack and we held em, like hostages
Rappers see me, hide they face like ostriches
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages
Underwater rap, you know who the bosses is
North Philly baby, that's where that Raw shit is
You'll get blown out the sky once you get talkative
A-D devise rise, I fathered it
So when you see me on the street, don't bother kid
Just be on your merry way, or you might get slit
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did
Lay you on floors like ya gettin' carpeted
You need a special kind of mic for retarded kids
Me against you's like Kane verse the Partridges
You want to battle, change your name to The Forfeiters
Cause that's what you do, face to face wit raw niggas
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

They used to talk shit, but I'ma quiet them
Kick in the door wit my boys stick to riotin'
First nigga that flinch, I'ma fire em
Tape 'em up, grip his hands, and plyer em
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em?
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him
Paid the front row seat watchin' Iverson
First class air crafts what I'm flyin' in
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them
Used to shotgun in cars, now I'm drivin' 'em
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' them
Ran up in y'all spot wit Rob and them
Grew up, two-four, wit Pie and em
But do my dirt, twenty first, wit Kyle and them
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them
Brother news, nigga schooled Marley Park and them
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them

To this avalanche of black snow, rap flow
To get my people thinkin' mo', we at the brink of war
What does it all mean? What's it all for?
With knowledge of yourself, then you're through the first door
My people hungry and thirst for more next music explore
It's heavenly to your ebony daughter next door
So what you think the roots get the world respect for?
The splendid authentic hip-hop that's raw core
Severe, world premier, a superior sophomore

Who the ultimate?  Yo my man speak upon it

Aiyyo I stop fools and drop jewels but never run it
Rock mics so nice I make you stock price plummet
All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane barkin big game and get hunted
Eyewitness account, say it happened so sudden
Just slid off to the side, didn't really say nuttin
Then BLAOW, blew away the 1900th

And rock, uniforms, that's made for nurses

So mounties in the county got a BIG bounty stressin me

But half the time, they run it down one of mine

I'm nicer than your writtens even when I'm improvised

The Roots,"Muffled sound of fist on flesh 
Blows to chest 
No breath 
Air gasps 
You ain't nothing but white trash, bitch! 
With each hit, each kick, each, broken rib 
Crack, crack! 
Bones are crying 
Mommy's crying and bleeding 
And pleading 
And then 
Daddy wants to fuck 
Dick hard, swelled with power rush 
And as if all that wasn't enough 
Mommy's seven months heavy with birth 
As, Daddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied ear 

First, lullaby 
First, son, will, ever, hear 
And never forget 

Mommy almost bled to death when she have him, finally 
She'd already lost, three 
Uterus-bruised, shredded, and weak 
From being daily beat 
And Friday nights were the worse and 
Daddy never came with flowers 
Instead he spent hours at some corner spot 
With some bar pop named Cookie 
Putting his thing down 
Soiling Mommy's sheets with
Sweet, talk shit, 
Cookie's cheap lipstick, 
Hair grease, sperm, and Jezebel juice 

To hell with the good news that
He was a father for the first time 
His thirst for wine and women 
Clouded his vision 
No warm welcome for mother and son 
Just 
The rank smell of ass-crack, funk, and cum 
But Mommy's prayerful strength-her best defense 
She, burned the dirty linens 
Made a fresh bed 
Laid sleeping First Son down 
And never made a sound 
As she purged her scourge 
With birth-blood and quiet tears 
Watching as her fears and love and sacrifice 
Lie there in his soft skin and new life 
Breathing, dreaming, fresh from God's eye 
Mommy's little survivor 
Like, her 

Mommy called crazy and scorned 
Cause she two more born 
One boy soon after 
The girl much later and 
Although they were both sung the same lullabies of hate 
Her, First Son, the first one 
Whose, womb-world was profaned 
Came of age playing street games 
With Stewie, Rezzie, and Little Brother 
'Till his heart start to wither 
In pain and shame 
Blamed Mom for the wrong she let Daddy do to her 
And him
Let, sins of the Father cause his innocence to wander 
Found out amongst thieves 
Chose to squander his dreams 
Stopped believing in himself 
Become prodigal with his life 
Make impossible shit right with
Gang-ties, crime, lies 
Erase wise, woeful words of Mother 
Replaced them with absurdities of others 
Who had also lost their way 

Played a different kind of street game now 
First Son plunged deep 
Speak street-family vows 
Espouse no causes but his own 
See, he couldn't protect Mommy's neck from Daddy's grasp 
Or, protect Mommy's ass from Daddy's wrath 
Couldn't shield her ears from
Daddy's foul-mouthed, liquor-breath jeers 
His only defense-served be confidence 
Brown bottles housed his swift descent 
Phones called cops on block frequent for his shenanigans 
Now, Daddy and him twins in addiction 
Driven to false-hearted heavens and friends 
By liquefied demons 
Had become what he despised from conception 'til end 
Destined for a demise 
Survived nine lives of staying high 
Conning, jewelry-pawning, arrests, theft 
Womanizing, only for money, never for sex 
Bullet in chest, baseball bat to the head 
Left for dead 
So, eyes wide and glassy 
Speech, slowed and slurred 
Lips twitched with caked-up codeine candy 
And mouth corners one December 24th 
Mr. Hide and False Friend 
Took final ride to suburban supplier 
Shots were fired by the gray man 
With shaky hand 
But not shaky enough to miss
Hit, Lost Boy in back 
So-called Friend runs for door 
Leaves First Son blood-born 
Lying alone in blood on cold floor 

Death was the cause of
Returning to Innocence Lost

Baby 'Sis awake for dawn on Christmas morn 
To Mommy's sobs and shakes 
Daddy's silhouettes of regret 
All past, omitted, and absolved by lost 
As they clung to each other

Look God, I walk around a little edgy already
Y'all MC's come into my face, but my aim's steady
M-illitant is skilled in most strategic plan
I float across seas and, breezed across land
Standin', in these thoughts of murder within
The structure of this world that's corrupted with sin
I'm always hittin', to leave MC's guessin'
For any transgression, in my perimeter
There will be a blessing, and your explicit intoxicated
Buddha session, to stop stressin'
Me with the madness, puttin' niggaz on my had list
No sadness is felt, you shuffled and your cards get dealt
Jim Carrey ass niggaz start to melt
Impact like a buckle bein' swung from off a belt
Any help for shelter, when in the realms of a welter
My weight will tilt ya, hold alignments and change your filter
My attitude a product of society
So sometimes for gratitude, you know you can't rely on me
Niggaz eyein' me, with looks of they anxiety
Wonderin' what's in my heart, velocity or piety
Yo, it depends on which one, you bring to surface
At times I get trife, but what to worship is my purpose
Malik be blend with the tree, to spot an enemy

Don't approach with bullshit, I'm quick to call it invalid
Route through your district, we keep it simplistic
No need for the rapper to talk, put it on halt
Show me the vault, or the safe, cause I'm on the paper chase
Wade through route states for bout thirty down my waist
I'm tryin to get it, these rain bottlin' thoughts become acidic
With one in the chamber, ready to aim and spit it
A girlfriend and team made nigga cash just splintered
I take what you got to give, cause I got to live
The last hour, I bet your ass you act sour
Might act up, but I still can pass dowa
I'm usin' new ways to try to reach these better days
Instead of tryin' to take you under I just make you wonder
I still fast, make salaat, and pay zakaat
I didn't make Hajj yet, but that's my next project
Livin' two lives, one of turn and one with true lies
Keepin' a hoe, knowin' these hands into my do'as
In the quarters livin' modest with my nigga Trotter
I circle my foes, like tawaf around the kaba
I used to live life, like there was no mañana
Now I'm treatin' every breath, like it was your honor
I'm Mill-itill-itant with the Fifth that stand firm
Like a pillar, I'm I and T-L like Manilla

Taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo flash focus record
Said she workin on a flick and
Could my click do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris
At Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage
And took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that
Things fall apart, intentions shatter
She like that shit don't matter
When I get home get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever
Let's link, let's get together

When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl

And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact

I remember I's a little snot-nosed
Rocking Cazal goggles and Izod clothes
Learning the ropes of ghetto survival

Caught up in the Hype Williams, and lost H.E.R. direction
Getting ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R

Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight, losing weight
Not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty
Most of the niggas she know is dirty
Having more babies than Lauryn
She started showing early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testing me
In retrospect I see she brought life and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and White dudes

The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
Into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back, the first five rows
But before the raw live shows
I remember I've a little snot-nosed
Rockin' Gazelle, goggles and Izod clothes
Learnin' the ropes of ghetto survival
Peepin' out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back my front plus my sides too
When it came to gettin' mine I ain't tryin', to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you
Hip-Hop, you the love of my life and that's true
When I was handlin' the shit I had to do
It was all for you, from the door for you
Speak through you, gettin' paper on tour for you
From the start, Thought was down by law for you
Used to hit up every corner store wall for you
We ripped shit, and kept it hardcore for you
I remember late nights, steady rockin' the mic

Yo, yo I was speakin', to my guy 'Riq and
How she was desperately seekin' to Organize in a Konfusion
Usin', no protection, told H.E.R. on Resurrection
Caught in the Hype Williams, and lost H-E-R. direction
Gettin' ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H-E-R
An under the counter love, so silently I treat H-E-R
Her daddy'll beat H-E-R, eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggaz had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just a fuck
The police, in her I found peace (like who?)
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, trickin' off
Tried to make a hit with H-E-R but my dick went soft
Movin' weight, losin' weight, not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate, with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty, most of the niggaz she know is dirty
Havin' more babies than Lauryn, she started showin' early
As of late I realized, that this is H-E-R fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testin' me
In retrospect I see she brought life and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and white dudes
Over H-E-R I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, makin' the right moves
Besides God and family, you my life's jewel

What's the combination that can make a human erupt

Indeed, we blast, refuse to kiss ass
Quick fast, ready to mash cause of a bugged out past
Swallow the pain, follow the mental terrain
It takes a hell of a man, nowadays to maintain
Garments bloodstained, face bruised and battered
Our eyes reflect the agony, of dreams that were shattered
And they love it, when we wild out and kill our own
but the greater responsibility, yes, is still our own

that somebody do somethin soon, and let's examine

Too many drops of blood, too many problems to juggle
Too few jobs available, too few schools equipped
Too few role models; just gangsters and pimps

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We use to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour 
And peep this ethiopian queen from philly 
Taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo flash focus record
Said she workin on a flick and
Could my click do the score
She said she loved my show in paris
At Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage
And took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that
Things fall apart, intentions shatter
She like that shit don't matter 
When I get home get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever
Let's link, let's get together
Shit you think not, think the thought went home and forgot
Time passed, we back in philly now she up in my spa
Tellin me the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
Startin buildin' with her constantly round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop 
And keep tellin me

Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol

Seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
While politicin with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playin boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin boo 
And when cats be poppin' game I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin' to your homies they be leavin you blind

Yeah, so what you sayin' I can trust you?
Is you crazy, you my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill
No doubt

[Chorus:]

The snake could be that chick 
And that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering ""she tryin' to play you for the fool Black""
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be I ain't on some ""oh I'm a celebrity""
I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, she like

At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him

They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll split your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it

They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, [yo]
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted [or what]

Know what'm saying?

You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
'What can become of kings and young kids?'

Summer dream deferred, incident occurred, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from

Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight,
Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising,
Developing his knack to write

Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world, detached himself
You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions

This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you

This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
Peace are you

Forever and ever yo, locked down forever
Could you stand the weather?
Yo, yo I can't even explain the pain
Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

Yes, I am the inescapable, the irresistible,
The unnegotiable, the unchallenged [who dat?]
I am time
I scroll in measurements, control the elements,

I hold the evidence, I tell the story [say what?]
I am time
I know no prejudice, I bare no sentiments
For wealth or settlement, I move forward [who you?]

I am time
You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me,
Retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me,
You can't do much for me besides serve

Me well and have good dividends returned to you
Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me,
Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully

Plaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be,
Who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me
Angel's scribe the page for me,
Keep a full account of all the names for me
And make a special mark for Hurricane who (?) patiently

Could you hold it together?

Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising

From out the south water, like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You can't believe the world we live in's injust
All I see is more proof, there's no place for us

They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control 
It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul

Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
There's no where to run, no where to hide
In a six-by-six a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Could you stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
I can't even explain the pain, know'm saying?

Your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine behind bars forever
Could you stand the weather?
You built for that? Is you cut for that?

Don't be telling me that you know the pain
Your life was like a hurricane, yo

I woke up and it was pouring down rain
I put my head on, it really wasn't no thing
One of them days I was feeling immune to the pain
Threw on, Alice Coltrane, smoked and sang

And wrote this flame compused to the rhythm of the droplets
And went whispering simliar to gossip
The kick slapping at the window glass
Slow down the globe so it don't spin too fast

Because, I been running like a river since
The age of my early innocence
It just made me ambitious
My grams used to tell me ""Man listen,

If you can't burn, don't step into the kitchen""
You muscle your turn, the laws of the land viscious
We gotta stick to the plan, which is
Pursuing true riches, whether we trade stock or wash dishes

Throughout setbacks and few glitches
The Big Picture's the focus, fuckin being hopeless
Or helpless, we not selfish so we wrote this
Give it to ya, make you feel good
Know what I'm talkin about? C'mon

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Yo from the parquet floors to the fifty foot ceiling
I pull the heavy black curtain back, now revealing
The sun beneath the velvet, and like it was mine

No one elses, embracing the beams yo, I felt it
And stood there, feeling it, getting charged
Turn me loose upon the streets, a young poet at large
Out in the world, up against tremendous odds

Some'll let it break em and throw in they cards
But my squad remain focus when we goin for ours
And we don't, do it for chains or do it for cars
And we don't, do it for lames or do it for broads

And we don't, do it for fame, we do it because
It's for the young black gifted mind
Living the story of the most twisted kind
Turbulent times swirled around they dome like a turban

It gets disturbing, feelin alone in the urban
But maintain ya grip for just a little bit
I'd tell you it's all good but that's bullshit
Let's just try to feel good, yeah...know what I'm talkin bout

Eyyo, the anticipation arose as time froze
I just stared down the aisles with my eyes closed
And jumped straight into the crime code, I just did it
You trying to hear that heat right? Yup, well let's get it
My desire to groove was overcomin' my fears
I got a P;anet Rock record I stole from blairs
I feing to throw a DISCO in my room upstairs
Put the needle to the record let it soothe my ears
It goes, ""Party People this groove is so sonic
We feining to get you high as a kite with no chronic""
Who can tell at the top, but it's better than brain
But I fell in love with the culture, was never the same
Remember All Stars in Ti Sweats
And young rhythm round the projects trying to chill
Cause my name on my buckle and my style is Ill
Cause I got you in my system and refine the skill
You like my life soundtrack, my personal theme
Joint that knock for me ever since I burst on the scene
Yo it's like gimme the music and I make it my wife

(Chorus)
Hip hop, you the love of my Life (ey yo)
Tell the people like that what (ey yo) (hip hop over chorus)
And it sounds so tight, hip hop you the love of my life
We fein' to take it to the top love
It's like that love, and it sounds so tight
Hip hop you the love of my life
We fin to take it to the, 
Take it to the, to the, to the, to the (hip hop)

Yo, when I was 9 years old, I realized there was a road
At the end thered be a lot of studios and shows
I had to pump my brakes and learn from my mistakes
Took time to create so that y'all could relate
To be a pioneer it takes work for years
And sometimes I Seen things that'll jerk your tears
I been through hard times, many rocks to climb
Trying to take it from the bottom to the top of the line
With fam' and the same shorty from the two dollar jam
That used to rock Sergios in the B-girl stance
Polly rocking door knockers with her hair in the twist
With the ill Michael Jackson wrist band on her wrist
Before we ever shook asses and the watched the cells
We used to sing ""Lodi Dodi"" and ""ROCK THE BELLS""
And you can mash up in the party til the early mourn'
Without your BALI shoes getting stepped on
Even though we from the city, the Crime and Grime
Yo I grew up around the times of beats and rhymes
I remember late nights rockin' without a mic
Hip hop u the love of my life

And what she's fittin' to have she don't know
She wants neo soul cause hip hop is old
She don't want no rock'n roll
She want platinum, ice and gold
She want a whole lot of somethin' to fold
If you're an obstacle she'll just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary's bad
In these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told the girl look here
Calm down I'm gonna hold your hand
To enable you to keep the plan
Because you're quick to learn
And we can make money to burn
If you allow me the latest game
I don't ask for much but enough to room to spread my wings
And a world fittin' to know my name, just listen to me

I don't ask, for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow standin' where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lovers behind my lovers back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary dropped my baby girl tonight I would name her rock 'n roll

Cadillac needs space to roam
Where we headin' for she don't know

And I'm a god dang rollin' stone
I don't beg I can hold my own
I don't break I can hold a chrome
And it's weighin' a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is the only one
And Black Thought is bad
These streets he done ran ever since when the game began
I never played the fool
Matter of fact I've been keeping it cool
Since money been changin' hands
And I'm left to shine, the legacy I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread these wings
And a world fittin' to know my name, now listen to me

I don't beg from a rich man
And I don't scream and kick when his shit don't fall in my handsman
Cause I know how to still
Fertilize another against my lovers will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Oh you know the deal you'll be keeping my legend alive
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight I would name her rock 'n roll

Oh break it down, down for me
I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've takin' my test
Deliverin' Mary it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it rock 'n roll

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right

Pull out-rageous arms from the floor of the basement
Then bust 'nuff talons if my peoplez in danger

My vision is the strangest, the rhythm is anguish

Is something in the iris and the way I spit
That tell these other crab rappers I ain't fo' no shit

Thought, put ass-backwards rappers in a small package
Experience is all that is, I'm well established
Me and the mic in holy matrimony like a marriage
The technique in your reach, if only you could have it
For me it's automatic, it's na-tu-ral, I'm mad thoro
Poet for hired pack metal
You feel me?

Don't stop (uh don't stop yo)
Tonight (cheeba cheeba yo, soul shock yo)
(Give it everything you got yo)
(Once again it's time, it's time)
It's time to ride, ride

Yo, the load heavy
We walk around a little edgy, all ready and steady
Withdrawal like Darryl Strawberry, it figures
Niggas mad from them ghetto sandwiches and swine
Cryin' hard times, disadvantegeous, man listen
The story in the ghetto the same
Seem like it's just some things that never will change
Give birth to a style and won't give it a name
Talk 'bout consciousness it's a different thang
Envision again, the honorable 'Riq, general Hannibal speak
The understandable diabolique, animal style
Out of your dreams kid, you proud that you seen this
Fifth supreme linguist, a lyrical genious
Inject you with the broke down english
The most freshest and cleanest, 'Riq Geez, guess what the fame is
Kareem's beat makin' me fiendish
Don't act shaky and squeamish, if you real make me believe it nigga

Don't stop (uh don't stop yo)
Tonight (cheeba cheeba yo, soul shock yo)
(Give it everything you got yo)
(Once again it's time, it's time)
It's time to ride, ride

Yo, the rebel Jake Rivera
You felt another date, you better
Don't copped off, create it just save your cheddar
I hit the studio with a pen and a vendetta
Sippin' an ice cold Beck, huffin' the tenth letter
Driftin', shots lickin while the plot thickens
Sands in the hourglass thinnin', the last inning
The flash and the cash and the fast women
It's nothing, a lust for the craft keep the passion and
Blaow, kissin' my tablet with firing pins
Poke holes in the plastic for oxygen
MCs jumpin' out shoes and socks again
Must have seen their face in the news it's gots to been
Thought known as the cure for cancer
Same corrupt city as Mumia the Panther
Man to man, hammer cocked, block and standoff
Bang, gunfire slang up in the dance hall
Yo, I hold the mic that could be thrown as a pipe bomb
Bring it just to sling it at your favorite icon
Thing about my music is it ain't shit like y'all
Thought, diesel like a 28-inch python
You know what I'm saying?

When I'm on the mic there won't be no delayin'

Don't stop (uh don't stop yo)
Tonight (cheeba cheeba yo, soul shock yo)
(Give it everything you got yo)

Something in the way of things
Something that will quit and won't start
Something you know but can't stand
Can't know get along with
Like death
Riding on top of the car peering through the windshield for his cue
Something entirely fictitious and true
That creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways
Like they were yourself passing yourself not smiling
The dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss
I tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate

I know things you know and nothing you don't know
'cept I saw something in the way of things
Something grinning at me and I wanted to know, was it funny?
Was it so funny it followed me down the street
Greeting everybody like the good humor man
But an they got the taste of good humor but no ice cream
It was like dat
Me talking across people into the houses
And not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks
You could see them
But they looked like important Negroes on the way to your funeral
Looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction
And let them chant the number and use an ivory pointer to count your teeth
Remember Steppen Fetchit
Remember Steppen Fetchit how we laughed
An all your Sunday school images giving flesh and giggling
With the ice pick high off his head
Made ya laugh anyway

I can see something in the way of our selves
I can see something in the way of our selves
That's why I say the things I do, you know it
But its something else to you

Like that job
This morning when you got there and it was quiet
And the machines were yearning soft behind you
Yearning for that nigga to come and give up his life
Standin' there bein' dissed and broke and troubled

My mistake is I kept sayin' ""that was proof that God didn't exist""
And you told me, ""nah, it was proof that the devil do""
But still, its like I see something I hear things
I saw words in the white boy's lying rag

Said he was gonna die poor and frustrated
That them dreams walk which you 'cross town
S'gonna die from over work
There's garbage on the street that's tellin' you you ain't shit

And you almost believe it
Broke and mistaken all the time
You know some of the words but they ain't the right ones
Your cable back on but ain't nothin' you can see

But I see something in the way of things
Something to make us stumble
Something get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness
I see something and feel something stalking us

Like and ugly thing floating at our back calling us names
You see it and hear it too
But you say it got a right to exist just like you and if God made it
But then we got to argue

And the light gon' come down around us
Even though we remember where the (light or mic??) is
Remember the Negro squinting at us through the cage
You seen what I see too?

The smile that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks
You see something too but can't call its name

Ain't it too bad why'all said
Ain't it too bad, such a nice boy always kind to his motha
Always say good morning to everybody on his way to work
But that last time before he got locked up and hurt, real bad

I seen him walkin' toward his house and he wasn't smiling
And he didn't even say hello
But I knew he'd seen something
Something in the way of things that it worked on him like it do in will

And he kept marching faster and faster away from us
And never even muttered a word
Then the next day he was gone
You want to know what

You want to know what I'm talkin' about
Sayin' ""I seen something in the way of things""
And how the boys face looked that day just before they took him away
The is? in that face and remember now, remember all them other faces

And all the many places you've seen him or the sister with his child
Wandering up the street
Remember what you seen in your own mirror and didn't for a second recognize
The face, your own face

Straining to get out from behind the glass
Open your mouth like you was gon' say somethin'
Close your eyes and remember what you saw and what it made you feel like
Now, don't you see something else

Something cold and ugly
Not invisible but blended with the shadow criss-crossing the old man
Squatting by the drug store at the corner
With is head resting uneasily on his folded arms
And the boy that smiled and the girl he went with

And in my eyes too
A waving craziness splitting them into the jet stream of a black bird
Wit his ass on fire
Or the solomNOTness of where we go to know we gonna be happy

I seen something
I SEEN something
And you seen it too
You seen it too
You just can't call it's name name name name name name name",Something in the Way of Things (In Town),2002

Gripping, draw you in closer make you want to listen to it
And if you real ill at making music
Then lesson will feel like you livin' through it
That's how my nigga do it
I met Slacks back in like '91 rapping

Encore, yo I'm headed back to Philly
Nigga you rollin' with me?
I'm trying to get busy
We walk dogs that was off the chain
Lot of times at the show people hardly came
I just took it in stride as part of the game
But inside people down with me started to change
It was a couple things
Lil' [unknown], lil' pills
Instead of driving out on the road you rather chill
I know the way the pleasure feel
I'm not judging
But still I'm on a mission, yo I'm not buggin'

Oh why we walking with the rep up for

You know it if you came up poor my nigga
Picture a bus up north
You know we made of everything outlaws are made of
I'm far from a hater
And I don't say I love you 'cause the way I feel is greater
In Illa you a poet son
You a ball creator
And this will probably dawn on you later
Is in you nature, letters all up in the wall like they made of paper
You got to find out where you talent take you
You might fuck around, finally make it

Cop codeine by the courts and keep comin'
Dummy, just embracing the dope like it's a woman
You burnin' both sides of the rope and keep pullin'
Tuggin', in between Islam and straight tuggin'
Laying everyday around the way and doin' nothin'
See'em looking shaking their head and start shruggin'
If they don't have a man like mine, they got a cousin
Hey yo you better be a true friend to 'em
Before the shit put an end to 'em
Or give a pen to 'em
Or lock'em up in the studio with a mic

Like eucalyptus and have ready to go for yours

The Roots,"[Chorus: x2]
I've been wondering about the complexity
Of what we have it shouldn't be
More
Just can't see
More

You're physically in this, but how could we tell
If we was meant to be in bliss if you're not mentally as well?
This energy you're sending me is tricky as hell
Usually it's like a 50/50, we could take a L
Before we start things, at this point being apart brings
The feeling of somebody plucking at your heart strings
I know it probably shouldn't feel like this
But any other woman I see is in your likeness
It's from your cheekbones
Yo your lips, to your curves, to your deep moans
To that walk, to your words
You love feeling like a breakdown on the verge
First we on good terms, then you on my last nerves
Got my back just aching, my shoes is all tight
It's too complex when we choose to do it right
It's wrong, one minute you a soldier strong
Then you trying a route talking about it's over and gone

[Chorus]

When your boyfriend's in town, it's bound to be trouble, Love
His name Black, and he known to be a lover of
Getting it on with my smoker's jacket on
Eyes racing back and forth listening to Chaka Khan
Trying to figure the cause why you always acting off
like I'm slacking off
Maybe our signal's getting crossed
For the case Love, you feel like you making a waste of
Your precious time you need to get a taste of
Some space to breathe, a moment as friends
We should've felt ourselves slipping into it again
'Cause it's like off and on, on and off
Passion, lost and found, found and lost
Clashing, asking for nothing but understanding
Your hearts made of glass, use care when handling
Girl, all in all I never leave you stranded
'Cause my respect you commanded, you figure it out

[Chorus]

I used to come into the party and stand around
'Cause I was kinda too shy to really get down
I used to play the corner and watch the scene
Deep down knowing I wanted to find me a queen
And I could feel that in my stomach and up in my chest
Because I knew a lot of women, and some was fresh
But then I found you girl, and just like me
You had a heart that was yearning to be set free
Now listen, see you and me we need to take the time
To erase any doubt that's inside your mind
It's not a mountain that I'm ever too tired to climb
And who's counting, but I know at least a thousand times
I let you know I'm here for you, care for you, and confide in you
Break bread, share with you, and provide for you
And that's full time, it's no 9 to 5 with you
That's why I'm trying to work it out with you, it's gonna work

Cause you a toy not a soldier yet
You better hold your neck
You dick smokers get no respect
With the blood, ice your watch, rock your rocks
Better rock it on the screen and not the blocks
'cause them crews don't stop them shots
It's so many that fly,  they chase down, I just stop and watch
I'm from the south side of philly, it's known to get gruesome
Heavy hitter villians these alleyways produce them
Heavy hitter on a pocket we find a way to juice them
They may as well pay, schmuck

Then analyze the taste in your mouth, it seem bitter

The Roots,"Listen, I got you phobic offa this like arachnids
Drastic, it ain't plastic, it's just pro blackness
Grown man tactics no pediatrics
The kind of track that make the comeback miraculous
The catalyst. Thought with the knack of splashin'
I'm dashin', I mastered the craft of mashin'
The level-headed thoroughbred the females passion
Magnetic attraction be keeping em askin'

The crews in the Cadillac, the Pendergrassin'
Swerve half-naked won't come near crashin'
But if I go to Heaven would ya'll know my name
Or would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?
Clap for your freedom dog, that's what's happenin'
My spit take critical political action
The hustle is a puzzle, each piece is a fraction
And every word that's understood is a transaction
I'm an S.P. soldier, microphone holder
Rep Philly set
From Bolivia to Boulder
Paris, France to Tip and Thai Yoga
How we gon' make it through the dark?
I'll show ya.

Tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
Listen,
If you want to be high

Yo kick off ya shoes, jump off the jock
I fly higher than them dudes from off ya block
My name Black, the style is unorthodox
It tap chins wit ya men's who you thought could box
A couple people wanted thought to stop
But guess what?
My man grab the missile, plug for the gut
Now next time greedy stop being such a glut
I'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts
We up close on 'em with toast but no crust
It's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust
Choke on your face you jewels is lackluster
Gotta put it to ya straight
Y'all fools is jacked up
Came close to the utmost but no cogar
Nose to the grindstone, head to the stars
The number one runner with the number one drummer
Grammy award-winning it's the world's eighth wonder
Come on!

Tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
If you want to be high

Yo, your first impression might be I'm a asshole
Or say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle
Or try to suntouch and put the heat in a capsule
Dog I'm far deeper than that though,
I get in the zone, recognize I'm a rolling stone
No time to lollygag or lounge with scallywags
Gimme the disc or I'll put it where your body at
Old school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks
With no apology, fraud or tricknology
Just trust what I see and I say and follow me
My way, I be the open book, look inside me
The star of the story that the grooveteller guide me
Through all the dark times part of the business
The light be contingent on small forensics
My microphone'll make a man a newborn infant
It's true so the true gon' sense it
I get in the zone

Tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music

And peep this Ethiopian queen from Philly 
Taking classes abroad 
She studying film and photo flash focus record 
Said she workin' on a flick and 
Could my click do the score 
She said she loved my show in Paris 
At Elysee Montmartre 
And that I stepped off the stage 
And took a piece of her heart 
We knew from the start that 
Things fall apart, intentions shatter 
She like that shit don't matter 
When I get home get at her 
Through letter, phone, whatever 
Let's link, let's get together 
Shit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot 
Time passed, we back in Philly now she up in my spot 
Tellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot 
Startin' buildin' with her constantly round the clock 
Now she in my world like hip-hop 
And keep tellin' me 

[Chorus: x2] 

Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight 
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night 
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol 

Another lonely night 
Seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic 
I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight 
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me 
While politicin' with my sister from New York City 
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty 
Sike, I'm playin' boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin' boo 
And when cats be poppin game I don't hear what they sayin' boo 
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl 
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills 
So when you sweatin' on stage think of me when you rhyme 
And don't be listenin' to your homies they be leavin' you blind 

Yeah, so what you sayin' I can trust you? 

Is you crazy, you my king for real 

But sometimes relationships get ill 
 
No doubt 

[Chorus: x2] 

That snake could be that chick 
And that rat could be that cool cat 
That's whispering ""she tryin' to play you for the fool Black"" 
If something's on your chest then let it be known 
See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone 
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact 
That people bite back and fracture what's intact 
And they'll forever be I ain't on some ""oh I'm a celebrity"" 
I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be 
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds 
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends 
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends 
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, she like
 
[Chorus]

What we are against is those thugs""",You Got Me [Live],2004
The Roots,"Hold your flix, I'm not for the photo op's
It's Black, code name Yaphet Kotto ock
My twist like a ratchet in an auto shop
Since granddaddy old Desoto stopped and he got the Caddie
I been gladly servin, any y'all cats want to act determined
Spit pesticides for rats and vermin
Seem like none of y'all chumps is learning
Y'all hopeless, and I'm a little better than dope is
Far from a brand new kid to show biz
Tryna hold on, maintain my focus
Coming out a room with a could of smoke
Smokers rolling with the punches
I survive and rock
Cause I keep the crowd alive
And the texture of my voice
Is course and kind of hoarse and cut
Like I'm throwing a thousand knives

Party people gather round what we have here is a brand new sound
Reach for my waist you hit the ground
You better duck when that awful sound goes
Boom
That's what's happenin in the parking lot
That's what's happenin on stage

The man at hand that rule the school
And reach and teach the blind and find a way from A to Z
And be the most to boast I'm load and proud
The game and reign that remain
The heat is on so feel the fire come off the empire or the
More higher level of depth one step beyond dope
To suckers all scope and hope to cop a note
Cause I could never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of Monopoly
Let it speed around the board like an astro
And send them to jail for tryna pass go
Shaking them up
Breaking them up
Taking no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So quest love let the fire roast
So I can flow and we can kill the whole show cause

Party people gather round what we have here is a brand new sound
Reach for my waist you hit the ground
You better duck when that awful sound goes
Boom
That's what's happenin in the parking lot
That's what's happenin on stage

I'm live
Design a finer rhyme that's right on time
One step beyond and not behind the line
That separates thought from divine
You can take it as a caution or a warning sign
Look for antonyms
Words I'm sending em
Homonyms, synonyms good like M&M's
You know the time when it's Riq Gees slicing
I turn a Mic's last name into Tyson
My brain like a factory constantly creating
Materials stitch by stitch for decoration
My lyrics one fabric the beat is a lining
My passion of rhyming is fashion designing
Now it get sorted cause people want to sport it ya bought it
If you didn't then you couldn't afford it
Poetry full of surprises it's like a game show
And my brain go
I do my thing yo

Party people gather round what we have here is a brand new sound

You better duck when that awful sound goes

You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, okay

When that adrenaline get in they system
It get 'em out on a quest for stardom, could be a mother fuckin' problem
In Philly, Cincinnati, Los Angeles or Harlem
Kids call themselves killers let they hammers do the talkin'
Don't even know the meaning of life, ain't seen a thing
And you dream of floodin' the scenery with, yayo and greenery
But for now, you stickin' her with the heavy machinery
Wonder how, you lift it up, be only 17
And like everybody he want to shine, young brothers on the grind
Holdin' something in their spine, ""Bowling for Columbine""
Stressin' to me how it's all about a dollar sign
Dig the way you out of line, out of sight and out of mind
Up against the clock and damn near out of time
""The Tipping Point"" has arrived, and that's the bottom line
To all my peoples that are stars, it's our time to shine

Twist some cool champagne, I'm goin' through changes
A grown-ass man, I done paid my dues
Learn the rules lil' homey, you could be one too
Niggas know, ain't no tellin' what he gonna' do
But recognize young bro, I'mma do it for you
You know why?  We're all stars and we highly evolved
Hip-Hop, it's not pop like Kylie Minogue
If it bang, them gettin' busy brothers probably involved
In the game, where everybody got a shottie to draw
I guess you probably a thug, you boss ballin' or what?
I can't call it man, I got the ladies fallin' in love
Cause handsome, intelligent, tough I'm all the above
I know you knew it it's the movement
Groove to it while you doin' it up

Introducing the band you gotta see to believe
He got the mic in his hand, so keep the heat up your sleeve
It's Black Thought, he rockin' sharp so the speakers'll bleed
I run a triathlon, you wouldn't see me fatigued
I'm a star, and maybe y'all should cop something to be
Or trade some of y'all equipment in for something you need
Cause it's a, lot of bullshit floodin' the scene
Where everybody's a star, and hot shit is few and far between
We lose the grip of what, garbage mean
Shorties want to be themselves, I know it's hard to be
Don't want to do the Ruben Studdard and come off less threatening
Keepin' it real I'll kill you if you end up lettin' it
Ain't it blowin' your mind how the game all in line
Now the best, to the rest, we fin' to end up settin it
I'd tell you that I was a veteran but it's evident
You act like you want it, you gonna' end up gettin' it

'Riq geez motherfuckers I'm a son of a gun
Black master of any trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue
Clear my path and come get your captain hung
Trying to breath like black'll collapse your lungs
Young chump you could choke off the web I spun
I done cleared 'em out from the threat I brung
You done heard about what set I'm from
My nigga, word-a-mouth little rule-a-thumb
Y'all better bow down when the ruler come
I'm a real hood nigga not a hood-a-lum
The way Thought put it down be confusin' some of y'all
Cats can't walk while chewin' your gum 'n all
With a keyboard got do with a drum 'n all
School 'em on stage like I'm doin' a seminar
Professional type, I'm adjusting my mic
Go to war kid I'll give you any weapon you like
Give you something to run from
Bust off your dum-dum
Stop kid, that hot shit you know where it come from
It's philly world-wide phenomenon
And reinforcin' that shit is my nine to five
And when I finish making you recognize
I'm getin' at a couple civilized women that's tryin' to ride
You were waitin' on the raw to come off the oil
You wanna get the bitches up off the wall
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
To keep you in health, this for all of y'all
I'm quick on the draw like Black McGraw
And I can't tell what y'all cats rappin' for
My name 'riq geez and I'm back for more
To get more chips than the corner store
With a portrait of Malcom X on the door
While I'm eatin' MCs like a carnivore
Matter fact, ease back 'fore you get harmed
Ring the, warning horn when I'm gon' perform
The first nigga that move, or disturb the groove
I'm a have y'all flicks on the evening news
Play y'all part, get on y'all P's and Q's
And when y'all think Thought, be prepared to lose
Bring money to spend and somebody to lend
And some worthwhile money not twenties and tens
Get took for your tuck right in front of your 'hens
Who coulda help you nigga, not none of ya friends
Because, I put a black fist under ya chin
Have your physical remains found under the pen
If I'm coming up in the place, I'm coming to win
Wasn't in it for a minute, now I'm dumbin' again
'Riq geez ock, y'all can chat what y'all please
Receive what I'm gonna give back to y'all please
'Cuz y'all don't really wanna get clapped with all these
My man, you can take y'all strap when y'all leave
You see the squad come in the place, they all freeze
Ice cold, with his mellow cool breeze
MCs, never showed loyalty yet
Kool Herc ain't never get a royalty check
I do work, no question, and bomb your set
I'm calm collect, sharp like my name Gillette
RIP my man Gillette
Until I touch the mic, y'all people ain't seen danger yet
I'm a decorated vet, I regulate and wreck
Never hesitated yet, I'm gettin' heavy weighted checks
If you would dare ask if I'm dedicated - yes
I spit, live rounds that would penetrate a vest
Nigga, take ya seats I'm a demonstrate a test
How to freak the beats, so gangsta fresh
And it thump, from the east coast to Bangladesh
Big bank, willy gank smoke the thing to death
But hold tight, cuz it's not over yet
I don't even feel like I'm not sober yet
And it ring like shots in the projects new year's eve
And it ain't even October yet
I'm a big bounty hunter like Boba Fett
Y'all more shell shocked then a soldier get
If the prize in my sights then I'm goin' for this
Whoo whoo 'riq geez be the ultimate
I'm the corporate, give me the bulk of this
'Riq set it on the magnetic ultra tip
Get down how you 'posed to get
I got nothing to lose, I'm a killer with no regrets
I'm like young LL, cuz I'm hard as hell

Reed pipe but deed tight, disposition keep on flipping
Keep em playing they position
Keep making the people listen what I spin
Put em out on a limb
Got tears, got blood, got sweat, leaking out of the pen
Y'all fake niggas not setting a trend
We never listen to them
It's like trying to take a piss in the wind
My home team doing visitors in, yo don't test em
They all standing close to the edge, so don't stress em

Yeah Illadelph, home of the original gun clappers
Out on the wrong corner your shit'll get spun backwards
You got the fool wanting the rules, enter at risk
Or your own nana'll keep a gat under the mattress
Shorties running reckless from Philly to Texas
Surprising what niggas willing to do to get a neckless
Some emotions felt better left unexpressed at times
Niggas' crime record longer than a guest list
Yes, I done seen things you wouldn't believe
Seen people reach levels thought they'd never achieve
Silhouettes waiting in the wings ready to D
Thirst decise or need at least a buck to breathe
C'mon! Stick up kids, they be out to tax
Most times they be sticking you without the gats

On stage wit the planet in the palm of my hand
When a brother transform, from aynonomous man
To the force, crush whoever might of thought I was playin'
I'ma flame some, sentence the shit, the cold twist to slang
Thicker than big boy baby, mom, sister pain
Beyond measure, relaxed under pressure
You see the master piece, but to me it's unperfected
Give it here Geffen Records, I'm off the handle
Cut the check, and yo it better be as heavy as anvil
Next joint comin', all bets is canceled
Nigga black ink, red was a G financial
We finna have the whole industry at a stand still
See me put the system on lock like can pill
So get wit them endorsements, and call reinforcements

So push another slice into your toast and tighten your vests

I give you somethin' high voltage double dosage
Runnin' with these vultures givin' me ulcers

The super black man runnin' wit a S on his chest
And stand for the straight struggle to escape the stress
You think it's sweet tryin' to eat, you ain't taste this yet
So make y'all steps precautious into the darkness
Thoughts cold and heartless makin' me nauseous
Gettin' more remorses for what I done
If the lawyers and courts wonder what I run

How you a gangster and you scared to bust your gun
For the call, trust your fam' and trust nobody at all

A gladiator in a colliseum ready for war
That old timer holdin' his revolver set to blow
Just like a gladiator at whoever stick his head in the door
And one who been through it all, anything go
Rather give it to you straight 'stead of speakin in codes
'Cause man, that bullshit can get you riddled with holes
If you ain't insured than the hospitals is close
You got to go up-town while ya leakin' on the ground
In cases like these, you need to duck down
You're five dollar toys, I'm a million dollar man

That's for certain nigga, Ted Turner, Nat Turner, nigga Ike Turner
The raw sojourner for truth
The mic burner

[Chorus]

Mic malevolence defies violence I inherited
Others just rentin' it like rooms at the Sheraton
I gotta jones like Vanessa in the devil in-
And y'all cold like a show in the Netherlands

Cold shoulders and frozen aortic valves -
So I don't form pals - conform to norms - morals different
Gifted - use it to shift shit a mutant shape shifter when I spit it I'm liquid
You could lick a million shots at the character of the body shell

They'll just richochette nigga aura's hard as hell
Before there was ain't hard to tell
The mic's cycle coincided right with mine as well
Since a minor I walked with the spine upstraight

I learned to rhyme to feed the dinner plate
I scraped barrel - even dined up on wine and steaks
'Cause in the bone same marrow that apartheid chased
The narrow margin with the haves and the have nots

Will get smaller as I approach - so watch your stash box
Fox logo if your fave is local
Get bruised till you're the color of the Laker's logo
This is work niggas

[Chorus]

I made it - ain't nobody believe in me
But this rap game is like selling coke legally
Ain't no innovations - that takes concentration
nigga's celebrating not knowing the time they wasting

Killin' mics is one of my aesthetics
Rip very live so I'm an entertainer like Cedric
Shit they play on radio's now give me a headache
Can't slow me down I know where I'm headed

The profit on kill if you let it
nigga's feeling energetic
want to rumble - guns will come out
Here come the paramedics

I'm just trying to live like I've Devin
Tired of my people failin'
We all sin - the devil, what di I tell em
Somebody gotta get their hands dirty and shoes muddy

I see things vividly, y'all vision is blurry
Even if you hate - through my music you gone love
Everybody with me and they was with me when it was ugly

Don't blink, Black Ink has arrived, all rise
Rudebwoys keep dem thing at your side, be alright
Muh'fuckers Philly we up in here, we all live
I'm puffin this Cohiba mami coolin' her heels
All she ever seem to do is play it cool f'real
She be pushin', pop vessel, and her shoes is ill
But her hand, keep slippin on the woodgrain wheel
But it's cool, we never slippin' when there's moves to make
Especially when what we talkin' ain't ya usual cake
I pump bass for y'all bathin' apes, to get charged
Nah, I'm not a dealer, I'm a poet at large
We in the wind with the roof back, lettin' the breeze hit us
The bathrobe on with sweatpants and slippers
Comin' to pay a visit to whoever on the hit list
Some of y'all been tryin' for years, you'll never get this fool

Hip-Hop my main bitch, I got a few on the side
The game stitched y'all I'm doin' my job
Go up against enormous odds
Wouldn't break a sweat, money make her bet
Funny son you threat, well I ain't shakin' yet
Twenty-fo'/sev' chillin', tougher than penicillin
From the block where the crooked cops killin' like a villain
Children, in the hood gettin' rocked by they buildings
And brothers, 'cross the board gettin' knocked by the millions
The stress, got me ignitin' the potent marijuana leaf
Tryin' to play it cooler than a polar bear colony
You feel the music know I'm over there probably
Pimpin on the same system that forever shorted me
I got the soul of a young Sam Cooke when I spit
It make you want to make a new dance up
It's all to the good shorty 'gwan do that stuff
It's not another sound system rockin steady as us
And it's cool

Yeah, when I'm crusin' in my vehicle, the chase harass me
They never ride past me, they really comin' at me right
They want to know where the drugs guns and cash be
Probably want to get me to run, so they can blast me
Just, blast me in your box, play my shit
I know it's crowded at the top, cause I'm on the tip
And that's as high up at the top, as a brother could get
And how I do it make a lot of muh'fuckers upset
But it's fine, re-gizzlin' I'm back for mine
In case y'all gettin' tired of the same ol' shine
And I'm calm, calculated and perfectly aligned
The way I'm operatin' what is a surgery of rhyme
It's not a thang when I lower the gradient lens frames
I'm cooler than Clyde Stubblefield, drummer for James
Hip-Hop is out of Hustleville, comin' for change
I exercise 'til a muscle build, breakin' the chains
And I'm cool

The Roots,"Why?

Sky's the limit so you know I'm gonna rise and shine
I gotta do my thing, I'm kinda getting a little tired of all that's hidden
That's the reason I'm a speak my mind, keep from going insane
Now work with it, we in the last innin'
The world keeps spinnin', my peoples steady losin' while the rich keep winnin'
It's like we neva smilin' and the devil steady grinnin'
Killin' what we representin'
Even our children and women, 2K4, livin' above and under the law
Young teen joins the marines, says he'll die for the core
Inducted up into the government's war as if the land of money and oil
Funny how ain't none of it yours
I can't sleep yo I'm paranoid, it's code orange
It's far from right, I guess that's why it feels so wrong
To see the world get stripped out of every resource
And people pray to Coca-Cola now instead of the gods
What's goin' on?

Why

Keepin' your head above water, hustlin' to survive
Some people chasin' a dream, others just chasin' a high
Some people blind leading the blind, they chasin' a lie
Some people chokin' backs broken barely makin' it by
But still they workin' all they live, they pushin' for the light
Givin' everything they got to stitch them swishes on ya Nike's
Puttin' pockets on our jeans, mining diamonds for them rings
Rewarded with small change and bullets in the brains
And it makes me feel strange everything we take for granted
At times I feel stranded on this planet of mine
Now should I pull the hammer, clap it out, and laugh about it
Or stand up, be counted while I cast my ballot
When the undertaker's busy and the prison's is crowded
People livin' in fear because they vision is clouded
But the sky's the limit, I ain't cryin' you a river
Gotta move me a mountain, I'm a git up and shout it

Why?

When I dream it's hounds on my heels gainin' momentum
I'm tired, can't get uninspired or quit runnin'
I can feel they only inches behind, I escape, I survive
Some how I gotta decide how much I want it
Or is anybody listenin' without a pot to piss in
If I disappear I wonder if the world will know I'm missin'
Who my support system, it's not the court system
Gotta letter it said that you're not avoiding prison
People 'neath the microscope 'cause we defining the culture
They smile and insult you like you shinin' their loafers
Them old heads say we need a modern day Moses
When the leaders is posers we needing some soldiers
It's the X generation, the anger is a nature
Got the writing on the wall so clear that I can taste it
Like a kid sniffing glue somewhere trying to escape
Cause we vulnerable and naked
Gotta show 'em we can make it

That's the way it is, when ya gotta be 
Indeed as I distort I proceed, I need 
Gettin' hotter than sacks of boom, in my room at the Ramada 
Four tanks in your memory banks to fill up 
I provide the static, with scratch to match, while you catch the vibe 
Most can play high post, but yo that don't mean shit 
Because my click'll make a motherfucker sick 
I flips, redder than pork, comin' to New York to mix 
[It's Bob Powers] With the snares and kicks to fix 
Rhythmically, you got ta be, static-why 
Magically I appear, spark a L and drink a beer 
With air smooth, takin' niggaz loot with dice 
Then shoot The Roots, poetic, courageously kinetic 
Vagabond, versatile and various, plus rap styles 
Of mine are blunt, pain is in the mind, so I'm fine and five 
Foot seven, inches in height 
My mission to strike mics and lighten your tights 
Ridin' in, like lightning 
Fluorescent, incandescent, effervescently 
I represent, Foreign Objects and Ill Elements 
Very relevant, plus intelligently managin matter 
That's makin' tracks fatter, revolve around 
Saturn like rings and brins swings when I sings with bass 
Then distort up in your face like mace 
Bustin your dreams, I gasp with loaded magazines 
I'm on the rap scene, re-color fellas like a vaccine 
As I, rocks from under blunderin' I'm not, lyrically 
Ya getm, shot, get caught so distort with thought, for real 
It's the illest out the Phi, short for Philidelph-iada-fly 
Money makin' move fakin' I isn't 
Niggaz can nah front, I'm poetically exquisite 
Wicked, with the visit while you're wonderin' what is it 
Dig it, yo my mellow um whattup for the night

Like that y'all, and yo I'm flowin', my part of the song 
It's goin, it's goin, it's gone 	 

Now, go get your dictionary and your Pictionary 
Cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries 
Words and hers like some cattle in the steeple 
People, there's no equal, or no sequel 
SO policies, of equalities, get abolished 
Demolished, distortion of the static's gettin' polished 
Urges of splurge and words will just be merged 
Together, damn it's quite clever, however 
You never, can sound alike, lyrics don't be poundin' like 
These, troops, who be's, Roots 
Insult ya, mellow of culture, rhythmical vulture 
Approach ya, with Magnetic shit that's Ultra 
I make MC's dangle like a bangle 
Strangle from every angle, my lingo hingles and it jangles 
Under Kangols, nahh them niggaz don't want to tangle 
Cause Roots get loose, negroes get juiced like the mango 
To be particular, extra-curricular, for pleasure 
Measure, in any weather, value more than the treasure

The Roots,"Here's what you want right, here's what you need right
We got to give you more of what you're lookin' for

So it's a secret that's been pent up inside for years
Exclusive type, only for your eyes and ears
You held it in for so long, you busted into tears
The letters spilled slowly across the page like a world premiere

Well I ain't, the bullshit begins here
The obvious cause, the effects is unclear
The punishment for crimes of the heart could be severe
Though to keep it on the low is a heavy cross to bear

You deep now, submerged with no signs of air
Still your sunken heart thumpin' like the kick in a snare
While on the surface it's all turnin' to a circus
That's why you're nervous, and you got a right to be

'Cause if somebody woulda done that shit to me
I mean my best man hittin' my wife to be
My sentiments exactly would be history
Why'know what I'm sayin' my peoples in the place, let's hit it off, one two

Here's what you want right, here's what you need right
We got to give you more of what you're lookin' for
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]

Yo, it's like nothin' changed, it's all the same thang
The same characters in a book, with different names
It's a lot more to lose than you got to gain
You a lot more confused than hip to the game

The peep the script of the game the price is pain
Men and women get into things, now who's to blame?
When everybody whisperin' 'bout whatever took place
And how the fact twist a knot with a straight face

And lies, hard to swallow from the bitter taste
Well that's a point in the past that can't be erased
So motivate, though it's hard to let it ride
Or set aside true feelings, underhand dealings

Our lost trust, I wonder if we lost us
It's bigger than me and you, it's monstrous
So I'ma, just calm down and try to relax
Before I clap [Incomprehensible]

Here's what you want right, here's what you need right
We got to give you more of what you're lookin' for
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]

If you could only flash back and undo our actions
Change what happens, dissect the fractions
A time to rewind and be recorded absent
For real 'cause these memories is photographic

Pornographic, pushing me close to madness
Head heavy like I'm trippin' on acid tablets
Yesterday as I recall was all fabulous I thought so
But now it feel like shots hittin' my torso

Spent a lotta time and trust in the wrong place
Fought a lotta fights rollin' with the wrong ace
Love, stronger than pride, we could end disgrace
I need, room the think, and space to ventilate

Was solid as a rock, shall not disintegrate
Thoughts racing like the lunatics on the interstate
For real, ya, it's ill, ya, my peoples in the place
I got to go

Here's what you want right, here's what you need right
We got to give you more of what you're lookin' for

Ladies and Gentlemen 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain, 'gain 
Yo, adrenaline 

Yo, I'm in the eye of the storm where the pressure's on 
And MC's are dressed funny like a leprechaun 
I chop rappers like chicken suizceiun 
Send a squad off like a slave auction 
Yo my zodiac sign read caution 
On stage, I'll make your seed to an orphan 
Yo, my agent have to break equation 
Niggas want some? I hit 'em with a portion 
Son of fifth foursome, armed at the door, son 
In milita, Dice Raw quick draw, son 
You don't want no more son? That's when more come 
And drag a nigga Eerie avenue to Oregon, you're all done 
Ladies and Gentlemen, select a weapon at the gate 
Upon enterting The Roots' instruemtalin' 
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit 
We hit 'em like The L on 60th and Market 
South Philly click will hold it til a nigga park it 
Take sneaks, chains and rings and braclets 
Split back, just like we the therapist 
Adrenaline, fifth mic terrorist 
Once again 

[Chorus] 

Nigga, nigga, niggas tryin' to get a grip 
Bu still slip, so lift me up 
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt 
You get to know me, you'll poke me slowly 
When caught fussin' 
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't 
Punked 'em with the dozen 
The pellets all in they skellet 
Transform from the norm, start the brainstorm 
Yeah, Malik be	 from The Roots, he ain't gone 
I took the wrong exit, the sings to lay on 
I'm trapped up in about five worlds with live pearls 
Shouts to armour and ??? whose name Jahlil 
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand in 
Demandin', taking you back like Knots Landing 
And Ralph Cramden, we out, you'll see in Hampton 
Yo, what what what what what what the...? 
I get wicked on this concrete earth until I rot 
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet 
But still I rock once again 

[Chorus] 

Beans passed the mac and we held 'em, like hostages 
Rappers see me hide they face, like ostriches 
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages 
Under water rap, you know who the bosses is 
North Philly, baby, that's where that raw shit is 
You get blown out the sky once you get talkin' it 
Hey, take the vibe raw, I fathered it 
And when you see me on the street don't bother kid 
Just be on your merry way or you might get slit 
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did 
Lay you on floors like you gettin' carpeted 
You need a special kind of mic, for retarded kids 
Me against you's like Kang vs. The Partridges 
Want to battle? change your name to the forfeiters 
Cause that's what you do, faced to face with raw niggas 
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters 
Once again 

[Chorus] 

They used to talk shit, but I'm a quiet 'em 
Kick in the door with my boys, stick to fryin' 'em 
First nigga that flinch, I'm a fire him 
Tape him up, grip his hands, and plyer them 
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em? 
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in 
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em 
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him 
Paid a front row seats, watchin' Iverson 
First class air crash when I'm flyin' in 
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them 
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them 
Used to shotgun in cars that I'm drivin' 'em 
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' 'em 
Run all up in yo' spot with Rob and 'em 
Grew up, two-four, with Pry and 'em 
But do my dirt, twenty first, with Kyle and them 
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them 
Brother knews, nigga schooled Marly Park and them 
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em 
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them 
Tore their body all up, ain't no chalkin' 'em 
To sharp for them, move out in the dark on 'em 
These Illadel' foul streets when I'm stompin' 'em

Tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
If you want to be high
Tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly

Yo - I don't really know but somebody said
That the O.G. flow, it could fuck witcha head
And the po-lice know that the green black and red
Too strong to con-trol, they study what I said

Dig it - my name is 'Riq, and when I'm on the mic
I'm known to spit somethin that these MC's hate
I couldn't care less what you feel what you say
'Cause I gotta put it to you in my own special way - I'm a MONSTER!

You know I'm certified sick
I came from the corner where nobody got shit
Took the cards I was dealt, turned it into hot spit
Now I'm not only a passenger, I'm in the cockpit

Been a long time comin, I was caught in the scramble
Of cats, tryin to do the same thing that they man do
Eagles born to fly, real is made to ramble
""A Dangerous Mind,"" I'm a prime example

You need to fall back, could be NARC's around us
You in a hot area for marchin powder

Them real crook brothers don't talk about it
They never make a move 'til they thought shit out kid
I knew a lot of men who did bids for mayhem
They made a lot of money, they money never made them

The game of survival is filled with rivals
Knives and fo'-five slugs flyin in spirals
The wicked is diseased and it ain't all viral
Could be greed and gluttony bubblin inside you

Dawg, follow your pride, the rhythm'll guide you
Yo, follow them guys, them niggaz'll rob you
And have you up in somethin that don't' really involve you
But you don't give a fuck you want to pump the volume, I know

Don't come 'round me sparks and waste time frontin

It ain't really bout nothin - Philly just love cuttin
They shut shit down before the law start shuttin
Get your route right cousin - be out nightclubbin relaxed
And want to get lights out tonight brother, perhaps

It's the percussion that keeps shit, kinetic

She don't want no rock-n-roll
She want platinum or ice or gold
She want a whole lotta somethin' to fold
If you a obstacle she just drop ya cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad
In these streets she done ran
E'er since when the heat began
I told the girl look here
Calm down I'ma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan
Cause you is quick to learn
And we can make money to burn
If you allow me the latest game
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name

Fertilize another behind my lover's back

I never played the fool
Matter fact I be keepin' it cool

Who came up poor, grits and government cheese
The only thing I ever really loved in my life, was a mic

Work the bass, nigga, juggle them keys
I'm tryin'a get a piece of this government green
And smack 'em in the melon with another LP
C'mon, help a couple people in the struggle get free
We from the block, where people stay prepared to rock
And it's hard, 'cause opportunity be scared to knock
And mo' people in the 'hood found dead from cops
Than guns that drop, that sprayed off random shots
But what'cha know good, people say they in the hood fo' good
You ain't a prisoner, the world got mo' to it
Sky's the limit, it don't take but a minute
Don't fear for your people, nigga, my hood's yo hood

Can't Stop This, I want my peoples to rock this
Bang this music in your speakers and boxes
Legs and users, 'bout as a deep as my thoughts is
Sit back and I'mma paint you a portrait
This stuff can make you think you are lost
This shit can have you exhausted
Just, picture the planet and imagine it's yours, kid
Don't ever let nobody knock you outta your orbit
I never seen a bridge we couldn't shuffle across it
We got a lotta people livin' a life, that's pure trivia
Real hip hop, I ain't tryin'a get rid of ya
Can't have that, because here come, the city of Philly
Put an end to all the trivia, really
Where I'm walkin' everybody ain't pretty or friendly
It's work, my whole life they ain't give me a penny
Comin' up between a rock and a hard, watchin' for God

Speakin' my mind for every day that's on the calendar
Cause I'll'a been quiet, about as long as I can handle it

The stages I'm seen on, mic I fiend on

Looking over mad years worth of photographs
Pictures of some places I ain't never going back
Some people I used to love, why I ain't show them that?
The skies was overcast, when I was sober last
My head is spinning, couldn't tell you if it's slow or fast
It's starting to get too clear, I got to go and grass
To y'all it's a shame but life is what we know it as
Waiting, navigating the plot, without plans
In the car, it's hard to read as a clock with no hands
How your man's goin' get up and stop with no yams
All it take is one break, it could pop the program
Whether sinning or not, my back bending like I'm sentenced a lot
I feel some brothers is beginning to plot
It might have been a close friend I forgot
Who started up and ain't remember to stop
I bet these niggas going remember the shop

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know

Yo, I'm like Malcolm out the window with the weapon out
Searching for somehow to find a minute or the second now
Precious time is money that I ain't got to mess about
Need it from the horse's mouth or from my eye with less account
Lessons with my back to the wall, scoping my session out
Stay a little edgy at times when I ain't stressing bout
Haters don't know shit about me, they the ones that talk shit
Those that love me send it out, so I ain't got to force quit
Cause I'm doing better now, don't mean I never lost shit
I was married to a state of mind and I divorced it, man
I'm from where brothers moving product from the porches
People locking their doors, clutching to their crosses
The block hot by the law, there ain't too many choices
So what I do is for y'all, there ain't too many voices left
I watch my back, and watch my step
And I might forgive, but I will not forget come on

The blind leading the blind
Some call it evolution, some say intelligent design
You say you want a revolution, you out of your mizind
Your sons' destitute, and their pops all in the prison

He just attracted to scam, he right back in the can
I never sleepwalking, you dig
You get your shuteye
I'm on the first thing in, I'm leaving on the red-eye
My brother back in rehab, just had another relapse
But fin himself, it's been like he's been fighting an energy
Half telling me nobody true when they pretend to be that
So closer than friends, that's where I keep my enemy at
To many parties concerned, it's time to live it and learn
Until we're able to grow, forever bridges we burn
My thoughts free as a bird, that's just about to emerge
And every action is heard, it speaks louder than words, yo

But it's still coming across like the bridge and tunnel vision

And pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid?
When the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare

It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense

I stand where the people got the heat in they pockets
You mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness
I spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit

Worldwide, we coincide with who suffering
Who never had shit and ain't got nothing
But more struggling, it makes you wanna run up in the motherfuckin'
Hot zone for a piece of the cake back
I can't work for it, I can certainly take that
I'm fired up, thinking about the payback, ASAP
You fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black
Ill, but that's too real for TV
It's crazy when you too real to be free

The Roots,"Yeah, I'm from the illest part of the Western Hemisphere
So if you into sight seein' don't visit there
It's somewhere between Jersey and Delaware
Philly never scared and them niggas ain't timid there
Them young triggers lose lives by the minute there
It might start but the fight never finish there
They all fucked up tryin' to get the gingerbread
A few stacks be the price for a nigga's head
Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians
Clips and revolvers and George's and Benjamin's
A celebration of the loss of your innocence
To you old self you've lost any resemblance
They say the city make a dark impression
The youth just lost and they want direction
But they don't get the police, they get the protection
And walk around with heat like Charlton Heston, man

It's in the music, turn it up let it knock
Let it bang on the block till the neighbors call the cops
The cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit
They don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid
It's in the music, turn it up let it knock
Let it bang on the block till the neighbors call the cops
The cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit
They don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid
It's all in the music

It's kinda ill how we grip these bitches in the Bonneville
It's kind of a thrill, my mind it will spill, my nine it will kill
Of course bro like crossbow, I bring the force though
Hittin' your guts splittin' your torso
It's colder than the North Pole livin' unlawful
I'm giving you a jawful Of somethin' awful
Yo my theoretic is leaded, Will come and set it
The shit bang and leave you diabetic for paramedics
I spit flames and get dames to get change
With pit bull bark and lock the shock
Don't bother me Och, don't you dare lie to me Och
I don't know, who's this nigga that you try to be Och
Benefit of doubt had me think you in it for clout
Big shit, send it for route and finish him out
Joints stiff from rigor mortise
While we swimmin' in waters, women with daughters
Will have us niggas sinnin' with orders

It's in the music, turn it up let it knock
Let it bang on the block till the neighbors call the cops
The cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit
They don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid

Yo, they got high-powered lenses on the cameras outside
It ain't nowhere to run it ain't hardly nowhere to hide
They hear you when you whisperin' so try to keep quiet
You don't even realize that you's a twinkle in the all, seein' eye
From the time you in the bar gettin' high
To havin' conversations on your phone through the wire
You can drive but it's definitely footage of your ride
Livin in this day and time, it's a funny kind of vibe
From the corners of the ceiling feel its eyes in back of me
I couldn't tell you why I think they constantly after me
Maybe it's cause the news put it to me so graphically
How niggas don't obey no laws, not even gravity boy
No benefit of doubt he had to be from
He from the corner where they known to get they casualty on
Another day another scene to perform, spotlight him on Friday
Come and lock him up Saturday morn, c'mon

Struck by the luck of the draw
Real life preservation
What I'm hustling for
My name black thought
The definition of raw
I was born in South Philly
On a cement floor
I had nothing at all
Had to knuckle and brawl
They swore I'd fall
Be another brick in the wall
Another life
Full of love
That lost
That's silly
This Philly
Y'all really ain't stoppin'
The boy with the pen
Like Willie
On top of the hall
Pure soul is what the city
Most popular for
Hear the tones
That will ease you
Smooth
As Bunny Sigler's soundtrack
Keepin' your head boppin' and all
It's something in the water
Where I come from
They used to sing it on the corner
Where I come from
Making somethin' outta nothing
Because everybody fifty cents
From a quarter
Where I come from
Yeah
The streets ain't timid
But I feel at home in it
Gotta see a couple people
I ain't got at
In a minute
Yeah
You can take a brother outta South Philly
Can't take it outta him really
I forever represent it
And it's

Listening to Ultramagnetic
Ego tripping you won't
Pressure my word
I'm the urban vision
Of you chump
Stomped on a different ground
Sound second to none
Synthesizers tweet
To improvise your feet
I calculated every lyric to arrive on a beat
It's free
Come get high on me
Before a nine millimeter shell
Hit my pelle pelle

Where I come from
It's just a natural reaction
For crack to make it happen
Let the pen ink sink
Into the paper of the pad
Think back
When I was younger
Ghetto could have took me under
Young Peedi can't mess with North Philly
Never had
You don't know about me
You ain't stroll my streets
Look familiar
I feel ya
Longtime no see

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Clap somethin'
But whatever you clap
Clap to the record spinnin'
While I'm takin' you back
To the top paper era
Baby big on that
Picture the pool room
Where the money getters was at
And street people
With feather in the cap
Or their bossolino pullin' paper
As if it's a small casino
I was a young boy
Sweepin' the floors
And runnin' to stores
But all those old heads
Would talk to me About the way
To clutch the eagle
On a buck and truck
And if I'm down
How to get back up
Just survival kid
And it's a struggle worldwide
I'm positive
Shit the ghetto might as well
Be the Gaza Strip
You know where all the monsters is
Street walkers
You don't see no consciousness I'm coming back to where

We on the job again
Y'all know what time it is

Get somebody else involved right next to ya
Y'all elected me to keep it so fresh for ya
Just cause I make it possible for the rest of ya
To just take it there come on and
Get your head ringin' from the sting of the snare
Spine tingle elevating every singular hair
All the way from South Philly on a wing and prayer
And still bringin' it yeah

C'mon take it there, let's take it there

I'm from the side of town
Where shots get sprayed around
Where the expectancy rate be twenty-eight around
Downtown battleground where cops parade around
Have your whole view of life beyond jaded
How everybody sick of breaking down, tryin' a make it out
Hand over fist the only way to get the paper down
People tired of gettin' pushed around, gettin' gangsta now
Discipline the only way to bring some kinda change around
Chain cirgarette smokin' with bad nerves
And brothas with bad lungs from smokin' mad herb
Whoever in the dark is unseen and heard
Let's submerge, I can feel something close we on the verge
Talkin' bout, to my street sweepers, hotel housekeepers
And my people spillin' this out through jail house speakers
Some people rather use than might than use heaters
Some people rather lose they life than lose freedom
For real

C'mon take it there, let's take it there

Flash light, red light, proceed ahead right
Straight into them headlights, you get your head right
Head right get a third strike, hit the turnpike
Life quicker than spliff that wouldn't burn right
Make you wanna holla 'bout it
It ain't no doubt about it
Every now and then you gotta stand up and shout about it
And I'll be shoutin' it to, as if a shout'll count
Yo they got accountin' to do, reamount the balance
The shit more puzzlin' than a jigsaw
Raw pitbulls hustlin' through the pitfalls
Some of y'all toys let the laughter rip roar
Heart felt truth in every lyric I spit forth
Raise up time to lift off
Written on a legal pad, poetry that sizzle the clip board
My og, my homey who taught me deal
Said in prayer that's the only time you should ever kneel
And that's real, I'm a take it there

The Roots,"I woke up in the darkness at twelve seventeen, to shots and sirenes
Look out the window, peep the high beams
Now, they searchin', the cops lookin' for the person
That pulled the trigga

Medical figures is nursin' the kid that got shot
Some innocent ak, that would front
To flip the rock on them, at King Street block
I tried to tell him to stop 'cuz yo, it's ghetto red hot

Similar to the blood, now floodin' his top
I take a step out the spot, to the point of attack
And see the shorty, wop heart blast, out his back
Damn, I'm thinkin', it don't cease, it's no more peace

Police level increase but what the fuck
It's still crime on the streets
I can't breathe, now what's goin' on?
One minute you alive, the next, you're gone

Illadel P H I A, hell
Bust off into the heavens, for the nigga, who fell
And hit the L, for the niggaz, who fell
When that could have been prevented

In front of the flat, your moms rented
And no one expect that from you, 'cuz you was timid
Fuckin' with them, cats from outside city limits
Funny, how this whole thing changed, an off minute

And that's the reason we livin' where they don't wanna visit
Where the dope slang and keep swayin' like Sonny Liston
The money missin' and there's mouths to feed
Yet the brain kickin', thinkin' of a thousand things
Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs
And pancakes, thicken and greens and Kool Aid
When the 'fridgerator naked then the cupboard is bare
People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air
Wasn't lies when they told you wasn't nothin' to fear
Somethin' don't feel right out here, know what im sayin'? Check it out

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Look, my eyes open cause I'm really a rocksmith
And when inviting me thoughts, I'm really unboxin'
My main adversary in this silly concoction
Freeze your face like bosilium toxin
If you ain't tryin' to get popped, then give me a option
Helicopters choppin' from Philly to Compton
The Jones is the richest since the Smiths & the Johnson's
If you ain't sayin' nothin', you a system's accomplice
It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense
I'm overseeing anything within my circumference
This ain't a press junket, I ain't seekin' responses
I stand where the people got the heat in they pocket
You mesmerized by the calm nonchalant-ness
I spit a dart, rub on some John Hitchcock shit
If you ain't speakin' your life, your rhyme's adopted
If it don't feel right, then stop it, you nahmsayin'?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yo, field you work in, weapon producin'
Natural disaster got the planet in a panic
We all gots to make that livin'
Sex, drugs, murder, politics and religion
Forms of hustlin', watch who you put all your trust in
Worldwide, we coincide with who sufferin'
Who never had shit and ain't got nothin'
But most strugglin', and make you wanna run up in the ma' fuckin'
With hots on for a piece of the cake back
I can't work for it, I can certainly take that
I'm fired up, thinkin' about the payback, except
You fuck around and be a enemy of the state, black
I'll, but that'd be too real for TV
It's crazy when you too real to be free
If you ain't got no paper then steal this CD
Listen man, I'll let you know how it feel to be me, it don't feel

With hammers on their waist, yeah, waste rare niggas
And I race scared niggas, them snake head niggas
That take care of niggas who don't break bread with us
Niggas make dead niggas and hate black niggas
Brown niggas high yellow niggas and them red niggas
No telling when the bullet coming, be prepared niggas
Cause when it do it coming land, sea and air niggas
That's everywhere niggas, Am I the motherfucking legendary?
Yeah niggas, make it very clear niggas
Been looking at y'all in my rearview
Mirror niggas want to be a millionaire, I'm already there niggas
I'm the definiere nigga, a bear taking more than my share
Lookee here, yeah, I know it ain't fair nigga
Neither is a bar even with a hair trigger
Haystack, try and find a needle up in there nigga
Leave you up in there nigga, show me the puppet
That don't need a puppeteer nigga, shed another tear nigga
I'm in the field with a shield and a spear nigga
I'm in your girl with her heels in the air nigga
I am such a fair nigga, you in a battle telling
Me you not ready like you figured I'ma bear with you
I don't care nigga, you now listening to the sounds
Of the money making jam trillionaires nigga
Gentlemen of an extraordinary league
You never see me blowing on no ordinary weed
What I'm smoking ain't a product of no ordinary seed
Your boy is heavy treed, I'm feeling merry
As a Tyler Perry scene, that monetary gang green
We tried to launder the cash and never came clean
So now I'm in the story with all the cats before me
And smoke purgatory for doing the same thing
And them niggas ain't change, them niggas can't change
Their moms shake their heads saying it's such a dang shame
The train to the buck, did another dang plan
My stage and my government ain't the same name
I'm a rock star, love it that my wallet chain hang
I'm a modern day saint, I'm a modern day kane
My definition I can finally explain
Cold smooth like that dude Sean Connery was playing
I just got to be the man, I'm the father figure and
When I spit it's something like a psychology exam
If you stand where I stood, you could probably understand
How that mic feeling like a million dollars in my hand
It's the silence of the lamb, go and cop another gram
And twist with your zanny, work your set, work it down
What's your net working plan? You better look alive
Cuz them niggas outside looking desperate again nigga
And the blunts and liquor killing our lungs and liver
The asthmatic drug addict I function with it
I put a rapper in a hole where the dust will sit
For spitting played out patterns that once was hitting
I got news for you all, let me show you how to ball
See the legendary fall? I ain't heard of that
Y'all niggas is off the wall like Aresnio Hall
I'ma put you right back where the dirt is at
450 Fahrenheit on the thermostat
Somebody starving like a white girl runnin' that
But she not a earner yet, she couldn't put in no work,
Not earning that, the black microphone murder vet
I'm in a class of my own,
If I got beef with you, you the last one to know
I arrive on time, I'm never fashionable
You late, I'm already international-able
I done toured to Berlin, banged in Beijing
You never seen nothing can't say the same thing
Tell somebody Black Thought, yeah you know the name ring
So give him the game ring for bringing what them niggas can't bring
My hustle is long, my muscle is strong
My man put the paper in the duffel I'm gone
Y'all still a light year from the level I'm on
Just a pawn stepping right into the head of the storm
You been warned, I will blow y'all niggas and disintegrate

Monday they predict the storm
Tuesday they predict the bad
Wednesday they cover the grass
And I can see it's all about cash
And they got the nerve to hunt down my ass
And treat me like a criminal

[Black Thought]
Look, it is what it is
Because of what it was
I did what I did
Cause it does what it does
I don't put nothin' above
What I am, what I love
My family, my blood
My city and my hood
Hater for the greater good
I'm back from Hollywood
And I ain't changed a lick
Though, I know I probably should
But, what I'm doin' is not a good look
I never did it by the good book, as a lifetime crook
All the petty crime took a toll on me
I look around at my homies that's gettin' old on me
But still somethin' gotta hold on me
Maybe it's faith
If it's comin', yo I'm willing to wait
I'm not runnin', I done ran through the mud
I done scrambled and such
I done robbed an odd job and gambled enough
Till I'm put up in handcuffs
And pissin' in a cup
If there's a God,
I don't know if he listenin' or what

[Chorus]

[Truck North]
Yeah, it is what it is
And that's how it go
Get treated like a criminal
If crime is all you know
Get greeted like a nigga
If a nigga saw your show
A public enemy, to send a eye in the scope
My city like a island where you can't find a boat
Have you wishin' for a raft
And prayin' that hope flows
Some real f'ing things going down low so,
Who lookin' for a chair and some real strong rope
Just to end it all here
Screamin' ""fuck the mayor""
He see the faces at the bottom of the welfare
They act like I'm somethin' to fear
Trapped in urban warfare
And pullin' triggers at a college career
Can't ignore the call of the wild
That's drawin' 'em near
Try to make fast money last long some years
Try to laugh it off
Still couldn't lose the tears
To the rules, I will not adhere
Break the law, yeah

[Chorus]

[Saigon]
Who wanna challenge mine?
I'm sick of St. Valentine
I did the violent crimes
That's why I got this style of rhyme
Seek repentance to spittin' them sentences
To senseless experience is the difference
You can't convince this
In a crime sense, niggas is infants
I'm like a senior citizen
Still livin' but gettin' benefits
Put emphasis on hittin' my nemesis in high percentages
Crooked ass cops is the reason for my belligerence
And it gets deeper than that
Remember nights I used to sleep wit a gat
With a package of crack under my sneaker strap
D's sneak attack and raid me
It took a week for that
Beat the rat, but you're sayin' ""look, he think he the mack""
Fuck yall!
Niggas who thinkin' they might try us
Watch us inside riots
Blue cars and light fires
We already been knocked, scrutinized
Plus, cops rush to brutalize us
America's polluted by lust
Who could I trust?
If I can't trust you, then I might touch you
If I ain't got love for you
Then fuck you!

Regardless, the charges makin' us all targets
All on the red carpet, guns from the black market
Hey who got the politicians in they back pocket

Better deadbolt the door it ain't safe no more

I'm mutated by unknown forces

Reborn removed the gold coins from my eyes
I've been down but now I'm back up
Bout to act up boy you better back up

I crack up when a rapper gets slapped up
Number one reason yall should give rap up
Dice it's mine, I got it all wrapped up

I'm used to the one two check not the one two step
Um strapped I'll leave every cat among you wet
Now lets go! you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show I start it with a can I get a ho and the hoes go retarded
The popo tape off the stage for caution, its badlands north philly get it in!

I can't help it, maybe I'm selfish,
Maybe the way I'm running is becoming a hell freeze,
All I can see is smoke from tortoise shells that sell shit
50's I feel like I'm making a sales pitch,
My head already so heavy its making the scales tip,
I got my own pressure and got everyones elses,
I'm rehabilitating and still feeling rebellious,
Candidate of heart failure more pills than Elvis,
In a layer cake, half chocolate half velvet,
I'm listening to some howe Melvin,
I got so many options theres so many toxins yo,
Didn't really tell what we killing ourselves with,
I lit a cigarette and then held it,
I'm thinking of some rhymes more illa than a threatin' illment,
I'm on some bomb threat in the mail shit,
Because of all things I dealt with, nigga I can't help it

I never said I'm ready to die, but I accept it,
Never said I""m ready for war, but I'm protected,
I don't even know when its coming but I expect it,
Lost thoughts innocent hopes an now I'm left with
Nervous conditions, addictions, in addition
To prisons that mixed in to the wrong crowd,
My life is on a flight that going down,
My mother had an abortion for the wrong child,
With the time I felt loved, thats gone now,
Thats replaced with purples rays some storm clouds,
Misery love Misery, so why make friends lets make enemies,
An now I got a habit thats wasn't meant for me,
Now I'm in a marriage that wasn't meant to be,
One more reason to change identity,
The cars, the crime, K's, penalties.

Don't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business
Acting like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets
Shit I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits
White kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping
Or sipping on old English brew or whatever they think we do
Spraying double Uzi's cause you know they think we live in zoos
The problem is with this everyone seems to be real confused
The niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
And watch BET and the crazy shit they see
They associate with you do the same shit to me
When you look at me you see just a nigga from the projects
But can't understand this nigga's mind set but still

Yo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't going be televised
Governments is hellified, taking cake and selling pies
I ain't got a crust or crumb, to get some I'd be well obliged
Murder is co-modified, felon for the second time
Never was I into chasing trouble I was followed by
Facing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride
Vilified, victimized, penalized, criticized
Ran into some people that's surprised I was still alive
Look into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide
Got to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?
Messed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified
Had to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod
Now I'm in the black Impala looking for the dollar sign
Palms get the itching man I got to get the calamine
Before I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5
I will not be conquered by, I will not apologize

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long
So I told her I got something you've been waiting for
I got something you've been waiting for

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying, I walked up and asked what's wrong, she told me that
The radio's been playing the same song all day long
So get your glass lift it up in the toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused with it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We not the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga
Well I'm a downtown shoota who that?
The crown ruler is back
He congruent to the shape of a mack
Look how I do it yo I'm takin' you back
This how you rise down to the foundation how sacred is that?
I'm from the number one place on the map
The generational gap with yet another sensational track
And we don't stress for nothing I just press the button
It's as simple as just makin' it hap
To all the frauds stop fakin' relax
And to the broads if you cakin'
Then clap then shake it without breakin' your back
I know the world been waitin' for that you been aching fa that
Cause what they playin' on the station is wack
And I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less

Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We got the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga so lets go

Hip-Hop ain't dead cause the pulse is in us
I got the everclear flow they mimosa wit it
We are the hope of the culture they posed to listen
And I'm posed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league, I'm Oden wit it
Yet don't owe them niggas nothin' but potent lyrics
But if you ain't gotta dance they revoke your spinnin'
So good rappers ain't eatin' they Olsen twinin'
But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar
With the counterfeit hitters they so so with it but they a Sosa with it.
They Mark McGuire with the writtin' I'm Rodriguez
On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hittin'
This is the trial and error era no co defendant
I push the seed every time like I'm Cody wit it
I said they one hit wonders pneumonia to us
I don't know you niggas hit the road my nigga

Show me where your first impression is at

The real muscle in the message of that
My name trouble I'm a blessin' to rap
And you can check my stats cause worldwide they attesting to that

How I'm like bobby DeNiro Joe Pesc and them cats
Am I the unsung hero oh yes if you askin' anybody that's aware of the classics
They'll tell you I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque my squad? so fresh
You know its Black Thought and your boy the bro Quest, but

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long

So get your glass lift it up and in toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We got the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
So lets go",Rising Up,2008
The Roots,"[Chorus:  Dice Raw]
Days are living fast, moves in misery
You got a song you wanna sing for me
Sing a song, singing man
Sing a song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing a song for me
Sing a song for me

[P.O.R.N.]
Look, I'm so twisted, so, so twisted
One life to live, and I'm willing to risk it
Terror that the world has never known existed
Left so many clues, now how could they miss it?
Sadistic, ballistic, find a word and pick it
Long as it means the world is on my shit list
Walking time bomb, my mind is on tick-tick
Countdown's on, its too late to nix it
I'm so anxious, so, so anxious
The ones I hate barely know what my name is
Have no clue that I'm armed and dangerous
Willing to spill my blood to be famous
Willing to spill my blood to make changes
Look for a suicide note to explain this
Heinous, inking the ache from my anguish
Sounds insane, you're speaking my language

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
One for the pressing, two for the cross
Three for the blessing, four for the loss
Kid holding a weapon, walk like a corpse
In the face of transgression, military issue Kalash
Nikova or machete or a pitchfork
He killing cause he feel he got nothing to live for
In a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor
And never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer
13-year-old killer, he look 35
He changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive
When he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly
He loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes
Who to blame, its a shame, the youth was demonized
Wishing he could see rearrange the truth, to see the lies
And he wouldn't have to raise his barrel to target you
His heart can't give you the years of scar tissue...

[Chorus]

[Truck North]
Uh, what you're witnessing is true dedication
Charged by the call and the cause of the nation
Countdown, minutes away from detonation
A lifetime of grunt work, this is the culmination
My manner, seems patient, inner rage lies
So deep, I can taste it, let's sacrifice lives
Past the first sensation, to paradise I fly
Delusions are lighting up the midday sky
The last days of mine spent in extreme secrecy
Wolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently
Too much faith to be scared, the petrified both fled
Those who live fearing death, might as well be dead
Towers of the occupiers, will soon fall
Martyr or mass murderer? That's your call
Mass transit or a mall? Who can watch them all?
In the name of the merciful, sing me a song

Are-rated show 
[Black Thought]
Yo, She said she was a magazine editor named Jenning 
Backstage in high heels and painted on jeans 
Probably had the most devious eyes I'd ever seen
Told me she was twenty-two she was only seventeen
She had sumthin' to hide she snuck in from outside 
And got everybody gassed like the car I drive
With all that grown lady ass and my for rap vibe
She said she came to see them roots boy fallout live
But listen,

Verse 2 [Black Thought]
You see the girls look good but they brains not ready 
I talk to a woman, he mind more steady 
Probably something in the way they designed just more steady
I just let you recite cause the line so heavy
But I shoulda known better cause now I feel like America's underbelly 
R. Kelly got a smart better less, internet predators, chat-room irregulars
This not my twist 
You trying to send me to the therapist 

[Chorus]

Verse 3: [Black Thought]
Now she told me cheddar cheese grits 
Two tomato fried fish 
Cause she heard its my dish
Tryna be my sidekick 
All the people all around thinking she was my chick 
Saying DAMN the girl thick 
But she ain't no twenty-six
Looking at me like am up to sumthin' on the funny tip 
Like I ever been the one to honey jib
Its your birthday so let me know the gift you wanna get 
In fact blow out the candles on the cake and make a wish for me

They can't really seem to look away 
So they tried asking her to stay

Right now I can only think of one
You look lovely tonight.

My stage and my government ain't the same name

I'm a rock star, love it that my wallet chain hang
I'm a modern day saint; I'm a modern day king
My definition I can finally explain
Cold smooth like that dud Sean Connery was playing

I just got to be the man, I'm the father figure and
When I spit it's something like a psychology exam
If you stand where I stood, you could probably understand
How that mic feeling like a million dollars in my hand

It's the silence of the lamb, go and cop another gram
And twist with your zanny, work your set, work it down
What's your net working plan? You better look alive
'Cause them niggas outside looking desperate again nigga

And the blunts and liquor killing our lungs and liver
The asthmatic drug addict I function with it
I put a rapper in a hole where the dust will sit
For spitting played out patterns that once was hitting

I got news for you all, let me show you how to ball
See the legendary fall? I ain't heard of that

I arrive on time, I'm never fashionable
You late, I'm already international-able

I done toured to Berlin, banged in Beijing
You never seen nothing can't say the same thing
Tell somebody Black Thought, yeah you know the name ring
So give him the game ring for bringing what them niggas can't bring

My hustle is long, my muscle is strong
My man put the paper in the duffle I'm gone

War going on between the West and the East

My lady friend sneaks my beer in the movie
Throw your hands in the air if you the true and living

Nor do I call every nigga, my brother

We operate within this artificial opera
I bring hip hop terror like the Fuhrer, the Ace Ventura into the horror
Laboratory laborer, venture beyond the border
I'll structure a style, destroy your whole aura
Plus you're adrenalin'll rise before your eyes and mortalize

Hip-hop holocaust and camps, old champs are concentrated

For every career created was eliminated

Hey, I'ma be back on the deck
Opening business in places for you to cash your check
My neck of the woods ain't all good, ain't all bad
You can live in the burbs and still get had

The sad part about it, niggaz had houses on the lake
They tryin' to move us out, the land we ain't appreciate
For peace we skate, crackers we roll or player hate
Call each other 'cause, 'cause of how we relate
I see way too many Cadillacs with dope man plates
Through the wind and blow ups is how niggaz communicate

Knowing I'm sowing seeds, let's see whose thumb is the greenest

And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code
My soul starts to grow colder than the North Pole
I try to focus on the whole of where the torch goes
In the tradition of these legendary sports pros
As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a life time
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or canceling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with
Something in my eyes says I'm so close to having the prize
I realize I'm supposed to reach for the skies
Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn
You don't say good luck
You say don't give up
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn

One love, one game, one desire
One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher
I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
'Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
It's David and Goliath; I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time starts to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush; it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart--I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not be a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate
I hate losing; I refuse to make the same mistake

Oh, the fire, the fire
Oh, there's something in your heart
(The fire)
There's something in your heart
(The fire)

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire

You say don't give up

First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care

How I got over where the people come apart
Don't nobody care about you; only thing you got is God
Out here in these streets if you get down on your luck
You can stand out with a hand out, but nobody give a fuck
Out here in these streets every man is for himself
They ain't helpin' no one else; it's a hazard to your health

Livin' with the police right behind ya

Before I go back to the Heavenly Father
Pray for me if it ain't too much bother
Whatever don't break me or make me stronger
I feel like I can't take too much longer
It's too much lyin' and too much flyin'
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up cryin'
They all got a sales pitch I ain't buyin'
They tryin' to convince me that I ain't tryin'
We uninspired, we un-admired
And tired and sick of being sick and tired
Of livin' in the hood where the shots are fired
We dyin' to live, so to live we dyin'
You just like I am

First thing they teach us is not to give a fuck (how I got over)

Somebody's gotta care
And I swear it isn't fair
In suspended animation, we ain't tryin' to go nowhere

We ain't even old enough to realize we're on our own

Where it's like they lost they mind
Is there anyway to find
Are we runnin' out of time out here?

Gone in a flash and yet he gets faster
Sick when he hits the mic like Mix-master

Slicker than a can of oil with no Castor

I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Yeah, it's like everyday I wake up
I stare into space and don't say much
Peer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up
Coffee pots, cigarettes, morning Js, Baileys
Slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
Beats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs
Feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
And plus the toxins I sip got me tall
Still tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles
Every day is like a blank canvas
Carving my initials in the planet like I brand it
Hand picked to live this life we take for granted
Like a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it
Smiling through the trouble we face, trying to manage
My way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
Cause I can sit on my ass or just imagine
The madness I did on my path and paint the canvas

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Before I rise and shine like a neon sign
I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein
And burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton
It's my only bonafide break from these confines
I need a change of scenery like a montage
These kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad
And everybody coming at me from the blindside
I'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide
I listen to some theme music on the iPod
And walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise
Feeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline
I got to try different things in these trying times
Twenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five
It's come alive time, I picked a fine time
For getting open off life like a fine wine

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Sunday morning, plan my day out
Whole new blueprint, brand new layout
Deep down still don't know if it'll play out
But for the first time feel like I done found a way out
Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight
Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith
Troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
Chicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base
But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase
And I finally understand my right to choose
My preacher man told me it could always be worse
Even the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
So you can stop and refresh the rules
Breathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds
Something inside said that's the move
And made it today, I'll restart fresh and new

They see what we do and grow up in all likenesses
Really, I don't wanna see 'em having to fight for this
Story of the family biz; I'm-a rewrite the script
Daughter of a hip-hopper, hustla like her grandpapa
Her destiny done been determined, so you can't stop her
From being independent, earning paper and proper

Hustling to make a buck, make a buck and fuck it up
Fuck it up and suck it up, then go and make another buck

When it's said and done
My head is right back in a haze
I'm ready for the next chapter and page
To start acting my age and part ways
With black thought from back in the days
I'm stargazing from the back of the stage
Questioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise
What's the phrase--bygones is bygones?
Niggas who used to be the underdog is icons
People say the light shines once in a lifetime
Is this mid-life kind of crisis a little bit like mine?
I'm thinking not now, but right now
I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now
I fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now
The quick and the dead--which is my look-a-like now

Yo, opportunities lost because I blew 'em
On the sunniest days of my life I cried through 'em

And I would pray to God, but I'm tired of lying to him
Tired of trying to run from the things inside of us
Got a lot of fam' and a lot of admirers
Who tell me that I should aspire to be changed
But when I think of changing, it's like why even try this shit?
My mind hazy and my thoughts they get distorted
I know my good and bad needs both get recorded
You do right so your soul can last
But my role was cast before I even auditioned for it
So I don't really see an end to my vice
It's just false reclamation, no end of my strife
Feel the evil overpowering
You can go ahead throw the towel in
'Cause, nigga, that's the end of the fight
When you can only see the tunnel at the end of the lights
Like (?) it's the end of your life
And I'm out

When I look into the mirror and see my own image
It feels like there's something else far off in the distance
Something I wanna see, but something that's resistant
And every day the haunting is growing more persistent
I never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it
And the constant pounding's driving me ballistic
I ran from it for years, but it's still next to me
And it's growing stronger take and leaving less of me
I can't fight it now; I know it's just destiny
And I just wonder what's gonna happen when it catches me
Will it leave me face down in (?)
Or will it just start bringing out the best of me?
But is the best of me really just the worst of me?
And if so yesterday could be my anniversary
In sinners' court it's important to have church with me

Lurking and murk them, got them turning this
Bed into a coffin, burning over passions in this passion
Or more or less over what the pastor passed us
'Cause, see, the past tense it never really passes
Phases that trap us and cage us like classes
Fogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess
Task-less dilemma to match somebody's status
And I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassing me up
Passing bucks like a casual blunt
Granted, hustling habits on the stumble, the mansion while
Bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks

A girly pleasure, lonely language inside a letter
It's now or never--move it, move it, love it, or lose it

It's things of nature; paid a player and say your prayers

You 'bout it, 'bout it; don't allow it to pop without it
Then those who doubt it do or die the death of cowards
The world is yours and the world we can't afford
So ignore the law; start a fire; then start a war

Free will died long before Glydes and i-Pod

Sundays Mahalia played
Simple familiar ways, 
Like how she kneeled and prayed
Willin', master forgive us, 
Our trust pastors had us real afraid
I never listened yet I still obeyed
I got to see how Philly played at such an early age
What my father was into sent him to his early grave
Then moms started chasin' that base, like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of forty nights and forty days
Trouble was my ball and chain, shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings 
But a star is what it all became
My journey from a dirty hallway, 
To the Hall of Fame
Music my therapeutic way to cope with all this pain
Was headed for the drain, 
Soakin' before the rainwater came
And chaos, into the order came
I started doin' what I'm 'sposed to do in life
Tryin' to move out of the dark,

The Roots,"You know you ghetto boy, when you got a face, with a scar
And yo' highest aspirations is a place, and a car
Shorties pull out and bust, like a money shot
Now he on the run, he hot
And he hurtin' his Granny and she the only one he got
The hood so shady
You give up hope, of ever even tryin' to find a sunny, 
Spot-light, they caught him at the 
Stop-light, but if he woulda run that yellow
Then he coulda, run the globe
But instead, with speed
They put one in the middle of his frontal, lobe
Like a unicorn
I'm just tryin' to keep you, informed
To my little ghetto soldiers in they, gold
Green, red, and blue uni-forms, chuuch!
But I'm feeling like the loneliest monk
So I pull me a Thelonius Monk and blew, the horn
And we don the monikers of goons and gangsters
And are trained to conduct ourselves true, to form
So we add a Shorty, a Money, a Mack
A Lil', a Eazy, or a Young to our name
So all the big ballers grab rims and hung, in the game
And there's a degree, of difficulty
To make it from the ghetto boy into the man-hood
Especially when you know that yo' fresh greens
Will help eliminated a canned, good
Can, good, and bad co-exist?

Though I'm the type to bare arms
And wear my heart on my sleeve

Read the days that weave through the maze
The seasons so amazing
Feed them and raised them
Seasons are aging
Earthquakes, wars, and rumors
I want us to get by but
We're more than consumers
We more than shooters, more than looters
Created in this image so God live through us
And even in this generation, living through computers
Only love love love can reboot us
