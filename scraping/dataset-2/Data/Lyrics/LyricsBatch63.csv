[Troy Mitchell]
Yo, who want to wreck you with the iller thug, super killer thug
You know that thug that's used to doin it out the dub
I go Shaft on niggaz, don't make me have to call my killers
Staff on niggaz, get bloodbaths for all you niggaz
Yo, I ain't tryna talk shit straight up I walk this shit
I'm used to bossin shit and offin clips
See hood is around my way - they talk often quick
To us you spit, and leave that nigga coffin shit
See we gang we never bought it in the streets I slang
Peeps I train to hustle get it take out names
Let me bang and spread it all around the project blocks
I'm sick with glocks now bitches get ridiculous jocks
Now thug filthy niggaz walkin through your club with blunts
Grill with fronts, keep Henny on the spill for months
I get trucks from the bitches and the niggaz I crush
And figure the last niggaz that fuck with us

[Magoo]
Yo, Mag never roll with a gun, Mag roll with a two-case
Get up in some beef niggaz end up with a screw face
Besides that I got a gang of P-town niggaz with court cases
And they all gettin life
We can be enemies after fuckin your wife, or runnin train on 'em
Piss on a slut, let it rain on 'em
But I'd rather put my brain on 'em
Look at the bitch, she got a frame on 'em
Mag hit it then came on 'em
""Alias,"" if you with me you ride
Get in the back of the Lex', and be out of your tux
Label me ""alias"" from my respects to crack this case
I'm past bein berserk, nigga look at my face
I got an ill way of showin my pain
Fuck talkin how I'm hurt, Mag take out his brain
I'm goin insane and why'all niggaz, hatin my thang
Mag the illest nigga spittin, FUCK the simple and plain

[Sin]
Sin the reason why rap ain't gon' be the same
First niggaz speak my name, off with his brain
Put the heat to his back, clap his lungs collapse
If I would sell, six plat', I'm done with rap
How many why'all gotta touch, then found out Sin's too much
Uncut, can't touch
You remind me, of pussy; you bitch-ass nigga
Up North, drawers off, snitch ass nigga

[Magoo]
Now I'm hangin with superstars, and fuckin them in the cocktail room
After the nuttin, sweep 'em out with the broom
Mag ghetto as ever but mo' cheddar
Used to smoke dub sacks now just pound [unknown]
But I got a sweet tooth for crime but never kill
I run with steel, stay in the house, put my dick up in Jill
Poppin usin' the pill, never did it before
I want to see how it feel, when you fuck wit my skill
I make a mil' [unknown], pussy much fine in weather
Fam's wipin' they tongues a little
Mag run for the street, or for the block
Brand new cribs still dissin' the pot
Some bums take change see
Neighbors lookin' at Mag strangely
Find they self, hangin' from a tree
But I'm a real life gleeful
""Alias"" is next, but that nigga ain't diesel [unknown]

[Troy Mitchell]
Yo, I used to keep it on the low when I was younger
But now I'm big boss in the game, come let me show you somethin'
So what ya need is a tech or a four-five calico with a nose wide 
and women don't know when to slow slide
My A-K in the cut, with my 'dro hidin
I keep them hookers holdin' my fort, and keep a low vibe
I heard the feds hate me 'cause I'm so live
From five o'clock to four-oh-five sellin' quarters and dimes
Even Magoo got a watch I ain't dumb
Ain't no familiars in this place where I'm slingin' it from
I got wholesale weight, that low-sale weight
Or any kind of weight that make my dough flow stright
'Cause I'm oh so great; real thugs, no fake
That's why they down to play me on radio stations and rotations
Thugs hate - everything I stand fo', throw hands fo'
Make plans fo', roll on yo' camp fo'

[Sin]
Laid back in the same colored Escalade
Run over rappers that test the brake
Leave you under the jeep and test your faith
Put it in reverse and, crush your face
Go to court, tell the judge fuck the case
Go to jail, no bail, cut your face
Get it right nigga, you dealin with apes
I came for the safe now show me the cake, uhh

[Sebastin]
Listen, as soon I'm on the show you struggle in raps
Anticipate nickel plates, man, right where you sat
Like a panel nigga under your shirt, picture that
How your child's gonna burp when you losin your lap?
Hey, I'm bringin the shade, don't floss in the day
Niggaz think they so cold like they jewelry okay
I'm hittin hoes, respondin like you charmin the dame
Crackin up like, ""Damn, which one of why'all paid?""
A pretty boy got hookers thinkin that the blows don't trade
That's the day that the curls slide under the braid
I'll give you somethin sharp to raise that line in your fade
Different ligaments torn for every round that's sprayed
Puttin hoes into groups and spittin them up like Jake
do-rags ain't safe, bullets skip through waves
I'll hop drive-through, pop somethin in Dave
I ain't from around yo' way, nigga I'm from V-A",Beat Club,2001
Ciro Sebastinelli,"[Timbaland talking]
see'mon, ah, see'mon, ah, bounce a little, what, see'mon, yeah
Ha, you didn't think I was comin like that did you?
Whooo!

[Sebastian]
From the corner to the dice where we rollin at
For all my homies gettin nice off that cognac
To ghetto chicks who appreciate the Cadillac
When it flip to the normal color like Mike was back
Nike hats, slightly above your nose and neck
Chucks and slacks, separated from Gores and Tecs
Chicks in packs, please, let your weave relax
I'm so gangster with this rap bouncers hold me back

[Timbaland]
Hey G, I feel you black
But let me get up in this club and show you how I act
I'm a fool when it comes to these party girls
I'm a fool when it comes to this party world
Now ask yourself, now who do beats like me?
I was the one that gave you ""Hey Papi""
I'm like Tupac, all eyes on me
Got niggas messed up in the industry, but it's ok

[Chorus: Storm & Shelby (Timbaland)]
It's your night (yeah), no need to act uptight (uh)
Go and grab somebody (go 'head), go and grab somebody
And be real
(And just dance a bit, see'mon and just dance a bit)
Do what you feel
(Uh huh, and just dance a bit, see'mon and just dance a bit

[Magoo]
Must be the first of the month
Mag get up on the track and I'm rappin drunk
why'all want to battle we can spit for days
Let up sixteen bars like mayo-naise
Swisher in my mouth, shower cap on my dome
Ain't in the studio, little shorty I'm home
Pass the phone, I'm a call all VA
Tell Sin, call Brooke and bring some Alize

[Sin]
Got in the game like what, it's over man (say what?)
I spit vodka, ain't sober man (say what?)
I'm a bigger guy, need extra pay
Give me a bed so I can lay in my Escalade
You could be black, Puerto Rican or Dominican
Room 219, I don't care, send it in
I'm a jiggy guy, ride one plus the five
Make it a six, big bad son of a bitch

[Chorus: x 2]

[Magoo]
Sin got the Alize from home
Give me Lifestyles, put 'em on my jimmy, it's on
And peep out my manuscript
Mag and Tim party hoes so you gots to strip
And I ain't playin games when I heart
And leave Mag hangin hard suit with Christopher Darden
I take about a hour to bust
Chickens want to get with Mag so they makin a fuss
Told 'em, ""simmer down, you're next
Take my headphones, listen to Funkmaster Flex
I'll be about a minute or less
Stop sittin clothes on, take off your dress""

[Chorus: x 2]

[Timbaland talking to fade]",It's Your Night,2001
Ciro Sebastinelli,"[Chorus: x 2]
People like myself, only hang with self cause that's the way to go
I can't go outside without findin some new kinfolks
People on my left, people on my right, all in my earhole
Make be like whoa and find me somewhere else to go

[Magoo]
It's Mag from your TV screen, buzzin off the Jim Beam
But the Mag why'all think why'all know ain't what I seem
I'm a low-down freak from Seapeak(?)
See them high school mates, I see 'em and don't speak

All why'all want to talk like we used to hang
'Cause I'm doin my thang, now you want to bask in my fame
That's why I stay out the club, be in the crib
Smokin a dub, countin my cash, over the phone

And I'm sellin cell phones, all with chips
My nine to bloods, my glock to crips, who want war?
You and your boys can bring the noise
But I'm a bring hand grenades, now you're laid!

Pull out my dick, piss on your bitch-ass
Sit on your face, now you gotta kiss ass
Who fiend for fame life belong to your fans
And haters and thugs that want to end your lifespan

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
Uhh, uhh, uhh - since I got bigger (bigger)
I'm over here and why'all recite Tim's my nigga (nigga)
Like I just figure (figure)
And my tracks didn't help niggaz

So for rememdy I pound niggaz
Like I keep 'em in DJ's for that new Jigga
Like them forty-two Girbauds
I pocket every demo, like Timbaland - he's that next nigga

Confirmed by people that she can blow
Convinced Booker T she's the next to go
Now I'm checkin every joint and every unit I sold
Once I'm deep in the dough, I'm deep with a crew

In the 80's why'all screamed like the movie is through
Why'all screamin this is ""Nutty Professor: Part II""
To ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to whoever I choose
I can appreciate a Kidman to a, Tom Cruise

To a, fast food, I'm strictly drive-through
The money I gave dudes I basically raised fools

[Chorus]

[Magoo]
Even the phone spit it, God know what I'm thinkin
I'm drinkin and smokin and stressin, go to church for confession
Down on my knees, beggin to God, show me the path
My label is jerkin me workin me so the devil can lurk in me

Sick of niggaz bitchin, wishin I'd fail
Tell 'em Mag be the rap effin Kenan and Kel
I'm spittin the version of verses curses over the churches
Rappin mo' iller than thriller Manila and give you salmonella

[Timbaland]
Stop, the press!
Bitch, you can't afford that dress, you can't afford that hairdo
I don't want your sex, here take your fast food
""Tim you're dead wrong, Tim you're dead rude!""

Hey girl, I don't even know you
""Timbaland we're your first cousin Marion Sue""
My momma never ever mentioned you
My momma also told me to watch them savage boos, what?

Hey why'all, can why'all do something for me?
Can why'all bounce, can why'all bounce, what?

[Timbaland]
I be creepin' in backyards, dippin in alley ways
My brother in the 360, I'm in a escalade
We piled ride high, sittin' on low pros
Petey in the back of us, with his range rov
Bold ladies sittin' in back, one ridin' in the front
No smokin' in here, so put out your freakin' blunt
This how we gon' do it, so pay attention to the rules
Women in sexy gear, draws down and no shoes
That's why we keep it live, 'cause we keep ours alive
For that alcohol is full of, full of surprise
That's how we're gonna ball, walk before we crawl
This here, this here, is that party why'all

[Petey Pablo]
Roughest, toughest, fastest, one of the baddest
Rappin' asses, tickin' on a Timbaland classic
Layin' in traffic, shiftin gears in the automatic
Tryin' to get past this old couple in a Maverick
Beepin' my horn at 'em, flickin' on my hazards
G. callin' me, on his cell phone laughin'
Thinkin' his chick hang out the sunroof flashin'
I done went in the grass, like to kill a rabbit
Swerve back into traffic, radio blastin'
Slammed on the brakes [SKRUT!], ya old bastard
Tim zig-zaggin', hell, he in the back and
Girls sittin' on the trunk, droppin' wine glasses
Wind blowin' dresses up, showin' off the panties
Polka-dot stripe thongs crammed in they fannies
WHOOP! You could be Ms. Barry, fine as you is
Tim, pull it over, let 'em ride in here

[Chorus]

[Smokey]
Catch me in a chick, and her name is Kim
Tryna tell you who I hit 'cause I ran out of Bim
Fast food so dangerous that I'm crackin' my rim
Like why Taco Bell drive-through so damn slim
I'm out north too, no top on the Benz
Big body, too, just like I walked out the gym
Man, I'm sppeding through, not just feeling the wind
Look, the needle to the gas tank is right at the end
Now, I'm needing to sin, lying again
Pumpin' gas in the Benz, with no money to spend
And every kid that walk in, cashier turning again
So it's a good thing that lady walked in her twins

[Chorus]

[Magoo]
All I do is listen to Eightball, with the hoes on call
High dank in my gas tank and eat raw franks
Grill in my bed and serve 2 steak and siemen
And I'm scheming on your daughter with on condom and Clairborne
Don't get it twisted, I'm gold-toothed and two-fisted
Both arms ready to roll, chrome-wristed
I'm past being beserk, I go to work
Tell the boss ""Go 'head give me some sugars and hot sauce""
With an atrack of Diana Ross playing
And drunk off some moonshine, I passed out and woke up at noontime
Thought it was crack of dawn, but ass was in my face
Said them draws was versache, I thought she had versace

You was bowlegged now you walk pigeon-toed
You came in the front, I kick you out the back do'

Who got the forty-five, I got the crossroads(?)
I'm chillin in Cuba, chillin in the Pocanos

Put me in that Lex', let her give me head in it
Put me in the room, hit her on the bed in it

Niggaz try to rock when the nine out unload
Unload my world like a St. Louie Ram
Put it down like a Florida at the screen jam(?)

Shit in the park punk and now you eatin it
Rip off your shine, take out the hardest line

You fuckin with wilderbeasts when you come to VA
You niggaz ain't even try I know you niggaz don't spray

Don't give a hell what they say or read about me
I'm a rich man, invest in stock man
I buy land from the (freaky-freaky) white man
I move to Atlanta with Country Grammar
and move to 'bama with nails and hammers
to put the posters on Havannah
Move to China to move through miners
Then move to shirts, drawers, pants, and to the panty-liners

I got them planes, I got a whole squad entertained

You won't let it down

Until she's on the ground

Sometimes it's hard to believe
That God keeps loving me so much

Like you
Then God took ordinary me
And gave me a chance
And everyday I gotta thank him for
Where I am

But a false hearted lover will lead you to the grave
And the grave will decay you and turn you to dust

They'll hug you and kiss you and tell you more lies
Than cross lines on a railroad or stars in the skies

And spend a summer pleasant

Has laid Jesus Christ in his grave

He went to the sheriff,

Sell all of your jewelry
And give it to the Poor,
But they laid Jesus Christ in his grave.

When Jesus came to town,
All the working folks around,
Believed what he did say;
The bankers and the preachers
They nailed him on a cross,
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave.

They followed him around,
They sung and shouted gay;
Cops and the soldiers,
They nailed him in the air,
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave.

And everybody wondered why;
It was the landlord
And the soldiers that he hired.

Cisco Houston,"Way out in Reno, Nevada,
Where romances blooms and fades,
A great Philadelphia lawyer
Makin' love with a Hollywood maid.

""Come, love, and we'll go ramblin'
Down where the lights are so bright.
I'll win you a divorce from your husband,
And we can get married tonight.""

Wild Bill was a gun-totin' cowhand
Ten notches were carved in his gun.
And all the boys around Reno
Left Wild Bill's maiden alone.

One night when Bill was returning
From ridin' the range in the cold,
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart,
Her love was as lasting as gold.

As he drew near her window,
Two shadows he saw on the shade;
'Twas the great Philadelphia lawyer
Makin' love to Bill's Hollywood maid.

The night was as still as the desert,
The moon hangin' high overhead.
Bill listened awhile through the window,
He could hear ev'ry word that he said:

""Your hands are so pretty and lovely,
Your form's so rare and divine.
Come go with me to Philadelphia
And leave this wild cowboy behind.""

Now tonight back in old Pennsylvania,
Among those beautiful pines,
There's one less Philadelphia lawyer
In old Philadelphia tonight.",Philadelphia Lawyer,1963
Cisco Houston,"If you'll gather 'round me, children,
A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.

It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say:

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen.

And as through your life you travel,
Yes, as through your life you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.",Pretty Boy Floyd,1963
Cisco Houston,"Well, a curly-headed girl with a bright shining smile
Heard the roar of a plane as it sailed through the sky
To her playmates she said, with a bright twinkling eye
My Daddy flies that ship in the sky

My Daddy flies that ship in the sky
My Daddy flies that ship in the sky
My Mama's not afraid and neither am I
'Cause my Daddy flies that ship in the sky

Then a button-nosed kid, as he kicked up his heels
He said, My Daddy works in the iron and the steel
My Dad builds the planes and they fly through the sky
And that's what keeps your daddy up there so high

That's what keeps your daddy up there so high
That's what keeps your daddy up there so high
My Dad builds the planes and they fly through the sky
And that's what keeps your daddy up there so high

Then a freckle-faced kid pinched his toe in the sand
He says, My Daddy works at that place where they land

Called the good Reuben James
Manned by hard fighting men
Both of honor and fame?
She flew the Stars and Stripes
Of the land of the free
But tonight she's in her grave
On the bottom of the sea.

Tell me, what were their names,
What were their names?
Did you have a friend
On the good Reuben James?
What were their names?
Tell me what were their names,
The men that went down
On the good Reuben James?

Well a hundred men went down
In that dark watery grave
When that good ship went down
Only forty-four were saved.
It was the last day of October
That we saved the forty-four
From the cold icy waters
Off that north Iceland shore.

It was there in the dark
Of that uncertain night
That we watched for the U-boats
And we waited for a fight.
Then a whine and a rock
And a great explosion roared
And they laid the Reuben James
On that cold ocean floor.

[Chorus]

Now tonight there are lights
In our country so bright
In the farms and the cities
They are telling of this fight.
And now our mighty battleships
Will steam the bounding main
And remember the name
Of that good Reuben James.

Cisco Houston,"I went down to the fishing hole
And I set down with my fishing pole
Something grabbed my hook and it got my bait
And jerked me out in the middle of the lake
It was some jump, boy I got sunk
Kind of baptized on credit

Fishing down by the muddy bank
And I felt a pull and I give a big yank
I drug out three old rubber boots
A Ford radiator
And a Chevrolet coupe
Nothing but junk
So I handed it in
For national defense

Sitting in the boat with a bucket a beer
Hadn't caught nothing but I didn't much care
Guess I was pretty well satisfied
I had my little woman right by my side
Just taking it easy
Worm been gone off the hook for several hours
I was busy

When you go fishing I'll tell you what to do
Just go sit down by the grassy loo
And take a piece of string
And tie it on your pole
And throw it way out in the middle of the hole
Then find yourself a shade tree
Just sit down and go to sleep
Forget all about it
Can't catch nothing here anyway

Well I walked out on a sandy bar
And caught myself a big alligator gar
Well I drug him home across my back
His tail was dragging a mile and a half
Just flipping and flopping
I sold him for a quarter
Shot craps
Got in jail

Jumped in the river and I went down deep
There was a hundred pound catfish
Lying there asleep
Well I jumped on his back
And I rode him all around
Saddled him up and come to town
People come a-runnin'
They was lookin'
Dogs a-barking and kids a-squalling

Well early one morning I took me a notion
To go out fishin' in the middle of the ocean
Well I threw out my line
And I got me a shark
And I didn't get home till a-way past dark
He was a man-eater
A tough customer
But he wasn't quite tough enough

Well late last night I had me a dream
I went out fishing in a whiskey stream
I baited my hook with apple jack
I threw out a drink
I drug a gallon back
And I done pretty good too
Till the stream run dry
And I give the fish back to the finance company",Talking Fishing Blues,1963

He'll wrangle nevermore
His days with the remuda, they are o'er
Was a year ago last April
That he rode into our camp
Just a little Texas stray and all alone

His saddle was a Texas kak,
Made many years ago
With an OK spur on one foot lightly slung
His bedroll in the cotton sack
Was loosely tied behind
And his canteen o'er his saddle horn was hung

He said if we would give him work
He'd do the best he could
Though he didn't know straight up about a cow
So the boss he cut him out a mount
And he kindly put him on
'Cause he sort o' liked this little kid somehow

And know 'em all by name
And get them in by daybreak, if he could
To follow the chuckwagon
And always hitch the team
And help the Cocinero rustle wood

Well, we'd driven down the Pecos,
The weather being fine
We camped on the south side in a bend
When a norther started blowin',
And we called out every man
For it'd taken all us hands to hold 'em in

Well, Little Joe, the wrangler,
Was called out with the rest
Although the kid had scarcely reached the herd
When the cattle they stampeded,
Like a hailstorm 'long they fled

Amid'st the streaks of lightin'
We could see a horse ahead
T'was little Joe, the wrangler, in the lead

With a slicker o'er his head
A tryin' to check the cattle in their speed

At last we got them millin'
And kind'a quieted down
And the extra guard back to the wagon went
But one o' them was missin',
And we knew it at a glance
Was our little Texas stray, poor wrangling Joe

Next mornin', just at daybreak,
We found where Rocket fell
In a washout twenty feet below
And beneath his horse, smashed to a pulp,

Cisco Houston,"As I set down one evening in a timber town cafe
A six foot-seven waitress, to me these words did say
""I see you are a logger and not a common bum
For no one but a logger stirs his coffee with his thumb

""My lover was a logger, there's none like him today
If you'd sprinkle whisky on it, he'd eat a bale of hay
He never shaved the whiskers from off his horny hide
But he'd pound 'em in with a hammer, then bite 'em off inside

""My lover came to see me one freezing winter day
He held me in a fond embrace that broke three vertebrae
He kissed me when we parted so hard it broke my jaw
And I could not speak to tell him he'd forgot his mackinaw

""I watched my logger lover going through the snow
A-sauntering gaily homeward at forty eight below
The weather tried to freeze him, it tried it's level best
At a hundred degrees below zero, he buttoned up his vest

""It froze clean down to China, it froze to the stars above
At one thousand degrees below zero it froze my logger love
They tried in vain to thaw him and if you'll believe me, sir
They made him into ax blades to chop the Douglas fir

""That's how I lost my lover and to this caffay I come
And here I wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb
And then I tell my story of my love they could not thaw

Cisco Houston,"Oh, when I was a young boy 
And drove my mother wild,
I met a maiden in the woods 
And she said
""Child, look deep into my green eyes 
And at my autumn hair,
When you're a man you'll never see 
A girl quite as fair"".

Chorus:
Remember me 
Remember me 
Remember me 
For the rest of your life.

Her eyes were green as grassy pools 
Looking right at me,
And her hair was red and grown with leaves 
Just like an autumn tree
She moved her tiny hands 
And she made a little turn.
She swayed in the wind 
Just like a graceful fern.

Chorus

I swore as she vanished 
That when I was full grown,
I'd have a girl just like her 
To be my very own.
And now I am a man 
And I'd marry if I could
But I can't lose the mem'ry 
Of The Girl In The Wood.

Chorus

I've wished a hundred times 
That she'd never looked at me.
With the first wild beauty 
That only youth can see,
For a man cannot find it 
When he's looking for a wife,
And he'll end up in bachelorhood 
The rest of his life.

They sleep in the dirt and they wear a shirt 
That's dirty and full of crumb.

Chorus:
I am a bum, a jolly old bum
And I live like a royal Turk
And I have good luck
And I bum all my chuck
And to heck with the man that works

It's early in the morning 
When the dew is on the ground,
The bum arises from his nest
And gazes all around,
Well goin' east, they're loaded,
and goin' west, sealed tight,
I reckon we'll have to ride
Aboard the fast express tonight.

I beat my way from Frisco
To the rockbound coast of Maine
From Canada to Mexico
And then all the way back again.

Well, I met a man the other day 
That I never met before
And he asked me if I wanted a job
A-shoveling iron ore.
I asked what the wages was
And he said ""Ten cents a ton""
I said ""Oh fella, go scratch your...neck,
I'd rather be on the bum.""

to give me something to eat?

I'm the man for you, I'm six foot two,
All muscle, meat and bones.""

He's got a way they can't resist,
He kisses the girls and they stay kissed.

Well he took his pack from his great strong back,
And he said ""You lucky girls.
I'm here to stay for a year and a day,
And I won't be shooting squirrels.
So step up now for a howdy-how,
Get favors while you can,
It's dynamite when I hug you tight,
Cause I'm a natural man.

Chorus

Well, he grabbed a girl with a left hand twirl,
She looked so mighty cute.
But she had fight and used her right
And floored him with a beaut.
Now you can't do that to six foot two,
You're only five foot one,
He jumped a mile but she said with a smile,
""You're a boasting son of a gun.""

Chorus

She stepped right up like a demitasse cup,
And he looked into her eyes,
His heart went bang and her own heart sang,
They stood there in surprise,
Well he scratched his head and he smiled and said,
""Now you're the champ I guess.
And if you're free will you marry me?"",

So drunk I could not see
I got tangled up in the old doormat
Fell flat as I could be
And I had me a little old bottle of rum

And I did have any more and
The cap fell of when I fell down
And I spilled it on the floor

Then a rat come out from his hiding place
And he got that whiskey scent
Well he ran right up and got a little shot 

And back to his hole he went
Right back to his whole he went
Right back to his whole he went

Well he ran right up and got a little shot 
And back to his hole he went
Then the rate come out of his hole once more
Sidled up to the gin on the floor

He was a little bit shy
But he winked one eye
And he got him a little bit more
And he didn't go back to his hole this time
But stayed by the puddle of gin
And he said ""Doggone my pop-eyed soul,
I'm gonna get drunk again!""

And he washed his face with his front feet
And on his hind legs he sat
With a twisted smile and a half-closed eye
Says,""Where's that doggone cat?""
And he didn't go back to his hole
He said, ""Doggone my soul, I'm only a rat
But a doggone cat can't run me back to my hole.""

His little old eyes begin to shine
And he capped up more and more
And it made me glad that I had stumbled
And spilled it on the floor
But soon the puddle of rum was gone
And I didn't have any more gin
And the little old rat was having a time

And the old tom cat come in
Well the cat made a pass
And the rat made a dash
And his boldness faded then
The cat jumped over 
And the rat got sober

And ran back to his hole again.
Ran back to his hole again.

Through the canyon, in the glow
Of a quiet Sunday morning 
From the town of Angelo
Ridin' easy on that pinto 
That he dearly loved to straddle,
With a six-gun and sombrero 
That was wider than his saddle
And he's hummin' as he's goin' 
Of a simple little song
That's a-boomin' through the cactus 
As he's gallopin' along:

""Oh, I've rid from San Antony 
Through the mesquite and the sand
I'm a rarin', flarin' bucko, 
Not afraid to play my hand.
Well, I'm a hootin', shootin' demon 
And to have my little fun
On my pinto called Apache 
And Adolphus that's my gun.""

Well straight to Santa Fe he drifted, 
And he mills around the town
Sorta gittin' of his bearin's 
As he pours his liquor down
But he's watchin', always watchin',
Every hombre in the place,
Like he's mebbe sorta lookin' 
For some certain hombre's face.

Then one night he saunters careless 
To the place of Monte Sam
And he does a bit of playin' 
Like he doesn't give a damn.
Then all at once it's hushed and quiet, 
Like a calm before the blow,
And the crowd is tense and nervous, 
And the playin stopped and slow.

At the bar a man is standin', 
Sneerin' as his glances lay,
Like a challenge did he fling 'em, 
Darin' 'em to make the play.
Two-Gun Blake, the Texas killer, 
Hated, feared wherever known
Stood and drank his glass of mescal 
With assurance all his own.

Then the eyes of Blake, the killer, 
Met the glance of Dobe Bill
And they held each one the other 
With the steel of looks that kill,
Then the tones of Blake came slowly, 
With a sneer in every word
""Well, you've found me!"" 
But the other gave no sign he saw or heard.

Walkin' calmly toward the speaker, 
He advanced with steady pace
Then he grinned, and quick as lightnin', 
Slapped him squarely in the face.
""Shoot, you snake!"" he whispered hoarsely. 
""Shoot, you lily-livered cur!""
""Draw! You're always strong for killin'; 
Now I'm here to shoot for her!""

Some there was that claimed they saw it, 
As the killer tried to draw
But there's no one knows for certain 
Just exactly what he saw;
I'll agree the shootin' started 
Quick as Blake had made his start 
Then a brace of bullets hit him 
Fair and certain through the heart.

As he fell, his hand was graspin' 
For the gun he'd got too late
With the notches on it showin' 
Like the vagaries of fate.
And the man who stood there lookin' 
At the killer as he lay
Murmured: ""Nell, I've kept my promise. 
I have made that scoundrel pay!""

Then Dobe Bill, he went a-ridin' 
From the town of Santa Fe
On a quiet Sunday morning, 
Goin' happy on his way,

Hobo Bill, the railroad bum, was a-fighting for his life.

As the train sped through the darkness, with raging storm outside,
Hobo Bill, the railroad bum, was taking his last ride.

The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul,
As he raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold.

Outside the rain was a-pouring on that lonely boxcar door,
And the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor.

He heard the whistle blowing in a dreamy sort of way,
The hobo seemed contented, for he smiled there where he lay.

It was early in the morning when they raised the hobo's head,
And the smile still lingered on his face, but Hobo Bill was dead.

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well

Hope I live to tell

The majority of ears were only being polite 
Couldn't be bothered to disagree 
A social distance set 

By a liking of something hard to forget 
A need to remember and recognize 
And inspiration that over-rides 
Any hesitation or compromise 
Not relying on dubious facts in disguise 
What you eagerly collect 
And subsequently resurrect 
From acquaintances and T.V. set 
Falls on distant ears 

But when you tell it like it is 
From your own ideas and what they give 
We're all involved in the way you live 
And the distance disappears",Small Talk,1994
Citizen Fish,"Here in the Criminal Justice Act it says it's illegal to even react by marching against the sudden new lack of freedom of movement, assembly, and that goes for everyone because now we're all dispossessed. Little joy in the illusion that they can't mess up our heads. As we're taking life as being a reward, we're constantly told that we can't afford to live it, not the way we do, cause now we're breaking the law. Is it me or is it you who thought we could live without heeding it? Now the boundaries have all shrunk to fit to lifestyles. Based on total social complicity to work ethic, media, domesticity. Staying silent in response to freedoms being so curtailed we forget we need them to exist. Variety breeds tension. Then people debate what never mentioned before: ideas deal with feelings and laws try to shape the ideas that we deal in. At the point where the ideas have spread enough distance to call it a lifestyle, we start to meet the resistance. Here in the Criminal Justice Act all our paranoia has turned out to be fact! They really ARE out to get you, so party on, dude! Now we've all been criminalised for refusing to be led. They can't control our movements-they can't close down our heads. And if you start to think they can, they've won another round towards completion of their plan to keep the people down. The more we get pushed the more we push back. Destroy the Criminal Justice Act!

Citizens,"I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah
I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah

Whatever it is that gives that feeling that we can’t live without
The joys we try to get that only God can give we highly doubt
What allures and arouses the heart we can’t figure out
But it’s the quickest way to account for what we prize and are most proud about
These ""gods"" make promises but always lie to us
The kind of lies that says they’ll keep us safe and satisfy us
We blame the lies outside of us
But it’s the lie that lies inside that captures the depth of desires and false messiahs
We seek pleasure in anything, we overestimate everything
Endlessly trusting in empty entities
Secretly searching for anything in moments of blessing
While exiting edicts of Eden over our ecstasy
When a good God gives good gifts we generally tend to twist the list
And take the list of good gifts that God tends to give and make general ""gods"" out of gifts
I suppose what exposes the worship in most of us
Is a close look at most of our thoughts, fears, and emotions

No matter what I do
I can't ever make it last
I just repeat my past
I'm so broken
So much I thought I knew
All the things that I pursued
I'm worse off than before

I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah
I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah

The saddest fact is that I search for satisfaction
As if I lack it when in fact I lack nothing
That's the reason for my lackluster prayer life
And my lust for distractions, it's so easy to see in hindsight
I must confess it's the mess I acknowledge when I'm
Stalling on my responsibilities and don't apologize, but make excuses
Like my physical exhaustion is a license for narcissism
And speaking recklessly without caution
I often wonder, why I'm so awkward in conversations
Wishing I could switch places, envious of others
But my envy is a reflex of my ignorance
'Cause I don't know the details of their daily existence
I just assume the weight I carry is the heaviest
But I've never been a heavweight
My legs get heavy when I wait
Hope deferred so I prefer the immediate
And exchange the true God for what seems more expedient
It's meaningless

I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah
I can’t always rely on my desires
But I treat them like the Messiah

Help us not be haste when it comes to temporal blessings
And always see them for what they're actually meant to be
A mere extension of Your love and kindness
Extended to an undeserved humanity
Help us not see greater value in the gifts You give
And not become distracted from their intended desires
May we regard the world and all that is in it
As nothing compared to the satisfaction of knowing

City Harbor,"There's a child on the subway 
His story is written on his face 
And the pain he's felt, is enough to fill a lifetime 
But he doesn't know any other way 
 
Somebody tell him that the lost are saved 
Somebody tell him that his debt's been paid 
And let him know, love is calling out his name 
Somebody tell him, he's a child of the king 
And there is an end to this suffering 
And hope that never fades, through grace that's made a way 
Somebody tell him, somebody tell him now. 

You can see it on the TV 
Or in the middle of a crowded room 
There's a sea of broken hearts, that are longing 
To be washed away by an ocean of truth 
 
Somebody tell them that the lost are saved 
Somebody tell them that their debt's been paid 
And let them know love is calling out their names 
Somebody tell them, they're the child of the king 
And there is an end to this suffering 
And hope that never fades through grace that's made a way. 
Somebody tell them, somebody tell them now. 
Oh somebody tell them, somebody tell them now. 

Too many times we've all held back 
The truth from those put in our path 
So let us be the voice of love to them

City High,"They just gave up on our entire generation
So we were all pushed to the side
'cause we didn't see the world through our teacher's eyes
When all we needed was a little bit of motivation
But because we wore our pants saggin'
y'all labelled us gangsters
And said we wasn't worth the time

There are so many things I never asked you
There are so many things I still don't know
There are so many things you never told me
And still so many things that I will never know
And why 
'cause I went to City High

A school with more drop outs than sign-ups at registration
And the pregnancy rate is at an all-time high 
We all know why
Now you would think the classroom's the place for mental stimulation
But there's some brothers outside
Sellin' that stuff 
That'll really stimulate your mind
(Talk about gettin' high)

There are so many things you never showed me
There are too many things you let slip by
(You let slip right on by)
How can I face a world that doesn't know me
A world that doesn't care whether I live or die
And why 
'cause I went to City High
So

We don't need your education
We don't want no pacifier
We are the leaders of your nation
We're gonna make sure the world survives
There ain't no justice there's just us
What happened to the meaning of ""In God we trust""
So as we get older and our children grow up
We ain't gonna teach them what y'all showed us

There's too many babies dyin' before they're born
(Lord ain't that the truth)
Too many young ladies cryin' with a daddy in the house
But not a father in the home 
(Now y'all know there's a difference)
And what about all our young soldiers being led astray
(By this negative music)
What happened to the Isaac Hayes
And the Curtis Mayfield's and all the Marvin Gayes?
Man we really need 'em today

And there were so many things that needed explaining
But you said it was too late for me to learn
You were suppose to be my shelter when it was rainin'
But instead you left me out here all alone
So I gotta make it on my own

We don't need your education
We don't want no pacifier
We are the leaders of your nation
We're gonna make sure the world survives
There ain't no justice there's just us
What happened to the meaning of ""In God we trust""
So as we get older and our children grow up
We ain't gonna teach them what y'all showed us

SPOKEN
For people who did believe
What we could do to change our future
You knew the world was in our hands
Help build them strong so they can withstand
All the pressures
All the war
All the prejudice
And the others who were sure we couldn't fight the stress in life
For those of you who didn't believe us
Listen to my words for you
Listen to your children sing to you

We don't need your education
We don't want no pacifier
We are the leaders of your nation
We're gonna make sure the world survives
There ain't no justice there's just us

City of Prague Symphony Orchestra,"Nadie escoge a su familia o a su raza, cuando nace
Ni el ser rico, pobre, bueno, malo, valiente o cobarde
Nacemos de una decisión donde no fuimos consultados
Y nadie puede prometernos resultados

Cuando nacemos no sabemos ni siquiera nuestro nombre
Ni cual será nuestro sendero, ni lo que el futuro esconde
Entre el bautizo y el entierro cada cual hace un camino
Y con sus decisiones, un destino

Somos una baraja más de un juego que otro ha comenzado
Y cada cual apostará según la mano que ha heredado
La vida es una puerta donde no te cobran por la entrada

Y el alma es el tiquete que, al vivir, te rasgan cuando pagas
Y cada paso crea una huella, y cada huella es una historia
Y cada ayer es una estrella en el cielo de la memoria

Y la marea del tiempo lleva y trae nuestras contradicciones
Y entre regreso y despedida cicatrizan los errores
Y cada amigo es la familia que escogemos entre extraños

Y entre la espera y el encuentro uno aprende con los años
Que solamente a la conciencia nuestro espíritu responde
Y que una cosa es ser varón y otra es ser hombre

Nadie escoge a su familia, o a su raza, cuando nace
Ni el ser bueno, malo, lindo, feo, inocente o culpable
Del nacimiento hasta la muerte toda vida es una apuesta
De nuestra voluntad depende la respuesta

¡Sueño por un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se acabe!
¡Luchen por un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se apague!

Oh I'll go back home with my pocket full of tin oh doo-dah day

I'll bet my money on the bobtail nag, somebody bet on the bay.

City Slickers,"In some secluded rendezvous,
That overlooks the avenue,
With someone sharing a delightful chat,
Of this and that,
And cocktails for two.

As we enjoy a cigarette,
To some exquisite chansonette,
Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath a serviette,
With cocktails for two.

My head may go reeling,
But my heart will be obedient,
With intoxicating kisses,
For the principal ingredient,

Most any afternoon at five,
We'll be so glad we're both alive,
Then maybe fortune will complete her plan,
That all began
With cocktails for two",Cocktails For Two,2000

City Slickers,"Dear, it seems years since we parted,
Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.
 
It's strange how life deals you sorrow,
Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.

City Slickers,"There's a sunny little funny little melody
That was started by a native down in Waikiki
He would gather a crowd down beside the sea
And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
Soon the other little natives started singin' it
And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit
Funny little gay Hawaiian Chant
Ow way tah tualan Me big bad fightin' man
Tho it started on an island down Hawaii way
It's as popular in Tennessee or Ioway
If you wander into any cabaret
You will hear this gay Hawaiian Chant",Hawaiian War Chant,2000
City Slickers,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental Over You,2000
City Slickers,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

City Slickers,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2000

City Slickers,"Once I was happy but now I'm forlorn
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn
Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn 
Betrayed by a maid in her teens
Oh, this maid that I loved she was handsome
And I tried all I knew, her to please 
But I never could please her one quarter so well 
As the man on the flying trapeze!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
He'd play with a miss like a cat with a mouse
His eyes would undress ev'ry maid in the house
Perhaps he is better described as a louse
But still people came just the same
He'd smile on the bar to the people below
And one night he smiled on my love
She blew him a kiss and she hollered ""Bravo""! 
As he hung by his nose up above!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks 
While she spent her time the with the circuses freaks
The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
Alas and alack and Alaska
I went to this fellow the blackguard and said 
I'll see that you get your deserts
His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer  
He sneered once again and said ""Nortz"" Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night to his tent he invited her in 
Filled her with compliments and kisses and gin
That started her off on the road to ruin 
She made the supreme sacrifice
But even tho' I loved her I said ""Take my name  
I'll gladly forgive and forget!""
She rustled her bustle and then without shame she said
""Maybe later , not yet""!  Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night I as usual went to her dear home
Found there her father and mother alone 
I asked for my love and soon t'was made known
To my horror that she'd run away
Without any trousseau she fled in the night 
With him with the greatest of ease
From two stories high he had lowered her down 
To the ground on his flying trapeze!
 
He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
Some months after that I went into the hall 
To my surprise I found there on the wall
A bill in red letters which did my heart gall 
That she was appearing with him
He'd taught her gymnastics and dressed her in tights 
To help him to live at his ease
He'd made her assume a masculine name 
And now she goes on the trapeze!
 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease
You'd think her a man on the flying trapeze
Her actions are graceful, all girls she does please 
And that's what's become of my love

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

Down and down I go.
Round and round I go.
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide.

I stay away. Oh what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame.

So many karats in the ring I'm half man, half rabbit
Bitches be like, ""Ahh man"" when they see me with Cardin
Puffin on the green, discussin' a war plan

I used to have rock, now it's stocked with a laptop
Fat pot, a six-four with the ass dropped
With a dime daughter, dabbed in Estee Lauder
I want the new Tims so from the crib I made an order

Get ya Xed out, leave ya stretched out in the room, my doom

You a cutie with thighs and you live for dinero
But, me and my team drop, shit overseas
Then bounce wit' the ounce that's thick and Japanese

Got 'em winin' like spoiled babies in play pens

Now lick your tongue out lady and I put it in here

Watch the candy-paint change every time I switch lanes",Ride with Me,2001
City Spud,"Where they at?

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's

Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

If you want to go and take a ride with me

Ha, yeah, what you, what you think about that nigga?
Do do do doo
Hah, hah, what you think about that nigga? Ladies
Said, ""I wanna get it on""

Now you could search the whole globe but couldn't replace me
You skurred to face me, you don't wanna race me
Fendi fur, Cartier glasses for the blur
I'm a do it for me and let you do it for her
I got a real bad habit when I wanna grab it
So many karats in the ring I'm half man, half rabbit
Bitches be like, ""Ahh man"" when they see me with Cardan
Puffin on the green, discussin' a war plan

I used to have rock, now it's stocked with a laptop
Fat pot, a six-four with the ass dropped
With a dime daughter, dabbed in Estee Lauder
I want the new Tims so from the crib I made an order
So fuck your bitch nigga, what I wanna take
Plus she been on my nuts since thumps and pencil breaks
'Cause I'm a nigga with the hoe, a nigga with the flow
Fo' Reel nigga, pissy drunk in the Rov'

Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight

""Skuie"" baby girl, you hear me callin' you?
Now I ain't hawkin' you, just wanna walk with you
Talk with you for a second, spit a little somethin' in that err
Whatever it takes to make you come nerr
I'm tryna' sound sincerr, ay
Baby talkin' to me but I'm starin' at her rear and I'm like, ""Oh dear""
I ain't never seen nathen like you before
And you the type to make a nigga wanna open your door

And to the house up on the hill and the Jag is yours
As long as you can prove that you wit' a nigga for sure
You know I'm young and a thug, so I got issues
I did them St. Louis blues, I done paid them dues, aye
But nevermind that, how 'bout we hop the next cruise
We can cash it or plastic, you choose
Get pissed out with the Cristal or the Boones
Get ya Xed out, leave ya stretched out in the room, my doom

Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight, aye

Keep it movin', keep it movin', I keep it groovin'
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it groovin'
I keep it movin', keep it groovin'

Yo, baby girl you lookin' fly in yo' Donna K
Hopin' I could give you some love in the right way
But I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I keep it mellow, sayin', ""Hello""
You still thinkin' I'm a thug fellow
So I let you know from the get-go you thorough
You a cutie with thighs and you live for Dinero
But, me and my team drop, shit overseas
Then bounce wit' the ounce that's thick and Japanese

I'm a goodfella, you know, I'm a made man
Got 'em whinin' like spoiled babies in play pens
Put that ass up, baby and I hit it from here
Now lick your tongue out lady and I put it in here
Let me whip that, lick that, and I don't stop
Then hit the block with my niggaz in, my new drop
Convertable, tens and dubs, no matter the weather
One-sixty on the dash, chinky eyes and leather, c'mon

Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight, aye

You thought was a lame nigga

Now Murphy Lee is really ready
Fully prepared and well done
I told you that I'd give you my all if I sell none
Expected to sell plenty
Lotta more than Kenny
Big as ""Coming To America"" since I came and sent it
They saw he got his own money
""That boy got his own money!""
So please don't try to take nothin' from me
I'm talkin' consequences, all my conses see quince
Will literally take yo face off for the tiniest reason
I'm eas-un, eas-un on down down down down down
Makin' my rounds, I'm like a new Santa in town
Clown, calm down
I got issues like magazines
I'll leave you washed up, cut and cooked like Mama greens
You only cook every once in a while like lima beans
Me, I'm there all the time behind the scenes
Livin' my little dream (Uh-oh!)
Smokin' on Cali green (Uh-oh!)

Come on derrty be for real
I can let you know the deal like a salesman
I could get you out of these bars like a jail bail man
But nah, I'm a rapper I'ma put you in bars
Judge Murphy recommend then niggas put em in charge
You practice lookin' hard and you missin' preseason
So when it's game time you on the side chearleadin'
I'll have you breathing in and out like Ali
Haters like Marley, he hot like tamales
I'm the same dirty
That came wit them boys in the Range dirty
And it's strange how we 16 mil in they change dirty
Exchange the Range for the six fo' that sit low
Haters sick though, mad 'cause they didn't like us from the get-go
I tip-toe through beats, complete style unique
16's in the hallway, probably take you a week
I critique my lifestyle, I change my game 'cause of fame
It's a shame to see results in you mentioning in my name

[Chorus: x4]

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Many many many many
Many mention Murphy Lee name like I'm a reference
I'ma make yo ass S.A.T. is you try to test me
I hang where the best be, never been on jet skis
Been to D.C. and LA like Tyrone Nesby
Though, most definitely I'm worldwide like Pepsi
And I take care of my whole household like Jeffrey
So why you haters wish to mention my name, man?
Can't understand I'm just doin' my thing
Yo I change for nay-nada nudda mothersucker
I'll sell music instead of drugs, fans instead of cluckers
Ya dig? I'm original like a black man wit a gig
And not eatin' pig is why I had to split ya wig
But they might, and he might
You know they watchin' the person who watchin' the person
Jockin' my Johnny Cochran you cornball
All of em stick like a corn dog

And the dreams have changed
The palisade is all rearranged

But if my body's a temple
That's built from the ground
And my soul is created
By the shape of a sound,
Then all that I lost
Will soon be found

Strange as it may seem,
My body leans on only you
Strange as it may seem,
My body leans on only you
Only you...",Shape of a Sound,2012
Civil War,"You and I will last forever
But there are many reasons why I can not stay
Now we shall meet again in heaven
Going out to war is never easy that is true
Another day, another life I may not have to sacrifice
The only good thing in my life

A battle cry, a soldier's sigh, I wish I hadn't said goodbye
This time I won't be coming home
In the heat of the fight I search for the light
A rainbow is painting the sky
I am destined now to die

I'm here to march 'gainst the force of evil
Here to die in the pouring rain
But just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again
I will return as a new believer
Here to conquer the walls of pain
And just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again

Now I'm writing you this letter
But I'm not sure if you will ever see these words

Another day, another life I may not have to sacrifice
But I'm still aiming for the sky
In this suburb to Hell I'm living to tell
'Bout how I defended my Rome
Hail the Caesar, Kingdom Come

I'm here to march 'gainst the force of evil
Here to die in the pouring rain
But just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again
I will return as a new believer
Here to conquer the walls of pain
And just as sure as Rome is falling
I'll be rising again",Rome Is Falling,2012

Shyeah
Keep ya eyes open
For them jackers, baby
It's goin' down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

They see me doin' my shiit, that's why they in my miix
Jackers plottin' along watchin' like I'm movin' bricks
But I ain't move nothin', I'm on my grind hustlin'
Come at me wrong and my chrome gon' give you a concussion

I love to ride fresh, but hate to ride with Tecs
But the way that these jackers roll up, knowin' for the best
With diamonds on my neck, bulletproof vest on chest
I got my own laws, I'm here to serve and protect
Myself, because they ain't finna get me
I'm in the club sober as fuck and you won't catch me tipsy

Nigga! Yeah! I'm Mike Jones
Who? Mike Jones
Who? Mike Jones

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

The way that I pull up, I got the jackers lookin' at me
24's and swingers, sold the candy and got me caffie
And I don't give a damn if they rollin'
'cause my top gets folden, the AK I'm holdin'
'cause I ain't about to go down

Presidential when we ride with the trunk open heat
Clothes tryin' to jack playboy
You get three slugs to ya throat and I'm fo' sho' 'cause they don't know
I'm on a mission to get paid
Tryin to plot or set me up you get ya whole block sprayed

And I ain't knockin' ya hustle but a hollow head will hurt
In the heat of the moment, let's see if that heat gon buck first
And I'm a aim for the worst to make a jacker fall flat
And if I do get jacked, you better believe
I'm comin' back in all black, CJ

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

I'm down the boulevard flippin', jammin' ""Still Tippin""
See them jackers watchin' like I ain't payin' attention
But really, I'm lookin' at them boys like they silly
'cause I know their handguns ain't gon' fuck wit this Milly

'cause I'm a pistol packer for them jackers that try to attack us
No need to call the po po, 'cause my fo fo gon' be my back up
Act up, if you wanna and I swear you'll be a goner
I put it all on my mama, you niggaz don't want no drama

It's Mellow, king of the hill, don't think I ain't holdin' that steel
When I pull up in that Deville, you crumb niggaz better chill
I'm from the streets I'm real, I grind hard for the scrill
I major without a deal, gotta keep it hot wheels

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

CJ & Co,"Everybody, shake your body, we don't ill, we chill at party
Keep a groove that's sensual, three-dimensional, unquestionable
The lover is professional
Got a category, my own and I'm the president
With my particular style, particular, extracurricular, smoother and trickier
Throwing on lyrics like you throw up a flapjack
You're a Chicen McNugget and I'm a Big Mac
Brainstorm soloist, have a Coca-colaist, doing very well
Because it took the right road to this
Path, make the undertake, the recordbreaker
Get up on the floor and do the Heavy D shake
Started with a pow and I'm going to end with a bang

We've got our own thang

Picture the set, girlies wet with sweat
In the corner people sitting down
They've had as much as they could possibly get
Here while I'm lamping
Feeling like a champ and push up on a cutie
Phone digits I'm stamping
The place was packed though, stuffed like an Oreo
Everybody broke for a Heavy D video
Pumping in stereo, people said, ""Here we go,""
A cutie down in front said, ""Heavy you're my hero""
Understand this, before you make a comment
Because there's always a meaning in a Heavy D statement
In this life, I strive for improvement
Be your own guide, follow your own movement
Loving is a legend
Me, I'm legendary at it
Living on the mike makes me a rapping acrobat
Don't try to swing, because you couldn't even hang
We've got our own thang

We've got our own thang

Original, smooth criminal, dance a lot, dance a little, shuffle to the middle
Don't clock anybody, let them all clock you
Don't be down with anybody, let them all be down with you
Stay self-managed, self-kept, self-taught
Be your own man, don't be borrowed, don't be bought

Run DMC and Shell-top Adidas
Both on fire, I couldn't afford neither
On Easter, my three piece suit
That I wore 24, sitting (?)
Well, Mom's had a hell of a way
And Pop's up in Heaven today
My combination
Made me sell conversation
I couldn't sell crack, no time for wastin'
Break dancin' was hot and I was a dancer
Squish to the beatbox and now I'm the man cause
When the chicks here brrrr, stick 'em
They think that I'm on and wanna get with 'em
Even when I was young, I peep rhythm
That they weren't worth most of the shit we give 'em
Yea, life like heads or tails

Rap's drinking a poison ink, across the loud noise (?)
I face L's but i'm the best out in the rink

The Mike Tyson I acquire is not retired
Nor tired
To attract ends is required
And I don't punchlines - I punch liars

Been running this shit before I was a grown man
But I owe part of it, word to my home man
I'mma see you again when I get back to the homeland

And every other letter when I chose
To finish my sentence when I wrote

Paradoxes surreal, the apostles reveal
Tryna stay up out the (?) so we all know the drill
They might offer you deals on the real
A sequel for suspects that won't talk and won't squeal
That's the code we live by so the rules still apply
And the truth I abide, I choose not the lie
Need a new alibi, after a while they won't have use in the trap

It's all or nothing, quit with all the bluffing
Soon as one of my cards decline, I'm in my wallet shuffling
Not so lucky, I guess that's how it's looking
I'm a pro and not a rookie, I school you all and I play hookie
These were my times with Sookie
Tea kettle whistling if she ever left the stove on
Old age had kicked in and she sent me for a store run
Gambling is in your blood, ain't superstitious but you're definitely knocking on one
If I win we all won
Behaving, imagine the good grandson that I've been
Grandma give me the missing numbers, the cash that I need
Used to love the bodegas, now they ask for I.D
Had my own two dollars just to get some scratchers for me
Around that time things were drastic, worrying 'bout our finances
Didn't no one give them to me, I was the one who finance us
Said fuck whoever doubted, that's when I took my chances
Feel strongly about whatever I believe in cause I'm a Cancer
Ain't an auction but they gave my mans a bid

Voice of the unheard, louder than the bomb
Grandma's boy couldn't be prouder of my mom
For this historical perspective, a political education
I hardly ever gamble, my risk was too calculated
Caught up in the traps, to be highly and discrete
Red dollar and rented dream and get you followed by the feds
Cause this life is like a lottery, a loser then you'll probably be
Living with the ghost, like Debbie Moore with the pottery
Testing our morality when facing our mortality
Betting on a fallacy, handing over our salaries
Natural born killer, they call us Mickey and Mallory
'Til our men become warriors and our women become Valkyries
Cussing like some sailors in the open seas
Mama got the silk for the apartment smelling like potpourri

Got her a pepsi cola and some coke for me
Making a quick stop out the OTB

Repeat it and treat it and we playing against the odds
If we can only defeat it
We'd see it, but we standing weeping whenever we read it
And then we feeling cheated, we deserve better
Cause she done earned cheddar and I know she took her turn
Being Tina Turner, let her be returned from her ghetto
You'd know all she want is world peace if you let her
And one day we may travel, if you bought that scratch off
Like Payola at a DJ battle
And it paid off, then we made off like Madoff
And ate off that plate, constantly concentrated like Adolf
Came all the way, four hours in your heart though
Showing up in my school, saying we hit the lotto
Popped a bottle then saw that we misread it at second glance
That's when I learned life isn't up to chance

It really drives me crazy, I think I like you girl
Enjoys the moment, and takes her time, and does it right
'Cause she not just the average, I really like you girl

And something about her lips, the way she kiss
The way she walks them heads go
I see her like I should, oh then she'll look, and it's so sweet
It knocks me right up off my feet, now baby, I see her like I should

Oh, girl I'll never give you up
'Cause ain't no other good enough
And nothing can compare to you
I waited all my life to be with you

Oh, here I stand and when I fall
Only you'll come back for more
Greatest love you'll ever see
And girl your love is good for me

Girl you, got me, thinking, 'bout you, everyday
Men can't believe her now
I wanna say, her touch, her smile, keeps me, livin' right
I gotta say, she's the best for me

I can't explain it, can't explain it
It's just too damn good
So I can tell the world, you got my heart
I love your mind design

Used to be hard now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michelle?
Lookin' like straight bozos
I saw it comin' that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
When y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Livin' with the whites one big house
And not another nigga in site
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm makin' all the dough
White man just rulin'
The Niggas With Attitudes, who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homeys
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losin'
Ay yo Dre, stick to producin'
Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-a-dick
Eazy E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me
Tryin' to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flown
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B, and ya'll disgrace the see-P-T

You're gettin' fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick, is smellin' like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a hoe be a hoe, so
I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to dis Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls
'Cause I heard you're, like, givin' up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Gettin' money out your ass, like a motherfuckin' Ready Teller
Givin' up the dollar bills
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's goin' out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya Toby
Used to be my homey, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren, 'cause I remember when you drove a be 2-10
Broke as a mothafuckin' joke
Let you on the scene to back up the Verse Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they rippin' your asshole apart

I never have dinner with the President
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys
You little maggot, Eazy E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree
With no Vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' bout?
Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew tellin' you what to do
Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too

Come at me wrong and my chrome gon' give you a concussion

I love to ride fresh, but hate to ride with Tecs
But the way that these jackers roll up, knowin' for the best
With diamonds on my neck, bulletproof vest on chest
I got my own laws, I'm here to serve and protect
Myself, because they ain't finna get me

And I don't give a damn if they rollin'
'cause my top gets folden, the AK I'm holdin'

Clothes tryin' to jack playboy
You get three slugs to ya throat and I'm fo' sho' 'cause they don't know
I'm on a mission to get paid
Tryin to plot or set me up you get ya whole block sprayed

And I ain't knockin' ya hustle but a hollow head will hurt
In the heat of the moment, let's see if that heat gon buck first
And I'm a aim for the worst to make a jacker fall flat
And if I do get jacked, you better believe

But really, I'm lookin' at them boys like they silly
'cause I know their handguns ain't gon' fuck wit this Milly

'cause I'm a pistol packer for them jackers that try to attack us
No need to call the po po, 'cause my fo fo gon' be my back up
Act up, if you wanna and I swear you'll be a goner
I put it all on my mama, you niggaz don't want no drama

It's Mellow, king of the hill, don't think I ain't holdin' that steel
When I pull up in that Deville, you crumb niggaz better chill

I major without a deal, gotta keep it hot wheels

Claire Austin,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

Somebody else came near you

And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?,1991
Claire Austin,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone,1991
Claire Chevalier,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon Coeur,1996

Turn around in Your silence, hear my voice

Closin' time, another day is done
When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job, Lord, he's found a gun

He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
They let the ol' man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazin'
And already he can feel that great relief

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars?
Don't you think they'd love to stop complaining
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shootin' at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars?
Don't you think they'd love to stop complaining
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

Evening news it carries all the details
He dies in every living room in town
In his own a bottle's thrown in anger
And his father cries, ""We'll never live this down""

A love as true or as kind

Or just what tomorrow will own

And together someday will grow old

And those leftover chores from the midnight before are still waiting for me
And once again i'm caught between this rock and hard place

The school bell rings at eight i hope the kids don't make me late
Cause the boss will want to know
Why i'm holdin' up the side show in this rat race

And it seems like all the days are gettin' shorter
Fight with time to make your pay
Give a dollar's worth away to make a quarter
But i believe the holy light is burnin' brighter
To come and take this old world back stop the pendulum in its track
And let the sun forever shine on this moonlighter

The mornin' news is grim the cost of livin's up again
And there's little left to spare but i'm contendin' for my share
Cause my prospects are high people reaching for the good life all around me

Claire Martin,"There's a man in the station and a train in the rain
There's a face in the mirror that's showing the strain
There's a woman in the dark that's standing apart
There's a love in the man that's breaking his heart
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home
The next train home

There's one more circle I'm dying to try
There's a piece of my head that's asking why
There's a piece of my heart that's dying to fly
There's a baby in the woman that's waiting to cry
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home
The next train home

There's got to be a way for a lazy face and
Get up and start loving the human race
There's just got to be a way for a crazy face
Get out from under this paper chase
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home
Next train home

There's a man in the station and a train in the rain
There's a face in the mirror that's showing the strain

Claire Martin,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Claire Martin,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.

Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2004

Claire Martin,"Never knew the softness of his tender kiss
Don't know if he's weak or strong
All I know is he's every dream I dream
All night long

Never heard him say a single word of love
Don't know his fate or his soul
'Cause he only speaks to me in dreams I've dreamed
All night long

When I sleep he tells me he's in love with me
And how much he needs me to be near
But at best my dream is just a fantasy
If I touch his hand he'll disappear, no no no

I know he is near 
By the thunder I hear in advance

His words, his words alone
Are the words that can start my heart singing

I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching

So darling can't you please see through me

You came out in front and I was hiding
