Trails & Rails,"Oh give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle on
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences
To many words, gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

Oh give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle on
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

No, Papa, don't you fence me in",Don't Fence Me In,2005
Train,"I never been on a railroad, as many times as they pass me by
I never crashed in the desert or seen a rodeo
I don't know much about the world wars or Vietnam
I've yet to read about Uncle Tom
Never climbed a real rock or seen Colorado
Am I the son I think I am
Am I the friend I think I am
Am I the man I think I wanna be hey
I never had a day where money didn't get in my way
I never listened to much Elvis
I can't remember a warm December
Am I the son I think I am
Am I the friend I think I am
Am I the man I think I wanna be hey
'Cause I'm here for my sanity sanity
I am here for you
I'm here for your fantasy sanity, I am here 
I am
Am I the son I think I am
Am I the friend I think I am
Am I the man I think I wanna be 
'Cause I'm here for my sanity sanity I am here for you
Whether or not I'm walkin' in
Whether or not I'm walkin' out
I'm always here for you",I Am,
Train,"With the love I have inside of me
We can turn this world around
We can live through all eternity
And we'll never touch the ground
We'll take a chance to ride upon a star
To a place that's far away
The light of love will shine on us
Forever and a day

[Chorus]
Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud
You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me

With this true love I found
Picks my feet up off the ground to fly away
With this true love my dear
Takes away my every fear, don't go away

You just don't know what you did to me
But I'm not the same
Since you gave me love
That's sheltered from the rain
You just don't know how you make me feel
Your sweet lovin' girl, is so unreal
I've got love, love desire
From your lovin' my soul's on fire

[Chorus]

I'm ridin' on a cloud
Got to shout it out loud, you're my all
Baby, hold on tight
For the rest of my life, don't let me fall

[Repeat 1st & 2nd verse: x 3]

You're the one for me, yeah
You're the one for me

[Chorus until fade]",You're the One for Me,1996
Train,"Staring at the dark again, you left your silhouette upon my pillow
Right inside the night, I'm waiting for the light, seems like 
I'm in the middle
Workin' for something that I can't touch and sometimes
Can't even believe in woah
Cradled by the hands of fate the faith that 
Sometimes wraps around too tight so tight
They call me free but I call me a fool
They call me free but I call me a fool
Well I look back at April, but she won't look back at me
No, no, no
So I pray in May for June to stay, but she just came
To wash into the sea away
They call me free nut I call me a fool

Slipped down to Mexico, started messin' with her yellow afro
Slipped down behind the sheets, started talkin' bout Pistol Pete
Slipped down to the African, started talkin' bout what she can do
Well here we are again, back where we started
Slipped down to the dark again
You left your silhouette on my pillow hey
Well I'm right inside the night, I'm waitin' for the light
Seems like I'm in the, seems like I'm always in the middle
They call me free but I call me a fool",Free,1997
Train,"She doesn't own a dress, her hair is always a mess
If you catch her stealin', she won't confess
She's beautiful, she smokes a pack a day, wait that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing about that, hey
She thinks I'm beautiful. Meet Virginia

She never compromises, loves babies and surprises
Wears hi-heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen

Her daddy wrestles alligators, Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator for the President
Well here she is again on the phone
Just like me hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home, and rip on the President

Meet Virginia
Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna live this life

She only drinks coffee at midnight, when the moment is not
Right, her timing is quite unusual
You see her confidence is tragic, but her intuition magic
And the shape of her body unusual

Meet Virgina I can't wait to
Meet Virginia, yeah e yeah hey hey hey

Well she wants to be the queen and
Then she thinks about her scene
Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen
I, I don't really wanna be the queen
I, I don't really wanna be the queen
I, I don't really wanna live this",Meet Virginia,1997
Train,"The color of my hair is changing, my skin is soft
Too soft for a man my age, and I am never alone
Where is time taking me
Nothin' is real, this is how I feel
And nothing is wrong but everything takes too long
How did this end up me against you
With everything that I say, and everything you do
Your smile is changing yea, where is time taking you
'Cause nothing is real, this is how I feel
And nothing is good, but I don't mind being blind
If you don't mind doing time
Nothing is wrong but everything takes too long
Hey by the way, when I fell to your
Waste side, did I crash or just slide
Hey by the way, when I pulled myself up
To your waste side did I hurt you or just slide in
So this is how it feels to get a little older
And some would say wiser
But we know what that means, maybe not
When maybe that's what that means, maybe not
'Cause nothing is real, this is how I feel
And nothing is good, but I don't mind being blind
If you don't mind doing time
Nothing is wrong but everything takes too long
Hey by the way, when I fell to your
Waste side, did I crash or just slide
Hey by the way, when I pulled myself up
To your waste side did I hurt you or just slide in",Blind,1998
Train,"It's been days since I been doin' well
Since I don't feel like hell or crawlin' under you
It's been crazy feelin' like I do. I'd like to blame it all
On you for crawlin' under me yeah
Am I wrong for takin' this so hard, for tearin' me apart
Tearin' me apart, partly tearin' me a whole in my heart
Hey is everybody right, have I become so uptight, I'm givin' it away
And if blame is the answer, it's under control
And if shame is the answer, I'm sellin' my soul
And if pain is the answer, I've seen it all
Hey hey hey, I'm tryin' to calm you down
Don't seem to see it the way I see it
Round & Round & Round
Everybody's feelin' uptight
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey is everybody is everybody on
The same page, am I just one to move about the house this way
And if blame is the answer, it's under control
And if shame is the answer, I'm sellin' my soul
And if pain is the answer, I've seen it all

Just my nature got me holding on too tight
So, you say you're on the way
Got me feelin' like I should be holdin' on this tight

I'm heavy on my knees
Oh my, slip and slide
Hope they gonna make you feel
Like someday I will, I know
'Cause every girl I know has to go out to dance
Before my butterfly has it's chance to fly, fly, fly, fly, fly

Train,"So your tired of wakin' up on empty
You left for something that ain't real
So you think a couple of familiar faces
Is gonna turn it all around
You wanna be where they still pump your gas for you
Where they remember your name
They think that you are some beauty queen
Or somethin' better
Where they remember your name
Ain't it good to think about the weather
Doesn't seem to be time for that no more
It's hard to hear when you're busy sayin' what you want said
Well what you want said, it ain't clear
You wanna be where they still open doors for you
It's not hard for them to remember you at all
They light your cigarette and tell their friends
You used to love them
Where they remember your name
More forgiveness
More time away from feelin' like you do today
More forgiveness
More time away from feelin' this way
It's easy when you laugh, reminds you of you
It's easy when it's easy, it still ain't easy at all
So you're tired of wakin' up on empty

It's way to Mexico, sweet Jesus is on his way to take
You on his way down
You get your fill of what you like and you fill your head
With what you might want yourself to be when you're ready
But if you leave
It's gonna get a little easier to break down
And if you leave
It's gonna get a little bit easier for you to break down

Dress, and you look fine
But your new belief is my regret and my regret
Leaves you to believe that we have found the line

Train,"Not too smart, just out of school
A teachers pet and modern fool
Talked about being a freelance broker
But the police caught him tryin' to choke her 
Can't describe him in his corner
Like a rat out of the water
Out of work and outta grass
Mother Mary, never seems to stop to talk, she just walk on past

But why why, can't I see you 
One day always away
Why why can't I be you
One day always away

Share your philosophy before you go-I wanna know

But isn't that the payback for being indiscreet
If I knew better, I'd climb up on my ego like a child.
If I knew better, I'd knock down the flag

Seems like forever

Everything gotta change around me
I'd tell it to your face

Why do things have to change

But you don't need my pictures on your wall
You say you need no one
And you don't need my secret midnight call
I guess you need no one
Is anybody waiting at home for you
'Cause it's time that will tell if it's heaven if it's hell or if it's
Anybody waiting at home for you

Are you strong enough to tow the line
Are you gonna make me yours
Or do I make you mine

You're hopeless 'cause you tell the truth
The stars are jealous of your shine
If you were mine
There's not a thing I wouldn't do

You're black and beautiful, yellow, tan
You're white as light and soft as sand
With greens and greys and oh for days
A silver lining on the way you cover everyone
Just like a morning sun
You turn me into someone I would rather be

Oh I love your every color
Oh I love your everything
You wear the day around you
Like it's yours to stay around you
Maybe I could stay around you too
If that's alright with you

You're coffee brown and bubble gum pink
And oh I think the shade of you is on the brink
Of changing all the ways I see the world
I could drown inside a single drop
Of all the kinds of things you got
And all the kinds of things I'm not

Might just give me a chance to see
From way up where you are
Above the silent stars
Just dancing in the sky

You're better than any rainbow
You're brighter than the sun
You look like my first day of summer
When my spring is on the run
You're gold and more gold
And you're platinum too
With snow toned, copper attitude
I don't know what I'd do without you
I don't know what I'll do about you",Your Every Color,2003

So many numbers that you gotta rolodex them
So much muscle that you never gotta flex them
To catch you when you fall

Or that you don't shave your legs

And I suppose that I couldn't help things much
To set this day in a whirlwind rush
After finding out the backseat changed our lives

Pulling myself in to make warm
Helplessly feel for my phone and drive away

This new rhythm I pursue

I said ""Why wait you're my soulmate""
Took her by the hand in the golden state, now
That your mine things are gonna be fine

First came love and a baby carriage
Hardly knew the people at my own damn marriage
Where an open bar can open your mind

You save my life with every word you say
You shine your light for me to find the way
Just hold me tight and cross your heart to stay
Here with me born to be

Up in Tiburon where the girls are warm
We stay inside while the rain clouds form
And thank God for rainy days like these

Just when the time has come to retire
Baby starts cryin' so we dance by the fire
Always does the trick you better believe

We all know it's in the stars already
Oh oh oh oh
Why say no if yes feels right
You just got to go where it feels like home

It's Christmas time

There was a story that I was told
And I want to tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it, so let's December it
And reassemble it, oh yeah

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness

At the same town miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Clause would hear him say
I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground and family above
Can you send some happiness with my best
To the rest of the people of east and the west

And maybe every once in a while
You give my a grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season to smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

And let me meet a girl one day
That wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free
And she can open some happiness with me

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on all, it's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness

I hear your reindeer
I see the snow wear

I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Then love will grow in

And with a broken wing she still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing she carries her dreams
Man you ought to see her fly

He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom, found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze

Train,"I woke up on Angel Island in your arms
To the smell of burning bridges
And the sound of those alarms in my head,
We should have stayed in bed

But we held them up for ransom anyway
When the coldest days of winter were
The summers that we took aim at the Bay
And grateful wasn't dead

And like your lips were only made for me to kiss
Oh oh oh oh
We were made for this

While the girls all danced beneath a burning man
And the last waltz did somersaults to finish off the Band
Where they began in a wonder Winterland
All we ever wanted was to be alone
Learning how to fly to Sly, trying to find home
Underneath the Family Stone

And just like New Year's Day was made to reminisce
Oh oh oh oh
We were made for this

Love and stardust settle on us like a net
While Buckley's ""Hallelujah"" fills our ears from your cassette
While my heart stops beating, and you stop breathing, Juliette

You're the only thing I'm ever gonna miss
Oh oh oh oh

Friends become lovers, and lovers lose friends
That's when the fog rolls in!
Oh, oh, oh
I'm losing you!
Oh, oh, oh
You're losing me too!

In through the kitchen where we used to laugh,
Smells of your cooking, sounds of the past
Somehow we got older, the air just got colder
That's when the fog rolls in!
Oh, oh, oh

So much for sowing up
So this is growing up
Everything is going up for sale

The time came to sink or swim

And we tried like hell

I take a deep breath with my hand on the door

When it's my time I probably won't die

And spent more time in my birthday suit with you

And everybody upstairs, everybody down stairs
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

'cause I'll be hanging out with you

Who played the sherriff in Blazing Saddles

But who's to say who's right with things like this
There's so much that we miss
Tryin' so hard to be rich and famous
Pretty and thin, to win
It's a shame that youth is wasted on the young

So forget everything and just be with me here now
For as long as we can and whoever goes first save a spot

By an angel in blue jeans

I chased her to the turnpike
Then lost her where the music never plays
And though I rolled upon the stones and fell into the water
I’ll love her till my judgment day
Like a sunrise made of white lies
Everything was nothing as it seems

I see a million different ways
To never leave this maze alive

Where nothing could go wrong

And that’s the only time I ever saw true love

And Erica’s a girl I liked in Georgia
Alone and kept me warm up in Eugene
I guess my mother loved too hard
Set the bar too high to the sky
What’s fine enough to me is just too hard
For a son of a prison guard

There’s a gate that needed painting, clothes that needed clean
They’d say there’s time enough for that when the fun has all been seen
'Cause when we’re laying on our death bed, we promise we won’t say
Wish we would have worked more, baby
Instead of loving you that way, no way

And that’s the only time I ever saw true love

Segourney is a girl I met in Brooklyn
Herris got me close in New Orleans
I guess my mother loved too hard
Set the bar too high to the sky
What’s fine enough to me is just too hard
For a son of a prison guard

I go wherever you are, whoever you are
I go wherever you are, whoever you are
I go wherever you are, whoever you are
I go wherever you are

Betty is a girl I knew in Charlotte
Jordan left for Sydney yesterday
I guess my mother loved too hard
Set the bar too high to the sky
What’s fine enough to me is just too hard
For a son of a prison guard

Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace

Oh no, niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been seven days, the same clothes
Ask them originals 'cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharaoh
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim, I independently lay it down
And played my game, my own two raise my flame
'Cause dick ridin' ain't my thang

I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm gettin' it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' caked out from my bookings

When y'all was askin' permission, I just stepped up and took it
What? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year, the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubblin' then get money now

'Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble comin' out
Just a warnin', as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame that jealous gaze is too short to see it

But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evenin'
You keep on schemin', man, give me some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screamin', ""Lord Jesus""

Harder than y'all 'cause, I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down, it's got to be bothering y'all
Pay attention, watch fly gon' get larger than y'all
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all

The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do or die, stay rumblin' and bumblin' hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all

East coast on your neck and you ain't shruggin' it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumblin' off
I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggaz are the sons of New York
Gettin' spanked when there's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

Oh no, look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know
We rock from the East to West coast
Queens salute to Pharaoh
(You know)
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Very contagious, raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages of wackness, Pharaoh's raps are blazin'
And it amazes me how you claim thug
But go two-ways without Sky Tel pagers

I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East LA
More beef then deli's, thus, what I vent is just
What you lust to vent is irrele'

Huh, Hallelujah, Pharaoh Monch'll do ya
Maintain the same frame of mind, screw ya
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, preacher with scriptures
I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya

Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leavin' you mentally unfocused here

MC's, just come on 'round
You're the next contestants on 'Catch-A-Beat-Down'
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment
It's evident we medicine for your whole town

Sky's the limit, game's infinite when I'm in it
All windows is tinted, how you seein' me when I'm in it?
Rap, we got it on lock, man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangerous toils and snares
I have already come
'Twas grace (oh) that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

How sweet, how sweet the name of Jesus sounds
To a true, a true believer's ears
Yes and it soothes all His sorrow and it heals all His wounds
And drives away each tear

Tramaine Hawkins,"I was preaching a sermon one Sunday and uh
It was about, it was a parable
And it was talking about the uh, the disciples and Jesus
When they were going through a corn field
And they began to pick the corn

And the Pharisees, the legalistics of the day, they came
And they were chastising them that
'Why are you doing this on the Sabbath?'

They had this whole discourse and dialog between the two of them
Jesus was saying, 'Listen, do you, do you not remember that you
You, yourself aren't even worthy
You guys break unleavened bread on, on the Sabbath
And you kill the sacrifice, you clean the sacrifice'

They have a need and it's my job and my responsibility
To meet their need and I'm at their need
I trump the synagogue, I trump the Sabbath
I'm lowered of your life, I'm lowered of everything that is you
I'm lowered of this, this day, recognize who you're talking to

But in the course of the whole thing what I realize is that
The dialog was between the Pharisees or the religious leaders of the day
Was between the dignitaries, the officials of the Church and Jesus
The disciples never uttered a word

He literally started embodying his permanent position in our lives
Because he stepped in between the law and the people
He says, 'No, I'm Grace and because of Me
They don't have to defend themselves to you'

'I'll do all the talking, My blood will speak through all of eternity
I have justified them, even in their wrong, I know that they are wrong
I know that they make mistakes, I know that they are not perfect
I know that they do things that are not pleasing'

'But even in their wrong, My blood will speak on their behalf
And I will just', somebody should have shouted right there
Because He didn't kill you for all the sinful acts that you committed
But he justified you

God bless me with this song, it simply speaks the life of that message
And I'm just excited to be able to share it with you

Hey, justified me, glorified me
Paid my ransom and I've been redeemed by his blood
Go to Calvary, I've been made free
Despite my enemy, I thank God, I'm justified

Paid a price for my life
And all that was wrong, His love made it right
Now what greater sign can any man show?
That know with his own blood He made me whole

He justified me, glorified me
Paid my ransom and I've been redeemed by his blood
Go to calvary, I've been made free
Despite my enemy, I thank God, I'm justified

If my sins had their way I never would have made it
With a debt I just couldn't afford to pay, He came and saved me
When the enemy said that I couldn't, God said go ahead
Because you're covered by me awesome, awesome powerful blood

Though I, I should've been dead and never kept alive
God's grace and his mercy were on every side
When it looks like I can't, God says I can
And he won't let me fall in the enemy's hand

Oh, I'm just glad to know that God saved me
His grace and his mercy
They watched over me all night long
If it had not been, if it had not been
If it had not been, if it had not been
If it had not been for the lord that was on my side
Hey, listen I got some testimonies listen

Just like Nineveh that was headed for destruction
God stepped in and he said
(Not guilt)
You gonna live and you won't see the day of destruction

Ran down my back and up my neck

I got an appetite for love tonight 
I wanna taste your sweet thing 
I wanna feel the sting of your sex, of your sex

We ripped the sheets right off the bed 
My fingernails left fiery trails 
Across your back, oh, tell me baby

Can you hear me cry
In the stillness of the night
I have lost my brother
In the fights of the war
And my heart has broken down

In the night I cry
But no one seems to hear
I step into the night
But all I feel is fear

Lady of the valley
Can you bring him back
To the days when we were kids
Once we were together
We stood young and strong
Now it seems so long ago

The golden key
Is at the end of the chain
How it hurts, oh lady
Free me from this pain

(CHORUS):
In the night I cry to the lady of the valley
'Cause I'll die without the lady of the valley
In the night I call to the lady of the valley
On my knees I fall before the lady of the valley

In the valley lies the treasure
And the lady guards it well
He who bears all the pressure
Is the one to break the spell
There's a sign that I've followed
And it has led me to your seat
I have brought my fallen brother
And I've laid him
Yes, I've laid him at your feet

That’s why I never got it
I come to find the savoir,
In your eyes

All my frozen winters
Face to blame for the garden
At least I couldn’t say that I tried

Fall apart at the softest setback of darkness
Dampened towers cry above to the
Highest liar’s loving heart

All my partial poems come as painless fillers
I may never be as strong as you like
But the way you look at me
Is such a silent killer
Hold me a close and tell me I’m alright

Up all night just thinking of the ways to remain here
Mourn the silences that one time held
The key to paradise

I kept running down from heights that I remember
Those were times that I treasured like a child
Pick this body up because I know I’m better
And I fell upon the ground with a sigh

Little bandages add up to a coffin baby

So they packed some gold 
Myrrh and frankincense 
On some old camel 
With some fancy tents 

Closed down the house 
Set the servants free 
And three kings rode 
Into history 

It was long ago 
In a foreign land 
When the Lord looked down 
Said to make a stand 
So He sent His son 
And said, 'through him you'll know me!' 

Then the angels came 
And when they start to sing 
All at once the past 

It doesn't mean a thing 
And the star comes out 
And the wise men say, Hey show me! 

And they followed it 
Over hills and sand 
Til' they found the child 
Like it all was planned 
And as they knelt before 
The newborn king 

The angel's were singing 
In their angel style 
How all of our hopes 
Had come down to this child 

Then he reached for the song 
And he held it in his hand 
(It was something that he did 
Because angels can) 

And he wondered to himself 
""Is this the answer that I sought"" 
But something was still missing 
Or at least so he still thought 

And so he journeyed on 
Through the midnight winter air 
When all at once our angel 
Felt the touch of a man's prayer 

And looking once more to the earth 
To determine whence it came 
He felt a million souls below 
But one was not the same 

For there he saw a man alone 
Though he was walking in a crowd 
And though this man had rarely prayed 
Tonight his head was bowed 

For even in a crowd, you see 
A heart can feel alone 
When the night is Christmas Eve 
A child is not at home 

So from a father to the Lord 
A prayer did swiftly race 
But the angel saw it first 
And he listened to its case",Good King Joy,1996
Trans-Siberian Orchestra,"The sound that he had heard
Was the ringing of the bells
But now inside that night
There were voices there as well",O Holy Night,1996
Trans-Siberian Orchestra,"In an old city bar
That's never too far
From the places that gather
The dreams that have been
In the safety of night
With it's old neon light
It beckons to strangers
And they always come in

And the snow it was falling
The neon was calling
The music was low
And the night, Christmas Eve
And here was the danger
Even with strangers
Inside of this night,
It's easier to believe

Then the door opened wide
And a child came inside
That no one in the bar
Had seen there before
And he asked did we know
That outside in the snow
That someone was lost
Standing outside our door

Then the bartender gazed
Through the smoke and the haze
Through the window and ice 
To the corner street light
Where standing alone 
By a broken pay phone
Was a girl the child said
Could no longer get home

And the snow it was falling
The neon was calling
The bartender turned 
And said ""Not that I care
But how would you know this?""
The child said ""I've noticed
If one could be home,
They'd be already there""

Then the bartender came out
From behind the bar
And in all of his life
He was never that far
And he did something else
That he thought no one saw
When he took all the cash
From the register draw

Then he followed the child
To the girl across the street
And we watched from the bar
As they started to speak
Then he called for a cab
Then he said ""JFK""
Put the girl in the cab
Then the cab drove away
And we saw in his hand
That the cash was all gone
From the light that she had wished upon

If you want to arrange it
This world, you can change it
If we could somehow
Make this Christmas thing last
By helping a neighbor
Or even a stranger
To know who needs help,
You need only just ask

Then he looked for the child
But the child wasn't there
Just the wind and the snow
Waltzing dreams through the air
So he walked back inside
Somehow different I think
For the rest of the night
No one paid for a drink

And the cynics will say
That some neighborhood kid
Wandered in on some bums
In the world where they hid
But they weren't there
So they couldn't see
By an old neon star
On the night Christmas Eve

When the snow it was falling
The neon was calling
In case you should wonder,
In case you should care
Why we on our own
Never went home
On that night of all nights,
We were already there",Old City Bar,1996
Trans-Siberian Orchestra,"There is an ornament
Lost inside the night
There on a Christmas tree
With a thousand lights
No one can see her
She's standing all alone

Somewhere she glistens where no one can see
I don't believe I can say what had happened
All of those words that we put into play
No longer matter, I should have known that then
I just know you're far away

On this Christmas Day
On this Christmas Day
On this Christmas

Somewhere the wind
Carves moments in the snow
And if he sees her
He never lets it show
He just drifts behind her
Erasing every step

Tinsel and garland are whispered through trees
I don't believe I can say what had happened
All of those words that we put into play
No longer matter, I should have known that then
I just know you're far away

On this Christmas Day
On this Christmas Day

Come Christmas, stay Christmas
Watch over her this day
Keep her, protect her
From harm now in every way

Until the day
When you bring her back home to me

There is an ornament lost inside the night",Ornament,1996
Trans-Siberian Orchestra,"In the middle of a forest 
There's a clearing by a stream 
Where a mother holds her newborn 
And the child begins to dream 

And he dreams of hopes unspoken 
When the tears of man will cease 
And his mother holds him closer 
For he is the Prince of peace 

And the moon is looking downward 
Casting shadows through the trees 
And the stars are shining brighter 
As they whisper what they see 

How the emperor and the pauper 
With the lion and the lamb 
Kneel down before the infant 
For his peace they understand 

Hark, the herald angels sing 
Glory to the newborn king 
Peace on earth and mercy mild 
God and sinners reconciled 
Glory all ye nations rise 
Join the triumph of the skies 

With the heavenly host proclaim 
Christ is born in Bethlehem 
Hark, the herald angels sing 
Glory to the newborn king 

Let the bells ring out these tidings 
Let it echo across the land 
That a king is born in Bethlehem 
And his kingdom is at hand 

Let the world rejoice together 
As it looks upon the stars 
Knowing every man's our brother 
And that every child is ours 

As he flew o'er Sarajevo 
There were scars upon the land 
There were scars upon the people 
It was hard to understand 

And the deepest scars of all 
Which to humans are unseen 
But the angel could see clearly 
Were the scars upon the dreams 

Like Belfast and Burundi 
Rwanda, Palestine 
The only decorations here 
Had been awarded for their crimes 

And in gardens where the children played 
Now soldiers only trod 
And stranger still, he heard some say 
That they were killing for their god 

Now the angel heard god speak many times 
And he had always paid attention 
But this killing of ones neighbor 
Was something the Lord had never mentioned 

But as he neared the earth 
Of a recent battleground 
From among the ruins 
He once more heard the sound 

It was a single cello playing 
A forgotten Christmas song 
And even on that battlefield 
The song somehow belonged 

And as he flew away 
The angel did take note 
That where he found this music played 
One always could find hope",The Prince of Peace,1996

All is calm 
And the world is still asleep

Cloaked in time till it's just a memory 
Christmas stays if we don't forget its meaning 
Days go quickly by 
Years they multiply

Are the dreams we tend to seek

From last night 
When we'd wished upon a star

This day is just pretending 
If we pretend long enough 
Never giving up

Do your hands they still bleed
After all of this time
Do you think there's still need

And said not a word

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear savior's birth 

Now you all heard the story about Bethlehem
How the child was born and the three wise men
Heard the preacher tell it like the preacher does
But let me tell you, children, 
That's not how it was 

Now you might ask me what I'm talking about
But I know the part that they all left out, yes I do

Now do you hear what I said
That Herod wanted those wise men dead
But on that blessed evening
My great great great great great great granddad
He saved those kings 

Now granddad made his living 
Playing jazz you see
But jazz wasn't big around one A.D.
So he got himself a job in the palace band
Where he heard about three kings 
In the desert sand 

Let me tell you children that at any time
Three kings in the desert that's a real rare find, yes it is

But Herod heard of it too
And when he heard his curiosity grew
So he asked those kings to drop by
And my great great great great great great granddad
He wondered why

So the Magi told old Herod 
That they had come here
To find a newborn king of kings 
Who'd heal our sins
Then herod told his guards 
To follow those Magi
And that the only king around here 
Was gonna be him

Then he told his soldiers as I recall
When they found that child, to kill them all
But granddad overheard what Herod said
And he had to act fast or else they'd all be dead, yes they would

So granddad got to those kings
Filled them in on the plan, told them everything
When they heard what he had in store
They grabbed the gold, the frankincense
The myrrh, the jewels, the desert tents
And when they found his plan was sound
They followed granddad out the back door, yes they did
They follow them down

And what a night
It must have been
But when God is on your side
You gotta know that in the end 
You're gonna win

They traveled fast
They traveled far
And in the end they found 
That they were standing with the child beneath the star

Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Hallelujah
Hallelujah (Hallelujah)

so you see we've reached the end of our story
When granddad and the kings reached that stable on the hill
And while I said that three kings in the desert is a rare sight
Angels singing in the desert that's far rarer still

Now I ain't sayin' that the bible was wrong
But ya see the whole tale 
Would have taken too long
'Cause way back then in the promised land
Every copy they sold, 
It had to be written by hand, oh by hand

And granddad lived a long life
Stayed friends with those kings 
And found a good wife

Trans-Siberian Orchestra,"Deep inside this Christmas Eve
Watching as the hours leave
Gently drifting in the air
Shadows of an angel's share

Christmas lights
On Christmas nights
With peace for every nation

Stable scenes
And evergreens
With snow still glistening

Angels grace
This humble place
With hopes of our salvation

Christmas cards
And snow filled yards
And children wondering

Rejoice
All awaken
Rejoice
Quickly hasten
Rejoice
For the newborn king

Rejoice
For the vision
Rejoice
He has given
Hear the choirs as they sing

Scrooge returns
To once more learn
That Christmas ghosts conspire

To redeem
His soul it seems
But still he hesitates

To believe
He's not deceived
Until this night inspires

Him to find
That at this time
It never is too late

Rejoice
All awaken
Rejoice
Quickly hasten
Rejoice
For the newborn king

Rejoice
For the vision
Rejoice
He has given
Hear the choirs as they sing
And sing and sing
And sing and sing and sing

Winter dreams
Her endless scenes
In endless combinations

To embrace
This world of faith
This world that we now see

Every year
It returns here
With all its variations

And as the day
It fades away
And we once more find that

Once again the promise kept
One by one the angels slept
So we leave this night in peace
And the world in gentle sleep

Seeking its salvation
With every string of lights
That suddenly appears

Children stare with new found wonder
No one dares to break the trance
Every wish is carefully numbered
God has granted all a second chance
This day

And all at once the dream's begun
And as we mark the old year's passing
Strangers greet on every street
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air

On this night, to this light
We see it all again
On this night, to this light
We see it all again

On this night, to this light
We see it all again
On this night, to this light
We see it all again
All again
On this winter night
We still wait for you

And now the time has come
When all the world is one
And as we mark the old year's passing
Strangers greet on every street
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air

There comes a time when we're on our own
Some times in life such a thing must be
But such a thing should not be known
This night, this night, this night

And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come

And ghosts that failed learn time forgives
Welcome friends, please stay a while
Our story starts with one small child

Who spends this night in attics dark
Where dreams are stored like sleeping hearts
And so it's here that they must wait
Till someone wishes them awake

For somewhere on this night of nights
She's looking to believe
Here among the ghosts on Christmas Eve

And there near an old looking glass
There was a trunk from Christmas past
That she had somehow missed before
But now decides she will explore

It was filled with toys and one old wreath
And several letters underneath
So as the evening hours leave
The child sits down and starts to read

For somewhere on this night of nights
She's looking to believe
Here among the ghosts on Christmas Eve
On Christmas eve

When we sat next to our first tree
Ornaments reflected light
Of a candle in the night

And I gave you a music box

We watched it go round and round
As the melodies unwound
But all these things are now long gone
And not to be wished upon again

But the musical box continues to turn
The candle in the window continues to burn
But I know they're just memories
Like Christmas past and you and me

Remember that old fireplace
That held the room in warm embrace
And as we watched for Christmas ghost
The fire held the shadows close

But now upon that Christmas scene
The candle wax of melted dreams
And ornaments of shattered glass
Now belonging to the past
But all these things are now long gone

No destination but it always leaves on time
He buys his tickets as the train prepares to leave
Don't want to miss it on this evening Christmas eve

He stared into the night, no expectations
He watched the world go by without a sound
He saw the city lights arrive and fade away
While all that night, all that night the snow came down

No conversation as the snow fell from the sky
His consolation that the world is well disguised

He stared into the night, no expectations
He watched the world go by without a sound
He saw the city lights arrive and fade away
While all that night, all that night the snow came down

He stared into the night, no expectations
But in his heart he wanted to believe
That somehow, someone would be waiting there
Upon this Christmas eve
And when his train, it pulled into that station
He saw there was a single pair of tracks
Within the snow and leading to that station door
And he followed those steps back

And on this night of our salvation
Where dreams that have been lost can there be found
They walked away together on that Christmas eve
While all that night, all that night the snow came down

Only time
Could never take me away from you

And why
Should it try

I would find what you dream

Would pray this

I have tried
To pretend that I don't care
But then
Sleep arrives
And in every dream I find you there

But I don't want the past to be my life
And I don't want to live inside the night
But I don't want to see your shadow fade
So I sleep and I dream
Though I don't understand it

Slowly
Time brings revelation

Waiting
Softly
For someone to believe

That the ghosts we've hidden or left to die
Have now arisen and will arrive
To say what has happened
Say what has happened
Say what has happened
To me

And who would have thought
That you'd be the one
That I would have found here waiting

Lost in this night
Until you arrived
And always too blind to see

And who would have thought
That after this time
That I'd be the one you're saving

Now undisguised
The ghosts that survive
Now say what was meant to be

I never wanted to give my life away
Who ever thought it would matter any way

Wandering inside this night
Finding pieces of a life
Never sure I'd ever know what it means

It's the strangers in your life
That you'd never thought you'd meet
It's the hand that picked you up
When you're laying in the street

It's the hand that cut you down
It's the dream that someone shared
When you thought that all was lost
It's the friend that wasn't there

You can run from all the memory
But never get that far
For in the end they'll find you
For this is who you are

Change one note
Change one line

Change one loss
Change one cut

I've seen her in a dream
A captured fairy tale
That echoes cross my life

And though I've courted her
She's always stayed unseen
Now all at once she
Glitters in the night

But that was yesterday
And that all was before
When she was far away
A silhouette of dreams

But others whispered
That she was so much more
And suddenly I now
Know what they mean

Dreams change
Years strain
Lost illusions
Last stands
God's hand
Absolution
Found

Fairy tale sins
Visions by grimm
All forgiven
Lives spent in vain
Never reclaimed
Take their final bows

Pictures and words
Visions absurd
Maddened poets
All within sight

There in his eyes

That my whole life I have dread
What good this deafness
With these voices in my head

What good this deafness
If this prattle I must hear
If I were blind I'm sure they wouldn't disappear

Did you really want to believe what you're saying
Did you really want to be here alone
Have I interrupted a moment of praying
While your life's decaying
Your sins are they weighing
While you've been carving your stone
All on your own

Did you really want to sit here in silence
Could it be that brooding is part of your art
Is it an extension of artistic license
A moody defiance
Of all of life's tyrants

Alone with us in the dark",What Good This Deafness,2000
Trans-Siberian Orchestra,"And here in the night
As I feel the inferno
I stare in the dark
Thinking what is eternal

The man or the moment
The act or the reason
These thoughts fill my head
As I contemplate treason

Of dreams I have had
And dreams I have pondered
When late in the night
My mind it would wander

To things I have done
And then quickly regretted
While denying vices
My life had selected

And I think what I've done
Or have yet to begin
And the man I've become
And the man that I've been

Now caught in a waltz
With the eternal dancer
I'm courted by death
But death isn't the answer
I say

All I was
Meant to be
Could I
Suddenly
Just decide
Not a thought
Would survive
Could it be
My life's worth
Ended there
With my birth

If I could see someone
Who's been there before me
And traded his soul
For a moment of glory

His penance or mercy
By spirits debated
While judged on a scale
That's been heavily weighted

And what have I done
Could there be such a sin
In this man I've become
In this man that I've been

Now calling to god
From the pit's very bottom
I pray he forgives
Every sin I've forgotten
This day

And who would have thought
That my fate it would conjure
This twist in the road
On which I have wandered

Each vision and dream now
Completely dismembered
To give one's whole life
And find nothing's
Remembered

And what good is a life
That leaves nothing behind
Not a thought or a dream
That might echo in time

The years and the hours
The seconds and minutes
And everything that
My life has placed in it
Betrayed
Betrayed
Betrayed

The things I have done
The places I've been
The cost of my dreams
The weight of my sins

And everything that
I've gathered in life
Could it be lost
Could it be lost in this
Could it be lost in this

And if he did, would he turn away?

Dare he rekindle this hope
Perhaps to only watch it die

I wonder, would you or i?

Nearly every person there 
Went to the cathedral's basement 
And started setting up tables and chairs 

For that night this church would feed 
Any person in life who had less 
And both those that gave and those that received 
Left that night feeling blessed 

Then the angel remembered something 
That his lord's son had once said 
On how one truly followed him 
When words and acts were wed 

Some people claim to follow him 
But themselves they just deceive 
For his lord's son had said, 
""you will know who truly follows me 
Not by what they say, but by their deeds"" 

And this church was clearly filled 
With kind people of goodwill 
But the angel had more time left on this night 
And continued to search on still 

So the angel left the parishioners 
With their christmas meal in happy bliss 
And returned once more to the hotel 
To make sure that there was no one there he had missed 

And passing by a village square 
He heard a brass quartet 
Whose christmas concerto in the key of g

Welcome, friends, please stay awhile
Our story starts with one small child 
Who spends this night in attics dark
Where dreams are stored like sleeping hearts
And so it's here that they must wait
'Till someone wishes them awake 
For somewhere on this night of nights
She's looking to believe
Here among the ghosts on Christmas Eve 

And there near an old looking glass
There was a trunk from Christmas past
That she had somehow missed before
But now decides she will explore 
'Twas filled with toys and one old wreath
And several letters underneath
So as the evening hours leave

He feared to cross that divide
But how long could he stay in this dark
That allows us all to hide

Is there a wrong so great in life
That it undoes every good we've ever done
Is there an act so good it would undo all our wrongs
Every single one?

And in putting his whole
Life into this gesture
Would failing make it
Any lesser?

Then through the window he thought he saw
In the falling snow so near
The outline of his son's mother's face
But then it disappeared

It was only there for a second
And a second's not long, but yet
It was enough to cause that man
To take that very first step

And that step was followed by another
In that room still lit so dim
And before he realized how far he had gone
His son was directly in front of him

Then the father noticed on the windowsill
An old photo that he long ago had seen
It was a picture of him and his wife
When they were both about nineteen

It was leaning against a folder
That said ""property of the deceased""
And underneath was his wife's name
And the date it had been released

It was obviously her personal possessions
That had been given to his son
Because since he had left them all behind
The child was the only one

His son must have always kept it with him
For the folder was weathered and torn
And he must have gazed at that picture countless times
For it was also all tattered and worn

Then his son noticed him standing there
And from his task looked up
And then looked at the picture beside him
And that one look, was enough

He recognized it was his father
That was now standing there
And gave him a smile of pure love and forgiveness
And of the past, he did not care

He did not care where he had been
The whys, the wheres, the hows
He only cared that his father was there
Standing by him now

Then the father turned and walked across the room
Which by now had lost its distance
And went to the nearest incubator
And picked up a trembling infant

And with the child within his arms
He returned to his son
And all the pain within his soul
At that moment was undone

And he sat in the rocking chair beside him
With the life he had retrieved
And side-by-side together

The angel had to understand 
So invisible, he stood by him 
And then gently touched his hand 

Which caused the man to stand there still 
Despite the winter's cold 
And while he stood there in that trance 
The angel read his soul 

It seemed the man was not always like 
The man he had become 
And that angel wondered how that change had happened 
And when it had begun 

The man had been born to a kind and religious family 
And raised in the midwest 
And all throughout his childhood 
This man, clearly, had been blessed 

He grew up believing, among other things 
Man was made in the image of god 
He went to school, observed all rules 
While working very hard 

He had always tried to help others 
Excelled at nearly every task 
And when he'd graduated high school 
Of course, he was the first one in his class 

And in his eighteenth summer 
When it was time for him to leave 
He had offers from several colleges 
All of them ivy league 

And at college in all his studies 
He always received straight ""a""s 
And when he tried his hand in theater 
He got the lead in the senior play 

It appeared to nearly everyone 
There was no talent that he lacked 
And for three years on the football team 
He was, the star quarterback 

And there he also met the girl 
Who did become his wife 
With her, his world was now complete 
He had the perfect life 

When they had graduated college 
They were wed in a ceremony quite grand 
Then they moved to new york 
In a dream they seemed caught 
Where all had been perfectly planned 

She decorated their park avenue apartment 
In a 1920's art-deco style 
And six months after they had moved in 
She told him, they would soon be having a child 

And after their first ultrasound 
He knew they were having a son 
Their lives could not have been better 
And they had only just begun 

Together they arrived early at the hospital 
On the delivery date 
The father was taking no chances 
And did not want to risk being late 

But while waiting outside the delivery room 
He could tell that something was going wrong 
For too many doctors were rushing in 
With none coming out for too long 

When her own doctor finally came out 
With several nurses at his side 
He said that his wife had started hemorrhaging 
And despite their best efforts, she died 

Then in an effort to console him 
A nurse gave him his newborn to hold 
But from the way the child felt limp in his arms 
He knew there was still more bad news to be told 

The doctor then gave the prognosis 
As gently as anyone could 
But before he could finish explaining 
The father only too well understood 

The child had been cut off from oxygen 
For minutes, which is far too long 
The damage was now irreversible 
His brain permanently malformed 

He'd never hold a job, 
Learn to read or ever talk 
And it would be a miracle 
If the child even learned how to walk 

And with those words the father felt 
His entire world falling apart 
And he stumbled for the words to express 
The tearing inside of his heart 

He cried out, why did god have to take her 
While she was still so young 
And then as if to cut him deeper 
Leave this thing here as his son 

""please explain to me god's wisdom 
How could he decide 
To take from me my precious wife 
While leaving this alive 

There is no reason for this life 
Why does he even exist 
And if he had never been born 
There is no way he'd have ever been missed 

If man is made in god's image 
Then something here is surely amiss 
For there is nothing of god 
Nothing of god 
Nothing of god 
Nothing of god 
Nothing of god in this"" 

And then he asked for the child 
To be placed in a state run home 
And after he had signed the papers 
He walked into that night alone 

And in this world he found unkind 
He built a wall around his mind 
And every year he'd add new parts 
Until it had also enclosed his heart 

He kept his job and paid his debts 
As he slowly became a silhouette 
Of a man walking among the tombs 
While living his life within his wounds 

He distanced himself from all his friends 
Even his sisters and brothers 
And as time it went by, he developed his eyes 
So they could only see the flaws in others 

With this final glimpse, the angel stepped away 
And the man shook himself out of his trance 
Then continued his walk back towards his home 
And few would have given his soul half of a chance 

And the angel himself felt helpless 
As he watched that old man there 
So he did what even humans do 
And he quickly said a prayer 

And as the prayer flew to his lord 
The angel did decide 
To carefully follow the old man 
And stay closely by his side 

For on this night can one deny 
The gift of a more sympathetic eye 
To cast upon our fellow man 
And on this night to understand 

The frailty of childhood dreams 
Like fireflies over summer streams 
And if one dared to remove time's veil 
Could one retrace those childhood trails? 

But whispers in the winter's wind 
Told of rescued dreams, forgiven sins 
And who among us shall be deemed 
To rescue some forgotten dream? 

So on this night of christmas eve 
As once again the spirits weave 
Its snow swept dreams and colored lights 
With bits of magic into each life 

And as the snow comes gently down 
Its soul intent to reach the ground 
To cover scars the world still feels 
Perhaps to give them time to heal 

For as men invest in money 
And professors in what they know 
God invests in mercy 
Like winter invests in snow",The Wisdom of Snow,2004

Where he could hear a music box kind of sound

While she was imagining they all were alive

But the angel found himself waiting there
Until each story was finished

Have trouble keeping track of time

But in the end it seemed this delay
Had turned out for the best

The Lord has come 
Let earth 
Receive her king 

Now it was long ago 
When it all began 
Back in Bethlehem 
In the promised land 

When a single star 
Appeared in the sky 
And three kings saw 
And they each asked why 

And they checked the books 
Full of prophecy 
And the one king said 
Why it's plain to me 

You see it means 
That a king is born 
Who will save mankind 
On this blessed morn 

So they packed some gold 
Myrrh and frankincense 
On some old camel

On this night when no child's forgotten
No dream sleeps where he cannot see
No man here is misbegotten
And this night's dreams are still yet to be

Realize that the past can be forgiven, the future be re-writing

That every child is held close
On this night that dream won't be betrayed

I bled for you
I wanted to
Each drop my own

Slowly they depart
But fall in vain
Like desert rain
And still they fall on and on and on

Got to get back to a reason
Got to get back to a reason I once knew
And this late in the seasons
One by one distractions fade from view

So drifting through the dark
The sympathy
Of night's mercy
Inside my heart

Is your life the same?
Do ghosts cry tears?
Do they feel years?
As time just goes on and on and on

Got to get back to a reason
Got to get back to a reason I once knew
And this late in the seasons
One by one distractions fade from view

I'm looking for you
I'm looking for I don't know what
I can't see there anymore
And all my time's been taken

Is this what it seems?
Allure of a dream
And I'm afraid to walk back through that door
To find that I've awakened

The night seems to care
The dreams in the air
The snow's coming down
It beckons me dare

It whispers, it hopes
It holds and confides
And offers a bridge
Across these divides

The parts of my life
I've tried to forget
It's gathered each piece
And carefully kept

Somewhere in the dark
Beyond all the cold
There is a child that's part of my soul
That's part of my soul

Snow comes down, looks real pretty
Don't know how but suddenly there you are
With Jelly Roll Morton playin' for the bar

Inside here, lights are low
But each song has its own glow
As he floats them through that smoky air
You just cant believe hes really there

How old is he, cannot say
But claims he taught cab calloway
And on this night I somehow believe him
Knows every song that Christmas got

Even ones my brain has dropped
Just him and that old fir tree
All lit up this night
Electric blue

Just another night in New York City
Snow comes down, looks real pretty
Can't believe but somehow there you are
Talking with strangers sittin' cross the bar

Suddenly, all are laughin'
This nights smart, always craftin'
Building bridges nearly everywhere
Hits a wall, it just builds a stairs

Outside the colored lights they bleed
For snow is white and colors need
As it just comes down like pure salvation
It offers all its amnesty

And makes your neighbor different see
By the light of that fir tree
And this old bar
Electrified in blue

I gotta drop dead simple, childhood view of salvation
Perhaps that's how it was always meant to be
And the more I add up all this information
It seems it all comes down in the end to you and me

And you look around till you find a phone
Then you call your mom and everyone at home
And the bar looks on and they start to cheer
When you talk to folks you haven't seen in years

And the snow comes down and the children play
And they pray to God, it never goes away
And a childhood prayer should never be denied
As the night rolls on till its carolized

Carolized
Carolized
Carolized
Carolized

And on this tree the lights are done
But the colors here are down one

In the cold winter's light
A child stands alone and she's waiting
And the light that's out there
It just hangs in the air
As if it was just hesitating

And the snow it comes down
And it muffles the sound
Of dreams on their way to tomorrow
And when they appear
This night will hold them near
For where they will lead
It will follow

For here in this city of lights
This evening awakens
The dreams that it might
The winter it conjures
The spells it will weave
The snow gently covers the ground
Christmas eve

In this scene on this night
There's an ancient hotel
Where shadows they do tend to wander
And the ghosts that live here
Hold each moment so dear
For time's not a thing one should squander

And they recount their sand
As it runs through their hand
And examine each moment for meaning
It can be wished upon
'Till the moment it's gone
Like day disappears into evening

For here in this city of lights
This evening awakens
The dreams that it might
The winter it conjures
The moment is seized

Through this night
The dream still wanders
As it was meant to be
And every year this night grows fonder
Of children and circumstance
Caught in this childhood dance
As the world turns around
Keeping dreams on the ground

Windows of frosted ice
Prisming candlelight
And somehow we start to believe
In the night and the dream
As it cuts through the noise
With the whisper of snow
As it starts to deploy

In the depths of a night
That's about to begin
With the feeling of snow
As it melts on your skin
And it covers the land
With a dream so intense
That it returns us all
To a child's innocence

And could never retrieve

Find that Christmas is kind of a disease?

Every year it constantly defies
Placing strangers there before me, there before me
Spreading hope and cheer mixed in with happiness
Fraternal bliss and other Christmas lies

That I would now like you to know
The reason for Christmas I now realize
Is an excuse to tolerate snow, snow

I don't even like the sound of it

Lost in the darkness of eternity

Never quite there but it's never quite gone

Long past when belief was a memory

Where your dream carries on
Never quite there but it's never quite gone

Of a tale
Cut in the face of a crowd
Sentenced no bail

There
In the night
Deep in the back
Through the black
Beckons a life

Time
Moving in a straight line
But then at a whim
A change in the wind
A story begins in its mind

For deep in her eyes
Beneath the lies
Of the dark
Leaving marks

Sparks

She
Has been steeled
Standing there looking so tight
Taut and high-heeled

One
Of a kind
The kind of a girl
That only a dream
Could design

Time
Seen through glasses of wine
Never reveals

Was there before
But somehow here upon this night
It now means more

And all those words
She tried to say
I've now forgotten
Or they've somehow slipped away

And in this darkness
Is there salvation
Is there forgiveness
For hesitation

Can someone tell me
Can someone say when
The writer of this story
Will just tell us how it all will end

There's a wave on the ocean
That crashes on shores

From where they are now
To where they will be

Has joined up with the shoreline

It now means more

To be so near

For my meeting with death
Though it has been delayed
I have run my hands over
The end of his blade

Though the cut wasn't fatal
Even though it was deep
Well that wound's never healed
And the blood it still seeps

Are you scared of your life
Are you scared of your death
Though that day will arrive
Well it hasn't come yet

And each morning we arise

With a longer dream

Are you scared of your death

That you've made in your life
Must they stay as they are
Or can we make them right

And if I should die first
Could I not be your ghost

We should happen to meet
Would you keep me so near

And when we were young she taught us all to read
And then one by one, she would watch us leave

Never saw her cry, for she hid her tears
As one by one, we would disappear
But of course we’d write, and of course we’d call
Just to hear her voice, whenever we would fall

Way up in a big house under the trees
Day's in the sun she's seen by the river,
Reading a book, feeding her dreams
Now she's a loner, now she's a stoner, no one can touch her

He was the boy, the pride of his mother,
Stainless and shining, all heaven sent
But then the country calls for a soldier
And he went out to a foreign land
When he returned faces look different,

Summers of love, that child she was wild
She had the need for total expression,
Painting and poetry filled up her mind
Boy, he took pride in serving his country,
Went off to war no more than a child

My new world was spinning me around
And this is all that I've found
My new world was spinning me around
And time can be my enemy
My new world was spinning me

On a poetic island no past to recall

Feeling the window of time out of mind
Catching a glimpse each one to the other
Always not knowing the spark left behind
Going and going with fictional borders
Passing two feet from the door

My new world keeps spinning me around
And this is all that can be
My new world is ahead of me now
This is all that I've found
My new world keeps spinning me around
My new world keeps spinning me
And time is not my enemy
My new world is ahead of me today
And all things pass away",My New World,2000

Welcome to the mystery, dreams float in a pool in my head

There's Uncle Dick looking sick and half dead
The lights are on and she is home, stretched out on a Kodachrome bed

Transatlantic,"There's a bridge made of light
That crosses between death and life
Where shadows walk in the sun
And desperate lovers run
One day a child and an angel
Stood on either side
Of a magic river
That there was no crossing
But as they tried
The water began to rise
Then they raised their eyes

And as the river fell away
They built a bridge across forever
Between tomorrow and today
There is a bridge across forever

I've had this dream all my life
That doesn't live in black and white
It has no end it just begins
In distant sands and magenta winds
And my love she is standing by the side
Of a magic river that there is no crossing
Maybe someday when our spirits begins to rise
And light fills our eyes

We will meet again someday
On the bridge across forever
I know that we will find our way
To the bridge across forever
Between tomorrow and today
There is a bridge across forever
I know that we will find our way
To the bridge across forever.",Bridge Across Forever,2001
Transatlantic,"In a state of fallen grace
With a smile upon it's face, it came!
Full moon rising today

Like a child but fully grown
Like a star but not so far away!
It came here to take me away

This has never been before
While the sun burns bright as day
Light the sky, hold back no more
Let the full moon rise today
Full moon rising today

So there I was with my complaints
In the comfort of my restraints I stayed
I stayed and had nothing to say
But there it was returning for my eyes
Like a fire that's been burning up the sky
Full moon rising today

There's a town I used to know
There's a place I used ti go to play
Laughin' all the way
Never thought of where I'd been
Autumn wind came creepin' in one day
Now summer's gone away
Summer's gone away, hey

When October winds lay down
When the heat can't melt the ground
And nothing matters anyway
When October winds take hold
When you're down that dank dark road
Maybe nothing matters anyway

Dead on your feet you walk like no one's home
Out on the street you make your way alone
Soldier of fortune camouflaged in blue

Dawn turns to dusk you sail away in doubt
Love turns to lust you've turned it inside out
Soldier of fortune camouflaged in blue (but I know you)

All that you are is not the things you do
You know it's true
All that you are is camouflaged in blue
You know it's true

Dead on your feet you walk like no one's home
Out on the street you make your way alone
Soldier of fortune camouflaged in blue
But I know you now

Don't just sit there wasting your time on the phone
Don't be with that skank 'cause it hurts to be alone
And you swarm around like bees to the hive
And you look a man in full but you're half alive

One flew south, one to the east; one went to the west
You became the enemy just to be the best
Waiting for your dream to arrive
You're whole and you're complete but you're half alive

Waiting for your dream to arrive
You're whole and you're complete but you're half alive 

Pressed to the wall of the rail station hall is the Venus De Milo
You walk through the park 'til the clouds seem to darken the sky
And you wish you could soften your mind
But you feel like they've locked you in time
And you think you'll be perfectly fine once you get to the water

Suddenly you stop 'cause your feet just won't walk
Like there's someone awaiting
The moon seems alive and looks down on your life just to say
It's alright

Innocence and undying love will reign
Innocence and undying love will reign

Hearing the call with your back to the wall in a wordless conundrum
Half of your life 'tween a rose and a knife ain't it time?
You're sure to find

Innocence and undying love will reign
Innocence and undying love will reign
The world will soon be right again
Innocence and undying love will reign
The world will soon be right again
Innocence and undying love will reign

While the clock is turning fast, soak it up before it's passed away
Let it become what it may

Light the sku, hold back no more

Transylvanian Mountain Boys,"Who am i but you and the sun
A sad reflection in everyone
Was it me who let you walk away
Were you the one 
Or is it we're the same

What are we in time going by
The simple story of a younger life
Happy dreams and somehow through the day
We haven't come so far to lose our way

Look at me, i believe it's true
You're a part of me
I'm a part of you

Love is only what we come to knew
The walking, breathing and all with you
A crystal passing reflected in our eyes
Eclipsing all the jealousy and lies

Look at me, can't you see it's true
You're a part of me
I'm a part of you

Quiet as the voices in a dream
Without two shadows the things i've seen
Remember the evening i let you walk away
Were you the one
Or is it we're the same

Look at me, i believe it's true
You're a part of me
I'm a part of you",For Yasgurs Farm,2006

Dream here, dreamin' there
Two pieces all the time

Sobered, wisdoms in my dreams
Bits and pieces in my arms

Bright red, how am I gonna find a way?

Bright red
You have changed me too
Stranger now it seems somehow
Bright red has turned to blue

Tears and shades of gray
I have [Incomprehensible] you

Trapeze,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1975
Trapezoid,"A blacksmith courted me, nine months or better
He bravely won my heart, wrote me a letter
With his hammer in his hand, he looked quite clever
And if I was with my love, I'd live forever

But where is my love gone, with his cheeks like roses
And his good black billycock on, all crowned with primroses
I'm afraid the scorching sun, will shine and burn his beauty
And if I was with my love, I'd do my duty

Strange news has come to town, strange news is carried
Strange news flies up and down, that my love he's married
I wish them both much joy though they can't hear me
And may God reward them well for the slighting of me

Don't you remember well, when you lay beside me
And you said you'd marry me and not deny me
If I said I'd marry you, it was only for to try you
But bring your witness love, and I'll not deny you

Oh witness have I none, save God almighty
And may he reward you well, for the slighting of me
Her lips grew pale and wan, it made her poor heart tremble
To think she loved a one and he proved deceitful
",The Blacksmith,1980
Trapezoid,"We have been so close together
Each a candle each a flame
All the dangers were outside us
And we knew them all by name

   See how the bramble and the rose
   Intertwine
   Love grows like the bramble and the rose
   Round each other we will twine

Now I've hurt you and it hurts me 
Just to see what we can do
To ourselves and to each other 
Without really meaning to

So put your arms around me
And we'll sing a true love song
And we'll learn to sing together
Sing and laugh the whole night long

",The Bramble and the Rose,1983
Trapezoid,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard,1995

When you're near it wraps me up
Now I find the space to feel thrill
Like the water it fills me with peace

When you near me again I still breathe within
And now that you're at my side
Your soul in mine
But I long for your touch
It's hurting so much

You give me, give me colored kisses
Colored kisses for my lips to taste,ah-ah
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay

My head on your shoulder and pray
What else can I do?
Cause all I want is more and more
Colored kisses from you

Yellow is the sun that shines on me
Like your smile it sets me free
Seasons change to blacken my mood
When I falter my heart goes astray
I remember the nights when you'd take me away
Because when I'm at your side
I'm safe and warm but I'm never alone
My heart is your home

You give me, give me colored kisses
Colored kisses for my lips to taste,ah-ah
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray
And that no one can take me from you
And no one can break us in two
So lift it up in the clouds set me free
And let your rainbow all out shine on me

Come back... come back... come back
You give me
Colored kisses for my lips to taste
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray
What else can I do?

And so did I no need to stay

We've been through that, let's look fro something new

Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think it's time for us to walk away from here

Do you remember lying on the beach so late at night
Do you remember running through the sprinklers that night
Do you remember all the songs that I have wrote for you,
all the songs that I have wrote for you
For you, for you
I remember the way you made me feel when I was with you
I remember the smile that always brought me back to you
That look in your eyes I never thought that this could be untrue

"Traum, Artie & Pat Alger","First time you fall for somebody 
The world becomes your lucky star 
You wander around like a peacock 
With your lover on your arm 

Next time you fall 
You think you've heard it all 
No one could turn your insides out 
And your friends hear you say 
If your heart slips away 
I'll wonder what its all about 

And it's first time love, giving you fever 
Second time love, cooling your brow 
Finally love takes your hand in the dark 
And leads you home somehow 

So never say never another 
Just because somebody broke your heart 
Get your chin off the floor 
You'll never know what's in store 
If you don't give love a chance to start 
And if you don't believe in following feelings 

It's never too late to start 
Cause when you open your eyes 
Then you'll realize 
I'm the one who's chasing your heart 

Well it's first time love, giving you fever 
Second time love, cooling your brow 
Finally love takes your hand in the dark 
And leads you home somehow 

And it's first time love making your heart beat 
Second time love making it stop 
Finally love picks you up from the bottom 
And leads you home some how. ",First Time Love,1980

It's like Attica '67 when they, closed the jail
Be careful, but promote yo'selves that's what they told me
Involved but unconcerned fuck beef when it dissolve it does not return
I don't leave, stagnate nor move off-beat
So discrete very rarely do I move on feet
I rough-ride twin rugers on the sides of my seats
Drive-by's, bodies left on both sides of the streets
I blacks out never blind by the size of the image
No disguise, homocide don't rely forensic
Homes's finished, scrambling caught in the scrimmage

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Travelin' Light,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye

And we were lost in each other's eyes
Where loneliness meets paradise

Where the sun burns hot as the devil's gate

Tattooed on my memory is the image of an angel's face

I left her when ther morning broke

Tudo acaba em samba
E a galera já de perna bamba
Só esperando o dia clarear
E a viola tá chorando
O coro tá comendo
E todo mundo tá dançando
O clima está fervendo, eu sei que é pura travessura
E, desse jeito ninguém me segura
É envolvente toso esse clima
Fiquei de olho nessa menina
Mas a danada não quis nada e ainda ficou por cima
Deixa pra lá, o que é que tem
Não vou dar mole pra mais ninguém
Chama a viola tá na hora, chuta a bola
E sai da linha do trem, já falei
Deixa pra lá, o que é que tem
Não vou dar mole pra mais ninguém
Chama a viola tá na hora, chuta a bola

She see the glasses, so obvious
Run from home, after tonight we up out of here
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night
She run her mouth, but can't eat right
Don't read between the line and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless? SMH,
We all know that cocaine killed Abel
From the scholar letters devour this
She stepped into hell, 'cause winter got cold
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul
Don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know
'Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy

I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs, her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me
Here is where her heart

I beg for mercy today
They won't take me away
Take me away from you
Don't know what I would do
Don't let us die in vain
Don't let them see our pain
Wash these demons away
Wash these demons away

You are all unwelcome to Sin City
Yet the population still increases its density
And that increases its intensity
Which increases the propensity
To complicate your simplicity
No matter your ethnicity
All for the sake of publicity, in this city

Huh, bad bitches with ass shots
Use a house as a stash spot
Lexus coupe with the rag-top
I'm in the loop, warm tie like a ascot
I used to run with the have-nots
Kept the ave' hot just so we could have knots
A lot of niggas see they dreams in a glass pot
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
We broke all the commandments
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched
Come spend a day in my Hamlet
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
But this life'll take a toll on ya
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices
I know who Christ is
And he never hung with the Saints it makes no sense to save the righteous
By the age ten, we were caged in
Now they raise men in the state pen
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins
God bless the city, amen

I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me

And now I'm one of the residents
They walk with none of the repercuss', but all of the decadence
And all the fuckin' debauchery
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like
'Cause I could feel it in the air tonight
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite
But I am willing to share tonight
In the city that is as unfair as life",Sin City,2012

At that moment, the one known as Jacq turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch and lead the stampede of lost souls

And get high with me, and come down with me

She like my show lights, she want to be wifey
She know that if she got me then she gon' be good for life

Faster than a hi-hat, sorry baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'

Off the tippy titty, setting off my groupie radar
Sipping Hen, dapping hands off the roof of my Porsche

Nightmares kept a nigga from closing his lids
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gon' know, think the door the haunters ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do? When the zombies are coming for you
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Supply the race, turn the pave, relaxing, I'm whipping
Last week I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefing good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, and loss?
Nah nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie is so rock 'n' roll
My princess Vada know rock 'n' roll daddy got the glow

Like a bald nigga still wearin' du-rags, ha
Israeli guards, boy please be mindful
Don't have words with me 'cause I got a mind full
I could tell Larry David was the mind behind Seinfeld
Wanna know how I feel? Step into my minefield
Wanna know how pain feels? I got off my main pills
Bet my wifey stay close, she know I'm on my Bezos
Opioid addiction, pharmacy's the real trap
Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack
One year it's Illuminati, next year it's the Sunken Place
They don't want me to change, nah, nigga run in place
I need someone else to make this drink, because
You don't understand the juice to vodka ratio
That could satisfy a real drunk, guess what?
Never trust a bartender that don't drink, bitch

Travie McCoy,"Somebody call Doc Phil for real, I need help
I can't see me with no one else
I'm through with the lies, I see your disguise
Besides I can do bad all by myself

I scream, you scream, who's on, who's team
We're suppose to be together through rain and sunny weather
But I seem to bring you nothing but mood swings
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?

But that's what young lovers do, right, wrong
They fight all night long praying the shuffle
Plays the right song and nothing ever stays good, right, wrong
We go through the right songs, hoping one day will play when the fights on

Last night I dreamed you were back on my team
And everything seemed so HD like a wide screen
That's when I woke up, still a little choked up
Just to realize that you and I were still broke up

Ha, what a laugh but the funniest part is the fact
That we actually thought it'd last, the realist shit
To ever come from your lips was that people change
But I'm not your average Joe
So I obviously stay to stay the same

Somebody call Doc Phil for real, I need help
I can't see me with no one else
I'm through with the lies, I see through your disguise
And it's too bad, it's too bad, but I can do bad all by myself

I know we both got a little growing up to do to
To make it work out, to make it work out
Told you exactly how I feel so now it's up to you
To make it work out, to make it work out

I know I sacrificed a lot and baby you did too
To make it work out, to make it work out
If loving you is stupid then I guess I'm a fool

Stuck with me
Hello Ms. Tattoo Girl
You forever
Stuck with me
 
See everyday I asked a new question
To get right through all life a lessons
It's funny to me and I'm noticing that
Every tattoo I see is on the small of a back
It's like damn I can't refuse
All the great ideas that come with tattoos
Like first the rose, then the butterfly
Then the small little catch themes catch your eyes
And even Angelina Jolie got those
The only way you see those is with no clothes
So there's a few who knows
Maybe Brad Pitt know
Billy Bob saw a few so she got some more
I'm sayin'

Then I told her get my name
In all red ink, blood game
Then we cut off the night lamp
And I get up on that ass like a tramp stamp
My tattoo goddess
Love is an art and I'm an artist
 
And one of the hot har-hardest tattoos I ever seen
Is the one on my wife, one that you'll never see
It ain't no tiger, no snake, or no key chain
She went to FAMU, so of course she know T-Pain
Strictly simplicity, ink on your tities be wiggly jiggly
You'll never get rid of me, I'm permanently on the arm

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Uh huh
Thinking back when things were so easy
Got me laughing out loud, for no reason
I use to take them cans back and collect them nickels
Trading garbage pail kid cards for sweet pickles
The whole block used to have G.I. Joe battles
Yeah yer boy had the original storm shadow
And as of lately things have been slow
So I reminisce on when we use to break them windows
Yeah, Til I got snatched by the cops
With a wiffle ball bat and a hand full of rocks (Wasn't me)
Consider this song a throw back
Cause all I wanna do is go back
Y'all sing it with me

Rushing home to watch Video vibrations
Man I tell you Sherry Carter coulda got the business
And I cant forget Rachel from Caribbean rhythms
This was back when Rap city used to play the jams
This is how I first heard about the Wutang Clan
Banged 36 chambers all summer long
And to this day canopy's my favorite summer song
And I can drop names for days
Of all my favorite artists who helped to pave the way
But, we probably need a lot more then just 4 minutes
So this is how I'm gonna end it
Everybody sing

Yeah, I'm on the bus in the back lounge
Sweaty, cold confused in another unfamiliar town
Another sold out show
Spilling my soul to a ton of people I don't know
And I can feel my skin wearing thinner
4th night no appetite for dinner
Shit goddamn well ain't life grand
Getting paid to stand on stage with yer heart in yer hand
Sometimes I squeeze it til they get worried
If this is groundhogs day I guess I'm Bill Murray
And I swear I'm not complaining at all
I love each and everyone of y'all
All I'm really sayin' is

I mean he's so happy she's so free
Doctor what in the world is wrong with me

I just need some ressurance
I know my carrier won't be insurrin' this
If you could just be ernest
Oops I meant honest and make this promise

If any of this makes sense doc I know I wasn't crazy just thoroughly convinced
Go

[Chorus]
She got a set of lips like a sedative
Everytime I kiss her it's like medicine
Somethin's? nope don't let it?
Cause everytime I do I end up upset again
Haha
And then it's back to the waitin' room
Waitin' patiently for them to bring another patient to him
Anything is possible especially when you see it in the hospital
I hope dr feel good can fix me and help me find?

I made a detour quickly I tailed it to the exit door quickly before they could get me
It didn't take much to loose 'em
But before I got home I came to a conclusion
If feelin' means another appointment take?
And don't expect to call in the morning

At the beach with the surfers in Beverly Hills

I adapt to any situation I'm in
And my momma ain't raise no fools
I'm just comfortable in the skin that I am in

Tell him we need him quick

While you're on the phone,
Call up the clocksmith,

Feelin' my self like a braille book,
Double-fistin' two pitchers of pale ale,
Both stale as fuck.

Lined up at the bathroom,

We know what they doin'.

You can bring your friends tonight,
After the club
We can play all the games you like.

But if your cards right,
You'll be wakin' up naked;
What happened last night?

Too bad you're, just another notch in the bedpost,
Tryin' a get close and cuddly.
My girl stays in Brooklyn,
You just my west-coast fuck buddy.
Get that through your skull girl,

Hold tight, it’s gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight baby)
Never never let you drown, even if we’re going down
Hey oh, never let go of me
When I’m sinking

Loose lips sink ships that’s what someone told me
But this boat will stay afloat for as long as you hold me
We been through rough water anytime it was tougher
But the fact I came back to remind you I love ya
And if that’s not enough, well I can one up ya
I pinky promise touch thumbs I’ll never make you suffer
And all I ask in return is some reciprocation
I’ll be your oxygen when you’re running out of patience

So take a deep breath, and hold it tight
My heart is yours just reassure me that you’ll hold it right
Don’t be offended, I’m just the cautious type
To always be around and hold you down and never under, like

Hey oh, never let go of me (Never let go)
Hold tight, it’s gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight baby, hold tight)
Never never let you drown (never), even if we’re going down (Going down)
Hey oh, never let go of me
When I’m sinking

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh

This is my message in a bottle, I hope that you receive it
If it washes up at your feet then open it and read it
To whom it may concern, insert your name here
It’s destiny that we were both born in the same year
Three months apart, but on the same sphere
Staring at the sun, inhaling the same air
This type of love we got, they’ll never get it
I’ll be the Leo DiCaprio to your Kate Winslet
Sometimes I panic but I never take it for granted
I’ll hold you ‘til my lips turn blue like Jack in Titanic
And if I lose my grip, then just promise me this
You’ll keep my love in a locket and always rock it, like

Hey oh, never let go of me (Never let go, never let go)
Hold tight, it’s gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight mama, hold tight)
Never never let you drown (never), even if we’re going down (Going down)
Hey oh, never let go of me

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh

There’s times where like
We find it hard
To hold on to something
That was never meant to be held onto
But you let it go
If it comes back it was meant to be
If not, just let it be, c’mon

Alright, here's how it's going down
You, me and your home girl
Can get a little freaky in my hotel
Just don't let me catch you being sneaky with your phone girl
That's a quick way to get dismissed
Now I hope we on the same page
But that's what I love about college chicks
I keep getting older and they stay the same age
Now turn around and let me get a pick
Good lord, that's a miracle
But don't get too geek, feel them sheets
That's not boyfriend material

But when you lookin' in the Lower East Side
You're bound to find nothing but bad luck
Days can drift by, but I don't give a damn if you with me
Even if the earth exploded, I probably wouldn't notice

El muchacho anda contento y no le veo nada de malo 
En el charco se la lleva y agusto se la navega 
09 esa es su clave claro es de la gente nueva 
Compa beto es conocido donde quiera

Enfiestados, la pachanga es a lo grande para que entrar en detalles 
Eso lo tenemos claro improvisan de repente con corridos se amanese 
Que le toquen aquel dia cada que se siente alegre, pero antes que se avienten la del jefe 
Los consejos de una madre es muy difícil que se olviden 
Tiene grandes amistades porque sabe ser humilde, 
Cuenta con gente importante como el joven de caitime 
El muchacho de la laining es su compadre y amigo 
Cuando se trata de un party suena la música en vivo 
Se conocen de ase tiempo, casi casi desde niños 
Se comenta, que le gusta darse lujos y como al compa jr le gusta romper las reglas 
Y en carreras de caballos muy seguido ase presencia 
También al motor de un carro les encantan las apuestas 
La pachanga va a seguir ganen o pierdan 
Al pendiente, asi lucen los muchachos que se ven acompañando a mi compa el 09 
El gorgin bien activado listo por si algo se ofrece 
Su compa 2 al tanto nuca dice k no puede 
Si se trata de relajo no se duerme 
Por las calles de aguaprieta lo pueden ver transitando 
Cuando el calorsito aprieta nomas cambia de charco 
De repente se amanse con los traviesos tocando

Comiencen y yo les cante el corrido la plebada 
Bien alerta y una lamina en la puerta para cualquier 
Imprevisto las botellas en la mesa y la llelera cerveza 
Se antojaban con solo escuchar el ruido y un buen trago 
Dicen que te quita el frió 

Dos muchachos distinguidos con buen porte 
Y con estilo anfitriones de la fiesta se miraban 
Bien contentos de eso pude darme cuenta llegaban 
Los invitados saludando a los muchachos bien 
Tranquilos por que todo estaba en regla todos saben 
Que un bautizo se festeja 

Mientras brindaban seguido el alcohol asía lo 
Suyo luego el dijo el compa beto toquen hombre 
De respeto así dijo y así fue sabe que andamos 
Al cien por su puesto junto con mi compa JR 
Y a su padre le mandamos un saludo 

A las dos de la mañana se miro una caravana 
Circulando por el charco la ley no les dise nada ya 
Saben de quien se trata y se respeta a los muchachos 
No quiero que pase nada vamos a cerrar la calle y en caliente 
Atravesamos varios carros y los plebes bien atentos con los radios 

Seguían vaciando botellas y cantando acapela corridos 
De la plebada y como cambiar de tema desean en la madrugada

Tiene buen porte y porta una clave 
Por entre el monte se la navega 
Se arden las calles

La sicariada bien al pendiente 
Con una orden que les da el jefe 
Asen pedazos lo que se acerque 
Es muy cierto a diario se juegan la vida de lo cual están consientes 
Cuantos recuerdos trae en su mente 
Jugaba al lodo y un día de pronto cambio su suerte 
Luego las bajas de sus soldados 
En la batalla se la rifaron 

Sus guerrilleros nunca fallaron 
Los muchachos que cayeron aquel día fue porque los emboscaron 
Al interior de una blindada 
Se ve pasiando con 3 o 4 que lo respaldan 
Con los cristales polarisados 
De seguro andan bien equipados 
Y es lo que inpiden los vidrios claros 
Se platica si traen tiro arriba listos para los chingasos

Tal vez llegaron de irak

Creo que en algo me entretuve 
Solo para despistar 
Mi intención era escuchar una verdad 
Aunque yo ya la conozco en realidad 
Portan armas exclusivas del gobierno 
Todo el mundo anda diciendo que aqui son la autoridad 
Es muy cierto la gente no se equivoca 
Si de pronto ve las trocas no se debe preocupar 
Esas claves que llevan es su vestuario 
Las e visto en todos lados 
Se los puedo asegurar 
Mire amigo no se debe atormentar 
Esas claves se las voi a descifrar 

En un brazo traían la clave de un señor 
Es el mismo que ordeno 
La frontera hay que cuidar 
Me imagino que hablan de señor del siglo 
Tiene apoyo de un chapito 
Y otros mas que andan por ahí 
En el otro esta la clave del amigo 
No se como describirlo 
a dado mucho de k hablar 
Siempre al blanco si se trata de pelear 
Su misión es liquidar a su rival 

En la espalda se divisa un logotipo 
Es el nombre del equipo 
Se habla de un grupo especial 
Son soldados contratados por la mafia 
Gente nueva y con agallas 
Dispuestos para atacar 
En combate los muchachos son hermanos 
Siempre se han dado la mano 
Y eso no es confidencial 
Van de frente detonando su arsenal 
Con capuchas o sin ellas les da igual 

Pertenecen a un cartel muy poderoso

También se puede apreciar

Soy nacido en Sinaloa
Soy de un pueblo de Angostura por si alguien tiene una duda

A veces me ven feliz pero la realidad es otra

Tengo una tercia de reinas

Disculpe si no le dicho que estoy muy agradecido por todo lo que me ha dado
He aprendido a valorar las cosas bellas, en verdad me enorgullece mi pasado

Aquel tiempo que jugué con mis hermanos 
Que corríamos risueños y descalzos 
Son momentos que quedaron en mi mente, aunque me cambio la suerte yo empecé de mero abajo

Luego anduve por las calles 
A bordo de una patrulla me dije la vida es dura, pero tengo que buscarle 
Un día me encontré a un amigo y en cuanto me vio me dijo quieres aventarte un jale

Bien recuerdo que le contesté al instante
Usted diga yo estoy listo pa atorarle, 
Desde entonces tengo apoyo del señor, con su hermano ando al millón, los compas ya se la saben

Ahora me cambio la vida

Solo se que no llevo una vida recia 

Con corajes entregaba su trabajo 
Varias veces le quemaron los soldados 
Pero cuando se le daban bien las cosas eso había que festejarlo 
Con amigos se enfiestaba en el poblado

Una de ellas son las broncas cuales vamos a enfrentar

El día y la hora nada te puede cambiar 
Simplemente depronto llega el final

Hasta mero arriba) 

El muchacho en realidad era tranquilo 
Pero arriba se requiere andar al tiro 
Y una escuadra se fajaba en la cintura 
Pa cuidarse del peligro 
Supo manejar las armas desde niño 

La noticia corre por todas las calles 
Y fue ah dar hasta la ciudad de nogales 
Fue muy duro cuando lo supo su gente especial mente su madre
Como no si se trababa de su sangre 

Se presume que siempre fue un hombre serio
Cual fue el motivo del pleito todo mundo se pregunta 
Se rumora que aya en el panteón del pueblo 
Una mujer sin consuelo llora junto de su tumba

Amigo déjate de cosas 

Déjame felicitar a mi ex Esposa 

Tu bien sabes que es ajena
Aunque sigue tan hermosa no se 
Para que te enrredas 

Que importa,, Ahora traes tus uñas largas 
Y te tatuaste la ceja, hoy te vistes elegante 
Y es que no eres tan pen 

Déjala ya esta casada respeta

Quiero decirle palabras que duelan 

Hay lagrimas en su cara que pena

En mi corazon hay odio y tristeza
Deja que voy a decirle la neta
Se mira en tu rostro que te hago falta
Se mira que el pobre viejo te falla
Dile que ne la intimidad nadie me gana
Dile que en tu pensamiento a cada segundo lo engañas
Solo dile que soy único en la cama
Pa' que vas a estar con el si ni siquiera se le

Para no digas eso tal vez le gusta sentir su aliento
Tal vez bajo su temperatura mientras lavaba su dentadura

Dile que solo eres una interesada
Dile que al ver su cartera te sentiste deslumbrada 
Que te fuiste porque yo no tengo nada
Y ahora extrañas esas noches cuando yo te atra

Besabas sus lindos labios pero jamas le decías te amo
No le basto con tu compañía ni disfruto si se la

Mentiras te lo aseguro la hice feliz a cada minuto

Escucha esto querido amigo si te lo digo es porque te estimo
Amigo si así hubiera sido no se hubiera ido

Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Un viernes a medio día
Traiba el cheque completito
Dije que tanto es tantito
Y me metí a aquella cantina

Fue una semana pesada
Y una servecita elada
La verdad se me antojaba
Tambien me la merecía

Me fui directo a la barra
Y antes de que la pidiera
Me dio una cerveza abierta
Cortesía de la casa

A pecho me la tome
Y en cuanto pedí la otra
Muy sexy de falda corta
Se me acerca una mujer

Dijo te invito a MI mesa
No podía decir que no
Era todo un mujeron
Sin pensarlo fui con ella

Llegaron los tacatacas
Como ya andaba entonado
Le eche un grito a los muchachos
Para pedir una pieza

(Saludos)

Una se volvieron varias
Entre cerveza y canciones
Poco a poco se hizo noche
Pero eso a quien le importaba

De pronto escuche a lo lejos
Tal vez no trae ni dinero
Así dijo el cantinero
Cuando mas a gusto estaba

Yo me levante enojado
Ahí traigo con que quererlo
Digame cuanto le debo
A caray andaba errado

Por que ahí no mire la dama
Ella se llevo mi lana
Fue la explicación que daba
Y a chingazos me agarraron

De ahí paca no me acuerdo
Solo que al siguiente día
Desperté en la barandia
Con dolor en todo el cuerpo

Me dejaron encerrado
Asta el lunes me soltaron
No traía ningún centavo
Y es verdad lo que les cuento

Todavía no llego a casa
Necesito un buen pretexto
Mi mujer no anda con cuentos
Las mentiras no se traga

Y es que llegare sin nada
Por andar de boca seca
Se que Mi vieja me espera
Y no es pa ponerme pomada",El  Bocaseca,2015
Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Y con este nos vamos hasta el mero Rió Frió viejo 
Ahí le va compa Ángel! 
Y que se sienta el contrapeso Viejon! 

Dicen que forme un imperio 
Pero que fácil se escucha son muchos años de lucha y eso lo sabe mi gente 
A mi estilo a mi manera con cerebro y estrategias pude salir adelante 
tengo metas en mi mente y una de ellas es siempre mirar al frente 

Mi niñes no se me olvida 
Basta con cerrar los ojos y al acordarme de todos se me viene una sonrisa 
Y me veo en los arroyos también corriendo entre lodo 
Yo también tengo un pasado por aquel que no sabia 
De pequeño ya sabia lo que quería 

Me presento yo soy Ángel 
También empece de abajo sin hacer mucho relajo de pronto forme mi empresa 
Trabajaba sin descanso para cumplir un encargo 
A mi padre antes de irse yo le hice una promesa 
Ve tranquilo que esto corre por mi cuenta 

Ahora me gane el respeto 
No soy de los mas buscados pero donde quiera que ando mis muchachos me acompañan 
Cada quien sabe su cuento y tal vez sea por eso que a donde quiere que voy 
Traigo mi bolsa terciada puede ser que guarde un as bajo la manga 

Muchos se preguntara, cual es el significado de los tatuajes que traigo 
La respuesta es muy sencilla 
Lo que resalta en mi cuello es descendencia de mi abuelo 
La empresa que represento y lo demás pues ni se diga 
Son pasajes importantes de mi vida 

No me siento mas que nadie 
Con mi equipo ando al bagazo todos vamos en un barco donde soy el capitán 
Hay tormentas y huracanes pero vamos adelante

Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Dicen que es nuevo en la empresa
Sin hacer preguntas
Paso cada prueba
Dejo las patrullas
Se integro a la guerra
No quedaron dudas
Gira de pelea
Cuida su estructura
Tambien su bandera
Encuentros improvisados
Tambien movimientos
Bien organizados
En varios eventos
Ha participado
Detona su cuerno
Revienta contrarios
Dicen que un camello

Siempre anda a su lado
Apoyo no le ha faltado
Brinca su compadre
Con solo un llamado
Con la herramienta adecuada
Defiende la plaza
Sigue controlando
2 decadas lo respaldan
Eso ya esta confirmado
La comision se respeta
Se mira al volante
Tambien en paqueta
Se activa al instante
Si dicen que hay guerra
No se siente grande
Ni se menosprecia
Sabe ser humilde

Y eso es lo que cuenta
No voy a entrar en detalles
Ignoro su nombre
Al igual que su clave
Se que anda a la orden
Se que anda en Nogales
No es viejo, no es joven
Puedo asegurarles
Todos ya conocen
Sus actividades
Con el debido respeto
Le mando un saludo
Al señor de sombrero
Toda la raza anda activa
Con el tiro arriba

Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Si te quieres ir, pues vete 
Te doy mi palabra no hacer nada para detenerte 
Así me emborrache nunca iré a buscarte para que regreses 
Yo también me rindo no nos entendimos 
Agarra camino ya no quiero verte 

Si te quieres ir, que esperas 
Yo te doy luz verde te deseo suerte vete cuando quieras

Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Orgulloso me siento de mi gente de mi pueblo
Por su lucha, para salir adelante
Allá todo es distinto donde las calles se encharcan con las lluvia
A mi nadie va a contarme
Despiertas cada día con el canto de los gallos
Sabes que pa' que rinda tienes que levantarse temprano
Eso a mí no se me olvida, como olvidarse del rancho

Los golpes de la vida, los tropiezos, las caídas al final
Nos enseñan ser humildes
Recuerdo en ocasiones nada mas comimos tortillas con sal
Y eso no me puso triste
Era feliz en toda la extensión de la palabra
Como toda la bola de pequeño trabajaba
Son cosas que no se borran, son pasajes de la infancia

Recuerdo que las noches nos podían dar las 12 en una esquina
Esos tiempos ya se fueron
Con una resortera muy seguido nos fuimos de casería
Como devolver el tiempo
Renuncias a la escuela aunque seas un buen alumno
Olvidas la tarea cuando no hay pa´ el desayuno
Hace falta una moneda, es cuando sales sin rumbo

Las bromas las carrillas deberás que día a día las recuerdo
Y nada más me sonrió
El campo, los canales, el ganado, los corrales no les miento
Cuando digo que es lo mío
Hay veces que me sueño por un lado de la hornilla
Primero asiendo fuego después cachando tortillas
Como no echar de menos al pueblo donde vivía

Cuando todo parece estar en regla el viejón se me adelanta
Todavía no lo entiendo
El era un hombre fuerte y además toda la gente lo apreciaba
Hoy me quedan sus recuerdos
Hoy miro por los míos como un día lo hizo mi padre
Avanzo despacito voy mirando hacia adelante
No dejes de ser sencillo eso es lo más importante",Recuerdos Do Mi Infancia,2015
Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Oficial, no me vea como si fuera un criminal 
Sé que mi color de piel no es de su agrado 
Lo he notado su semblante lo ha gritado 
Una vez y muchas más 
Y yo no hablo por hablar

La verdad es que yo no vine aquí para robar 
Si así se portan conmigo 
Que según traigo un permiso 
Cual sería su castigo si yo fuera un ilegal 
No me quiero imaginar

Todo el peso de la ley para el de afuera 
Te cambian balas por piedras 
Y ahí es donde está el detalle 
Se aferraron a ponernos mil barreras 
No entiendo porque hay fronteras

Como un par de gotas de agua 
Tampoco me entiende nada 
Y así cree que es el mejor

No soporto que se rían

Y una mentada inyección 
Quien les dio autorización?

Fuiste tú

Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Muchos dicen que se oculta que se esconde
Otros cuentan que el señor es de la sierra por eso vive en el monte
Que le gusta disfrutar de las montañas
Que le importa si no duerme en una cama esa es la vida del hombre
No se asuste ni se asombre

A lo lejos se divisa una fogata
Reportaron que un convoy de un informados poco a poco se acercaba
Los calibres apuntaban al camino
Para dar la bienvenida me imagino pero no es que se animaban
Marcaron la retirada
Son 3 letras las que marcan los paquetes
Son 3 hombres los que le cuidan la espalda 
Ya ven que hay gente corriente
Nivel diez es el blindaje que manejan
Rifles cortos que escupen como un 50 son estrategias de un jefe

El sabe el teje y maneje

(Y hay que va pa toda la plebada de Caborca Sonora
Pueblos alrededores, la gente de sonorita uy)
Esa voz que anda al pendiente de la sierra
A los plebes dijo montense a los guamis que la fiesta nos espera
En caliente se jalo rumbo a la playa
Donde quiera trae su gente de batalla se rumora en la frontera
Es el de la cangurera! 
De temprano de bajo de una palapa
Platicaban los pasajes de la vida mientras su grupo tocaba
Eran sabias las palabras de ranchero
Ya gustoso de pronto jalo su cuerno rodeado de su plebada
Que bonito se escuchaba",El  Sr. De La Sierra (El De La Canguera),2015
Traviezoz De La Zierra,"A su gente les dijo voy solo no tengan pendiente
Sus soldados jamás cuestionaron la orden del jefe
Decidido se montó a su carro le abrieron el paso y salió de repente
No sabía que en la capital lo esperaba la muerte

En el charco sonó un celular para dar la noticia
Su comando quiso reaccionar y salieron de prisa
Se dice que llegando a las minas les llego la orden mejor no prosigan
Porque el jefe haya en el hospital ha perdido la vida

Por los medios no se supo nada no tenían idea de quien se trataba
Revisaron muy bien los archivos buscando al amigo y la misión fallaba
No había fotos, nombres y apellidos que lo delataran
Solamente lo que platicaban

Agua prieta al igual que caitime se encuentran de luto
El desierto y la sierra están tristes cayo el compa 1
Los soldados mueren en la guerra
No de esta manera no de un juego sucio
Ni siquiera pudo defenderse pa' morir agusto

Sin consuelo su gente le llora

Salió en caravana el de las 20 trokas
Así es como se acaba el corrido y termina la historia
De ese joven que andaba en sonora",Su Ultima Caravada,2015
Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Transitaba en el centro de la ciudad 
Renegaba del aire acondicionado que no quiso funcionar 
No había nada que no me hiciera enojar 
La verdad que me quejaba hasta del tono que traía en mi celular 
El semáforo marcaba una luz roja 
Y un chamaco brinco al cofre de mi troca 
Sin zapatos y de vestimenta rota sonreía al trabajar 
Y empecé a reflexionar 

Mientras el niño limpiaba el parabrisas 
Un anciano de algunos 80 años decía lleven la noticia 
En sus manos el periódico traía 
Yo sin habla solamente lo escuchaba la verdad no lo creía 
En voz baja le pedí que se acercara 
Pregunte por cada uno cuánto gana 
Es un peso y tengo que venderlos todos en el trascurso del día 
Para que no me despidan 

Le propongo que se vaya a descansar 
Se los compro le pague y le di propina al chamaco por igual 
El calor nunca dejo de presionar 
A lo lejos un carrito de tres ruedas se veía circular 
Un amigo vende bolis y paletas no anda solo lo acompañan sus muletas 
A pesar de que le faltaba una pierna alegre lo escuche silbar 
De su casa el pilar 

De por sí ya tenía un nudo en la garganta 
Y una niña con pintura en su carita tiro al aire tres naranjas 
Con su número nadie se impresionaba 
Fue muy clara cuando nos dijo su ayuda la quiero para mi hermana 
Con sus ojos apunto hacia la banqueta 
Donde estaba una pequeña muy enferma 
La verdad es que no quiero que se muera por sus medicinas caras 
Aunque ya este desahuciada 

Casi a diario nos quejamos de la vida 
Cuando muchos van luchando por el mundo por una comida al día 
Habrá quienes ni siquiera se imaginan 
Dicen dónde y es cuestión de que se asomen a la vuelta de la esquina 
Les parece si enfrentamos el problema 
Ayudemos con un granito de arena 
Les propongo que cuando les toque el rojo si se puede lo analizan 
Nadamas aver que opinan",A  Ver Qué Opinan,2015
Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Creo que se les olvido como decirlo
Alto al fuego
Porque diablos cuando hablan del enemigo, muchos niños caen al suelo
No es posible que ambos se sigan el juego
Han convertido su mundo en un infierno,
Solo se oyen los estruendos sin piedad y compasión
¿Cómo quieren que les demos la razón?
Excelente son soldados que defienden
Su bandera
Pero es demasiado el odio que se tienen
Tanto que viven en guerra
Y hoy lo quieren arreglar a su manera
Tal parece que se rompieron las reglas

Mientras que se bombardean yo compongo esta canción
¿Cómo quieren que les demos la razón?
El problema no es su rabia
Si no con quien la desquitan
No piensan bajar la guardia
Siguen cargando sus armas
Se siguen haciendo jiras
Quieren un mejor mañana y no dejan de disparar
No se escuchan mis palabras
Pero si las carcajadas de un mentado satanás
Tal parece que se inyectaron veneno
Que tristeza
Que no hay alguien que diga ya estuvo bueno

Y exija una media vuelta
En su mente no está planeada una tregua
Al contrario siguen buscando estrategias
Para eso si los entrenan no para pedir perdón
¿Cómo quieren que les demos la razón?
Se les puede comparar con soldaditos
De juguete
Ni siquiera conocen al enemigo
Pero ya lo dijo el jefe
Y una orden solamente se obedece
Eliminan a mucha gente inocente

Hay pequeños y mujeres que no encuentran salvación
¿Cómo quieren que les demos la razón?
El problema no es su rabia
Si no con quien la desquitan
No piensan bajar la guardia
Siguen cargando sus armas
Se siguen haciendo jiras
Quieren un mejor mañana y no dejan de disparar
No se escuchan mis palabras
Pero si las carcajadas de un mentado satanás
Creo que se les olvido como decirlo

Traviezoz De La Zierra,"El hombre nació en Chihuahua
Y en la etapa de su infancia, lo trajeron a las gruyas

Donde iba hacer de las suyas, de niño cuidaba bacas
Y aunque los años pasaban, tenia presente su cuna

Hablo de Alvaro Bojorquez, a muchos les suena el nombre
De eso puede estar seguro, lo vieron chambiando duro

Tenia amigos a montones y al llenarse los camiones
Festejo cada que pudo

Aunque fue un hombre de campo, se ganaba sus centavos
Le fue bien en lo negocios, tuvo errores como todos

También era enamorado y si se trataba de un trago
También se empinaba el codo

Supo ver por su familia, en la mesa había comida
Para su esposa y su hijos

No era pobre ni era rico

Y al mirar las nueve crías, nada más se sonreía
Y encendía un cigarrillo

El tiempo no se detiene, mientras que los hijos crecen
Uno se va haciendo viejo, y un doctor dijo lo siento

Pero el hombre era muy fuerte y lucho incansablemente
Más o menos año y medio

Un día no pudo más y en la mera navidad
Decidió cerrar los ojos,
Así es la vida y ni modo

Hoy su gente lo recuerda, en la gruya margen izquierda

Por que fue amigo de todos",Alvaro Bojorquez,2016
Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Que ando trabajando chueco
No conocen mi secreto
De plebillo andaba mal
Fue cuando dijo mi apa
Mijo póngase las pilas
Que aquí lo voy a dejar
Viendo por una rendija me di cuenta que se iba del lugar
Había que reconocer
Era por mi propio bien
Muchas gracias ahí nos vemos
Les dije ya muy sereno
Y no lo podía creer toda la gente del pueblo
Cuando me vieron un libro que hablaba del paraíso
Hasta se rieron
Todo estaba en su lugar y en realidad no nos importó ser pobre
En la sierra te enseñas a trabajar
Siempre lo dijo mi apa
Que no falten los frijoles
Esos tiempo les diré sin titubear
Pa mi fueron lo mejores
Si señores

Luego todo iba a cambiar
Las cosas salieron mal
Me arrebatan a mi viejo
Y eso se quedó en mi pecho
No pude con tanta rabia
Sentí morirme por dentro
Y a los puros 17 ya atendía los pendientes con mi cuerno
Si hablamos con mi carnal
Nunca lo voy a olvidar
Si porque me ven armado
Tal vez me tachen de malo
Creen que yo no siento nada
Si tampoco soy de palo
Por eso rumbo a las playas se movía
Mi plebada pa un encargo

El dolor no se termina
Te lastima cuando lo llevas por dentro

Que en mi vida yo jamas me imaginé que mi suerte hiba a cambiar
Soy el que vendia tamales y empanadas
El que por cierto mi hermano me acompañaba
La verdad que no nos importaba nada solo ayudar a mama
El tiempo debio pasar
Luego me hice militar
No es difícil aprender a usar las armas cuando piensas en cenar
Poco a poco fui conociendo el ambiente
En un juego de arruinar al delincuente
Como nunca se miraron los billetes yo ya no quise jugar
Dije no esta por de mas
Que tal si ya apuesto al mar
Los pescados aquí no fueron pescados y tube que renunciar

Pensativo con los pies dentro del agua
Nunca olvido mi bello puerto de waimas
De mi rifle y mi prechera me acordaba dije por aqui no hay mas
El señor y su carnal
Me invitaron a cambear
Que chulada de ante mano muchas gracias por esa oportunidad
Desde entonces me la llevo en la frontera
Me permiten les voy a decir mi lema
En la vida todo marcha sobre ruedas cuando existe la lealtad
Tengo mucho que contar
Pues me paso a retirar

Tienes que salirle al toro

Empezaba lo mero bueno

Y así es, y que creen
Somos nosotros)

Aquel sueño ya era toda una aventura
El muchacho de Angostura iba pa arriba
Después de quitarse el traje
Se ponía los huaraches
En el rancho lo apodaron La Tuyia

Fue sencillo de principio hasta el final
Y eso es algo que le inculcaron sus padres
Saludaba a todo mundo
Fue mi compa y lo presumo

Han trascurrido varios años
Y hoy quiero tomarme unos tragos
Voy a empezar con la primera
Ya llego el que andaba ausente

Cuanto soñé con este dia
Esa casita onde vivia
Y con esfuerso hizo mi apa
De nuevo la he vuelto a pisar
No esta de mas que se los diga los recuerdos no se van

Otra vez escuche los gallos que cantaron
Respire el aire de campo
Y me acorde cuando era niño
Otra vez pude disfrutar de una caguama
Y tomar con la plebada

Y pasen me otra bien helada
Que de repente agarro biada
De nuevo se oye la carilla junto con las carcajadas
Aqui la historia no se acaba si por mi fuera me quedaba
Pero ahy que darle pa delante

Un dia me lo dijo mi padre 
""Andele mijo echele ganas ya empezo no hay que afrojarle""
Otra vez estreche la mano de mi raza
Pero aqui se rompio una taza
Por eso ahy que agarrar camino
Luego nos vemos para seguir con la charla
En cuanto tengamos chanza mientras tanto les repito
Hace tiempo que no estaba donde un dia
 Vivi mi infancia rodeado de mis amigos",Otra Vez en el Rancho,2016
Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Resalta su personaje
No se vallan en el viaje
Si anda contenta es que salieron bien las cuentas
Los negocios marchan bien
Siempre anda alerta
Y cuando empaca sus maletas es que así tiene que ser
Hay algo que resolver
Creo que este día al parecer tenemos fiesta
Va llegando un X6

En un crucero tal vez
Igual bajando de un jet
En el sistema no existe ningún problema
Mucho menos su poder
En su equipaje no nada que la delate
Menos su forma de ser
Es mucha su sencillez
Así es la vida hay que vivirla
Y de la tierra, no hay que despegar los pies

Quiero que truene la banda en mi cumpleaños
Derrepente ya no estamos
Y hoy me quiero festejar
Quien me quiere acompañar
Quiero todo transparente
Y al igual que estén presentes
Mis amigos de verdad

Los recuerdos no se irán
Lo tengo que mencionar
No lo asimila y para no andar tan pensativa
Mejor se pone a chambear
Se despavila para recargar las pilas
Y por la orilla del mar
Se le ha visto caminar
Es muy directa, las mentiras la molestan
Y es cuando tiene que actuar

Y no tiene compromisos
Y la sierra es un paraíso
Le gusta el campo también se jala pal rancho
Con su gente y con sus hijos
Una botella para jugar al tiro al blanco
Nomas vuelan los casquillos
No importan los estallidos
En un caballo la pueden ver cabalgando
Siempre con su escuadra al cinto

Quiero que truene la banda en mi cumpleaños
Derrepente ya no estamos
Y hoy me quiero festejar
Quien me quiere acompañar
Esas fueron sus palabras y a petición de la dama
Yo también quiero brindar",A  Petición de la Dama,2016
Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Yo soy fuerte
Si me caigo me levanto y voy al frente
Son mil cosas las que pasan por mi mente
Por supuesto soy valiente y puedo aguantar el dolor
Los doctores, me analizan, me ayudan a que mejore
Mi sonrisa trato de que no se borre
Y alimento mi autoestima, con corridos y canciones
Me pongo en manos de Dios

No me rindo, yo aquí sigo en la batalla
No pienso bajar la guardia, yo luchare hasta el final
Yo me aferrare a la vida, sera una lucha cansada
Pero lo voy a lograr

No voy solo, mucha gente me acompaña
En las buenas y en las malas, si los corro no se van
Nunca me han dado la espalda, familiares y camaradas
No los voy a defraudar

Sabemos que no será fácil
Y sera una lucha continua y cansada
Pero con fe, todo se puede en esta
Vida viejo, animo!

No me doblo
Soy guerrero y le voy a salir al toro
Si Dios me quiere en el cielo ya ni modo
No reniego, no me opongo, si el así lo decidió

Adelante
Estoy consciente de que es una lucha constante
Mientras encuentran la cura para el cáncer
Con la sonrisa en mi rostro, como se los dije antes
Me pongo en manos de Dios

No me rindo, yo aquí sigo en la batalla
No pienso bajar la guardia, yo luchare hasta el final
Yo me aferrare a la vida, sera una lucha cansada
Pero lo voy a lograr

No voy solo, mucha gente me acompaña
En las buenas y en las malas, si los corro no se van
Nunca me han dado la espalda, familiares y camaradas
No los voy a defraudar

Por que así dice y así queremos que sea, claro!
Y alguien lo dijo un día, que la fe mueve montañas
Puede ser mucho el cansancio, puedes llorar a escondidas
Pero saldrás adelante, siempre y cuando no te rindas

Esta va para todos los guerreros!",Por Que Soy Guerrero,2016
Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Me hice viejo en el penal
Eso es algo que nunca podre olvidar
Conseguí mi libertad
Yo sabia que algún día lo iba a lograr
Me acusaron nomas así porque si
Cuantas fechas importantes me perdí
Para los que me robaron media vida
Les vengo a dar la noticia, ya sali
Me sentencian y se van
Todavía me pregunto donde están
Creo que les fallo su plan
Si querían que me pudriera en el penal
Cada instante que viví bajo la sombra 
Nunca me voy a quitar de mi memoria
Un día dije aquí no acabara mi historia
Tengo que volver al rancho de la Noria
Muchas veces me soñaba aya en el rancho
En esas tierras que andube desde plebillo
30 años dicen que se van volando, ojala que le calara el que lo dijo
No se olvidan aquellos días oscuros
Y aunque yo tenia mis lujos, aquí afuera esta mejor

Si supieran que conté cada minuto
Pero hoy todo mundo supo del regreso de un señor
Ahora ya nada es igual
Creo que los tiempos cambiaron para mal
Hoy todos quieren pelear
Cargan con el tiro arriba un arsenal
Tal parece que hoy reina la desconfianza y te vas a ir a la lona si das chanza
En mis años nada mas se trabajaba y se arreglaban las cosas con palabras
Aquí andamos otra vez
Y no ocupo presentarme ya lo se
Esto grabencelo bien
En la vida se sufre pa merecer
Tengo grandes amistades donde llego y pa variar donde quiera me paseo
A mi estilo supe ganarme el respeto con el rico y con el pobre me codeo
Muchas veces me soñaba aya en el rancho, en esas tierras que andube desde plebillo
30 años dicen que se van volando, ojala que le calara el que lo dijo

Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Recuerdo muy bien el día cuando me vine del rancho
Era un plebe todavía, yo tenia 14 años eso ni como olvidarlo
Le di un beso a mi familia y salí rumbo a la orilla con el sueño americano
Yo quise un cambio de vida y le dije adiós al ganado
La verdad no se me olvidan aquellos días nublados peleando con el arado
Muchos ni se lo imaginan me arrime una buena chinga y eso no me lo han contado
Una camioneta vieja pero como me paseaba
Un burrito bien alerta por si el has se me acababa de seguro me cargaba
Ni si quiera lo planeas pero hay cosas que se quedan 
Que no se borran con nada, se te quedan en el alma

Si ves que esta muy oscuro es que ya va amanecer
Es el dicho de mi madre y ha acertado la mujer batallamos pa comer
Lo confirmo y lo aseguró es cierto el camino es duro mas no hay que retroceder
Hoy puedo jalar la banda también bailar mis caballos
Se que el respeto se gana y no me lo ando recargando soy el que salió del rancho
A veces me doy mis lujos, esta vida la disfrutó, pero nunca ando con panchos
Soy el que agarro camino con sus huaraches cruzados
Ahora lucho por los míos hoy los tiempos han cambiado pues también me la he rifado
Un abrazo a mis amigos y a mi esposa y a mis hijos, ya saben que los extrañó
Ya saben cuanto los amo",Los Tiempos Han Cambiado,2016
Traviezoz De La Zierra,"Desde niño le gustaban las alturas
Y su sueño fue volar alguna vez

Desde niño les gustaban las alturas
Y su sueño fue volar alguna vez
Se que un día vieron aquella criatura
Corriendo de un lado a otro con aviones de papel
Se dispuso a comenzar una aventura
Dijo algún día seré piloto
Tal vez no lo han de creer
Tengo ganas y se que lo lograré
Dicho y echo a si lo dijo y a si fue

El apoyo claro que no iba a faltar
Algo que se requería en su carrera
Le dijeron tu no le aflojes carnal
Un día volarás tan alto y llegarás a donde quieras
Por supuesto que el que pone ve pasar
Y a la vuelta de unos años allá les cayó en la sierra
Dijo ""donde porque voy aterrizar""
En el monte ya tenía lista una brecha

Y así fue rompiendo el aire
Los consejos de su madre siempre los tuvo presente
A gusto se la pasaba
Tomando con plebada cada vez que hiba pal 7
Nomas retumbaba El Karma
Y esa del Toro Encartado cuando andaba en la Cheyenne

(Porque los aviadores no mueren. Simplemente, vuelan más alto)

Un orgullo para todos sus hermanos
Como no si se trataba del menor
Es cierto que fue renuente de chamaco
Pero busco la manera de cambiar y lo logró
Les sirvieron los consejos y regaños
Puso los pies en la tierra y ya jamás los despegó
Muy sonriente y tarareando una canción
Fue el semblante antes de subirse a un avión

Desde arriba divisaba el paraíso
Por encima de las nubes transito
Muy contento se le miraba a Toñito
Aquel niño había crecido ya era todo un aviador
Daba un brinco cuando el flete estaba listo
Hizo lo que tanto quiso y nunca dijo que no
En la sierra la frontera se movió
Aquel sueño claro que lo realizó

Y así fue rompiendo el viento
Todo cambia en un momento si las cosas salen mal
De pronto se oyó un estruendo
Luego se vistió de fuego
Ya no pudo reaccionar, no tuvo oportunidad
Y aquí se acaba el corrido de Toñito el Capitán",Toñito el Capitán,2016

Que este va hasta el meritito rio frio 
Fierro compa chente 
Y que suenen los traviesos viejon 

Mientras muchos me señalan con el dedo 
Yo sigo para delante 
Se me acusa de que un dia sali del pueblo 
Y ahora me e vuelto importante 

Claro que tengo presente de onde vengo 
Y hacia donde me dirijo 
La corbata se las quedare debiendo 
Ya saben que no es lo mio

Allá por mi adolescencia

De seguro ese es mi estilo 
Formo parte de los grandes empresarios 
Que me miran sencillo 

Tengo gente que apoya mis decisiones 
Nunca me han dejado solo 
El trabajo es en equipo chavalones 
Y han sido muchos los logros 
Y orgulloso estoy de todos 

Hay un ángel que me cuida desde arriba 
Al cual yo lo echo de menos 
Yo le prometí mirar por la familia 
Y eso es lo que estoy haciendo 

Con un trago se me vienen los recuerdos 
A como extraño a mi padre 
Mientras muchos me señalan con el dedo 
Yo juego mi personaje

I'll stay
