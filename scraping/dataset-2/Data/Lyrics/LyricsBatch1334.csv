Bobby Johns,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Bobby Johns,"Blue Spanish eyes
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please, please don't cry

This is just adios and not goodbye
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say ""Si, si""
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me

Blue Spanish eyes
Prettiest eyes in all of Mexico
True Spanish eyes

Please smile at me once more before I go
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say ""Si, si""
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me

Bobby Jones,"(Verse 1) 
I thought I lost, but actually I won 
For by His blood we all have overcome 
There is no failure, our God can never loose 
And that same power, it now belongs to You 

(Chorus) 
Now it?s time to celebrate all banners raised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Every situation I face, I win 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
And everything works for my good in the end 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 

(Verse 2) 
I was on my way to a burning hell 
The devil, he had my life set up to fail 
But thanks be to my God who causes me to triumph, overcome, tread upon the enemy 

(Chorus) 
Now it?s time to celebrate all banners raised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Every situation I face, I win 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
And everything works for my good in the end 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 

(Verse 3) 
Somebody who?s listening right now You think You?re losing 
You feel like You can?t win ?cause You tried everything 
Greater is He that is within You don?t doubt 
?Cause whatever You?re in now, God says 
You have to come out 

(Chorus) 
Now it?s time to celebrate all banners raised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Every situation I face, I win 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
And everything works for my good in the end

Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train, got my baby and gone

Well, it took my baby, but it never will again
No, not again

Bobby Keyes,"Dear landlord
Please don't put a price on my soul
My burden is heavy
My dreams are beyond control
When that steamboat whistle blows
I'm going to give you all I got to give
And I do hope you receive it well
Depending on the way you feel that you live

Dear landlord
Please heed these words that I speak
I know you've suffered much
But in this you are not so unique
All of us, at times we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much
And anyone can fill his life up
With things he can see but he just cannot touch

Dear landlord
Please don't dismiss my case
I'm not about to argue
I'm not about to move to no other place
Now, each of us has his own special gift
And you know this was meant to be true
And if you don't underestimate me
I won't underestimate you",Dear Landlord,1976

And I'm bound to keep on riding 
And I've got one more silver dollar 
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no 
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider 

And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing 
And the road goes on forever 
And I've got one more silver dollar 
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no

Bobby Keyes,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1976
Bobby Kimball,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Bobby Kimball,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me
towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way,
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient
melodies
He turned to me as if to say,
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever
do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (Oh
uh)

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the
Serangeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside,
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever
do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (Oh
uh)

Bobby Kimball,"If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared
Now you're gone, I'm really not the same, I guess I held
Myself to blame
Time can erase the things we said
But it gives me time to realize that you're the one who's
Sad

You know I won't hold you back now, the love we had just
Can't be found
You know I can't hold you back now
 
Now that I'm alone it gives me time to think about the
Years that you were mine
Time can erase the love we shared

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [*],1996

We've tried it on our own

Every step I take retreats

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Bobby Lewis,"Well, here we are again
I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

When love is truly right
(This time it's truly right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh, and on the way it grows
But it never disappears

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

Always just beyond my touch
You know I needed you so much
After all, what else is livin' for?

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts

Until the day I can no longer hide

Down comes the storm drowning his old faithfuls
And they sing a thousand songs from the depths of bloody hell
They take his soul from their handfuls
And her heart it skips a beat as her senses take a sleep
And the world turns so slowly to a creep
They faithful kiss their crosses but their hate still spreads the disease

Stacked up in formation
That mean much before
They're lining the fire

As the bottomless heat goes
To harness your anger
Your blood and
Your deepest desire

Because there's no truth stolen
That's been ever brought forward
By the minds of the writers
Looking face down on the gutter

'Cause this world's full of thinkers
And suffragette speakers
Who deny that they ever wear a dress
Oh, this god forsaken town is in a mess

Ravaging the whores
Ignoring constant calls

Bobby Long,"I lost my English soul,
Pulling out the corpse,
Sheltering in the Trenches again,
Crying for a lose,

I let my arms down,
Walked away in a trance,
There's parts of me layer out,
All over France,

So I took my last waltz,
Got caught up in the wire,
Wrote a letter for my love,
As I head from the fire,

An old solider carried me,
Way to the coast, bathe my wounds in the sea,
I'm in the hands of a ghost, im in the hands of a ghost
Their boats came on in,

I tried to run away,
I got taken half by the throat,
In the burning light of day
Set down with the iron punch,

So broken and alone,
Left my blood on the beach for the tide to take me home
These wounds that I shed inside,
Two years old

So my girl she gave up,
She had taken me for dead,
She had forgot all her promises and everything she said,
Living in the darkest dream,

I rose up in the cold
These wounds that I have outside,
Are two years old,
These wounds that I have outside,

Are two years old,
Two years old
Living in the past,
Living by the mile I toke the same walk down,

As I did as a child,
The flags flew for a man,
Unaware of the fate no one saw me walk down, on my very last parade,
So thoughts turn to dust,

As I headed for the mound,
I strayed up the part, waiting for the count,
Living in the darkest dream so broken and all alone
These pain that I have inside is two years old

These scars that I have inside are more than two years old
These pain that I have inside is two years old
These scars that I have inside are more than two years old
Is more than two years

Is more than two years

So spare the ghosts around my neck
The winds against the sails,
I'm shivering up a storm of roadside pines,
Thirst shreds the ballast cold
And shows the olden times

I'm bold and sorrow thrown into the day,
Into the barrels of the sun I turned and found a way,
The naked branches cut the empty air,
The river birds have fled away
From all their wear and tear

The covered surface hugs the board
But keeps in the sky,
A childhood glimpse that keeps you warm
But hangs you to dry,
The shameful dream, the shameful face
That pulls on your heart,
Those brittle winds will keep the dawn
From you at the start

So bring me choirs to ease me on my way,
So bring me screams of organs for the day,
So bring me choirs to brighten all the gales,
So bring me screams of organs and the wails,
of winter tales

I heard a lonely voice cut through the rain,
""So take away my conscious mind and
take away my fame,""
To embrace the day to cut through my only soul,
I'd starch my love of all its parts

Behind the prison is the dove
While the moon decides your grace you're in love
Just for a spell that hand in hand like does
Laughing like the birds beneath the pier

Beyond the dark that stings your mouth you've still got fear

So rest your mind in your darkest thoughts you'll feel alright

The lovers march through nuts and bolts to fix your day

Beyond the old time Ferris wheel
The trouble swap their thoughts for gold so you can't feel

Your blood and
Your deepest desire

Because there's no truth stolen

And suffragette speakers
who deny that they ever wear a dress

As it grabs you by the throat
And strings out all the times you've used

You turn yourself to nighttime
Trying to find your feet

So let me run

That light sends a shudder

To flourish the darkness

But the rich kids on the corner
Betting off on solitaire
Just to lay the poor upon the boys
Walking out, they're on your shoes
Like chalk upon the face of Rex
Beating out to keep their head above the noise

So sing a song in sixpence
I'll stick it to the change

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2004
Bobby Lyle,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you

No heart so true

You are mine alone.

Love has kissed me in a beautiful way
Holding hands ain't everybody's thing

I tell you I mean it

To be in love with someone
It's so hard to be in love with

Is your very best friend

Is rocking your cradle
Better than you can
Rock your cradle yourself

If I ever cross your mind

And get yourself a pistol

And then you make it
Back up on the scene
Where your loved one and your
Best friend are now together

You go right in and bust
Down the door and shoot him
You can't shoot her
Because you know if you shoot her
All of your love and your long
Lifetime will be gone forever

And just as you make it up
In your mind to forgive her
Here come another one of
Your best friends through the door

This really makes you blow your top
And you go right ahead and go in person
To your heart and shoot her

And realizing what you've done
You say, baby, please forgive me
I'm sorry

And with her last dying breath
She looks up at you and say

Some girls just want some fun
Some look for devotion
Some just wanna run
Some crave for affection
Burnin' up inside
Some need the direction
For the world outside
You can dance the dance 'til the mornin' comes
But I'll tell you where I'm comin' from

I wanna hear your soul' talkin'
Wanna hear your soul' talkin'
Wanna hear your soul' talkin'

It's the root of the cause
It's the still of the moment

And I don't need a slave

Bobby McFerrin,"Of all life's treasuries
One is most preciously
Kept in my heart
And that's the loyalty of friends

And family gathered 'round
And making joyous sounds
Familiar voices warm the heart
I find myself alone and feelin' blue
Then I know what to do

I phone my friends in melancholy
And then sometimes I'm filled with doubt
Something will chase it out
It's having friends, their faith will win it out

The problems that we face
Are easier to take when you have friends
To share the ways and how you knew
That they will share the load

Then you can always go by day or night
You know that you're with folk, of course
I know that some of you
Can't think of any who you might call friend

But listen and I'll tell you that
You've heard it said before
And of it's truth I'm more
Convinced that you have friends just be one

No thing comes even close
To what we treasure most
Then to be with friends

No thing comes even close
To what we treasure most
Then to be with friends

No thing comes even close
To what we treasure most
Then to be with friends

No thing comes even close
To what we treasure most

Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

Bobby Morganstein,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

Parked there in the drive way

Hanging from a cane pole 
Laying in the trunk getting ready to go

The only driver that car ever owned 
First million dollars takes it home

My feet barely reached the clutch

I loved him like the brother I never had
He was my go-to-guy on 3rd and 10, made me look good at the quarterback. Texas had a man in the stands the night we beat the Panthers
Said they had a spot for both of us that next fall
We were ridin' high on pride and big time futures
Small town paper said we had it all

Chorus:
Up until the night me and Billy Joe drank way too much for Blue Buck Road
""born to be wild"" on the radio, god I still hate that song
Both of us died there in that crash
But I lived to wish I had that night back
After that football didn't mean that much
But until then, I thought that's who I was

Daddy had a hardware store where hard work was his livin'
Peddelin' the hammers that built this town
I broke his heart that summer, I told him what I wasn't planin'
How to sell the nails by the pound
Spent my last paycheck on an RC and a Greyhound
A front seat to the world I'd never seen
I got a job, got a girl, had some cash and world in my pocket
Thought I'd found my place in the great machine

Chorus:
Up until the night I got the call
Mama said daddy didn't feel nothin' at all
She broke down at the fellowship hall said baby we need you here with us
I told my boss to wish me the best, I told my girl she wish we never met but I don't regret what I gave up
Cause until then I thought that's who I was.

I drove straight through some twist and turns
Went through some crash and burns
Stumbled through some lessons learned with the weight on my shoulders
Went around the world to find the girl god had in mind
Gave me a better love than the one I scratched up
But until then I thought that's who I was
But that ain't who I was

I turned sixteen got a brand new six-string
Haggard and Hank, Sting and Springsteen,
Peelin' the paint every chance I got.

Now 'Stairway To Heaven' won't get ya anywhere,
Otta cut your hair, and get a real job.""

So I started a band, and we got out of dodge,
In a Dodge van with no exhaust,
Got high off the fumes, but we played our tunes,
Ain't no one gonna say I can't,
Yeah, I started a band, stared a band.

Started a band and I met a girl,
Sang my songs and rocked her world,
Goin' strong but out of the blue one day,
She said ""I can't love a music man"",
So I dropped my dream and sold my amp,
But I'll be damned if she didn't leave me anyway.

So I stared a band, with a couple new guys,
We played those same ol' dives.
Yeah, we never sold gold, okay, we never sold,
Ain't no one gonna say I can't,
Yeah, I started a band, started a band,

But the lead picker always played too loud,
And him and the drummer had a fallin' out,
Bass man stayed out of it and just got drunk,
I was Nashville bound, my dreams were bigger,
I knocked 'em out they just couldn't pull the trigger,
And that's Nashville speak for I stunk, as a solo man.

So I started a band, we play what we like,
On a stage that's eight feet wide,
But I got my pride, and I got my van,

Started a band, can't get this guitar out my hand,
Yeah I started a band.

Like Speedy Gonz√°lez

In my light blue Cadillac

And she wasn't lookin' back

Just friends, but not like before

Bobby Ray,"Whatever happened to Bobby Ray, he used to be here for us
Then he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust
We never hear from you, you‚Äôre constantly changing
And your relatives always miss you at family occasions
And your mother misses you too
Since all the fortune you‚Äôve been too busy recording
Now she feels unimportant and your daddy‚Äôs been going through it
Since he lost his mother
The least you could do is call him and show him, you support him
I never thought you would sell out
You‚Äôre becoming so cocky
I asked you for a picture after your show
You walked right by me, I‚Äôm like
Ain't this the dude that said that it ain't about the price tag
Now on your records all that you do is brag

You were my idol, just when I thought I give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody (Melody, melody, melody)

Whatever happened to B.o.B. he once was my favorite
I swear to God that I had all of his mixtapes on my playlist
He was hood, but so different at the same time
It was like a breath of fresh air, every time he rhymed
And everybody was on him and the world fell in love

All the above

It‚Äôs like, people only see it, the way it appears
But they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears
Blood sweat and tears, we cry but always swear there‚Äôs tears
In the middle of this rap game on the battle field

Bobby Richards & His Orchestra,"He came from his palace grand;
He came to my cottage door;
His words were few, but his look
Will linger for evermore,
The look in his sad, dark eyes,
More tender than words could be.
But I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
There in her garden she stands,
All dressed in fine satin and lace,
Lady Mary, so cold and so strange;
In his heart she could find no place.
He knew I would be his bride,
With a kiss for a lifetime fee.
But I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
Now in his palace grand,
On a flower-strewn bed he lies.
His beautiful lids are closed
On his sad, dark, beautiful eyes.
And among the mourners who mourn,
Why should I a mourner be?
For I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
For I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.

Shine my light both bright and clear,
Shine my light both far and near,
In every dark corner that I find,
Let my little light shine.

Tuesday peace came from above,
Wednesday told me to have more faith,

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony

I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1986
Bobby Rosengarden,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Bobby Routch,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1990

All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou

That it isn't half of what it's going to turn out to be

That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel inside
When that elevator starts its ride
Down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go, all around I go
In a spin, loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,1997

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

I couldn't sleep a wink last night just a-thinking of you

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears

There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of

Bobby Ryder,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide

Bobby Ryder,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2008

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Are still around us

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The song that Crosby sings

Her parents had gone to their final reward
Leavin' their baby behind

This poor little child was only nine years of age
When mother and dad went away
Still she bravely worked
At the one thing she knew
To earn her few pennies a day

She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear
She made artificial flowers you know those artificial flowers
Fashions from Annie's despair

With paper and shears with some wire and wax
She made up each tulip and mum
As snowflakes drifted into her tenement room
Her baby little fingers grew numb

From makin' artificial flowers those artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear
She made artificial flowers artificial flowers
Made from Annie's despair

They found little Annie all covered in ice
Still clutchin' her poor frozen shears
Amidst all the blossoms she had fashioned by hand
And watered with all her young tears

There must be a heaven where little Annie can play
In heavenly gardens and bowers
And instea-a-ad of a halo she'll wear 'round her head
A garland of genuine flowers

No more artificial flowers
Throw away those artificial flowers

Paint a yuletide valentine

And the children's faces shine
With each new toy we share their joy
With a Christmas auld lang syne.

Oceans of tears,

With an outlook that is rotten
And an attitude to match it

Mountains of pain,
Valleys of love,

Anything money could buy

Nobody there to hold my tremblin' hand
And I cried like a baby in the darkness of my room

In the hollow of an empire
I become a warrior king
Hunting golden deals and million dollar schemes
When our fate has been decided
And my soul's been subdivided
I will cry alone for half forgotten dreams

Won't you walk with me
And talk with me Mr. Sun
I've been running all my life now
In search of something I can't find
I've been chasing rainbows
And they're just visions in my mind
There are a lot of lonely people just like me that need someone
To walk with and talk with sometimes Mr. Sun
Hey Mr. Sun
You can change the night to day
You can chase away the rainbows they're just illusion anyway
When I'm standing in the rain
You can come and be my friend
You can make the storm clouds break
And let the sun shine through again
And tomorrow when I'm dreaming
Of some mountain I will climb
You can tap me on the shoulder
And whisper to me from behind
Please remind me of the yesterdays
I tried it all alone
You can tell me that's it's time again
To walk again
And talk again with you

Where I walked with you a thousand times before

Was a yesterday I lost along the way

It was just your portrait painted in my mind
And pictures there of me and you
Memories that like a fool I left behind

Once there was a time when I was yours and you were mine
And every search for you would stop at our front door
You were always waiting there for me at night when I'd come home
I'd see your smiling face and I'd feel great once more

Please send me down somebody to love

But nobody wants me
I'm blue somehow
Won't someone hear my plea and take a chance with me
Because I'm nobody's baby now

Nobody's baby
And I've got to know the reason why
Last week I was walking down the street and met a boy and I said
""Hey! Maybe I was meant for you""
But he only shook his head and said ""Goodbye""
He kept on walking down the avenue

Nobody wants me
I'm mighty blue somehow
Won't someone hear my plea and take a chance with me
Because I'm nobody's baby now

Steals across the meadows of my heart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002

Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall

And the women wicky-wacky

You can keep in form
With a bowl of rice beneath a parasol.

Has to use a fan
And they only use suspenders in the fall.

In pink pyjamas
They try to give you a kiss

The nearest moment that we marry is too late!

Have you met Miss Jones
Someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me

Then I said Miss Jones
You're a girl who understand
I'm a boy who must be free.

And all at once I lost my breath
And all at once was scared to death
And all at once I hold the earth and sky!

Now I met Miss Jones 
And well keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I",Have You Met Miss Jones?,1975
Bobby Short,"Once I was young, yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps
Once I was young, but never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was
Then you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Once I was old, twenty years or so
Rather well preserved, the wrinkles didn't show
Once I was old, but not too old for fun
I used to hunt for little girls up my imaginary gun
But now I ain't for only one

I'm so wise and I know what time it is now",I Didn't Know What Time It Was,1975
Bobby Short,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch-drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle, of a him and her
I don't like quiet, and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again,1975
Bobby Short,"I've never met you, yet never doubt, dear;
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
while all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
and if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
it's a duty that we owe to dear old France.

Bobby Short,"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hideaway, no soft guitars

Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dream come true
My romance doesn't need a thing, but you

Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

Bobby Short,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you

Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1975

Bobby Short,"With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through

With a song in my heart for you",With a Song in My Heart,1975
Bobby Short,"In the spring when the feeling was chronic
And my caution was leaving you flat,
I should have made use of the tonic
Before you gave me that!
A mental deficient you'll grade me.
I've given you plenty of data.
You came, you saw and you slayed me,
And that-a is that-a!

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all.
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will,
You've made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me!
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow.
So what's the use,
You've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me!

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
So lock the doors
And call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me.

When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone, of course;
It can't be a sister or brother

But horses are frequently silly-
Mine ran from the beach of Kailua
And left me alone for a filly,
So I-a picked you-a.

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

She swore that I would be special

I feel like a frightened colt
Just hit by a thunderbolt

I've fallen in love with you,
I'm taking it badly;
Freezing, burning,
Tossing, turning,
Never know when to laugh or cry.
Just look what our dumb friends do,
They welcome it gladly;
Passion in a dromedary doesn't go so deep,
Camels when they're mating never sob themselves to sleep,
Buffaloes can revel in it, so can sheep!
Why can't I?

Any little bird can fly,
Any little dog
Or any little cat
Can do a bit of this
And just a bit of that.

And any little cow can moo,
But I can't do anything at all
But just love you.

Any little cock can crow,
Any little fox can run,
Any little crab
On any little shore
Can have a little dab,
And then a little more!

You've pulled me across the brink'
You've chained me and bound me;
No escape now,
Where's the crepe now?

Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

Bobby Short,"Picture you upon my knee, 
Just tea for two and two for tea,
Just me for you
And you for me alone.

Nobody near us
To see us or hear us,
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations.
We won't have it known, dear,
That we own a telephone, dear; 

Day will break and you'll awake 
And start to bake a sugar cake, 
For me to take
For all the boys to see.

We will raise a family, 
A boy for you, a girl for me.
Oh, can't you see
How happy we would be?",Tea for Two,1992
Bobby Short,"I search for phrases
To sing your praises
But there aren't any magic adjectives
To tell you all you are!

You're just too marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamourous
And that old standby, amorous

It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean, they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much
And just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary

And so I'm borrowing
A love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words",Too Marvelous for Words,1992
Bobby Short,"If dreams come true,
My dream's of you;
At night when you are away,
My heart is yearning to say;

If dreams come true"".

Oh, if my dreams come true,
I'll be with you,
My dream's so true!
We'd love, we two,
If dreams come true.",If Dreams Come True,1993
Bobby Short,"Over in Cararne
Many years ago
My mother sang a song to me
In a tone so sweet and low.
Just a simple little ditty
In her good old Irish ways
And I'd give the world
If she could sing that song to me this day

[Chorus]
Tura lura lural
Tura lura lie
Tura lura lura
Hush now
Don't you cry
Tura lura lural
Tura lura lie
Tura lura lura
That's an Irish Lullaby

Often dreams I've wondered to that cott again
I feel her arms a huggin me
As when she held me then
And I hear her voice a hummin to me
As in days of yule
When she used to rock me fast asleep
Outside the cabin door

Don't you cry","Sleep Baby, Don't Cry",1993
Bobby Short,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly

Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1993

Beside it the Wreck of the Hesperus too
And proudly above the waves

She can give you a view of the world

Two heavenly hermits, we will be in truth

Old brown wooden stoop,
On a summer's evening, 
We formed a merry group;
Boys and girls together,
We would sing and waltz,
While the ""Ginnie"" played the organ
On the sidewalks of New York.

East side, West side,
All around the town,
The tots sang 'Ring-a-Rosie',
'London Bridge is falling down!

On the sidewalks of New York.

That's where Johnny Casey,
And little Jimmy Crowe,
With Jakey Krause the baker,
Who always had the dough,
Pretty Nellie Shannon,
With a dude as light as cork,
First picked up the waltz step
On the sidewalks of New York.

[Chorus]

Things have changed since those times,
And some are up in ""G,""
Others are wanderers.
But all feel just like me,

Could they but once more walk,
With their best girl and have a twirl,
On the Sidewalks of New York.

Built to shelter the rich and greedy

His mortgage is due and his marriage is through
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street

He always hears voices when he's all alone

They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get em home ain't no tellin what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eatin dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet""

Bobby Short,"Say, have you seen a Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Bobby Taylor,"In a world like today
It's a rare occasion to be able
To see young mothers like the ones
That were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory
To quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated
To those who cherish that memory

Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me, ""boy, hurry to Sunday school""

Filled with her load of glory
We learned the Holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring

Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you

Sweet Sadie (well, well, well)
Living in the past
Some times it seems so funny
But no money will turn your life around

Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papa's old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry

Some times she'd be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song

Oh, Sadie (oh, Sadie, baby)
Don't you know we love you (she'll love us all in a special way)
Sweet Sadie (well, well, well)
Place no one above you

Sweet Sadie (sweet Sadie livin' in the past)

Oh, she's never sinnin'
In love she's always winnin', yeah

Don't you know we love you (I love you, mama)
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you (I just can't forget)

Sweet Sadie (how you gave me love, oh, Lord)
Living in the past
If there's a heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love

Sadie (it's a mean world without you)
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie (all the love you showed)
Place no one above you (oh, I could never, ever doubt her lovely word)

When the world is at peace

I can see the day when it's safe to walk the streets
When we learn to care for those lost in poverty
There would be no need for our daughters and our sons
To march up and down the streets, singing we shall overcome
(Do it to me now)

When the worlds at peace will it still be in one piece
I pray for the day when the bombs and the bullets cease
Come let's make a change or leave the world in dust
Lets be the world of love for the ones that follow us
(Do it to me now)

If we learn to love the way we learn to kill
Then love will rule the world and hate would soon be still
Some may say they love but loves a sacrifice
Love is not a state of mind, loves a fact of life
(Do it to me now)

Hate be still
Love get behind me
Peace, what we need
Ha ha, peace is what we need now

Bobby Timmons,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1959

Bobby Timmons,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You,1961
Bobby Timmons,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1961
Bobby Timmons,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1961
Bobby Timmons,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Bobby Timmons,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1964
Bobby Timmons,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Bobby Timmons,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Bobby Timmons,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near

Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away

The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it
Couldn't do without it

All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night
No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.

Even though his buddies
Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

While they all were rootin'
You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

How they used to hate him
Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with 'em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game
And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.

Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah
Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch 'em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off
But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)

Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards
'Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Seein' their position
They called intermission
And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'

And you've only got about a minute to play
And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold 'em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)

And then the students all began to yell
The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.

Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still
Just as it always will

And there's a picture in the hall of fame

Or was that a nightingale?

I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane?

Haven't you heard the music in the night,
Wonderful music,
Faint as a will o' the wisp, crazy as a loon,

Bobby Troup,"It happened
I felt it happened
I was awake
I wasn't blind
I didn't think
I felt it happened
Now I believe in matter over mind.

And now you see we mustn't wait
The nearest moment that we marry is too late!

Have you met Miss Jones
Someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me

Then I said Miss Jones
You're a girl who understand
I'm a boy who must be free.

And all at once I lost my breath
And all at once was scared to death
And all at once I hold the earth and sky!

Bobby Troup,"She gets too hungry for dinner at eight 
She likes the theater and never comes late

My unhappy oh little girl, little girl blue, yeah. 

Oh sit there, oh count those raindrops
Oh, feel 'em falling down, oh honey all around you.
Honey don't you know it's time,
I feel it's time,
Somebody told you 'cause you got to know
That all you ever gonna have to count on
Or gonna wanna lean on
It's gonna feel just like those raindrops do

Bobby Troup,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Bobby Troup,"Summer journeys
To Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares

I've a cozy little flat
In what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canaries's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronx Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan,1955
Bobby Troup,"On the first of May, it is moving day,
Spring is here, so blow your job,
Throw your job away!
Now's the time to trust,
To your wanderlust,
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait!

In a mountain greenery,
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.
While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your coverlet,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.
And if you're good, I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while I stand looking
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home!

Simple cooking means
More than French Cuisines
I've a banquet planned which is
Sandwiches and beans
Coffee's just as grand
With a little sand
Eat and you'll grow fatter, boy
'smatter boy? Huh, huh! 'Atta boy.

In a mountain greenery,
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.
How-how-how-how-how we love sequestering
Where no pests are pestering
No dear momma holds us in tether
Mosquitoes here,
Won't bite you dear,
I'll let them sting, me on the finger!
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery

Far from life's machinery

Bobby Troup,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note,
Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

W e may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love

Bobby Troup,"You are too beautiful
My dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling
That because I had found you
I could have bound you to me.
 
You are too beautiful
For one man alone
One lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own
To see with.
 
Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs?
 
If on the other hand
I'm faithful to you
It's not from a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool
For beauty.",You Are Too Beautiful,1955
Bobby Troup,"I don't care if there's powder on my nose.
I don't care if my hairdo is in place.
I've lost the very meaning of repose. 
I never put a mudpack onmy face.
Oh, who'd have thought
That I'd walk in the daze now?
I never go to shows at night,
But just to matinees now.
I see the show
And home I go.

Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire,
Uneasy in my easy chair.
It never entered my mind.

Once you told me I was mistaken,
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one.
It never entered my mind.

You have what I lack myself
And now I even have to scratch my back myself.

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you where there again
To get into my hair again.
It never entered my mind.",It Never Entered My Mind,1957
Bobby Troup,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin' that he's so willin' 
To make whoopee

Picture a little love nest 
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest 
Think what a year can bring

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks,
That's what you get folks, for makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Five thousand dollars per;
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You pay six to her.""

He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge, right into jail.
You'd better keep her
I think it's cheaper
Than making whoopee.""",Makin' Whoopee,1957
Bobby Troup,"My ship has sails that are made of silk,
The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me.",My Ship,1957
Bobby Troup,"The song a robin sings
Through years of endless springs
The murmur of a brook at eventide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide
A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
My heart and I agree
She's everything on earth to me

Bobby Troup,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1957
Bobby Troup,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1957
Bobby Troup,"While the city sleeps, ev'ry night he creeps
Just surveyin' his domain
He roams around like he owns the town
He's the King, he makes that plain

He knows ev'ry trick, doesn't miss a lick
When it comes to keepin' track
Some city slicker, no one is quicker than
That darn cat

Ev'ry nook and cranny and garbage canny
He inspects so thoroughly
When he's on his rounds, nothin's out of bounds
To his curiosity

He can smile and purr at a pretty her
Till she don't know where she's at
Nose like a diner, oh, what a tiger is
That darn cat

He's a sly old codger, an artful dodger
A scrounger unsurpassed
A ball of fire, a nine live wire
Who just can't be outclassed

Yeah, this midnight rover, he lives in clover
It's an art he's got down pat
Never was a greater smooth operator than
That um darn, that darn cat

Um um

Now our cat's been paid ev'ry accolade
And he's earned all his acclaim
In a blaze of glory, he ends our story
In the Feline Hall of Fame

From the fam'ly he begat
You may wind up with one of, maybe the son of

Bobby Troup,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard,1994
