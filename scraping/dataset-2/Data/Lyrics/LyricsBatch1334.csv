Bobby Johns,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Bobby Johns,"Blue Spanish eyes
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please, please don't cry

This is just adios and not goodbye
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say ""Si, si""
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me

Blue Spanish eyes
Prettiest eyes in all of Mexico
True Spanish eyes

Please smile at me once more before I go
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say ""Si, si""
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me

Bobby Jones,"(Verse 1) 
I thought I lost, but actually I won 
For by His blood we all have overcome 
There is no failure, our God can never loose 
And that same power, it now belongs to You 

(Chorus) 
Now it?s time to celebrate all banners raised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Every situation I face, I win 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
And everything works for my good in the end 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 

(Verse 2) 
I was on my way to a burning hell 
The devil, he had my life set up to fail 
But thanks be to my God who causes me to triumph, overcome, tread upon the enemy 

(Chorus) 
Now it?s time to celebrate all banners raised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Every situation I face, I win 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
And everything works for my good in the end 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 

(Verse 3) 
Somebody who?s listening right now You think You?re losing 
You feel like You can?t win ?cause You tried everything 
Greater is He that is within You don?t doubt 
?Cause whatever You?re in now, God says 
You have to come out 

(Chorus) 
Now it?s time to celebrate all banners raised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
Every situation I face, I win 
(I?ve got the VICTORY, the VICTORY) 
And everything works for my good in the end

Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train, got my baby and gone

Well, it took my baby, but it never will again
No, not again

I'll give You the praise

Bobby Keyes,"Dear landlord
Please don't put a price on my soul
My burden is heavy
My dreams are beyond control
When that steamboat whistle blows
I'm going to give you all I got to give
And I do hope you receive it well
Depending on the way you feel that you live

Dear landlord
Please heed these words that I speak
I know you've suffered much
But in this you are not so unique
All of us, at times we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much
And anyone can fill his life up
With things he can see but he just cannot touch

Dear landlord
Please don't dismiss my case
I'm not about to argue
I'm not about to move to no other place
Now, each of us has his own special gift
And you know this was meant to be true
And if you don't underestimate me
I won't underestimate you",Dear Landlord,1976

And I'm bound to keep on riding 
And I've got one more silver dollar 
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no 
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider 

And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing 
And the road goes on forever 
And I've got one more silver dollar 
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no 
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider

Bobby Keyes,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1976
Bobby Kimball,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Bobby Kimball,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me
towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way,
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient
melodies
He turned to me as if to say,
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever
do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (Oh
uh)

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the
Serangeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside,
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever
do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (Oh
uh)

Bobby Kimball,"If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared
Now you're gone, I'm really not the same, I guess I held
Myself to blame
Time can erase the things we said
But it gives me time to realize that you're the one who's
Sad

You know I won't hold you back now, the love we had just
Can't be found
You know I can't hold you back now
 
Now that I'm alone it gives me time to think about the
Years that you were mine
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

Bobby Knight,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [*],1996

Times when we're apart

If my hours could be spent near you
I'd be more than content near you

Spend the rest of my days near you

There is just one place for me, I'm happy when I'm near you

Every step I take retreats

Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Bobby Lewis,"Well, here we are again
I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

When love is truly right
(This time it's truly right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh, and on the way it grows
But it never disappears

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

Always just beyond my touch
You know I needed you so much
After all, what else is livin' for?

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through

Until the day I can no longer hide

Down comes the storm drowning his old faithfuls
And they sing a thousand songs from the depths of bloody hell
They take his soul from their handfuls
And her heart it skips a beat as her senses take a sleep
And the world turns so slowly to a creep
They faithful kiss their crosses but their hate still spreads the disease

Stacked up in formation
That mean much before
They're lining the fire

As the bottomless heat goes
To harness your anger
Your blood and
Your deepest desire

Because there's no truth stolen
That's been ever brought forward
By the minds of the writers
Looking face down on the gutter

'Cause this world's full of thinkers
And suffragette speakers
Who deny that they ever wear a dress
Oh, this god forsaken town is in a mess

Ravaging the whores
Ignoring constant calls

Bobby Long,"I lost my English soul,
Pulling out the corpse,
Sheltering in the Trenches again,
Crying for a lose,

I let my arms down,
Walked away in a trance,
There's parts of me layer out,
All over France,

So I took my last waltz,
Got caught up in the wire,
Wrote a letter for my love,
As I head from the fire,

An old solider carried me,
Way to the coast, bathe my wounds in the sea,
I'm in the hands of a ghost, im in the hands of a ghost
Their boats came on in,

I tried to run away,
I got taken half by the throat,
In the burning light of day
Set down with the iron punch,

So broken and alone,
Left my blood on the beach for the tide to take me home
These wounds that I shed inside,
Two years old

So my girl she gave up,
She had taken me for dead,
She had forgot all her promises and everything she said,
Living in the darkest dream,

I rose up in the cold
These wounds that I have outside,
Are two years old,
These wounds that I have outside,

Are two years old,
Two years old
Living in the past,
Living by the mile I toke the same walk down,

As I did as a child,
The flags flew for a man,
Unaware of the fate no one saw me walk down, on my very last parade,
So thoughts turn to dust,

As I headed for the mound,
I strayed up the part, waiting for the count,
Living in the darkest dream so broken and all alone
These pain that I have inside is two years old

These scars that I have inside are more than two years old
These pain that I have inside is two years old
These scars that I have inside are more than two years old
Is more than two years

So spare the ghosts around my neck
The winds against the sails,
I'm shivering up a storm of roadside pines,
Thirst shreds the ballast cold
And shows the olden times

I'm bold and sorrow thrown into the day,
Into the barrels of the sun I turned and found a way,
The naked branches cut the empty air,
The river birds have fled away
From all their wear and tear

The covered surface hugs the board
But keeps in the sky,
A childhood glimpse that keeps you warm
But hangs you to dry,
The shameful dream, the shameful face
That pulls on your heart,
Those brittle winds will keep the dawn
From you at the start

So bring me choirs to ease me on my way,
So bring me screams of organs for the day,
So bring me choirs to brighten all the gales,
So bring me screams of organs and the wails,
of winter tales

I heard a lonely voice cut through the rain,
""So take away my conscious mind and
take away my fame,""
To embrace the day to cut through my only soul,
I'd starch my love of all its parts

The old shamed face he walks a jamboree
Behind the prison is the dove
While the moon decides your grace you're in love
Just for a spell that hand in hand like does
Laughing like the birds beneath the pier

Beyond the dark that stings your mouth you've still got fear
You think it doesn't matter
Nobody told you twice
So rest your mind in your darkest thoughts you'll feel alright

It won't be long
It won't be long
It won't be long

Until she's laughing off the woes of your wrongs
There's endless hands in all Miss Mercy's pies
You can see the daytime stripped away
The lovers march through nuts and bolts to fix your day

The factory blows a scent down Piggy Hill
Beyond the old time Ferris wheel
The trouble swap their thoughts for gold so you can't feel
You think it doesn't matter
Nobody told you twice

Stacked up in formation
Which mean much before
They're line-ing the fire

As a bottomless heat goes
To harness your anger
Your blood and
Your deepest desire

Because there's no truth stolen
That's been ever brought forward
From the minds of the writers
Looking face down on the gutter

'Cause this world's full of thinkers
And suffragette speakers
who deny that they ever wear a dress
Oh this god forsaken town's in a mess

And all the truths been let out loose
Is desperate to amuse
As it grabs you by the throat
And strings out all the times you've used

But now you don't belong you
Whisper when you speak
You turn yourself to nighttime
Trying to find your feet

Oh let me run
Lord, let me run,
So let me run
Lord, let me run

But as the morning awakens
That light sends a shudder
The twist of hope that helps you down
Is left to rest and stir

You back down a hallway
To flourish the darkness
And you fool yourself
You did it all for her
And him, and her

But I've seen your face before

If the hands of strife and the darkest night
Could write down the words they're exchanging
Then my ringed neck may bring the death

No bitter fling could force you to begin
The truthful lie you've been craving
There stands a ghost on a withdrawn coast
That flies just like a raven

Hoping that my god will let me in

They scream ""oh man, better wake him up""
Hey kid you'll never want to follow him

But the rich kids on the corner
Betting off on solitaire
Just to lay the poor upon the boys
Walking out, they're on your shoes
Like chalk upon the face of Rex
Beating out to keep their head above the noise

So hold me down
So tear me up
So let me in for a while

Hey

When everyone's a down and out
You don't know where it ends
But the forecast tells the lads to push on through
Beyond the tepid shade a face is wrecked in the afternoon

So sing a song in sixpence
I'll stick it to the change
But men can never seem to make it last
The send all three I owe it to the hate, the love, the cut
The scar I will have to wear upon the mask

If someone isn't hurt then it's gonna be me

I'll have you banished from my mind

Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2004
Bobby Lyle,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love

And make me smile with glee
Never never will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery
Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly
I like the way you make me feel about you, baby
Want the whole wide world to see
 
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
 
Flowing in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way
Holding hands ain't everybody's thing
But with me it plants the seed
In my heart forever growing
The kind of love I know you need

For you I sigh, for you dear only

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

Is your very best friend

Is rocking your cradle
Better than you can
Rock your cradle yourself

And get yourself a pistol

And then you make it
Back up on the scene
Where your loved one and your
Best friend are now together

You go right in and bust
Down the door and shoot him
You can't shoot her
Because you know if you shoot her
All of your love and your long
Lifetime will be gone forever

And just as you make it up
In your mind to forgive her
Here come another one of
Your best friends through the door

This really makes you blow your top
And you go right ahead and go in person
To your heart and shoot her

And realizing what you've done
You say, baby, please forgive me
I'm sorry

And with her last dying breath
She looks up at you and say

Some girls just want some fun
Some look for devotion
Some just wanna run
Some crave for affection
Burnin' up inside
Some need the direction
For the world outside
You can dance the dance 'til the mornin' comes
But I'll tell you where I'm comin' from

I wanna hear your soul' talkin'
Wanna hear your soul' talkin'
Wanna hear your soul' talkin'

It's the root of the cause
It's the still of the moment

And I don't need a slave

Bobby McFerrin,"Of all life's treasuries
One is most preciously
Kept in my heart
And that's the loyalty of friends

And family gathered 'round
And making joyous sounds
Familiar voices warm the heart
I find myself alone and feelin' blue
Then I know what to do

I phone my friends in melancholy
And then sometimes I'm filled with doubt
Something will chase it out
It's having friends, their faith will win it out

The problems that we face
Are easier to take when you have friends
To share the ways and how you knew
That they will share the load

Then you can always go by day or night
You know that you're with folk, of course
I know that some of you
Can't think of any who you might call friend

But listen and I'll tell you that
You've heard it said before
And of it's truth I'm more
Convinced that you have friends just be one

No thing comes even close
To what we treasure most
Then to be with friends

No thing comes even close
To what we treasure most
Then to be with friends

No thing comes even close
To what we treasure most
Then to be with friends

No thing comes even close
To what we treasure most

Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

Bobby Morganstein,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

Parked there in the drive way

Hanging from a cane pole 
Laying in the trunk getting ready to go

The only driver that car ever owned 
First million dollars takes it home

I loved him like the brother I never had
He was my go-to-guy on 3rd and 10, made me look good at the quarterback. Texas had a man in the stands the night we beat the Panthers
Said they had a spot for both of us that next fall
We were ridin' high on pride and big time futures
Small town paper said we had it all

Chorus:
Up until the night me and Billy Joe drank way too much for Blue Buck Road
""born to be wild"" on the radio, god I still hate that song
Both of us died there in that crash
But I lived to wish I had that night back
After that football didn't mean that much
But until then, I thought that's who I was

Daddy had a hardware store where hard work was his livin'
Peddelin' the hammers that built this town
I broke his heart that summer, I told him what I wasn't planin'
How to sell the nails by the pound
Spent my last paycheck on an RC and a Greyhound
A front seat to the world I'd never seen
I got a job, got a girl, had some cash and world in my pocket
Thought I'd found my place in the great machine

Chorus:
Up until the night I got the call
Mama said daddy didn't feel nothin' at all
She broke down at the fellowship hall said baby we need you here with us
I told my boss to wish me the best, I told my girl she wish we never met but I don't regret what I gave up
Cause until then I thought that's who I was.

I drove straight through some twist and turns
Went through some crash and burns
Stumbled through some lessons learned with the weight on my shoulders
Went around the world to find the girl god had in mind
Gave me a better love than the one I scratched up
But until then I thought that's who I was
But that ain't who I was

I turned sixteen got a brand new six-string
Haggard and Hank, Sting and Springsteen,
Peelin' the paint every chance I got.

Now 'Stairway To Heaven' won't get ya anywhere,
Otta cut your hair, and get a real job.""

So I started a band, and we got out of dodge,
In a Dodge van with no exhaust,
Got high off the fumes, but we played our tunes,
Ain't no one gonna say I can't,
Yeah, I started a band, stared a band.

Started a band and I met a girl,
Sang my songs and rocked her world,
Goin' strong but out of the blue one day,
She said ""I can't love a music man"",
So I dropped my dream and sold my amp,
But I'll be damned if she didn't leave me anyway.

So I stared a band, with a couple new guys,
We played those same ol' dives.
Yeah, we never sold gold, okay, we never sold,
Ain't no one gonna say I can't,
Yeah, I started a band, started a band,

But the lead picker always played too loud,
And him and the drummer had a fallin' out,
Bass man stayed out of it and just got drunk,
I was Nashville bound, my dreams were bigger,
I knocked 'em out they just couldn't pull the trigger,
And that's Nashville speak for I stunk, as a solo man.

So I started a band, we play what we like,
On a stage that's eight feet wide,
But I got my pride, and I got my van,

Started a band, can't get this guitar out my hand,
Yeah I started a band.

To find myself alone

One minute she was in my arms
The next where did she go

Like Speedy González
She broke my heart in two
She left my heart and my wallet feelin'
Empty and blue

Saw her across the border
In my light blue Cadillac
Her arms were around another fool
And she wasn't lookin' back

They found my car in pieces
In a town in Mexico
As for my señorita, my juanita
I don't know

Just friends, but not like before

Since he lost his mother

Bobby Richards & His Orchestra,"He came from his palace grand;
He came to my cottage door;
His words were few, but his look
Will linger for evermore,
The look in his sad, dark eyes,
More tender than words could be.
But I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
There in her garden she stands,
All dressed in fine satin and lace,
Lady Mary, so cold and so strange;
In his heart she could find no place.
He knew I would be his bride,
With a kiss for a lifetime fee.
But I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
Now in his palace grand,
On a flower-strewn bed he lies.
His beautiful lids are closed
On his sad, dark, beautiful eyes.
And among the mourners who mourn,
Why should I a mourner be?
For I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
For I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.

Shine my light both bright and clear,
Shine my light both far and near,
In every dark corner that I find,

Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long

So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree

And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!

Finding another world.

You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

Bobby Routch,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1990

Lookin' forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou

I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou

That it isn't half of what it's going to turn out to be

Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart

You just say nothing's changed

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

Bobby Scott,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

An airline ticket to romantic places

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

As snowflakes drifted into her tenement room
Her baby little fingers grew numb

Valleys of love,

Nobody there to hold my tremblin' hand
And I cried like a baby in the darkness of my room
With nobody there to love or understand

In the comfort of my castle I have lived my life in style
Let the troubled world just up and pass me by
I surround myself with treasure and I fill each day with pleasure
Until late at night this king begins to cry

And I have cried like a baby in the darkness of my room
Nobody there to hold my tremblin' hand
And I cried like a baby in the darkness of my room
With nobody there to love or understand

In the hollow of an empire
I become a warrior king
Hunting golden deals and million dollar schemes
When our fate has been decided
And my soul's been subdivided
I will cry alone for half forgotten dreams

And I have cried like a baby in the darkness of my room
Nobody there to hold my tremblin' hand
And I cried like a baby in the darkness of my room
With nobody there to love or understand

Cried like a baby in the darkness of my room
Nobody there to hold my tremblin' hand
And I cried like a baby in the darkness of my room
With nobody there to love or understand me",Cried Like a Baby,1991

I said good morning Mr. Sun
I've been looking through the raindrops much too long
I need someone
I can tell you where my mind is at
If you will take the time to listen
'Cause it's such a lovely morning
Won't you walk with me
And talk with me Mr. Sun
I've been running all my life now
In search of something I can't find
I've been chasing rainbows
And they're just visions in my mind
There are a lot of lonely people just like me that need someone
To walk with and talk with sometimes Mr. Sun
Hey Mr. Sun
You can change the night to day
You can chase away the rainbows they're just illusion anyway
When I'm standing in the rain
You can come and be my friend
You can make the storm clouds break
And let the sun shine through again
And tomorrow when I'm dreaming
Of some mountain I will climb
You can tap me on the shoulder
And whisper to me from behind
Please remind me of the yesterdays
I tried it all alone
You can tell me that's it's time again
To walk again
And talk again with you

I was looking for your face
Where I walked with you a thousand times before

Was a yesterday I lost along the way

It was just your portrait painted in my mind
And pictures there of me and you
Memories that like a fool I left behind

Once there was a time when I was yours and you were mine
And every search for you would stop at our front door
You were always waiting there for me at night when I'd come home
I'd see your smiling face and I'd feel great once more

Bobby Sherwood & His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no

I will spin a yarn

You can keep in form
With a bowl of rice beneath a parasol.

Has to use a fan
And they only use suspenders in the fall.

In pink pyjamas
They try to give you a kiss

I put them down on anything but Clarabelle,
The perfectly swell romance;
Never gonna dance,
Never gonna dance,
Only gonna love,
Never gonna dance!

Have I a heart that acts like a heart,
Or is it a crazy drum,
Beating the weird tattoos
Of the St Louis Blues?

Have I two eyes to see your two eyes?
Or see myself on toes,
Dancing on radios
For Major Edward Bowes!

Though
I'm left without a penny,
The wolf was discreet,
He left me my feet!
And so,
I put them down on anything but Clarabelle,
The perfectly swell romance;
Never gonna dance,
Only gonna love,
Never gonna dance!

I'll put my shoes on beautiful trees,
I'll give my rhythm back to the breeze,
My dinner clothes may dine where they please,
For all I really want is you!

And to Groucho Marx I give my cravat,
To Harpo goes my shiny silk hat,
And to heaven I give a vow to adore you;
I'm starting now to be much more positive;

That though
I'm left without a penny,
The wolf was not smart,
He left me my heart!
And so,
I cannot go for anything but Clarabelle,
The perfectly swell romance;
Never gonna dance,
Never gonna dance,
Only gonna love you,
Never gonna dance!",Never Gonna Dance,1965

I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day,1973

But, oh, my heart grew active

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie

I could fall with so much emotion

For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush

She had a most immoral eye,
They called her Lorelei.
She created quite a stir,

Bobby Short,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch-drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle, of a him and her
I don't like quiet, and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again,1975
Bobby Short,"I've never met you, yet never doubt, dear;
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
while all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
and if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
it's a duty that we owe to dear old France.
Isn't it romance?",Isn't It Romantic?,1975
Bobby Short,"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hideaway, no soft guitars

Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dream come true
My romance doesn't need a thing, but you

Bobby Short,"Nobody's heart belongs to me
Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

Bobby Short,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior

Or two

Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1975
Bobby Short,"It seems we stood and talked like this before.
We looked at each other in the same way then,
But I can't remember where or when.

The smile you were smiling you were smiling then,
But I can't remember where or when.

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again.

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before and loved before,

Bobby Short,"With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you",With a Song in My Heart,1975
Bobby Short,"In the spring when the feeling was chronic
And my caution was leaving you flat,
I should have made use of the tonic
Before you gave me that!
A mental deficient you'll grade me.
I've given you plenty of data.
You came, you saw and you slayed me,
And that-a is that-a!

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all.
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will,
You've made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me!
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow.
So what's the use,
You've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me!

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
So lock the doors
And call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me.

When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone, of course;
It can't be a sister or brother
And so I loved my horse.
But horses are frequently silly-
Mine ran from the beach of Kailua
And left me alone for a filly,
So I-a picked you-a.

Bobby Short,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought

Yet resurrected and sailing the crest
Why this elation mixed with deflation

Should I order cyanide or order champagne
Oh, what is this sudden jolt
I feel like a frightened colt
Just hit by a thunderbolt
I am in love

I knew the hours were against me before
I have no flare for flaming desire
But since the gods gave me you to adore
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire

'round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Let our hearts take wings'

Let the angels sing,

I've fallen in love with you,
I'm taking it badly;
Freezing, burning,
Tossing, turning,
Never know when to laugh or cry.
Just look what our dumb friends do,
They welcome it gladly;
Passion in a dromedary doesn't go so deep,
Camels when they're mating never sob themselves to sleep,
Buffaloes can revel in it, so can sheep!
Why can't I?

Any little bird can fly,
Any little dog
Or any little cat
Can do a bit of this
And just a bit of that.
Any little horse can neigh
And any little cow can moo,
But I can't do anything at all
But just love you.

Any little cock can crow,
Any little fox can run,
Any little crab
On any little shore
Can have a little dab,
And then a little more!

Any any little dove can coo,
But I can't do anything at all
But just love you.

You've pulled me across the brink'
You've chained me and bound me;
No escape now,
Where's the crepe now?
When is the funeral going to be?

Then I see how stupidly monogamous I am!

Bobby Short,"Over in Cararne
Many years ago
My mother sang a song to me
In a tone so sweet and low.
Just a simple little ditty
In her good old Irish ways
And I'd give the world
If she could sing that song to me this day

[Chorus]
Tura lura lural
Tura lura lie
Tura lura lura
Hush now
Don't you cry
Tura lura lural
Tura lura lie
Tura lura lura
That's an Irish Lullaby

Often dreams I've wondered to that cott again
I feel her arms a huggin me
As when she held me then
And I hear her voice a hummin to me
As in days of yule
When she used to rock me fast asleep
Outside the cabin door

Don't you cry","Sleep Baby, Don't Cry",1993
Bobby Short,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1993

Beside it the Wreck of the Hesperus too
And proudly above the waves

You can learn a lot from Lydia
 
She can give you a view of the world

For a dime  you can see Kankakee or Paree

We would sing and waltz,
While the ""Ginnie"" played the organ
On the sidewalks of New York.

All around the town,
The tots sang 'Ring-a-Rosie',
'London Bridge is falling down!

With Jakey Krause the baker,
Who always had the dough,
Pretty Nellie Shannon,
With a dude as light as cork,
First picked up the waltz step
On the sidewalks of New York.

Things have changed since those times,
And some are up in ""G,""
Others are wanderers.

With their best girl and have a twirl,
On the Sidewalks of New York.

He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street

Bobby Short,"Say, have you seen a Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Who think they're mighty wise
Just because they know a thing or two

Strolling up and down Broadway
Telling of the wonders they can do

Card sharks and crap shooters
They congregate around the Metropole

They wear fancy ties and collars
But where they get their dollars
While they all got an ace in the hole

Some of them write to the old folks for coin
Well, that's their old ace in the hole
Others have gals on the old Tenderloin
Well, that's their old ace in the hole

They'll tell you all the trips
That they are going to take
From Frisco up to that old North Pole

Now their names would be mud
Like a old chump playing stud
If they lost that old ace in the hole

And lets their old ace in the hole

It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Bobby Taylor,"In a world like today
It's a rare occasion to be able
To see young mothers like the ones
That were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory
To quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated
To those who cherish that memory

Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me, ""boy, hurry to Sunday school""

Filled with her load of glory
We learned the Holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring

Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you

Sweet Sadie (well, well, well)
Living in the past
Some times it seems so funny
But no money will turn your life around

Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papa's old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry

Some times she'd be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song

Oh, Sadie (oh, Sadie, baby)
Don't you know we love you (she'll love us all in a special way)
Sweet Sadie (well, well, well)
Place no one above you

Sweet Sadie (sweet Sadie livin' in the past)

Oh, she's never sinnin'
In love she's always winnin', yeah

Don't you know we love you (I love you, mama)
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you (I just can't forget)

Sweet Sadie (how you gave me love, oh, Lord)
Living in the past
If there's a heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love

Sadie (it's a mean world without you)
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie (all the love you showed)
Place no one above you (oh, I could never, ever doubt her lovely word)

Bobby Taylor,"When the world is at peace
When the world is at peace

I can see the day when it's safe to walk the streets
When we learn to care for those lost in poverty
There would be no need for our daughters and our sons
To march up and down the streets, singing we shall overcome
(Do it to me now)

When the worlds at peace will it still be in one piece
I pray for the day when the bombs and the bullets cease
Come let's make a change or leave the world in dust
Lets be the world of love for the ones that follow us
(Do it to me now)

If we learn to love the way we learn to kill
Then love will rule the world and hate would soon be still
Some may say they love but loves a sacrifice
Love is not a state of mind, loves a fact of life
(Do it to me now)

Hate be still
Love get behind me
Peace, what we need
Ha ha, peace is what we need now

Bobby Timmons,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1959

Bobby Timmons,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You,1961
Bobby Timmons,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1961
Bobby Timmons,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1961
Bobby Timmons,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

Bobby Timmons,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1964
Bobby Timmons,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it
Couldn't do without it

All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night
No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.

Even though his buddies
Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

While they all were rootin'
You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

How they used to hate him
Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with 'em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game
And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.

Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah
Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch 'em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off
But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)

Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards
'Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Seein' their position
They called intermission
And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'

And you've only got about a minute to play
And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold 'em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)

And then the students all began to yell
The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.

Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

Bobby Troup,"Sit there, hm, count your fingers.
What else, what else is there to do?
Oh and I know how you feel,
I know you feel that you're through.
Oh wah wah ah sit there, hm, count,
Ah, count your little fingers,
My unhappy oh little girl, little girl blue, yeah. 

Oh sit there, oh count those raindrops
Oh, feel 'em falling down, oh honey all around you.
Honey don't you know it's time,
I feel it's time,
Somebody told you 'cause you got to know
That all you ever gonna have to count on
Or gonna wanna lean on
It's gonna feel just like those raindrops do
When they're falling down, honey, all around you.
Oh, I know you're unhappy. 

Oh sit there, ah go on, go on
And count your fingers.
I don't know what else, what else
Honey have you got to do.
And I know how you feel,
And I know you ain't got no reason to go on
And I know you feel that you must be through.
Oh honey, go on and sit right back down,
I want you to count, oh count your fingers,

And my little, oh, girl blue.
I know you're unhappy,
Ooh ah, honey I know,
Baby I know just how you feel.",Little Girl Blue,1955
Bobby Troup,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Bobby Troup,"Summer journeys
To Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares

I've a cozy little flat
In what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canaries's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronx Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan,1955
Bobby Troup,"On the first of May, it is moving day,
Spring is here, so blow your job,
Throw your job away!
Now's the time to trust,
To your wanderlust,
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait!

In a mountain greenery,
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.
While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your coverlet,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.
And if you're good, I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while I stand looking
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home!

Simple cooking means
More than French Cuisines
I've a banquet planned which is
Sandwiches and beans
Coffee's just as grand
With a little sand
Eat and you'll grow fatter, boy
'smatter boy? Huh, huh! 'Atta boy.

In a mountain greenery,
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.
How-how-how-how-how we love sequestering
Where no pests are pestering
No dear momma holds us in tether
Mosquitoes here,
Won't bite you dear,
I'll let them sting, me on the finger!
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery,
Far from life's machinery
Bless our mountain greenery home!",Mountain Greenery,1955
Bobby Troup,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note,
Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

W e may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

Bobby Troup,"You are too beautiful
My dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling
That because I had found you
I could have bound you to me.
 
You are too beautiful
For one man alone
One lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own
To see with.
 
Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs?
 
If on the other hand
I'm faithful to you
It's not from a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool
For beauty.",You Are Too Beautiful,1955
Bobby Troup,"I don't care if there's powder on my nose.
I don't care if my hairdo is in place.
I've lost the very meaning of repose. 
I never put a mudpack onmy face.
Oh, who'd have thought
That I'd walk in the daze now?
I never go to shows at night,
But just to matinees now.
I see the show
And home I go.

Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire,
Uneasy in my easy chair.
It never entered my mind.

Once you told me I was mistaken,
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one.
It never entered my mind.

You have what I lack myself
And now I even have to scratch my back myself.

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you where there again
To get into my hair again.
It never entered my mind.",It Never Entered My Mind,1957
Bobby Troup,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin' that he's so willin' 
To make whoopee

Picture a little love nest 
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest 
Think what a year can bring

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks,
That's what you get folks, for makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Five thousand dollars per;
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You pay six to her.""

He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge, right into jail.
You'd better keep her
I think it's cheaper
Than making whoopee.""",Makin' Whoopee,1957
Bobby Troup,"My ship has sails that are made of silk,
The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me.",My Ship,1957
Bobby Troup,"The song a robin sings
Through years of endless springs
The murmur of a brook at eventide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide
A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
My heart and I agree
She's everything on earth to me

That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
My heart and I agree
She's everything on earth to me",Stella by Starlight,1957
Bobby Troup,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1957
Bobby Troup,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1957
Bobby Troup,"While the city sleeps, ev'ry night he creeps
Just surveyin' his domain
He roams around like he owns the town
He's the King, he makes that plain

He knows ev'ry trick, doesn't miss a lick
When it comes to keepin' track
Some city slicker, no one is quicker than
That darn cat

Ev'ry nook and cranny and garbage canny
He inspects so thoroughly
When he's on his rounds, nothin's out of bounds
To his curiosity

He can smile and purr at a pretty her
Till she don't know where she's at
Nose like a diner, oh, what a tiger is
That darn cat

He's a sly old codger, an artful dodger
A scrounger unsurpassed
A ball of fire, a nine live wire
Who just can't be outclassed

Yeah, this midnight rover, he lives in clover
It's an art he's got down pat
Never was a greater smooth operator than
That um darn, that darn cat

That darn cat
Um um
That darn cat
Um um um um um um

Now our cat's been paid ev'ry accolade
And he's earned all his acclaim
In a blaze of glory, he ends our story
In the Feline Hall of Fame

But the way life goes, in a year who knows,
From the fam'ly he begat
You may wind up with one of, maybe the son of

Bobby Troup,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard,1994
