He(She) is my baby and he (she) lives next door.
Every morning 'fore the sun come up,
He (she) brings my coffee in my fav'right cup.

That's why I know, yes, I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so.
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends,
I know he'll (she'll) go with me until the end.

Everybody asks me how I know.
I smile at them and say he (she) told me so.
That's why I know, yes, I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so.

Now if I call him (her) on the telephone,
And tell him (her) that I'm all alone,
By the time I count from one to four,I hear him (her) on my door.
In the evening when the sun does down,

When there is nobody else around,
He (she) kisses me and he (she) holds me tight.

Tok Tok Tok,"Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With ""Boy thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (""You nasty boy."")
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it-it sure felt out to sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go",I Wish,2005

Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top""

Release your hold and I'll set you free""

Tok Tok Tok,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on",A Day in the Life,2005
Tok Tok Tok,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Tausende Lichter die die Nacht erhellen
Auf den Straßen herrscht dichtes Gedränge
Ich mitten drin, ein Gefühl das ich brenn

Ich laufe los und merke nicht mal das ich fliege
Aus der Ferne seh ich ein Lichtermeer
Tausende Menschen ein tanzendes Heer

Es ist so wunderschön, dieses Nachtleben
Ich will doch nur tanzen die ganze Nacht
Einmal noch tanzen bis der Tag erwacht
Es ist so wunderschön, dieses Nachtleben
Gib mir die Hand und lass uns nochmal tanzen
Die ganze Nacht bis der Morgen erwacht

Am hintersten Horizont sieht man das Licht
Wie es auf geht und die Dunkelheit bricht
Aus schwarzen Schatten werden bunte Gestalten
Die ihre Tanzlust völlig entfalten
Das Ende ist nah und ich bin voller Staub
Will noch nicht das der Tag mir die Nacht raubt

Also lauf ich los und bleibe nicht mehr stehen
Dreh die Zeit zurück ich will die Nacht sehen

Ich will doch nur tanzen die ganze Nacht

That thrills and delights me, oh no

I'm fighting all it's power coming in my way
Let it take me straight to you,
I'll be running night and day
I'll be with you soon
Just me and you
We'll be there soon
So soon

Running through the monsoon
Beyond the world
Til' the end of time
Where the rain won't hurt
Fighting the storm
Into the blue
And when I lose myself I'll think of you
Together we'll be running somewhere new

And nothing can hold me back from you
Through the monsoon
Through the monsoon
Just me and you
Through the monsoon
Just me and you",Monsoon,2007
Tokio Hotel,"It's getting light outside
She is still there but no one cares
They sang her Happy Birthday yesterday without her
Do you want to see yourself flying through the night?
This gift is what you need
You're gonna be alright
Eyes close and fall

[Chorus]
Her first time on the edge
The scars will stay forever
Side to side with death
A moment that feels better
Darkness and light are blinding her sight
She's not coming back

Its getting light outside
She cannot sleep 'cause time stands still
Someone's hand is touching her, she has no will
Each time when it hurts, she just feels so alone
She doesn't care at all
Her memories are long gone
Eyes close and fall

[Chorus]

She shuts the door
She longs for more and more
And more
She shuts the door
She longs for more and more
And more
Just once more

Everyone is watching
Her arms are so sore
But she doesn't care anymore

Our senses had been drowned
A place we hadn't been before

We learned to live and then
Our freedom came to an end
We have to break down this wall
Too young to live a lie
Look into my eyes

Ready, set, go it's time to run
The sky is changing we are one
Together we can make it while the world is crashing down
Don't you turn around

We are looking back again
Our loneliness and pain
Never been so wide awake

Breathe slowly in and out
Somewhere beyond the clouds
I can see the morning break
Too young to live a lie
Look into my eyes

Ready, set, go it's time to run
The sky is changing we are one
Together we can make it while the world is crashing down
Don't you turn around

Leave it all behind you now
The final wall is breaking down
We are all it's all about
Nothing can stop us now

I promise you right know
I never let you down

Ready, set, go it's time to run
The sky is changing we are one
Together we can make it while the world is crashing down
Don't you turn around

I fucked up on girls, I fucked up this song
I fucked up on my sister, my dad, and my mom
I fucked up on everyone, I fucked up on me
I fucked up with money, and man, nothing is free
I fucked up on Letterman, I fucked up on stage
I fucked up on time and I fucked up too late

But now, I am ready to win

I stand on a river, I stand on a stage
Hoping for glory, or maybe today
'Cause it's all a mistake, and a beautiful mess
Like your next door neighbor when you saw him undress
And I'll do it forever, do nothing but fail

Yeah, now, I am ready

And tell them they're great, tell them they're splendid
No matter how all of their fuck-ups have ended
Tell them they're free from whatever happened
From all of the haters who need someone to slap them
Just go and fuck up, fuck up fucking up
Nothing but fucking up, never e-fucking-nough
And then you'll be strong, and then you'll be fearless
'Cause you've done it all, and your tear ducts are tearless
Then you'll remember, there's a fire in your heart
And a dream in your head, and permission to start
And from out of the silence you will hear your voice
Like a big fucking siren and you won't have a choice
And you will stand up, throw caution to the wind
And you will scream out that you are ready to win

Are you ready?
Ready to win

'Cause everyone's weak and everyone's drunk
And everyone's smart but usually wrong
And Rome wasn't built on a fucking cliché
And I love you all in the best fucking way
Fuck up like a pro, fuck up like a saint
Fuck up for the terrified people in wait
Because the good things are hard and the hard things are good
You know I'd fuck up for you if I could

There's no use looking back.
In retrospect, its all clear now, twenty/twenty.
What lies ahead?
It's your path, up to you to plot it well.
Take some chances, fifty/fifty.
You gotta make yourself do something,
instead of falling back on familiarity.

You said yourself
that this would be the last time
that you spent
alone, hoping things would happen.
Is it someone else's responsibility to pick you up?
Stop dreaming. Start being.
You gotta make yourself do something,
instead of falling back on familiarity.

so take it, yeah take it.
Take it for granted.

Stop reading between the lines.
You won't like what you'll find.
You haven't seen nothing yet.
The best is yet to come.

You're holding the past against me,

Tom Aldredge,"He's a very smart prince
He's a Prince who prepares
Knowing this time I'd run from him
He spread pitch on the stairs
I was caught unawares

And I thought, well, he cares
This is more than just malice
Better stop and take stock
While you're standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace

You think, what do you want?
You think, make a decision
Why not stay and be caught?
You think, well, it's a thought

What would be his response?
But then what if he knew
Who you were when you know
That you're not what he thinks
That he wants?

And then what if you are
What a prince would envision?
Although how can you know
Who you are till you know
What you want, which you don't?

So then which do you pick
Where you're safe, out of sight
And yourself, but where every thing's wrong?
Or where every thing's right
And you know that you'll never belong?

And whichever you pick
Do it quick
'Cause you're starting to stick
To the steps of the palace

It's your first big decision
The choice isn't easy to make
To arrive at a ball
Is exciting and all
Once you're there, though, it's scary

And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave
But you have to be wary
There's a lot that's at stake
But you've stalled long enough
'Cause you're still standing stuck
In the stuff on the steps

Better run along home
And avoid the collision
Even though they don't care
You'll be better off there
Where there's nothing to choose
So there's nothing to lose

So you pry up your shoes
Then from out of the blue
And without any guide
You know what your decision is
Which is not to decide

You'll just leave him a clue
For example, a shoe
And then see what he'll do
Now it's he and not you
Who is stuck with a shoe

In a stew, In the goo
And you've learned something, too
Something you never knew
On the steps of the palace

Who might that be?
It's the witch from next door
The old enchantress told the couple she had

Placed a spell on their house

What spell?

In the past, when your mother was with child, she developed

An unusual appetite, she took one look at my beautiful garden
And told your father that what she wanted more than

Anything in the world was
Greens, greens and nothing but greens
Parsley, peppers, cabbages and celery
Asparagus and watercress and
Fiddleferns and lettuce!
He said, ""All right""

But it wasn't, quite
'Cause I caught him in the autumn

In my garden one night!
He was robbing me

Raping me
Rooting through my rutabaga

Raiding my arugula and
Ripping up my rampion

(My champion! My favorite!)
I should have laid a spell on him

Right there
Could have changed him into stone

Or a dog or a chair
But I let him have the rampion

I'd lots to spare
In return, however

I said, ""Fair is fair:
You can let me have the baby
That your wife will bear

And we'll call it square""

I had a brother?
No, but you had a sister
But the witch refused to tell him anymore of his sister
Not even that her name was Rapunzel
I though I had been more than reasonable
But how was I to know what your father
Had also hidden in his pocket!

What?
Beans

Beans?
The special beans
I let him go
I didn't know
He'd stolen my beans!
I was watching him crawl
Back over the wall!
Then bang! Crash!
And the lightning flash!
And well, that's another story
Never mind
Anyway, at last
The big day came

And I made my claim
""Oh, don't take away the baby""
They shrieked and screeched
But I did
And I hid her
Where she'll never be reached

And your father cried

And your mother died
When for extra measure

I admit it was a pleasure
I said, ""Sorry

I'm still not mollified""
And I laid little spell on them
You, too, son

That your family tree
Would always be a barren one
So there's no more fuss
And there's no more scenes
And my garden thrives
You should see my nectarines!
But I'm telling you the same
I tell kings and queens:

Don't ever never ever
Mess around with my greens!

Especially the beans

Now closely to me, Jack. Lead Milky-White to market and
Fetch the best price you can. Are you listening to me?

Head in a sack
The house is getting colder
This is not the time for dreaming
Chimney stack
Starting to crack
The mice are getting bolder
The floor's gone slack
Your mother's getting older
Your father's not back
And you can't just sit here dreaming pretty dreams
To wish and wait
From day to day
Will never keep
The wolves away

So into the woods
The time is now
We have to live
I don't care how
Into the woods
To sell the cow

You must begin the journey
Straight to the woods
And don't delay
You have to face

The marketplace
Into the woods to journey's end

Into the woods to sell a friend
Meanwhile, the Witch, for purposes of her own
Explained how the Baker might lift the spell
You wish to have
The curse reversed?
I'll need a certain
Potion first

Go to the woods and bring me back
One: the cow as white as milk
Two: the cape as red as blood
Three: the hair as yellow as corn
Four: the slipper as pure as gold

Bring me these
Before the chime
Of midnight
In three day's time

And you shall have
I guarantee
A child as perfect
As child can be
Go to the wood!
Ladies

Our carriage waits
Now may I go to the Festival?

The Festival!
Darling, those nails!
Darling, those clothes!
Lentils are one thing but
Darling, with those
You'd make us the fools of the Festival
And mortify the Prince!
Our carriage is waiting
We must be gone

Good night, Father
I wish

Look what I found in father's hunting jacket

Six beans, we'll take them with us
No!
The spell is on my house
Only I can lift the spell
The spell is on my house
No, no, the spell is on our house
We must lift the spell
No. You are not to come and that is final
Now what am I to return with?
You don't remember?
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood
And so the Baker, reluctantly, set off to meet the
Enchantress' demands
As for Cinderella
I still wish to go to the Festival
The cow as white as milk
But how am I ever to get to the Festival?
The cape as red as blood
The hair as yellow as corn
I know!
I'll visit Mother's grave
The grave at the hazel tree
And tell her I just want to
Go to the King's Festival
Into the woods
It's time to go
It may be all
In vain, you/I know
Into the woods
But even so
I have to take the journey
Into the woods
The path is straight
You know it well
But who can tell
Into the woods to lift the spell
Into the woods to visit Mother
Into the woods to fetch the things
To make the potion
To got to the Festival
Into the woods
Without regret
The choice is made
The task is set
Into the woods
But not forget
Ting why I'm on the journey
Into the woods
To get my wish
I don't care how
The time is now
Into the woods to sell the cow
Into the woods to get the money
Into the woods to lift the spell
To make the potion
To go to the Festival
Into the woods to Grandmother's house
Into the woods to Grandmother's house
The way is clear
The light is good
I have no fear
No no one should
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood
No need to be afraid there
There's something in the glade there
Into the woods
Without delay
But careful not
To lose the way
Into the woods
Who knows what may
Be lurking on the journey?
Into the woods
To get the thing
That makes it worth
The journeying
Into the woods
To see the King
To sell the cow
To make the potion
To see
To sell
To get
To bring
To make
To lift
To go to the Festival!
Into the woods!
Into the woods!
Into the woods
Then out of the woods
And home before dark!",Prologue: Into The Woods,1988

I met her at the club, her friend liked me but she didn't. 
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits.
She didn't want to be one of those ho's whose clothes
Exploiting their body's from head to toes. She had glossy lips,
She was swaying her hips on the dance floor and every ni-
Flashing the grips trying to impress her in vain, 
She gave no play, tend to offer numbers and she said no way.
I thought to myself let it go the girl on beat,
But like Smoky said she really had a hold on me. 
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her. 
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya. Even if I 
Moved to the other side of the party I had pictures in my 
Head of her moving that body. I was beside myself with conquer
Pain so I slowly walked over and I asked her name

She gave a smile but I got no answer though it took a while 
Before she could gave a chance she sat too cool. I offered her 
A drink she turned me down flat she said ""If you want my name 
You gotta do better than that."" I said, ""Okay, now your shit 
Don't stink, I'ma walk away, only tried to buy you a drink."" 
As I began to walk away she said ""I'm sorry for reals, but every 
Guy in the club tries slipping me pills, I don't trust that each 
And everyone would lie to you"" I said ""I understand but that's 
Not what I tried to do, I wasn't even gonna go to your table but 
If I didn't, I knew that I'd regret it later. I go after what I 
Want but I got class. For me no need to slip a pill if I want."" 
She gave me a funny look, I couldn't tell what it meant. She let
Her guard down and on the conversation went
[Chorus: x2]

Lets go!

She said I want a man with the plan and ambition not an immature,
On a., get mission. I'm too good but that I have so much to offer.
Got a good job, working at my mom and dad's law firm. ""You got 
Goals?"" that's what she asked, ""Yeah, I want to fill my home with 
Platinum plaques. It takes hard work but you know it's coming 
After."" She said ""Oh My God! You must be a famous rapper"". ""I do 
Alright, but I'm never satisfied. I'm told 'when you still love 
What you do it never gets old'. I strive for more but that's enough 
About me. Why don't we skip out the club, take a walk  on the street? 
We slipped outta the club with no worries, seemed she wanted to get 
Out in a hurry. We hung all night, and we lost our friends 'til 
They caught us banging in the back of a Benz.

Tom Askin,"In the old days when the wheels went round and round
Through a wagon trench I called this home

And out here on these new trails we've blazed
Watching buffalo herd and windmills sway

And still these paths do run wild
But now the concrete slabs make roads of mile

DId the wealthiest always get there first
They could afford to journey on and on

Amazed at what we've come from
And found along the way the wheels don't turn much different
Only the roads have changed

A freeway never seemed so strange
Rushing back an forht from a life that I can't explain

Trees fall without a sound.
Jets crashing through the sky.
The big sun is burning high.

The oceans are turning black.
Tuna nets are dolphin traps.
Oil spills near a garbage barge.
It's dumping needles and hospital jars.

But close to the fires, and under a trance,
The Indians sang and said with their dance:
To take what you need and leave the rest,
To take what you need and leave it alone.

The landscape is full of holes.
For private business or personal goals.
Nevada's testing the nuclear sin.
Designing wars that no one could win.

The karma debts are out of control.
They're bathing me inside my soul.
Beauty pageants with glamorous furs.
Can you believe what they once were?

But close to the fires, and under a trance,
The Indians sang, and said with their dance:
To take what you need and leave the rest,
To take what you need and leave it alone.

Meeting people
Without names and without
Faces they lived

To the west

They're gonna make it all the
Way to Colorado
Where the mountains touch
The sky and rivers bend

This land really is

Broken down from some new form of gasoline

Tom Ball,"It's painted red, the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
Put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
A '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it make me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say, you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half-ton shortbed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
Couple of burned valves and he had it going
He let me drive here when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
Sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With three-speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say, a little slower son you're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
To let them drive my old Jeep across a pasture in our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile, and say

Just an old worn-out Jeep
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say, turn it left and steer it right
Straighten up girl now you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive

When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
Daddy let me drive

That September day?
Out in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor,
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones,
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white, and blue
And heroes who died just doin' what they do?

Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened,
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow,
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on """"I Love Lucy"""" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger,
Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your fam'ly,

He gets me my drinks for free

Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy

Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness

And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.

He's come to take me back.

I lose myself a while.... 
And I pray to the moon despairingly, 
Comfort me, please comfort me
For sometimes, my smile won't smile, 
And my laugh won't laugh
And my heart grows cold and lonely, 

Open like a book, my heart, it reads broken sentences, 
And for pages you turn and the chapters you read, 
It's though my story will never seem to end,
For sometimes my gears won't change and my clutch gets stuck 
And my wheels won't turn on empty 

So if at night you hear a voice, it may be the moon and me, 
Or if at times you lose your light then ask the moon to shine on you!
Join the moon and me
The moon and me... 

And though the world is a cruel cruel place at times
They say a mans not meant to shed a single tear ... 
Oh well if you like me, simply disagree 
Then when the day lays down to sleep, creep beneath the moon with me
For sometimes, my smile won't smile
And my laugh won't laugh
And my heart grows cold and lonely 

So if at night you hear a voice, well it may be the moon and me, 
Or if at times you lose your light then ask the moon to shine on you!
To shine on you... to shine on you....

Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life

Somewhere a king has no wife

And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that they lived is dead

And with its crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers ""no, this will be the last""

And I drank dirty water down to the dregs
But I won't do it again I don't care who begs

Dirty water, now what's that for
Dirty water, I ain't drinkin' no more
I ain't drinkin' no more

You got a lie underneath your tongue where it
Can't be seen
And you want to put the truth on guillotine
But you might as well put out a fire with gasoline
Well you can serve dirty water from a golden cup

You can try to lock up the truth but the door won't shut
'Cause the truth just keeps comin' out like blood from a cut

You can try to sweeten dirty water up with grenadine
But I can still read you just like a magazine
And I ain't gonna drink no more till the water runs clean

Tom Chapin,"All my life's a circle;
Sunrise and sundown;
Moon rolls through the nighttime;
'Til the daybreak comes around.

All my life's a circle;
But I can't tell you why;
Season's spinning round again;
The years keep rollin' by.

It seems like I've been here before;
I can't remember when;
But I have this funny feeling;
That we'll all be together again.
No straight lines make up my life;
And all my roads have bends;
There's no clear-cut beginnings;
And so far no dead-ends.

[Chorus]
I found you a thousand times;
I guess you done the same;
But then we lose each other;
It's like a children's game;

As I find you here again;
A thought runs through my mind;
Our love is like a circle;
Let's go 'round one more time.

Tom Chapin,"Hello honey, it's me
What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said 'That's the place for me'
And how I got the job as an FM Jock the day you married me?
We were two kids and I was was into AM rock
But I just had to run around
It's been eight years since I left you babe
Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down

I am the morning DJ on WOLD
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen
The drinking I did on my last big gig made my voice go low
They said that they liked the younger sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way back home again, via Boise, Idhao
That's how this business goes

I've been making extra money playing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, begging for a new toupee
And a tire on my gut from sitting on my
But they're never gonna go away
Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just drive off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still say where you are
I've been thinking that I should quit disk jockeying
And start that record store

Maybe I could settle down if you'ld take me back once more
Okay honey, I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, old girl, I understand
You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man

For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!

Tom Chaplin,"It's such a beautiful world
So why do I feel so down?
I should be heading for somewhere
Instead of spinning around, round, round
I'm flying out of control
Headlong into the ground
And all the people that love me
They never know if I'm up, down or round

Everything I've got
I’m gonna lose the lot
How I wish that I was not

Hurting everyone I know
Bringing everybody down so low
Stuck along a road of sadness with nowhere to go

Then we're gonna take you out for a ride

There's nothing short of heaven
Going to help you when this hell starts to blow

Is what they show you in the government news

Tom Cochrane,"So long so long so long he's been away
So long so long so long he's back again

When I turned seventeen
We had passion, we had dreams
Thought the love we were fighting for
Was something holy, something more

When I turned twenty-one
We were outside on the run
When I walked out with my girl
We went halfway around the world

I dreamed I saw her standing there
Running for the boy inside the man
I was hit hard by the light so bright it burned
All at once I knew she'd understand
Boy inside the man
The boy inside the man
When I turned twenty-five
We were hungry, we had drive
When I turned much older then
When the boy was lost in pride

Now I just turned thirty-one
I have lost and I have won
Still I've kept my dreams alive
Cause the boy will never die

I dreamed I saw her standing there
Running for the boy inside the man
I was hit hard by the light so bright it burned
All at once I knew she'd understand
Boy inside the man
The boy inside the man
When I turned twenty-five
We were hungry, we had drive
When I turned much older then
When the boy was lost in pride

Ah do you understand

Running for the boy inside the man

Tom Cochrane,"You can lead a horse to water
But you cannot make him drink
You can own a man's whole work for life
But you cannot make him think what you want
You can tell them all a thousand lies
But you don't own the world
You can give her everything you want
But you won't have my girl
Man you leave it all in pieces
Let us all come and clean it up
Love to see your name in the papers
Like to hang out at your club
Like to drive around in your silver car
As if it were a cloud
Like to call yourself a legend
But if you were you wouldn't be that proud

Your money don't buy you love
Citizen cain, citizen cain
I don't know what you could be thinking of
Citizen cain, citizen cain
Don't you think that you have the keys
You might own all the locks in this whole damn town
But there ain't no chains on me

You like to do everybody favors
Then take it all back in spades
Keep everyone you know under your big bad thumb
Until they start to fade
You like to think you're king of the western world
But he died long ago
You like to give yourself to charity
As long as everybody else knows

Won't be the first time you wait by the phone
Won't be the last time you drift away
To some place we were such a long time ago
We would move like ghosts in the night
Always looking for some cause to fight
You'd always look for some cool James Dean type
We tried to make it
Like it was up on the screen
You know, only fools believe
What they cannot see
And only fools put their hands in the fire
Again and again
To see how it feels back in
CHORUS
No, I don't want to hear you say
That it won't happen like this anymore
And while the radio plays
I'll sing that lasting song again
And again

We're shadows dancing from a fires embrace
Where time is passing in a wild nights race
You are the moon and I'll be the sun
Forget about who has lost and who's won tonight
You know, only fools believe
What they want to see
And only fools put their hands in the fire
Again and again
To see how it feels back in

CHORUS

Though I'm miles away
I can still hear her say
Play that song for me
Once again she said
The one thing that gets me high
The one that keeps me strong

Into the lonely night

Won't be the last time I sing you that song
Under these lights so far from home again

She got the heart of the working man
It's not hard to understand
She got the love
She got the love of the working man
She wears it high upon her sleeve
Deep in the heart of this working land
They say the streets are paved with gold
And ever man had his mission
Then after all the stories are told
The only thing I've got to hold
Our love is under fire tonight
But you know it's not to be forgotten

She's seen this place before
Where do you stop it?
Stop the leaking, this is ship to shore
Down to zero and then back for more
Do you miss me?
She doesn't even know your name
We can rise from this
Likes ashes to diamonds
Like a soldier from a kiss
Milk and honey, or the grapes of wrath

You don't walk a thousand miles
Just to get yourself turned back
Don't you fade on me now
Can't you see
We can take it is degrees
Nor rhyme nor reason or fame nor gold
Could make you change your mind, your heart, your soul

Our love is under fire tonight
You know it's not to be forgotten
Our love is on the wire tonight
But It'll never be broken (repeat)

You might look the other way
And then turn again someday when you'll remember
It'll never, never be broken

Our love is under fire tonight
You know it's not to be forgotten

That won the war
Sing me the song

It's almost D-Day

I'd know that face anywhere
Without a trace and without a sign
Anytime you could come to me
In the night
When you thought
No one should have known
With your hard luck little girl look
And the trouble that you'd own
You'd come like the wind
When the night got so cold
And leave with the light
Like you didn't even know you'd
Come at all
CHORUS

One more time
You could walk back in
One more time
It's the same south highway again
One less chance and then one less mistake
Some old habits are hard to break
Like you

If a heart could ever learn to say goodbye
And not let time take the best away
Still I Learn
Look down and I'd ask knowing why
Still this time is the destiny
I'd wait while you climb your golden stair
Hard luck then little girl
I know it's nowhere
Still you feel
They beat on you like a drum
If you get tired, torn and wasted
You know I'd never be one

CHORUS

So many times
When it gets hard to
See the truth
When you got to survive you
Tow the line and you compromise
Until you live a lie

I'd know that face anywhere and I
Without a trace and without a sign
I still remember

On the fields where we once laid
Looked back on them for one last time
Before the storm would break
You cannot stand in the line of fire
I still can hear you say
We won't be going home tonight
Where only the past remains

No, you cannot drink
From the river of stone
No you cannot live
In the shelter of a burned out home
I can almost touch
The times that we once knew
Then the wild and shattered nights
When only the darkness grew
We lost our dreams in a bitter wind
Watched as the fields were burned
We'll hold our heads up high again
When our dreams have been returned

No you cannot drink
From a river of stone
No you cannot live
When you're losing your love

No you cannot drink
From a river of stone
No you cannot live
When you're losing your love (repeat)

You work in the mill and get laid in the ground
If you're gonna jump it will be with the game
Real fast and tough is the only clear lane to the big league

My boy's gonna play in the big league
My boy's gonna turn some heads
My boy's gonna play in the big league
My boy's gonna knock 'em dead

Out with his girl near Lake Mcclean
Hit a truck doing seventy in the wrong lane
To the big league

My boy's gonna turn some heads
My boy's gonna play in the big league
My boy's gonna knock 'em dead

Never can tell what might come down
Never can tell how much you get
Just don't know, no you never can tell

Sometimes at night I can hear the ice crack
It sounds like thunder and it rips through my back
Sometimes in the morning I still hear the sound
Ice meets metal...
""can't you drive me down to the big league?""

Who lived outside of town

Battered and run down

Helped out, we took him in
Like my brother he disappeared

There we were far out at sea
Somehow we got lost
Then we landed hard on shore
There upon the rocks
While celebration shook the air
We turned to hear some shots

In colors red, white and blue
The more I spoke, the less she heard
And then she slipped away
I just stood there sinking
Far beneath the waves

Tom Cochrane,"If I was a sailor man
If I was lost at sea
I'd see your light shining there
Off the rocks, off the sand
That light would be all that I'd see
And if I was the king of the world
With all the world to set free
You'd be the one there to force my hand
To make a stand
Give me that sweet release
Those are the dreams that a
Dreamer Dreams
Those are the dreams
That he dreams
That he dreams
Fill you up so high
So high you wouldn't come down
Those are the dreamers dreams
 
If I could see in you
All the things you want me to
And if I could walk a mile in your shoes
An old cliche, anyway
But if you could just do the same
There's nothing we couldn't so
Surround you with a silver crown
Fill you up so high
So high you wouldn't come down

Those are the dreams That a Dreamer dreams
Those are the dreams
That he dreams
Fill you up so high
So high you won't come down

I'm gonna take what we might take away

And you will find a brighter
You might find a brighter day

I'm white hot
By the Somalian shore
White hot, yes I'm burning to the core
I need rain

Cast out from the jungle
With no rations or canteen
For selling faulty riffles
To the thieves in Tanzania

Adventures and misfortune
Nothing wagered, nothing gained
I have wandered through the desert
Found the ocean not the rain

I can remember the nights by the strand in Tripoli
We were so much younger then
I had you and my poetry to protect me
We were so much cooler then

Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar

Tom Cochrane,"Could it be the joke's on us?
Seventy-five degrees and it's just the end of winter
She says we've got all we need
To go outside and sit right down and paint a picture

One more day to be alive
One more good day to survive
One good day to put your glasses on
Protect yourself from the midday sun
It's one more beautiful day
And it's one more beautiful day to survive

Don't forget to put your screen on
No, I don't care if I burn to the ground today
I'm sick and tired of shades of gray and brown
Gonna put this brim hat on
Just to be cool
Not as a rule, as a hoot
'Cause you're born naked
And you go out with a suit; and if you're lucky...

[Chorus:]
I see people in the streets, and they're all smiling
Underneath the ozone skies
We've got one more mountain to climb
One more river to cross
I can't seem to find myself by
Yes, I'm going outside
Let's take a, let's take a ride

No one's gonna break my stride
Or bruise my pride
Or bring me down today
Sick and tired of shades of white and gray

Gonna sit right down over there and paint a picture
You're born naked

No one sees that point of view

It's so hard to communicate
So hard to relate
Unless you're someone else
Unless you've not come to
Dictate, to dictate to
To tell 'em what to do

I got my own mind
I want to have some fun
I want to be in the sun
I want to be somewhere, where I can be
Who I've got to be
Got to see, got to be real

Where I'm calling from
They can't desert you
Where you're calling from
They like to eat you but they can't hurt you
Don't you know you're just like me when you hurt

Heartbreak girl, it's your choice
Break outside, raise your voice
Like the Book of Esther, where she shows her colors
And lets down her hair
Heartbreak girl, if you knew, and if you dare
Don't you know you're just like me when you hurt?

Do the things you've got to do
All those things that come to you
When you hold your head all up and above
And the haze falls away like defenses fall
Write a letter to yourself, and
Do the things you've got to do
To no one else
Turn me upside down, you turn me upside down
You're boundless
Where I'm calling from, I won't desert you
Where you're calling from, they'd like to eat you
But they can't hurt you
Don't you know you're just like me when you hurt?

Tom Cochrane,"On a muggy night in the north end in July
A kid named Joseph Beeper Spence
Took a shotgun blast to the back
And died...
There by the CP tracks, along the great divide, you see
Fought two native gangs called the deuce and the I.P.

Dances with warriors, hatred between slaves
They kill each other off, we all get saved
I can't help but think... his mother's tears
Beeper Spence was thirteen
In the northern frontier

A van crossed the bridge that night
And stopped at Flora Avenue
When Beeper thought they'd lost their way
Walked over to see what he could do
""Are you I.P.? Straight up,"" he'd say
Even if it wasn't true
""Bust a cap in his ass.""
He turned to run, heard the blast
Then he was through
 
The kids in the van weren't much older than him
Couldn't tell the difference by the color of their skin
One thing in common, and one thing was real clear
Their future was ended in the northern frontier

Dances with warriors, hatred between slaves
They cut each other down and no one is safe

And we're like a river you and I
Like a river we're gonna run

He went looking to the East, he went looking to the West
He was looking for the courage, To see which way was the best.

Can't turn back, Oh no
Look out on his right, He would look out on his left
He would look out in the distance, Where he could see the wilderness
When the thunderhead approached, He would pull off to the side
And when the sun broke through, He would get back out and ride
 
Cause you can't turn back....
Try to see the forest for the trees, The wind storm for the breeze
No one ever said that it would be that easy
You make your way through the debris, Cling to your beliefs
Even though the world might say your crazy

He always had the feeling, He would get back out alive
But the more that he sees of it, Then the less he fantasizes

It's not like that at all

But out on the streets out there

When he must hang up his gloves

Some are tragic some find glory
But it feels more real when you're here
Right next to me

You can walk too far out on that ledge
And you might lose your mind
You know I need you now
You're an angel that keeps me in line
The old sergeant has broken down
He's grown senile
He shouts ""kill the bastards!"" in the night
Cause he's all out of time

Cause there's some things I'd like to forget
When our hearts are sinkin' like a sunset
Won't you hold me now
And make things right

In the morning light
Makes everything alright
The way you move me
Is out of sight now girl

All bathed in gold
With your hair flowing down
Upon your silken robe
And you move to the window
And you stare down below
Out onto the darkness
And the shadows in the snow

Where the brave are free and lovers soar

We won't hesitate break down the garden gate

Ashes to diamonds
Taken all they find
Turning blood to gold
Won't let go

So damned hot
The next time you better slow down
If they catch you near the border
Then it's nothing short of dead or alive
Got your number son
Now we'll get your Cape Town buddy
Then we're gonna take you out for a ride

But you won't have my girl
Man you leave it all in pieces
Let us all come and clean it up

Like to hang out at your club
Like to drive around in your silver car
As if it were a cloud
Like to call yourself a legend
But if you were you wouldn't be that proud

Don't you think that you have the keys
You might own all the locks in this whole damn town
But there ain't no chains on me

You like to do everybody favors
Then take it all back in spades
Keep everyone you know under your big bad thumb
Until they start to fade

But he died long ago
You like to give yourself to charity
As long as everybody else knows

Won't be the first time you wait by the phone
Won't be the last time you drift away

Always looking for some cause to fight
You'd always look for some cool James Dean type
We tried to make it
Like it was up on the screen
You know, only fools believe
What they cannot see
And only fools put their hands in the fire
Again and again
To see how it feels back in
CHORUS
No, I don't want to hear you say
That it won't happen like this anymore
And while the radio plays
I'll sing that lasting song again
And again

We're shadows dancing from a fires embrace
Where time is passing in a wild nights race
You are the moon and I'll be the sun
Forget about who has lost and who's won tonight
You know, only fools believe
What they want to see
And only fools put their hands in the fire
Again and again
To see how it feels back in

CHORUS

Though I'm miles away
I can still hear her say
Play that song for me
Once again she said
The one thing that gets me high
The one that keeps me strong
Through another day
Into the lonely night

Won't be the last time I sing you that song
Under these lights so far from home again

She got the heart of the working man
It's not hard to understand
She got the love

She wears it high upon her sleeve
Deep in the heart of this working land
They say the streets are paved with gold
And ever man had his mission
Then after all the stories are told
The only thing I've got to hold
Our love is under fire tonight
But you know it's not to be forgotten

She's seen this place before
Where do you stop it?
Stop the leaking, this is ship to shore
Down to zero and then back for more
Do you miss me?
She doesn't even know your name
We can rise from this
Likes ashes to diamonds
Like a soldier from a kiss
Milk and honey, or the grapes of wrath

You don't walk a thousand miles
Just to get yourself turned back
Don't you fade on me now
Can't you see
We can take it is degrees
Nor rhyme nor reason or fame nor gold
Could make you change your mind, your heart, your soul

Our love is under fire tonight
You know it's not to be forgotten
Our love is on the wire tonight
But It'll never be broken (repeat)

You might look the other way
And then turn again someday when you'll remember
It'll never, never be broken

That won the war

Before the words fell from the page
It's almost D-Day

You'd come like the wind
When the night got so cold
And leave with the light
Like you didn't even know you'd
Come at all

You could walk back in
One more time

One less chance and then one less mistake

If a heart could ever learn to say goodbye
And not let time take the best away
Still I Learn
Look down and I'd ask knowing why
Still this time is the destiny
I'd wait while you climb your golden stair
Hard luck then little girl
I know it's nowhere
Still you feel
They beat on you like a drum
If you get tired, torn and wasted
You know I'd never be one

So many times
When it gets hard to
See the truth
When you got to survive you
Tow the line and you compromise
Until you live a lie

Without a trace and without a sign
I still remember

On the fields where we once laid
Looked back on them for one last time
Before the storm would break
You cannot stand in the line of fire

We won't be going home tonight
Where only the past remains

No, you cannot drink
From the river of stone
No you cannot live
In the shelter of a burned out home
I can almost touch
The times that we once knew
Then the wild and shattered nights
When only the darkness grew
We lost our dreams in a bitter wind
Watched as the fields were burned
We'll hold our heads up high again
When our dreams have been returned

No you cannot live

So long so long so long he's back again

When I turned seventeen

Thought the love we were fighting for
Was something holy, something more

When I turned twenty-one
We were outside on the run
When I walked out with my girl
We went halfway around the world

When I turned much older then

No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing At All,2006
Tom Cohen,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2006
Tom Constanten,"Dark star crashes, pouring its light into ashes.
Reason tatters, the forces tear loose from the axis.
Searchlight casting for faults in the clouds of delusion.
Shall we go, you and I while we can

Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?
Mirror shatters in formless reflections of matter.
Glass hand dissolving to ice petal flowers revolving.
Lady in velvet recedes in the nights of goodbye.

Country garden in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain

Stephen prospered in his time, well he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now? Stephen would answer if he only knew how
Wishing well with a golden bell, bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight, writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer, darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own
Did he doubt or did he try? Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

Saint Stephen will remain, all he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam,
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home

Tom Cruise,"We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did the words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here somehow
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

But now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess

Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song

When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said ""You're on buddy -- my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way -- to Dead Man's Curve""

We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine!

I flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six taillights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were - at Dead Man's Curve

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm free as a dove

I'm lost inside your kiss

About all the things i'd missed

And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes, it was my way",My Way,2012
Tom Faulkner,"I saw her walking one Sunday
Down a cobblestone lane
The sunlight danced through the cotton woods
The air smelled like rain

Still unaware of my presence
She stopped for a while
To see the world spinning by
Through the eyes of a child

Angelina [Foreign content]

I cross her way and inquired her name
And she softly replied
I reached across and gave my hand
She smiled and obliged

She tried to speak in my language
I stumbled through hers
I had so many thoughts
But couldn't find the right words

Angelina [Foreign content]

I knew that I had found
An angel in disguise
We talked as though the night would never end
But we both knew otherwise

Here in this place of pure innocence
This haven of peace
There's a lady who's love
Still awaits its release

Tom Faulkner,"There's been something I've been trying
To see for sometime now
But I found myself rambling
Through all the wrong words

I guess I'd known you so long
That I never really knew just our ways
'Til I find myself thinking of you
Whenever I'm with somebody else

I've had days of confusion
I've laid sleepless in vain
Just to find my way to you again
Do you understand?

Please don't tell me the answers
Don't tell me what you're thinking of
Just tell me when you see a sign of love

Do you remember last year?
It was the first day of May
When we found ourselves staring
With nothing to say

Well, I've been wondering since then
What was going on through your mind
Now I thought this thing through
And I'm hoping that you can leave friends behind

Though you seem like a sister
With the ways done to be
Still you look like a lover to me
Girl, can't you see?

Please don't tell me the answer
Don't tell me what you're thinking of
Just tell me when you see a sign of love

How the years can bring changes
Seems like nothing stands still
But I'm willing to try if you will
I'll wait if you will

Please don't tell me the answer
Don't tell me what you're thinking of
Just tell me when you see a sign of love

Tom Fischer,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Tom Frederikse,"For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, 
The homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. 
All that was of value to me was in London. 
By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

Forever Autumn

Journalist
The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here.

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here.
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. 
The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Journalist
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, 
More and more people joined the painful exodus. 
Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, 
Their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. 

Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, 
And here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, 
Cutting through bridges as though they were paper. 
Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, 
Had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. 
This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, 
Without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. 

It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. 
I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. 
At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. 
At that very moment, it was raised, 
And I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

Tom Frederikse,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

As time passed in our dark and dusty prison
The Parson wrestled endlessly with his doubts
His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man [The Spirt of Dub],2006

And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you,

I am free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way",Fantasy,1997
Tom Grant,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2000

Is the invisible man

You probably spend hours on the phone
Talkin' 'bout nothing at all

Lost in a love so real
And so sincere
You wipe away each other's tears

Tom Grant,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2004

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?

Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much

Don't sigh and gaze at me

I wanna go and bounce the moon

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

That I would rather be.

The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain

I say, don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire

And watch him grow into a shell of a man
Everything is taking shape and going to plan
How quickly though, life can turn around
One step forward, two steps back, he’s lost in the crowd

Alone, we stand together we fall
Slow, that belief conquers all

So don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
I say, don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire

If you walk in your shadow
Led by shepherds then you know
If you walk in your shadow
If you walk in your shadow
Led by shepherds then you know
If you walk in your shadow

So don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
I say, don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire",Barbed Wire,
Tom Grennan,"Oh I love, oh I love, love my freedom
More than heartbeat, a beat at a table for one
Go to a movie with just yours truly
Stay out all night or go to sleep early

I do what I want to do
Got no one to answer to
Live whatever life I choose
I'm free

Don't want no one taking up my time
Staying on my mind, changing up my life
Don't want no one messing up my bed
Fucking with my head, it's no lie
But when you look at me like that
I might

Oh I like, oh I like singing loudly
In my room out of tune with no one around me
Being stupid, acting crazy
Work hard all day or spend the day being lazy

I go where I want to go
Living fast or taking it slow
Like it out here on my own
I'm free

Don't want no one taking up my time
Staying on my mind, changing up my life
Don't want no one messing up my bed
Fucking with my head, it's no lie
But when you look at me like that
I might

Might never walk away
Might beg you to stay
Might change everything just to keep you close to me

Don't want no one taking up my time
Staying on my mind, changing up my life
Don't want no one messing up my bed
Fucking with my head, it's no lie

I might, I might, I might
When you look at me like that

Tom Grennan,"I've had a long day, I've been 
walking on, hands in pockets
Wishing on stars that I can't see
I watch all you city dreamers
left hometown believers
Looking down at the ground like me

We're all lonely people, lonely people, alone
Going in circles, going wherever the wind blows and it blows

But I'm lighting matches
Making a shelter for a flame til' fire catches
Stay in the dark another day (I wanna know)
Will it all get better (are we alone?)
Or are we lost together

Nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
Are we lost together
Nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
Are we lost together

So I lift my eyes up
let conversation lie on
It feels like I've no room for time
Tell me which piece of you is missing
We all got pasts, we fix them
It's just the catch of being alive

We're all lonely people, lonely people, alone
Going in circles, going wherever the wind blows and it blows

But I'm lighting matches
Making a shelter for a flame til' fire catches
Stay in the dark another day (I wanna know)
Will it all get better (are we alone?)
Or are we lost together

Nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
Are we lost together
Nah-nana-nah-nah-nana-nah
Are we lost together

And I-I-I-I won't stand down
And I-I-I-I won't let it burn down
Can't make this puzzle with a piece that doesn't fit
There must be something more than this

So I'm lighting matches
Making a shelter for a flame til' fire catches
Stay in the dark another day (I wanna know)
Will it all get better (are we alone?)
Or are we lost together

Tom Grennan,"Mama told me not to get involved
But I never did what I was told
Always drawn to the golden light
And it would happen every single night
Carry on, carry on, carry on
We were living by the Marlboro rule
Never talking to the jakes or turnin' up at school
And I'd pretend that I was fine enough
That I was never giving up
Carry on, carry on, carry on

And I saw my devil closing in
Never thought I'd do such bad things
You saved me though
Little by little love
And I try so hard to bury that stuff
Never thought I'd get so fucked up
You saved me though
Little by little love, Little by little love

Misbehaviour, clocking out reports
Where's your manners, where's the things you're taught
I said ""What's your business with the things I do?""
You say ""Boy, if you only had a clue""
Carry on, carry on, carry on
All them years and never thinking straight
In my own way I was lying awake
All my demons came whispering
Telling me carry on, carry on, carry on

And I saw my devil closing in
Never thought I'd do such bad things
You saved me though
Little by little love
And I try so hard to burry that stuff
Never thought I'd get so fucked up
You saved me though

Sail away, together we could run
