The Searchers,"Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine

Everybody stops and stares at my baby
When she's walkin' down the street
People passin' by just look at my baby
Cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's

Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine

Every time we kiss I get that feelin'
Every time we simply meet
When I see you smile I get that feelin' 
Cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's

Kisses sweeter than wine

The Searchers,"Don't try and understand me, you never could do that   
Ah, and in the end you'd wind up being hurt   
I'm a man with too many problems that keep pounding on my brain     
So if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth   
(if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)     
I don't pretend to be a saint, my sins they are many   
But there's no-one perfect in this universe   
And though you think I'm weird, don't try and change me dear     
Cause if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth   
(if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)     
Hear a howling wind outside my door, there's restlessness within   
Oh, I'm like a raincloud that one day may burst   
We both know I'll be leavin' and if one little tear you grieve     
Ah, it's all right 'cause that's all I'm really worth   
(it's all right 'cause that's all I'm really worth)     
And if you think about me in your lonesome hours   
Ah, and on your lips there's a sweet word and not a curse   
Ah, then I'll be comin' back one day when my wandering is over     
Ah, if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth   
(if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)   
Ah, if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth

The Searchers,"I can feel a new expression on my face
I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tunes
Every time that you walk in the room
 
I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room
 
Baby it's a dream come true
Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel a something pounding in my brain
Just any time that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound I hear thunder boom
Every time that you walk in the room",When You Walk in the Room,1977
The Searchers,"Some girls have a whole lot of trouble finding one boy.
Others want a lover, some they just want a fun boy.
My girl, she's smart.  She's never ever going to give her heart.
And she's wild.
           
She's got hearts in her eyes.
She's got hearts in her eyes.
Like a kid in a toy shop, she can't stop.
She wants all the boys.
She's got hearts in her eyes.

Some girls want a boy to give her all the action.
Others in a hurry to find a little satisfaction.
This girl, she's tough.
She keeps going when the going gets rough.
And she's wild.

When she's at a party she will flit from boy to boy.
But she'll never settle, her heart is filled with joy.

My girl, she's smart.  She's never ever going to give her heart
And she's wild.",Hearts in Her Eyes,1979
The Searchers,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,

The Searchers,"Outside my window, I can hear the radio,
And I know that motor wagon is ready to fly,

Bye bye, tomorrow, Jody's gone to the rodeo,
And you know some good old boys are ready to ride,
'Cause it's almost Saturday night.

[Chorus]
Gonna push the clouds away, let the music have it's way,

I was your butch and you were touched

Weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind if I asked you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change
Come what may
If the good times are all gone
The I'm bound for moving on

You could meet me if I send you down the fare

Something's gonna break before too long
I don't know the reason for this feeling
And I can't put my finger on what's wrong

Do you feel it too is it so strong?
Do you feel it too or am I wrong

That this is not the way that it should be.

I don't wanna be the one to say goodbye
I don't wanna look the problem in the eye
I don't wanna be the first to say
That maybe we should both call it a day

Saying, ""Looky, what did you do""
A pointing his finger right on you

I just sat right down on the floor
I just took a drink in my hand
And then it all began
Somebody's always to blame
Somebody's calling my name
Somebody's putting me down
When there just ain't nobody around
BUt it just ain't me this time
Said it just ain't me this time, girl
Did you ever feel you're from different time?
And 9 from 9 equal none
And the king in the courtyard has just lost his crown
The garden he grows, grows blacker each day
As 29 crows a'fly away
The flowers fade, fading away

The Seekers,"He came from his palace grand;
He came to my cottage door;
His words were few, but his look
Will linger for evermore,
The look in his sad, dark eyes,
More tender than words could be.
But I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
There in her garden she stands,
All dressed in fine satin and lace,
Lady Mary, so cold and so strange;
In his heart she could find no place.
He knew I would be his bride,
With a kiss for a lifetime fee.
But I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
Now in his palace grand,
On a flower-strewn bed he lies.
His beautiful lids are closed
On his sad, dark, beautiful eyes.
And among the mourners who mourn,
Why should I a mourner be?
For I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
For I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.

From the dusty red-soil plains
I am the ancient heart
The keeper of the flame
I stood upon the rocky shores
I watched the tall ships come
For forty thousand years I've been
The first Australian

I came upon the prison ship
Bowed down by iron chains
I bought the land, endured the lash
And waited for the rains

On a dry and barren run
A convict, then a free man

Bowing her politely on to me.

The week has gone its lonely way;
I've waited for my only day
Away from shadows,
In her sunlight I can tell her, ""I love you, Angeline.""

She hasn't even read her magazine.
Angeline is counting stations, 'til the one where I am standing,
Waiting for my only Angeline.

It isn't easy seaching around;
I can't believe it's true.

And when I turned around,
I found your note pushed under my door;
You'd gone without a sound.

So you had gone, no word of farewell;
I didn't realize.

You've got love to fill my heart;

I can never be the same again;
Now my eyes are looking past the life that I knew,
I'll be shedding black and grey to take on red and blue,
Colours I can feel by touching you:
Colours of my life,
Bloom like flowers in my heart;
I don't need a rainbow

To fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go waAs I know you must
There'll be nothing left

In the world to trust
Just an empty room
Full of empty space

Can I tell you now
As you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly

Are you thinking of me now,
Missing having me around?

Wherever you are, that I still love you so.

There's not a lot for me to do,

And my thoughts return to you,
I tried to read the paper
But the words aren't very clear,
Oh I know there's something missing
And I wish you could be here.

Or your key turned in the door,

From the dusty red-soil plains
I am the ancient heart
The keeper of the flame
I stood upon the rocky shores
I watched the tall ships come
For forty thousand years I've been
The first Australian

I came upon the prison ship
Bowed down by iron chains
I bought the land, endured the lash
And waited for the rains
I'm a settler, I'm a farmer's wife
On a dry and barren run
A convict, then a free man
I became Australian

I'm the daughter of a digger
Who sought the mother lode
The girl became a woman 
On the long and dusty road
I'm a child of the Depression
I saw the good times come
I'm a bushie, I'm a battler
I am Australian

We are one, but we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We'll share a dream and sing with one voice
""I am, you are, we are Australian""

I'm a teller of stories
I'm a singer of songs
I am Albert Namatjira
And I paint the ghostly gums
I'm Clancy on his horse
I'm Ned Kelly on the run
I'm the one who waltzed Matilda
I am Australian

I'm the hot wind from the desert
I'm the black soil of the plains
I'm the mountains and the valleys
I'm the drought and flooding rains
I am the rock, I am the sky
The rivers when they run
The spirit of this great land
I am Australian

We are one, but we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We'll share a dream and sing with one voice
""I am, you are, we are Australian""

Gotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man.
At birth, Mama 'n' Papa called their little boy Ned;
Raised him on the banks of the river bed.
A houseboat tied to a big, tall tree,
A home for my mama and my papa and me.
The clock strikes three, Papa jumps to his feet;
Already Mama's cookin' Papa somethin' to eat.
At half-past, Papa, he's a-ready to go;
He jumps in his bureau headed down the bayou.
[Chorus:]
He's got a fishin' line strung across a Louisiana river,
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat.
He sets his traps in the swamps, catches anything he can;
Gotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man.
Gotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man.
Oh, yeh! Cajun man, do all he can,
Gotta make a livin'; he's a Louisiana man.
They call Mama Rita and my daddy Jack;
The little baby brother on the floor is Mack.
Bryn and Lynn are the family twins,
Big brother Ed's on the bayou fishin'.
On the river float Papa's great big boat;
That's how my papa goes into town
Takes ev'ry bit of the night and day
To even reach a place where the people stay.
(Chorus)
I can hardly wait 'til tomorrow comes 'round;
That's the day my Papa takes his furs to town.
Papa said, ""Son, we got lines to run.
We come back again, 'cause there's work to be done.""

Mr Sandman passes by my door;
Life has changed since you've been there to say it's alright,
You taught me to understand what I thought couldn't be,
Don't mind missing sleep if I can see:
Colours of my life,
You've got love to fill my heart;
I don't need a rainbow
With colours of my life,
Colours of my life.
Colours blend with love to show I'm happy with you,
I can never be the same again;
Now my eyes are looking past the life that I knew,
I'll be shedding black and grey to take on red and blue,
Colours I can feel by touching you:
Colours of my life,
Bloom like flowers in my heart;
I don't need a rainbow
With colours of my life,
Colours of my life.

Bloom like flowers in my heart;

Could it be you just don't try or is it the clothes you wear?

You're always window shopping but never stopping to buy
So shed those dowdy feathers and fly a little bit

There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide and, oh, what a change there'd be

The Seldom Scene,"Just a loud mouth Yankee I went down to Mexico.
I didn't have much time to spend, about a week or so.
There I lightly took advantage of a girl who loved me so.
But I found myself a-thinkin' when the time had come to go...

[Chorus:]
What am I doin' hangin' round?
I should be on that train and gone.
I should be ridin' on that train to San Antone,
What am I doin' hangin' round?

She took me to the garden just for a little walk.
I didn't know much Spanish and there was no time for talk.
Then she told me that she loved me not with words but with a kiss.
And like a fool I kept on thinkin' of a train I could not miss...

[Chorus]

Well it's been a year or so, and I want to go back again.
And if I get the money, well I'll ride the same old train.
But I guess your chances come but once and boy I sure missed mine.

A story that I know is true
A little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With hair of gold and a heart so true

Way down in the blue ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
Lives my sweetheart of the mountains
She's my little Georgia rose

A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand

I watched her do her little part",Little Georgia Rose,1973
The Seldom Scene,"I lost ten points just for being in the right place
At exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there, but I may as well have
Been completely blind
So, if you see me walking all alone
Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home
There's a train leaves here this morning, and
I don't know, what I might be on
She signed me to a contract, baby said it would
All be so life long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't something more to blame it on
But, if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now, and I won't be hanging on
There's a train leaves here this morning
And I don't know, what I might be on
Ooo, ooo, ooo.. etc...
1320 north columbus was the address
That I wrote down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
Might have been that it was getting time to leave
And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said, ""lead on.""
Cause there's a train leaves here this morning

A routine he can't stand
And at night he derams of wide open spaces
Gresh dirt tween his toes and on his hands

Inside a letter

With a baby in her arms
And the words she wrote
Would change his life forever

The Seldom Scene,"Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the man who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave while the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The judge said Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you don't have to die
I spoke not a word thought it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

In a long black veil she cries over my bones ",Long Black Veil,1990
The Seldom Scene,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

Down where the lights are so bright.

From ridin' the range in the cold,
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart,
Her love was as lasting as gold.

As he drew near her window,
Two shadows he saw on the shade;
'Twas the great Philadelphia lawyer
Makin' love to Bill's Hollywood maid.

The night was as still as the desert,
The moon hangin' high overhead.
Bill listened awhile through the window,

Your form's so rare and divine.

The gay times and play times
Like colors run together and fade

Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away

There's times when I trembled
When my mind remembered
The days that just crumbled away
With nothing to show
But these lines that I know
Are beginning to show in my face

Oh Lord if you're listening
I know I'm no Christian
And I ain't got much coming to me
So send down some sunshine
Throw out your lifeline
And keep me from blowing away

To see an erring but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him

It was a halo bright sent down from heaven's light
The sweetest gift, a mother's smile

Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town.
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab.
With a twenty dollar bill, told him 'catch that yellow cab.'

The September Strings,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me.

The September Strings,"A winter's day, in a deep and dark December
I am alone, gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock, I am an island

I've built walls, a fortress deep and mighty that none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock, I am an island

Don't talk of love well I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
And I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock, I am an island

I have my books and my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor, hiding in my room, safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock, I am an island",I Am a Rock,1994
The September Strings,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1994
The September When,"I t feels like I'm burning inside
Can you help me with some water

And I can no longer ignore
Where the situation stands

Duncan arrives with a gun in his hand
He is the man

Duncan arrives with a gun in his hand

But I can't get out of my debt
So bullet bullet bullet my head
And get the situation set

The September When,"Big shade in deep water
He'll look up at me
I'm above, He's below
I think of him as the dinner of tonight
But he sees me through the sunlight

My boat is to small for the rough times
So I prefer hot summer days like these
And when the rowing makes blisters in my hand
I must think of getting myself to land
And when the rowing makes blisters in my hand
I must think of getting myself to land

And when the sun drops down in the western horizon
I put on the coat that will keep me warm
If my trip home happens in the pouring rain
I wish that tomorrow brings sunlight again
If my trip home happens in the pouring rain
I wish that tomorrow brings sunlight again

And if I where one day to bring with me my worries
My boat will not cope It would sink like a stone

I know that I would be safer then
If only the lord would look at me as a friend
I know that I would be safer then",Fish Song,1993

The Septette,"Late in the evening out in the square
A man in a raincoat standing there

We met by the lamp where the newsboy cried
He stole my heart with his laughing eyes

He smiled as we climbed on the old street car
I blushed when he asked are you traveling far

The next time we met the sun shined all day
We walked and we talked 'til the evening was gray

He took me dancing we danced until dawn
No happier couple had ever born

I felt like a queen and he was my king
He borrowed some money to buy me a ring

But I'm still alone the cards are all down
He's taken my money and skipped out of town

Now when I pass the place where we met
I'm wondering if I would forgive and forget

Though fickle is my heart and foolishly proud
I still keep on looking when out in a crowd

With laughing eyes and dark brown hair",The Man in the Raincoat,2005

You see I'm talkin' 'bout happiness with the sad

He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,

One could not walk,

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,

But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round

Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand

He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least

And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon

I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, ""Sit down,"" I stood up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed b-52 and bombed them with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing

And in their place there were two wooden pegs 
She kissed him a dozen times or two 
Saying ""Holly molly could it be you?"" 

""Now was you drunk or was you blind 
When you left your two fine legs behind? 
Or was it out walking upon the sea 
That tore your legs from the knees away?"" 

""No I wasn't drunk and I wasn't blind 
When I left my two fine legs behind. 
For a cannon ball on the fifth of May 
Took my two fine legs from the knees away."" 

""Now Teddy me boy,"" the old widow cried 
""Your two fine legs was your mama's pride 
Them stumps of a tree won't do at all

Yo, yo, I'm 'bout to tell you what I like

I'm with five individuals, they say we not original
We all started underground like Digital
Now the haters lookin' pitiful, we humble and un-spittable
But lyrical, we still sh-sh-shit on you

I got a number two, Nelly got her number too
We call a tip, girl, you prolly call it a switch-a-roo
We be at Amoco, D's on that cantaloupe
Wit my folk's pocket full of bread and toast

In my Timb's and coat, do it big in the winter time
Prolly full of Air Force Ones up outta Finish Line
And I call myself normal, casual or formal
I still be blank like a carnival

You know he drives a yellow wagon when he's passin' by
(Yo, you see me rollin' in that thang?)

His pants is always saggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
Got money but never braggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy

You see I'm young with information, I don't play like Station
'cause it took education, dedication and patience
To get a record deal, fo' real, this ain't no fluke
To you, we like a fat dude playin' a flute

Like my granny do in the troop instead of the James Brown
Look at all these boys reppin' the same town
Come from the same moms and owe dues
Aunties and uncles, man, they went to the same school, yeah

St. Louis ain't that big
Ayyo, we stay on the hill and steal a 30 ball to get to the crib
And I can do it on a quarter tank, a quarter of dank
It's ya home, wake up and maybe go to the bank

And I think you people need to open up like mail
If you can't tell Skool Boy, normal as hell
So don't let the TVs confuse you

'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy
(Yo, I'm just like you)

I ain't different from those that think I'm different
Still enjoy fat checks overtime, I'm just like you
I ain't changin' for nobody, mixin' up your talent wit yo hobby
End up wit no jobby

I guess you got personal problems
The bigger you are, they start openin' up ya personal closet
A Ram 150, man, still couldn't dodge it, dislodge it
Take advantage derrty, live off ya profits

You right, I ain't ya average lil' dude
We had the number one song when I was still in school
Shoot, I can say it though, I'm glad that we made it mo
No neva bein' in class, song pop up on the radio

And it's a beautiful thang
To turn street money to legal money and beautiful change
Yo, I gotta use my beautiful brain
And understand when I'm sprinklin', man, in my rain

I planned, each chartered course

When there was fuck, fuck fuck else to do

But through it all, when there was doubt
I shot it up, or kicked it out
I faced the wall .. and .. the wall
And did it my way

I've had my fill, my share of looting
And now, the tears subside

The Sex Pistols,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
You cunt, I´m not a queer
I´ll state my case, of which I´m certain
I´ve lived a life that´s full
And each and every highway
And yet, much more than this
I did it my way

And yes, I´ve had a few
But then again, too few to mention
But dig, what I have to do
I´ll see it through with no devotion
Of that, take care and just
Be careful along the highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

There were times,
I´m sure you knew
When there was nothing
Fucking else to do
But through it all,
When there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I fought the just as before
And did it my way

Knocked out in bed last night
I´ve had my fill, my share of looting
And now, the tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think, I killed a cat
And may I say, oh no, not their way
But no, no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a brat,
What has he got
When he finds out that he cannot
Say the things he truly thinks
But only the words,
Not what he feels

I´ve got no clothes
And did it my way",My Way [DVD],2005

When I dream I kiss you (kiss you)
Music fills with starlight (starlight)
Every time I touch you ( when I touch you)
Each and every time a chime rings out I love you
Only you for ever more


'Cause you're my theme for a dream
Yes you are a rare and lovely theme (You're my theme for a dream)
So, angel please say that you love me too
And make my dreams come true dream


And make my dreams come true
Please make my dreams come true.

The Shadows,"Last night I heard you 
Opening doors and rattling chains, angel 
Last night I heard you 
Tapping your nails on the window pane, angel

Nightmare I cannot escape, shake my head but I'm awake
Cut myself, hurt myself, I'm sleepwalking 

Last night I saw you 
Stepping on glass and leaving no trace, angel
Like a spider creeping through the crack 
In the wall of a lonely place, angel

Follow every step I take, stranger I cannot forsake 
Shake myself, can't wake myself, I'm sleepwalking

In the corner of my eye, moving, shifting 
A figure dressed in white, floating, drifting

""Last night I touched you 
As you turned to hide your crying face, angel 
Last night I felt you
As you held me in your cold embrace, angel""

Dream from which I can't awake
Witches spell I cannot break 
Scratch myself, bleed myself
I'm sleepwalking

In the corner of my eye, moving, shifting 
A figure dressed in white, floating, drifting
Gone before the time I turn my head
I swear I hear her voice calling me",Sleepwalk [Stereo],1961
The Shadows,"To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.",That's My Desire [Mono Version],1961
The Shadows,"First you cuddle up beside me nice and near
Then you whisper all the things I long to hear
That's the first lessson in love
Mmmm...Give me your heart

Then you put your two sweet lips on mine like this
And you'll learn the magic of a tender kiss
That's the next lesson in love
Mmmm....lesson in love

It's so easy when you know how
O my darling let me show you now

Last you whisper I love you so sweetly
Then I'll know you've learned it all completely
That's the last lesson in love
Mmmm...baby love me true

The Shadows,"Bo Diddley had a farm
On that farm he had some women
Women here, women there
Women, women, women everywhere

But one little girl lived on a hill
She rustled and tussled like Buffalo Bill
One day she decided she'd go for a ride
With a pistol and a sword by her side

She rode right up to my front door
Knocked and knocked 'till her fist got sore
When she turned and walked away
All you could hear my baby say :

Hey! Bo Diddley
Hey! Bo Diddley
Hey! Bo Diddley

Saw my baby run across the field
Slippin' and sliddin' like an automobile
Hollered at my baby and told her to wait
Slipped off from me like a Cadillac-8

Hey! Bo Diddley

And so I face the final curtain

I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

If not himself, then he has naught

And its taken you so long

When you thought it had everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy

Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're crying you're crying now

Opens the door
He's got that look on his face
And he asks you were you've been
You tell him who you've seen 
And you talk about everything

He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down 
In some quiet little town 
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving

And pain is all around

That I still need your love after all I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Could'nt stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying ev'rything new

I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be,
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that every word is true

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
He saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost riders in ghost riders in the sky
Yi-pi-yi-ay, yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost riders in ghost riders in the sky

They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1980

Becomes part of the machine.

I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

He can beat the best.

And he just does the rest.

When I try to explain how I feel
And that I still need your love
After all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun

So I choose freedom
Running 'round, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
Well I never expected it too

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance

As for fortune and as for fame
Well I never invited them in
Though it seems to the world
They were all I desired

They were illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance

Everyday now seems endless... 
How slow the moments go but how fast they fly... 
The next time I see Mary-Anne...

All my sorrows soon will leave me... 
Then the sadder world will seem like new... 
The next time I see Mary-Anne...

Mary Anne, there are no words that I could say, 
No way to tell her what it means to me 
To see her face again.....

In the sunlight I'll kiss her, 
Married we will be - my baby and me

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
He saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

Ghost riders in ghost riders in the sky

Without despair we will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end 
And with the strength we have won't be erased 
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you 
Will echo in your mind 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again
I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
God surely answered my prayer
God surely answered by prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
God always will answer your prayers
Believe in one who will answer my prayer

The Shangri-Las,"The past, past, well now let me tell you about the past
The past is filled with silent joys and broken toys, 
laughing girls and teasing boys,
Was I ever in love? I called it love- I mean, it felt like love,
There were moments when, well, there were moments when

Present, Go out with you? Why not
Do I like to dance? Of Course,
Take a walk along the beach tonight? I'd love to,
But don't try to touch me, don't try to touch me
'cause that will never happen again,
Shall we dance

[Instrumental]

The future, tomorrow? well tomorrows a long way off
Maybe someday I'll have somebody's hand
Maybe somewhere someone will understand
You know I used to sing- a tisket a tasket a green and yellow basket
I'm all packed up and I'm on my way and I'm gonna fall in love,
But at the moment it doesn't look good
At the moment it will never happen again

I don't think it will ever happen again.","Past, Present & Future",2000

The early dawn, the shades of time 
Twilight crawling through my windowpane 

Am I awake or do I dream,
The strangest pictures I have seen 
Night is day and twilight's gone away

With your head held high and your scarlet lies 
You came down to me from the open skies 
It's either real or it's a dream 
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile 
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind 
Away from me.

Across the night I saw your face 
You disappeared without a trace 
You brought me here, but can you take me back

Inside the image of your light 
That now is day and once was night 
You lead me here and then you go away.

Away from me.

Il se pose un tas de questions
Après tout ce temps perdu est-ce qu'il sera quand même un bon daron?
Retrouver un job, quitte à même finir maçon
Mais son lourd casier faisait de lui un mauvais garçon
Déterminé à pas finir comme ça
Mais la vie refuse de lui laisser le choix
C'est comme si cet homme ne pouvait plus changer
Il est en stand by, c'est dur à supporter
Toujours pas de réponse depuis des mois
On lui répète toujours : ""On te rappellera""
Ce genre de réponse : la suite on la connais
Il repense au passé en se disant : ""J'ai merdé""

Seul inconvénient, dans le passé c'était une vraie pro'
Sa réputation a vite fait le tour du réseau
Apparemment pour elle c'était trop tard
Elle a changé mais personne ne le voit
Femme indépendante qui pourrait s'assumer
Fonder une famille, c'est tout ce qu'elle recherchait
Elle a tout essayé, elle ne comprend pas
Tous les hommes qui l'accostent : elle sait pourquoi
C'est pas demain la veille qu'elle va pouvoir se marier

Une heure et demi, il est pas dans son lit
Maman ne calcule plus l'enfant depuis que papa est parti
Un gros coup se prépare et ce soir tout le monde est de sortie
Direction la banque pour se partager tous les llions-mi
Malheureusement pour lui, les flics sont là !
Un indic parmi eux, les dénonça
Ca part en poursuite, plus personne n'est ami
Chacun pour sa peau, il avait plus de famille

Je suis comprimé, coquin, au contraire de ton concubin préféré
Je te trompe occasionnellement, nan pas du tout car
Jamais je sortirai du gouffre, mon âme me tourmente
Salement durant ma période de regrets
Pardonne moi, car sans toi je ne broie que du noir

La putain d'ta race, j'suis qu'un Homme, j'ai quand même le droit de me contredire
Y'a que les cons qui ne changent pas d'avis (han)
Ivre de l’oxygène que j'inspire, j'aspire à bâtir un empire
J'suis empris de sentiments hostiles et compliquant ma iv'
J'sais que je suis fêlé dans le fond, j'suis continuellement dans un bad trip
C'est ça l'pire, j'pense à mon avenir
Tu ne m'as point aidé, je t'invite donc à te faire farcir
Garci, Hennesy, non merci, j'suis fêlé fils
Le bénéfice m'atomise, j'agonise

Tant que le flouz est fait, laisse les faire
Peu importe, peu m'importe
Tu peux casser du sucre sur mon dos
Peu importe

Yeah
Toujours cette envie de grailler, sans y être invité
J'viens d'un bled qui dort peu, claque du bif en moins d'deux, tout en restant sur d'eux
L'avenir me laissera t-il briller ? Ou va-t'il m'enfermer ?
Faire du bif comme un d'ceux qui disent que l'argent ne te rendra pas plus heureux
J'ai plusieurs plans d'avances comme un schizophrène en danger
J'inhale aucune substance, mais j'ai rien à l'enjeu
Quand je prend mes distances, c'est que ma vie est en jeu
J'garde toujours la tête haute, le regard des autres m'importe peu
Laisse moi faire mes bails boy, épargne moi tes discours
Tes mots ne m'atteignent pas comme à l'oreille d'un sourd
Hassoul, la roue ne s'arrête jamais de ner-tour
Reste cool jusqu'à ce qu'elle arrive à ton tour

Tant que le flouz est fait, laisse les faire
Peu importe, peu m'importe
Tu peux casser du sucre sur mon dos

Tu peux prétendre être meilleur que moi
J'ai mes défauts, je ne te le cacherais pas
J'reconnais quand j'ai tort
Je m’apitoie sur mon sort
Peu m'importe

Je sais que parfois la vie nous joue des tours
On ne cessera jamais de parler dans mon dos
J'accepte, j'pardonne s'il le faut
Ces gens ne voleront pas plus haut

Et cherche le bonheur dans le cash et les femmes
Casse moi les pas, viens pas me ler-par, j'm'en beurre
Puisse le seigneur m'écarter des flammes
J'n'assumerais pas car je suis qu'un Karlouch en deuil
De son innocence, j'l'ai pas trop connue longtemps
Mais peu importe, j'pense pas être un grand fils de pute pour autant
Pour ma part, en France je suis perçu comme un orang-outan
Et j'avance vers la gloire et le bonheur tout en doutant

Fini les fins de mois à tout calculer
T'es passé d'homme banal à célébrité
Puis doucement, doucement
Tu t'écartes de celle qui t'aimais

Tu t'souviens de ce que t'étais ? Rappelle toi
T'as changé, à vrai dire, moi même j'm'en rappelle pas
Et puis j'ai pas la tête à te juger
Je suis loin d'être meilleur que toi
Je fais des erreurs, je n'suis qu'un Homme
Je fais pas toujours preuve de bonne foi

Pris un simple billet aller, manque de bif', j'avais la dalle
Persuadé de faire c'qu'il fallait pour le cocon familial
Mais j'avais tort, j'avais tort
Déterminé depuis la naissance, complexé qu'la vie soit mal
Vu qu'la hass était mon essence, ne t'étonne pas si je m'enflamme
J'pensais gagner plus de puissance en devenant sans état d'âme
Mais j'avais tort, j'avais tort
J'ai vu qu'les temps déficits rendaient les relations bien plus difficiles
Que, lorsque trouble est ton esprit, le soutien de ton entourage n'a aucun prix
J'ai fait le tour des continents sans m'sentir chez moi
Enivré par la richesse, j'en ai perdu ma foi

J'ai crié fort mon désespoir, je marche en marge de mon époque
Et, souvent, j'en ai fait des tonnes, j'ai simplement voulu qu'on m'pardonne
Malgré ça, mes torts me suivent encore et encore
À trop penser au moment présent, on en oublierait souvent que le temps passe
J'me sens épuisé, usé, désabusé d'être accusé comme si c'était normal
Et j'aimerais tant revenir au départ
Quand j'n'étais pas conscient de c'que j'n'avais pas

J'ai toujours voulu faire du bif, sortir du noir
Depuis l'époque du sac-à-dos
Focaliser sur l'avenir, la 'sique, pour moi
N'était autre qu'un sale cadeau
À défaut d'être concessionnaire, j'confectionnais les conso' des gens
Pendant ma sale période d'ado
J'avais beau écrire des CV, lettres, rien à faire
On m'répétait tous ces mots
Qui disaient, ""J'suis pas fan de lui, Seine-Saint-Denis
93, banlieusard, une source à problèmes
Y'a pas d'place ici, sauf taf de nuit
Vu ton niveau scolaire, t'en vaux la peine""
On m'a marché dessus, plus d'un homme m'a déçu
Combien de fois j'ai désiré que l'on m'enferme?
Interdire les blessures, la mater' m'a dit, ""Assure!""
Les plus gros rêves se forgent sur du long terme

Je voudrais le monde à mes pieds, car les gens ne font que m'épier
La réussite, ici bas, n'est qu'une question de mentalité
Désormais, je compte y arriver, j'ai délaissé ma vanité
J'attire l'œil et la convoitise, mais je fuis ces fatalités
Tensions lorsque les temps sont durs
Mon ami, tes mensonges, tu peux te les foutre dans ton cul
Me parle pas quand j'songe, cousin, je n'm'entends plus
Du mal à éclairer mes pensées qui semblent absurdes
Et je n'ai, je n'ai pas le temps, je n'ai pas le courage
D'affronter les conseils de tout mon entourage
J'ai beau tourner la page, jamais rien ne s'efface
Car je fuis le regard de l'homme qu'il y a dans la glace
J'ai rêvé d'espoir
Cousin, j'ai même rêvé d'être sage, gros, j'ai rêvé d'être moi
Mais pas si on me brûle de l'intérieur, je vois ma vie défiler
Impuissant devant ma destinée, j'ai juste envie de dire ""Stop""

Flossing down the block, holla at my boys up in the third
Got the latest word, swerve to the side of the curb
A fiend that wanted me to serve him, I said bitch can't tell I'm off?
But I still gave him five dollars to wipe my white walls
And then I burst up out the block, dropped the top cause it was hot
Hit the spot with the most hoes at the sideshow, abouts to plot
Spin donuts, you know I'm macking, a straight up nigga
Catch me spinnin', you can tell I was there cause I clocked smoke when I was finished
I seen five-O, and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin' he'd be nice and all cause I gotta 185 in the hood 
And you know they can't catch me
And if you see me chilling you can stop me
But I keep that glock, 40 up on the dashboard you never know who might not be

Playa, play on
I can't hate you homie
Playa, play on
I can't hate you homie

Burbans and Lacs, mansions and bitches, money and weed
A made life is all I dream, paper chasing for that green
I'm thugging on the scene, nigga
Whatcha don't believe, well check the credents, they'll tell ya
A niggas living presidential, I'm on the level that you bustas will never feel
My daughter thought I'd get caught up in the game and get killed
But reverse that shit and hit the studio and make a mill
For real, I'm slanging platinum shit until I'm old and ill
Lil' Gotti, I'm gonna make you feel what I say, I got time to parlay
Chill off in the bay, smoke some hay, I wouldn't have that shit no other way

Are you ready to boldly go

Are you ready? [Yes I Am!!!!] 

1st Verse: [Master P -- Fiend] 

Master P: 

Somebody musta' told these hoes I was a muthafuckin' rapper, 

but will they jus' tell them hoes that I was a muthafuckin' 

captain? 

All the bitches I done broke fo' they bank, 

I got so many cocktales I need a muthafuckin' fish tank. 

I got hoes like acorns fallin' outta trees, 

No Limit niggas don't say hoes, 

ain't no caps that be floatin' in the breeze... 

Fiend: 

Now, Now, Now P, all the time, I done put in work 

I ain't know, I was livin' next door to Captain Kirk. 

kepta smirk on his face, lookin' like drug swappin', 

come to find out, some bitch holdin' his money down hostage. 

Got keys to his cottage, done changed the law and the act, 

and all he get to do, is eat that funky hoe from the back. 

On top of that, 

the bitch fat!!! 

Makin' a career off this nigga, 

and all his homies gone, because they can't get it clear to this 

nigga, 

go figga, 

all she wanted was that man to change, 

but if it was me, I done been done slapped that bitch in the brains. 

Chorus: 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby. 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby. 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby. 

Captain Kirk, can you save me? 

Mr. Captain Kirk, I want to have yo baby. 

Verse Two: [Silkk The Shocker] 

See I met this bad ass trick, 

I mean this bad ass bitch. 

Tellin' her friends about month go by see I'ma be like buying her 

shit. 

I bought her lunch the first time, 

but see there trick that's nuthin' but game, 

I hit it one time and they be callin' back, 

talkin' bout' ""Silkk, why you do all that playin'?"". 

And she had the nerve to tell me, 

if I ain't a fuckin' trick I'm worthless, 

I told her Bitch if you ain't suckin' dick, 

then none of yo' clit defeats the purpose. 

Figured she had game, tryin' to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind, 

I figured lookin' at me she see nothin' but dollar signs. 

Simply, a bitch might give you some weed, 

a bitch might give you a buck, 

man, but since you my boy you 

better use a condom, before you try to fuck. 

Take the game from this show bug, 

'cause Silkk ain't no love. 

I give'em a little somethin', but at the end I 

take'em back and get the most love. 

And ain't no beam'em up Scotty, 

ain't no savin' hoes that ain't puttin' in no work. 

It all depends on TRU niggas like us, no Captain Kirk (Bitch freeze), 

all you ghetto hoes get yo' Lee Press-On Nails, fix yo' wig, 

bring yo' Bebe kids 'cause the Ghetto Enterprise is leavin' in 

approximately five minutes. 

Chorus 

Verse Three: [Mystikal] 

Aww HOLD UP!!!, WAIT A MINUTE!!!

What the fuck you mean, where I was?, who I was with?, 

and where the fuck I went? 

Bitch you be beside yoself, you probably WOULD,

The Shocker,"And the lady America was finally slaughtered 
And divided into 3 quarters 
Her children the cities fell
Battlin' golden' platinum 
Friends of terror and endless bloodshed 
Pity was not spared for no man  woman  child or rapper 
And believe 
For his rap was felt by everyone 
And this time when trust had no meaning 
Family and friends who survived destroyed one another
Decide to the world 
Love, peace, and brotherhood
Soldiers, high ashes to survival 
To open up a path to reality 
For some, judgement 

[Verse] 
The devil took the straps off my nigga legs 
The Virgin Mary came when my homie bleed 
Too many fuckin' thieves and enemies 
The vultures pecked the mouths for the green cheese 
I watched his soul leave his clothes left him cold 
On these streets, anything goes 
He was on the road 
It took 'em ten to do him in 
The killas fled, damn, but they'll be back again 
He was Polo'd down with the matchin' socks 
I mean stuffed like a turkey with a half a key of cooked rocks 
The reaper came and took him 
I saw the tears from my baby mama's eyes over look him 
As I walk through the shadows of death 
Where no rapper or no man can spare no breath 
The kingdom of freedom is all they said 
Why the shackle and chain? 
My homie's life slaid
From the cradle to the grave every soldier shall ride 
Bite the apple of eternity(uggggHH) 
Every mother will cry 

[Chorus x2] 
Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends 
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end 
 
[Verse]
Now who's to say if it's the beginning or ending 
Start to finish 
Losin' or winnin' 
I'm trapped in a whole world of sin 
Who's to say your life is worth more than mine 
Should I give my heart to the President so he can live and I can die? 
Now my whole life I was scared 
The only judge is god 
But why do I (we) live by these man made laws 
Ten commandments they say do not steal or kill 
But I lost too many niggas and some say they split my wig for meal 
Heaven, leadin' up to the steps 
Everything I do wrong in my days is leading to my death 
And even though I never see 
I believe there's a god 
But I hate when your best friend turn to your enemy 
When times is hard 

[Chorus x2] 

[Verse] 
As the sand slowly poured 
I see flashes of life 
Time started ticking it's the end of my life 
Blind fo' his eyes when he look at god 
Behold no man or your life destroyed 
He took many prophets and poured to the kingdom 
Big ones and small ones 
Good ones and mean ones 
As the angel came the ghetto from hell 
Some words of the piece cause they didn't know no better 
So they sold to the pitch-forks of the fire 
Do g's go to heaven or just young niggas retire 
Crosses burned cause they souls was scarred 
Hoping for a second chance but ain't none 
Cause it's your final call

I heard you make em worry, that this for the loot 
They intimidated by the rounds that the tank shoot 
Tank dawgs salute! 
Every robbery we score, cause they know 
Everything Fiend know, mean mo money mo 
Little Fiend still want the greens

We capitolize and monopolize on everything we see 
Keep pistols drawed and cocked 
We got the industry locked, we can't be stopped, too hot 
Check the spots that we got on billboards 
The tank can set up roadblocks, we fadin all you hoes 
Want some mo? 
Then let's go, stretch you out like elastic 
Zip that ass up in plastic, have ya folks pickin caskets 
We drastic, our tactics is homegrown in the ghetto 
So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas 
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mama Mia 
The unlady like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her 
Or see her, and get that ass embarrassed 
If you're a decision maker, guaranteed you'll get carried away 
So stay in yo place, when ya hear mamma speakin 
Cannons spray, clear the way, when ya see the tank creepin 
Chorus (2X) 
[Mystikal] 
Hi i'm that nigga that rappers look up to 
If they want to know how to do it 
It could be the little bitty skinny muthafucka 
With the braids in his hair 
Used to live on Tchopitoulus 
I done paid my dues, but still playin the blues 
Nigga play me like you was scared to lose 
I'm still a fool, you ain't heard the news 
I wasn't a No Limit nigga, but I made the move 
I won't stop now, bitch, I can't stop 
You can't stop me, so, bitch, don't try 
We TRU soldiers, and we don't die 
We keep rollin, n-n-nah-nah-nah 
All aboard, it's like a band inside 
The group going hallelujah 
Niggas goin to war, got to fightin and shootin inside rumors 
Little bitch sayin he there, we there, be where? 
see there, Silkk there, Fiend there, Mamma there, P there 
Ain't no salary cap, on top of my dollars

Just a young thug tryin' to make it
Visualize me in ghetto in these fools tryin' to break me
Kill me for my weed and my hindesee
Young villains when I'm gone won't remember me

Greeting women be my past time
Live the life of the hustler
Came up on ghetto rhyme

Look at all these haters surrounding me every day
hatin on a baller but they can't stop my pay
stop all the hatin I can't take it no more

Verse 1: Master P

Pop the lock on the benz with the keys 
To high to see his own enemies
his baby mama with him in a short skirt 
his last ride was in a car, i mean a black hearse
his friend took his life for the mighty dollar 
then ran through the alley must have been a coward
No more hit 'em up like in the old days
homies scrab with Mack 10s and AKs
that's why I roll by myself I mean I'm a loner
cause haters be all up on me
tryin to sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
and the same niggas want to blow on your weed
set you up for a caper 
don't want to see you make no money then take ya
gotta figure out how to get what you got 
cause haters be the same niggas on the spot

Chorus 

Verse 2: Master P 

How do hatin get started?
It started by the jealous people 
and they get mad over the things you have 
and the things they'll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really ain't hard to get 
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors 
I'm really not impressed
I tell you only one time 
with my scrilla fool don't mess

Verse 3: Fiend

I only get with a few cause these bitch made niggas is actors

non-packers
I'm strapped like P
or see
they ask for me 
capture me 
but I'm going out with a blast
I put that on some cash 
I'm standing last 
for some ass
y'all young crazed punks are trippin 
don't hate me nigga just go ahead and credit my ??
I'm admitting 
that I'm not only on the thwat
but I know i got stopped 
on tha ??
and its understood that I'm not 
one of the best niggas that ever lived
but I got some advice to give 
and that is

Chorus 

Verse 4: Silkk

I wonder why they hatin for?  Probably cause we got G's,
mad cause we makin moves, cause we got keys
But really I can't fade them
Cause truly you need haters up on you to know you'se a motherfuckin playa
I know y'all gonna kill me in a matter of lies 
I got friend that will turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me 
when I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes up on  my enemies  I gotta watch my friends
like when I'm sittin on top or ridin in a benz
Why don't y'all go out y'all's ass up and get something 
don't worry about how i got mines
always tryin to point a finger and say that's not mine.
and kill me 
it kills me 
its digusting cause I got a few G's
they try to rob me
but they know they won't touch me
smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
but I just can't call it or catch

Have mercy on P, just tryin' to have change
In my pockets I'm knockin', the feds can't stop me
Most hoes they jock me, I got knots in my pockets
Caviar and bitches, 6-4 and switches
Champagne and riches, but cooking keys in kitchens
Mansions with marble floors, knocking off chocolate hoes
Boots with ignition, Ferraris and drop rolls

Catch that rocket to the fuckin moon
That be yo final ship, bitch, cause yo ass is doomed
Ain't no comin back, livin in the dope game
Cause once you die, nigga you slangin rocks, then that's yo name
On the wall when they run up,
I got killas coming trough with bubble ups to pick up double ups
And put him in that muthafuckin long black hearse
I mean, once you gone nigga you layin in the dirt
Ain't no love in new orleans,
All the way to richmond, california
Niggaz livin for ghetto dreams
And the ghetto get so crazy
I seen a little bitty baby suckin on daisies
Caught two to the chest, one to the head
5 niggaz walked behind him dressed in red
With ski masks, but niggaz thought it was a clown show
Witches in the st. bernard projects, downed a hoe
And it's sad cause niggaz claimin 3rd ward
9th ward and niggaz claimin 10th ward
All my homies be dyin down south
Run around, talkin shit, killas with gold in they mouth
But I'm a soldier, a rolla, give me ten
I'd rather die than go to the fuckin pen
My partna bos looked to my eyes and said, ""nigga
Is it time for change, niggaz ain't livin in this dope game""
So we jumped into this rap game
And laid it down to all my killas
That tried to teach my nigga the game
Cause once you gone, ain't no comin back
Talked to randall and t-dove
They say, ""p, the streets ain't all that.""
I mean the calliope projects done change
Right from roges tablet you find the fuckin police man
And niggaz still servin bubble ups
Big mo in the projects rappin, and niggas=z tryin to come up
And with this new wave dope game,
I mean this rap game, niggaz tryin to get out to make some change
But down south my homies dyin, niggaz fryin
But stories we ain't buyin

Who (2pac gone, but what rapper) gon be next
To take that final ride (I hope it ain't me who)
Get cashed like a bad check (slammin cadillac doors)
Black hearses when they should be 6-0's

[silkk]
I often wonder wonder if there's a heaven or a hell
Rest in peace to my niggaz that died
Too bad when they died they couldn't come back and tell
If they really is another side, I seen his mother cry
I just wanna know where he went when my cousin died
That last step, then it's yo debt, yo last breath
Then it's the moment you fear
Just think, by the day over, one of us ain't gon be here
Used to ride with a bunch of niggaz, now he's ridin solo
He's dressed up in a suit, when he used to wear polos
I wonder if there's a heaven for a gangsta, a killa, and a shoota
I wish some nigga gunned john gotti had went in the chamber
Moms say my days are numbered cause I live wrong
Even scarface made a song, gangstas really don't live long
I'm tryin to live to a rock candy painted cadillac like outkast say
Ride on them thangs like mack 10, from back side to side like u.g.k.
Convertible lexus like eightball, mjg
500 like my brother master p, I'm a shock the world if I see 23
Maybe not today, but tomorrow off into the funeral parlor
Take pause to bury my boy, as we roll up to the grave yard

Who gon be next...to take that final ride?

Chorus

[c-murder]
I done seen mo crime than a crime lord
Sometimes I sit back and think I seen more death than god
Just last week a nigga got shot up and burned
But me I take heed to shit like that, and I learned
How can I not end up like that nigga?
What the fuck I got to do not to get banged up by that trigga?
Cause in the projects, ain't no love
Niggaz will split yo wig cause they gon on drugs (her-oin)
I hope you feel me, cause I feel the pain of others
I feel for every nigga that got to go on without they brother
But like the game, what goes around comes around
Next week that could be your muthafuckin hearse ridin through that town
That could be yo mama cryin in that steeple
Better yet, that could be you mornin the death of yo people
In the hood, I'm known for peelin caps, so I'm a cap peela
The police know me for sellin drugs, so I'm a drug deala
I reverse the game cause ain't no love for a black man
13 years old, my little cousin got juvenile life for takin a stand
It's a never endin game of death, do or die
So if you kill, be prepared for that final ride

Chorus (2x)

R.i.p. 2pac, nigga, eazy-e, segram, mr. see
And my little brother kevin
Miller, and all y'all tru niggaz and bitches
That done died out there on these streets
And took that final ride
Y'all niggaz ain't forgotten
Cause tru niggaz live forever
Tru niggaz like us
Ya heard me? it's real nigga
We gon see y'all fools in the crossroads
",Final Ride,1997
The Shocker,"Master p: tru niggaz stand...
Silkk (master p echoing): raise your right hand. repeat after me. I
Pledge
Allegiance, to the game of the united streets of a-fucking-merica. and
Not to be fucked with, for which it stands, one nation, under the
Dope game, with liberty and money for all. gangstas that is, gangstas

Chorus: gangstas make the world go round, gangstas make the world
Go round,

[silkk]
Hah! I live and die, so I'm a die by the 9
Fuck the dumb shit, I run this, a whole life of crime
Ain't never had shit, but always had my pistol, bitch
187, don't make me whistle, bitch
I never know, for sho, picture this
Never die, bitch, never die, say a damn thang
Canes in the chains, became the dope thang
Snortin some cane will make you do some strange thangs
I don't know why I idolize gangstas like tony montana,
Lucky luciano, probably cause they went out bangin
Gangstas like machine gun kelly
Rest in peace 2pac, aka makaveli
He run the chamber for danger, can't understand why these strangers
Wanna ride with us killas, but they can't fuck when we hang em
Gangstas like kadofy, john fuckin gotti
Ain't fuckin with these snitches cause they got em for his shotty
Gangstas

Chorus

[master p]
Uuuunnnngggghhhh! just a young nigga hangin with the thugs
From the ghetto so a nigga learned to slang drugs,
From ozs, to flip keys,
Eye blood red shot nigga smokin dank weed
And quick to slap a bitch in a minute
Fiends better have my money, I mean every penny
Youngsta, kickin with the hustlas
Fuck school, tryin to serve a clucka
And moms, wish she never had me
Cause I'm a nigga on the block slangin candy
Ready to die for this true shit
Takin penetentiary chances tryin to get rich
My role models frank nitti, scarface, and john gotti
Real gangstas, that's bout it, bout it

Chorus

[c-murder]
Throw your muthafuckin guns up (tru!)
Cause I represent gangsta day (uh-huh)
A g-a-n-g-s to the t-a
Ain't lookin for no shit but if shit comes (what's up, what's up)
Ready to turn your muthafuckin body numb
And fuck the pen, cause if I go to jail again
I pop a plea, and I'm free, in 5 to 10 (outee)
A nigga talk shit so I banged and I step
Another notch upon my rep (killa)
Like the last tape a nigga say fuck you hoes,
Now I'm turnin bustas, into john does
I'm the nigga with tru upon my back (c-murder)
A gangsta that's strapped so you can't jack
Ain't nuthin but killas on my team, (soldiers)
And I'm hangin with the shocker and the ice cream
Beware, my mental status is flawed, (crazy)
Start bangin and muthafuckas get lost,
You got drama with this muthafuckin tru click? (uh-oh, uh-oh)
Big worm, this nigga need his wig split
Take him to the river, cut his head off (cut it)
Target practice for my goddam sawed off
That's how we handle shit, in my town
Cause gangstas make the muthafuckin world go round

[mr. serv-on]
Round and round you go,
Now tell me who's the realest muthafucka that you know
Black lucianio, hangin niggaz out the window
Like a fat pig and ? ferejano?
Winnin gun battles like geronimo
Say hello to my new friend, mr. mac-10,
With the infrared grin, I can't pretend,
Who I be, the s-e-are-v aka billy badgate
Jack you for your safe, with guns in your daughters face
Catchin chase for my case for murder, you ain't never heard of a
Nigga, with nuts big like bison,
Unified, gangstafied champ like tyson, world introducin
Young billy blast em up, I gives a fuck, all about my double up
Catchin bubble up, now I'm here to let you know
Bitch you better give it up
Don't lay it down, I'll make your world go round

[master p]
Tru niggaz make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round (repeat 2x)

Chorus and fade
",Gangstas Make the World,1997
The Shocker,"Hit the block lexus truck slangin ice cream
A million records sold , that's why y'all know p
Came up on hard times tryin to make ends
2 stones to my niggaz that's dead and in the pen
The ghetto won't change , they label me the dope man
I slang raps but the feds think it's cocaine
Tap my phone , these hoes won't leave me alone
Nigga gon legit , so stay off the ding dong
Independent , that's why they hate me
A million man ghetto march for master p
So fuck rap pages ( don't know )
Y'all didn't want to see a nigga make it off the streets
That's why you'll never see p on mtv
Top 40 , but niggaz y'all know me
Number 1 in every mom and pop and billboard record store
So fuck y'all playa hatin hoes
Gimme a pen , a pad , and ill make a hit
Show every nigga in the ghetto how to get rich
Cause y'all don't know what go on behind closed doors
White folks pimp niggaz like hoes
But tru niggaz , say fuck that
You owe me money , it's time to meet the chrome gat
I got the drank , finna tomorrow I take a piss test
And I know my probs. want me to go back
An ex-con addicted to gangsta rhymes
Last year I caught a bullet but it wasn't mine
Time to go nigga on dead row , or should I say I'm stuck in the ghetto

Chorus:
(2x) just a ghetto thang , a ghetto thang , you would understand if you
Was
From the ghetto man
(1x)its a ghetto thang , a ghetto thang , these niggaz got me caught up in
This ghetto thang

Silk:

See I ain't got no money up in my pocket
How the fuck ima stop it
Ima get the glock and cock and plug you like a socket
See game get deeper but y'all don't feel me
Telling me to gets up out the game , get a job
I shouldn't rob a nigga , I might kill yah
See up on the block I rides deep on gold thangs
These niggaz be trippin up on my shit and they'll jack you like it ain't no
Thang
See I'm from the city where niggaz be salty and they stay faulty like wires
And I ain't seen a gangsta retire yet
On a bet , threw my cothes up on the floor and I sweat
Trust nobody cause these niggaz today will smoke you like a cigarette
Now bet , rest in peace to all homies that didn't make it
Took life for granted , an I panic while seeing niggaz with ski masks
We blast with ski masks and bust a cap into they weak ass
Everyday struggle and I stay hustlin like a pan handler
Fuck it if I took a chance to get dead like cancer
I betta not chance it
Slik , just another nigga tryin to make it up out the ghetto

(chorus)

Big ed:

Got a hold on me , jealous fools wanna roll on me
Will I die or will God just let me be
Fufill the prophecy reach my destiny avoid the burial plot
Unlive the ones that got popped
I got a son but she says that it isn't mine
I'm 24 and since birth I've served hard time
In this concrete jungle , a war zone , many of my peers die
Finally made it back home
Self preservation is a thing for me
Duckin and dodgin bullets stone faces on the ones who pulled it
I promise my mama I wouldn't die before she did
I got my life right got my wife and then my kids
But everywhere I look I see sadness
Imagine tryin to raise your babies in this worldwide madness

(chorus) 6x
",Ghetto Thang,1997
The Shocker,"See y'all niggas think I'm tripping cause I'm on that doja
See y'all true niggas
One reason I'm spiitin' this game to y'all niggas
Nigga cause 'I want y'all niggas to watch ya motherfuckin' self
Motherfuckin' f-e-d's be followin' niggas out in the projects
All in a niggas car, all on planes and boats
Just like deez niggas and deez hoes
Tired of motherfuckers followin' me man take another route
Nigga somebody else, keep ya eyes open fool

[Chorus: x2]
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
I'm paranoid I can't sleep I'm in this dope game
I think these hoes and these niggas out to get me man

I ain't never had nothing in my whole life
I'm from the ghetto grew up on eggs and rice
I'm paranoid, I can't sleep cause I done stole a key
Peep out the window unmarked car after me
My little homie down stairs hollerin' 5.0
But I ain't runnin' from no motherfuckin' white folks
I got the a-k spray hit the window (lay it down) duck
So nigga holler God damn, hit him in the trunk
The dogs chase me but a nigga ran through the back
That's when I seen dope and willy in the Cadillac
They said p where ya going man get in
Put the gat to his head said interstate 10
Play it off, play it off while I do a trick
Take me to the project to meet my bitch
100 g's, 2 keys, and a bullet-proof vest, like
Billy the kid I got some pussy and headed to the west

Chorus

I was pullin up out the driveway
Car been parked since Friday
I looked and look back it wasn't there
But I saw him followin on the highway
And I today know that I'm gonna blast
See I don't know who's in it cause the cars windows were tinted
And I be seeing shit that ain't it ain't there
But I be seein shit, I be in places without even bein seen there
But be seen in places without even bein there
And it seems like I'm in a different time zone
This dope game got my mind gone got my mind gone
Be having nightmares in the day, I be woke but I be sleep
I looked at shock the nigga but I turned around and it was me
It got me noid, it got me noid
It got me noid, but I ain't paranoid

[Chorus]

I beez more paranoid than a fugitive
Because I choose to live pro life
When it comes to mine my ruger 9's on cock
For all them haters with the scandolous plots
The red dot marks the spot for my nineteen shots
But I forgot the way they did ya boy
That's why I'm never on the streets without my plastic toy
They wanna trap me kidnap me duct tape my mouth
Torture me until I tell em about my man and point the dope house out
I used to be about the same drama game
That's why I'm two steps ahead of you gutter brains
You know the name mia x the biggest momma
Ghetto sara lee at the store
Betty crocker when I choppa fo' sho'
The evil eyes be watching cause niggaz be always
Tryin to get in the best players spot and knockin'
Motherfuckers head off and kris krossin
Throw in mo salt than martin
When it rains it pours, horns with the rough tones
They try to get me slung on my back
Got to watch the jealousy acts so black
My eyes be in the front and the back and the sides peepin'
For all them crooks that be out creepin'
I feel they watchin' me

They watchin' but true soldiers don't die they multiply
Keep an open eye for all them haters

[Chorus: x2]",I Always Feel Like...,1997
The Shocker,"This for all y'all niggaz dat tru to the g-zame.
From master p and the whole tru click. it's time to hook ya ice
Cream up and turn it into candy.
Mo b. dick: oh!

Chorus i: I got candy!
Mo b. dick: I can serve you on the block
Cocaine, cream, or rock, it takes over fiend
I got candy!
Mo b. dick: I wanna know
If you feel it, too, just like I do.

[silkk]
I hits the block non stop, rocks in my sock
Pause for a second when I see the cops
Rocks of candy, whatever you wanna call it
But when I get you hooked, it's like a muthafuckin alcoholic
I stay ? ? ? around like a poster, watch fiends follow like a toaster
Candy I have move em fast like ? ? ?
Knick knack paddy whack, give a fiend a fast sack
9 times outta 10, he'll tell his friends and they'll be right back
Whole bunch a niggaz, and just one fiend
They come to me for less cut, cause I boast bigger cream
And them fiends come back cause they understand me,
I open up shop, open up shop cause I got candy

Chorus ii: he's got candy! yo eyes roll in your head,
Mo b. dick: you toss and turn in yo bed
Cause I only sell the best to you,
Mo b. dick: indeed I do!
Simply put I'm the reason why
Silkk: why?
Everyday you get high,
Mo b. dick: real high!
And you know I got that crack for you
Mo b. dick: indeed I do!
Just for you

[silkk]
I'm sittin on the post, choppin game with this bitch,
I see ya later ho, I gots money to get
Cause as long as a fiend with dream, I got cream
Money moves everything around me, kn'what I mean?
Cause as a ? ? ? with a dolla, I'm sittin on a drop and parlour
On some gold thangs, watch all them hoes follow
My money makes stacks and real deals
I keep my cash, nigga taj, I can't chill, I gots to pay bills
And these niggaz can't stand me
Got this ho that said she wanna suck my dick for candy
Gotta watch out for these dope fiends cause they be runnin tricks,
$3 what they gon come with, $3 what they gon get
I hold the block like a 7-11(7-11), kick yo door in like taj (taj)
Cut the shit up like machetti, chop the shit up like grass
Cause I'm a stay hustlin till they fuckin can me bitch,
Because it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I got
Candy

Chorus I

[master p]
Uuuunnnngggghhhh! I smoke weed cause I'm a drug deala
I sell candy on the block fool, to make my fuckin scrilla
7 grams for $2.50,
Got niggaz in the hood on hold, tryin to get with me
I keep a stash for the drought,
But the shit I sling daily in plastic out my mouth
My homies use code names,
Like l.d., big champ, slim, t dove, and big mann
I take penetentiary chances to make a livin,
Every 1st of the month, is like thanksgiving
Fiends hug me like they miss me
Hoes see me rollin in my car, and wanna be with me
I get my candy from california by the keys
Ship it in boats and trains back to new orleans
And open up shop like mr. rogers,
But sell mo hits than the dodgers
And fiends holla ""ungh!"" cause it's all good
From the triple beam, straight to the neighborhood
And when you sellin candy trust nobody
Cause niggaz even snitched on john gotti
Niggaz stay tru to the g-zame,
Never front on muthafuckin candy in the dope game
And never go to the fedz on ya folks
Cause punks get fucked with the soap

Chorus iii:
Mo b. dick: I got that real good cocaine (cocaine) each and
Every day, all real tru soldiers, on these streets I gotta get my pay.
My game so tight, so good, so good, yeah!
Mo b. dick: cocaine, he-roin, that fire ass weed
Values and boulders, just tell me what you need baby. oh!
Cotton candy, candy!
