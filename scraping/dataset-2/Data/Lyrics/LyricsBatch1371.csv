Cadetes de Linares de Homero Guerrero Jr.,"Me dicen el asesino por hay 
Y dicen me anda buscando la ley 
Porque mate de manera ilegal 
La que burlo mi querer 

En un momento de celos mate 
Segado de sentimiento y dolor 
La que burlaba mi honra y mi ser 
Mi vida y mi corazon 

Ya esta en el cielo juzgada de dios 
Si alla de lo alto si a caso me ve 
Sabra la ingrata que tuve razon sabra cuanto la adore 

Veinte anos que de sentencia me den 
Con gusto voy mi delito a pagar 
Pero antes quiero vengarme tambien 
De el que me hizo criminal 
Va la justicia buscando a mi mas no me 
Entrego hasta ver a ocasion de ver a el otro que me hizo infeliz 
Y abrirle su corazon 

Veinte anos que de sentencia me den 
Con gusto voy mi delito a pagar 
Pero antes quiero vengarme 
Tambien del que me hizo criminal 
Va la justicia buscando a mi mas no me 
Entrego hasta ver a ocasion de ver al otro que me hizo infeliz 
Y abrirle su corazon",El Asesino,2006
Cadetes de Linares de Homero Guerrero Jr.,"Los 2 amigos 

Estos eran, dos amigos 
Que venian de Mapimi 
Que por no venirse de oquis 
Robaron Guanacevi 

Ellos traiban, dos caballos 
Un oscuro y un jovero 
En el oscuro cargan ropa 
Y en el jovero el dinero 

Tambien traiban, maquinaria 
Y muy buenas baterias 
Para desclavar los rieles 
Y hacer los cambios de via 

Martin le dice a Jose 
No te pongas amarillo 
Vamos a robar el tren 
Que viene de Vermejillo 

Amarillo no me pongo 
Amarillo es mi color 
He robado trenes grandes 
Y maquinas de vapor 

Valgame el santo ninito 
Ya agarraron a Jose 
En la esquina del mercado 
Lo ataron y se les fue 

Seria por sus oraciones 
Que su madre le rezaba 
Seria por su buena suerte 
Que a Jose no le tocaba",Los Dos Amigos,2006

Cadetes de Linares de Homero Guerrero Jr.,"Salieron de madrugada
Se oiha el canto de los
Gallos iban hacer 2 jornadas
Al lomo de sus caballos
La fiesta se celebraba en
El rancho del pitayo

Su padre les dio un consejo
Cuando apartir se aprestaban
Cuiden muy bien el peyejo
Por que la vida se acaba
En las palabras del viejo
Los 3 hermanos pensaban

Pedro le dice a Fabian dale
Un trago a Jose Luis que beba
De ese mezcal pa que se
Seinta feliz que ahorita nomas
Al yegar nos vamos a divertir

Cuando arribaron al baile a
Bailar se dirigieron la muerte
Andaba en el aire eyos no la
Presintieron como les dijo su
Padre cuando del rancho salieron 

Eran muchos los rivales viejos
Reencores surgieron rondando
Tras los jacales abrieron todos
El fuego asi matan los cobardes
Cuando los acosa el miedo

Un viejito solitario sin esperansa
Ninguna cuida el rancho y tres
Caballos como toda su fortuna
Va al panteon de ves en cuando
A visitar las 3 tumbas",Las Tres Tumbas,2006
Cadia,"You're movin' faster than an outbound train
Tryin' to find a way to outrun pain
And every time you start to come undone
You always start to run
My heart is breaking for you, I admit
It's hard to watch you fall apart like this
And I can't begin to know your sorrow
I have not walked far inside your shoes
And I wish you would let me
Love you through this

'Cause I'll stay with you (even in your darkest night)
Wait with you (for a little sign of light)
Cry with you (if the answers never come)
I'll be the one who
Hopes with you (there will be a better day)
So hold onto (every little piece of faith)
As long as it takes, I'll stay

And if He sees a sparrow fall or fly
Watches the lilies open to the sky
Then how much more does He love you and I
Sometimes it's hard to just believe it's true
But if you can't, I will stand believing for you

'Cause I'll stay with you (even in your darkest night)
Wait with you (for a little sign of light)
Cry with you (if the answers never come)
I'll be the one who
Hopes with you (there will be a better day)
So hold onto (every little piece of faith)
As long as it takes, I'll stay

Let me be still and quiet
Let me be Love's reminder
Let me be the one who's meant to
Be the arms that Jesus sent you

'Cause I'll stay with you (even in your darkest night)
Wait with you (for a little sign of light)
Cry with you (if the answers never come)
I'll be the one who
Hopes with you (there will be a better day)
So hold onto (every little piece of faith)
As long as it takes, I'll stay, I'll stay",I'll Stay,2008

Cadillac Sky,"Her daddy hated his tattoos
But she was in love with a baby due
In September, early September

So they called the kinfolk, set up the bar
Threw some chairs out in the yard
And got a preacher, a pentecostal preacher

And the man on the evening news
Promised sunny and 72 but

You can't trust the weatherman
Makes his livin' off a lucky chance
Whole crowd was soaken wet
Mud all over momma's dress

No sign of the sun
But a sure fire sign of things to come
One thing you can plan
Is you can't trust the weatherman

Six months after the knot got tied
There were diapers and a double wide
They couldn't pay for one day they had a brainstorm

She'd pull the gun he'd crack the safe
They pulled it off and they pulled away
They were laughin' 'til they saw lights flashin'

Forecast on the radio
Never even mentioned snow but

You can't trust the weatherman
Makes his livin' off a lucky chance
Cop car hit a patch of ice
Hit a rail flipped on its side

That couple got away
Cops only had one thing to blame
Shook off the snow, threw up their hands
Said, ""You can't trust the weatherman""

They hid their cash under the bed
Of that condo in Club Med
Where the chance of sunshine is
One hundred percent but

You can't trust the weatherman
Makes his livin' off a lucky chance
Hurricane came rippin' through
Tore that condo right in two

Stuff scattered everywhere
Stolen money flyin' through the air
And if you wonder how the story ends
They're back out in the sticks again
So remember when you're makin' plans
You can't trust the weatherman

You can't trust the weatherman
No, you can't, can't trust the weatherman
",Can't Trust the Weatherman,2007
Cadillac Sky,"As pure as a kiss from the lips of god
A red rose bloomin' out a canyon rock
Through a hole in the clouds she fell one day
And left her home on high so far away

From the day she came into this world
There were tears in the eyes of that baby girl
We tried everything to heal the hurt
But she never could find peace on earth

So goodbye, farewell homesick angel
May heaven shores be a sight for your sore eyes
Oh, I wish you well homesick angel
Yeah, I just wish we'd had more time

From a hillside grave a preacher writes
Who could blame that girl for rushing back?
Who amongst once had seen that place?
Would ever wanna step foot outside those gates

So goodbye, farewell homesick angel
May heaven shores be a sight for your sore eyes
Oh, I wish you well homesick angel
Yeah, I just wish we'd had more time

God is God and I'm just a man
So I guess I'll never understand
But the fire inside that lights my faith
Is a smile I see upon her face
When I hold her again that day

So goodbye, farewell homesick angel
May heaven shores be a sight for your sore eyes
Oh, I wish you well homesick angel
Yeah, I just wish we'd had more time
Yeah, I just wish we'd had more time

Cadillac Sky,"The willows are weepin'
The grass is bowed down
Coming down from the mountain
Drifts a high lonesome sound
Down in the valley sorrow runs deep
The river stands still as they lay him to sleep

And the twin fiddles play and the whippoorwill sings
All the angels in heaven whisper his name
As tears fall on the meadow like morning dew
The bluegrass has never been so blue

For that boy from Kentucky
The whole world will mourn
As that wayfaring stranger
Reaches that distant shore
All his disciples pay their respects
To the music he made and the legacy left

And the twin fiddles play and the whippoorwill sings
All the angels in heaven whisper his name
As tears fall on the meadow like morning dew
The bluegrass has never been so blue

Oh, there'll never be another to fill his shoes
The bluegrass has never been so blue
Oh, the bluegrass has never been so blue

Cadillac Sky,"Redbird outside my window
Sings a sad and lonesome song
But his words won't have wings
When I find the strength to move on

Everyday the cut feels deeper
But I know that I'll survive
'Cause my faith is far stronger
Than the pain of your goodbye

You can burn me down to ashes
Bury me beneath your clay
But I'll rise again like Lazarus
And live to love another day

Yeah, I should've known better
But I've learned my lesson well
Love's a long string of lies
Forever's some fool's fairy tale

You can burn me down to ashes
Bury me beneath your clay
But I'll rise again like Lazarus
And live to love another day

No love ain't seen the last of me
No love ain't seen the last of me
Let all of our forevers come crashing to the ground
This pain is not my prison

Heartache cannot hold me down
Someday I will wake up to a new sun shining bright
And you'll find me sweet salvation
In some distant angel's eyes

You can burn me down to ashes
Bury me beneath your clay
But I'll rise again like Lazarus
And live to love another day

Cady Groves,"It's not easy to be this complicated
'Cause I lose my way, change my mind, and I'm more recently jaded

'Cause I wanna be a pirate
Rhys one thing I've decided
It's the only thing that could ever intrigue me

There's no more tryin' to fight it
The pain I'll leave behind me
The sweet imperfections of a hot mess of a girl 

And I believe in miracles  
But there's no way that I'll ever fit in
To the modern way of livin', it's just not me
Work a, 9 to 5, live in complacency
And I gave it my all, I tried really I swear for a girl on her own
But after over analyzin' everything there is here it's time for my ship, and fresh air

[Chorus]

And if I know me like I think I know me
I'll try to bargain with myself
I'll tell myself it's really not that bad
And I'll try to stick it out
A little longer in society never killed no one

But I can tell you, it's a guarantee that I'll always run

Cady Groves,"You, You

Must have been a long walk,
How'd you make it across the other side of the tracks?
Then you ran into me,
And you made me believe in my own laugh.

And every time that we talk,
It's like we're taking a walk around our own little town.
But when we hang up the phone,
All I hear is alone, I hate, that sound.

I gotta put my heart to the test,
Gonna wrap it in a bulletproof vest,
Cause in time, you'll be runnin' to me,
Flowers in hand, but until then,
I won't forget you.

So when the stars come out at night,
And we're watching the same sky,
You can tell there's no surprise, 
I won't forget you.
It's like you fell from outer space,
And you can bet your pretty face,
You will never be replaced,
I won't forget you.

It's just a matter of time,
You know what's mine is yours,
I've put it all on the line.
And every day I say I love you more
than I did before and I don't think it's a lie.

This is our bedtime story
That we're gonna tell our kids,
And I'll watch you fall asleep, 
While holdin' all three, but until then,
I won't forget you.

Cady Huffman,"The urge to merge can rob us of our senses
The need to breed can make a man a drone
We must be on alert with our defenses
For every skirt will test testosterone

So, knowing this I severed all connection
With any creature sporting silk or lace
I was firmly headed in the right direction
When suddenly I stumbled on that face

That face, that face, that dangerous face
I mustn't be unwise
Those lips, that nose, those eyes
Could lead to my demise

That face, that face, that marvelous face
I never should begin
Those cheeks, that neck, that chin
Will surely do me in

I must be smart and hide my heart
If she's within a mile
If I don't duck, I'm out of luck
She'd kill me with her smile

That face, that face, that fabulous face
It's clear I must beware
I'm certain if I fall in love, I'm lost without a trace
But it's worth it for that face

That face, that face, that lovable face
It melts my Swedish heart
I'm certain if I fall in love, I'm lost without a trace
But it's worth it for that face

Caedmon's Call,"I am a bus driver and it's four in the morning
And I'm pressing out my clothes beside my bed
Fourteen years been on the job
And with many miles behind
Still I'm up at 3:30 to make sure I'm there on time
My car gets me along just fine
To and from the station
But my castle is this Houston metro bus
My first stop is Ashbury
And the sign's been gone for years
All the same the people wait
Cause they know that I'll be there

What would you say
If I told you that I won't be by today
Would you say that
I'm just a bus driver
And what do I know
Just a bus driver
And what do I know
Just a bus driver
And what do I know

I'm always there by 5:15
And lately I've been early
Cause Judith likes to be in early to the bank
And she gives me conversation
And a token good for riding
And she's happy all alone
And then there's Charles in retail sales
And I hope they pay him well
For the work that young man does
Cause I've never seen the inside of a custom refrigerator
But I know that he's the first and last one there

What would you say
If I told you that I won't be by today
Would you say that
I'm just a bus driver
And what do I know
Just a bus driver
And what do I know
Just a bus driver
And what do I know
And what do I know

And I wonder what they do all day
At their respective works
I suppose they give money and take money away
Still I'm just orbiting this town
With the post office my sun
And I'm circling again

And I wonder how this world would be
If I was never here
To drive this bus around from Ashbury to Main
I suppose this town would be the same
With one bus' less exhaust
But that bank and retail store
They just wouldn't be the same

But what can I see
From the limited confines of my bus driving seat
Only me

And I'm just a bus driver
And what do I know
I'm just a bus driver
And what do I know
Just a bus driver
And what do I know
Just a bus driver
And what do I know
I'm just a bus driver

Caedmon's Call,"
She seems a million miles away.
When she walks by you don't know what to say.
You're gonna make your move; you better make it now
And don't be afraid 'cause love will show you how.
 
You take that first step: ask her out and treat her like a lady.
Second step: tell her she's the one you're dreaming of.
Third step: take her in your arms and never let her go.
Don't you know step by step; step by step you'll win her love.
 
She looks too beautiful to touch,
But your heart keeps talking to you.
Now, don't give up.
You think you see something in her eyes,
But you will never know until you try.
But you've got to take that first step:
 
ask her out and treat her like a lady.
Second step: tell her she's the one you're dreaming of.
Third step: take her in your arms and never let her go.
Don't you know step by step; step by step you'll win her love.

In my mother's face 
With a touch of my father 
Just up around the eyes

More wrapped up in what binds our 
Ever distant lives.

Things I trust will be better off without me 
But I don't want to know

Keep me guessing

Of the people living there 
And I'm curious if they imagine me

Was torn for the twelve tribes

When did it get so hard to feel 
When did my heart get so afraid to love 
When did it get so hard 

And the easy-living Gnostic proud 
Use their knowledge 
Like a wreking ball to tear me down 
Flooding me with their fallacies 
I can't walk on this water

No, I'm not anyone

The i could be someone 

You're an army in a horse 
And you have taken me by force 
All the freedom in this world could not resist 
The sweet temptation of your sweet elusiveness 
So i say, come on

Caedmon's Call,"I was a pilgrim in early life
I traveled at night
Bound for Jordan just ten miles north
Of a civil war

Immersed in mercy and Holy flood
That mingled with blood
My sextant headed for homebound lands
Through twilight sands

But I grew weary and too far gone
To carry on
At first my home and my empire soon
Would there assume

I'm watching my kingdom tumbling down
You're flooding my refuge underground
My kingdom for angels, mighty surround
To take me away from here

A sea of sand came through fiery pass
A sea of glass
An ivory fortress and turret's steel
Would swift reveal

The gods of beast and of sun and sky
With banners high
Were worshipped in their six temples' fold
Of desert gold

I'm watching my kingdom tumbling down
You're flooding my refuge underground
My kingdom for angels, mighty surround
To take me away from here

In summer's sting as the sages say
The sand gave way
My empire capsized at vanity's cost
And all were lost

I'm watching my kingdom tumbling down
You're flooding my refuge underground
My kingdom for angels, mighty surround
To take me away from here

음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal
득과 실 벌써 decade
Still mic를 check 해
Like JK형 밝은 미래 in my arms
실낱 꿈 풍파와 입맞춤
가사를 쓸 때마다
혼자가 아니야 in my room
내게 숨 같던
친구들의 반이 하늘나라
내가 대신 꾸는 꿈 속에서
편히 잠을 자라
맺힌 내 땀을 봐라
I\'m a damn 괴물
Made an independent label
cause I won\'t ever settle
at your level

I\'m Not There\' in this 폐허

Till I see God up there
높이 솟아올라
세상은 유대자본이 지속한
몰락 속에 피로 차올라
But 징조가 좋다

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다
모든 걸 고통 없이
원한다면 해답은 없다
내가 해냈으면 너도
충분히 할 수 있으니 believe
내가 해냈으면 너도

얼굴 찌푸리면서

너넨 뒷북이나 쳐
마음이 뒤틀린
낙서 가득 기운이 앞서
누구나 깎아내는
조각가들 신물이 났어
차라리 신문이나 펴
요즘의 경제면처럼 마땅한
대안 없는 음악 믿음이 안 서
착실한 기반 닦은 확실한 상품
어설픈 화가들의 막 칠한 작품
둘 중 하나를 분명히 해

I sit and wonder if you think of me as I think of you
I'm lost without you, I don't know what I'm gonna do

When I had you around I never realized
I know I blew it and I'll never get another chance
Now the summer's here and you're with somebody else

And now that you're gone, I don't know if I can carry on
So sorry 'bout the things that I've done
I know that it was over 'fore it started

I've got your number but I haven't got the guts to call
I know it's up to me but I just stare at the wall
I know it's useless and I should just forget it all

When I was with you I never took it seriously
When you told me you'd had it and that you would leave
I said well baby just go, I'm better off alone

When I was with you I never took it seriously
When you told me you'd had it and that you would leave
I said well baby just go, I'm better off alone

But now that you're gone, I don't know if I can carry on
So sorry 'bout the things that I've done
I know that it was over 'fore it started

The summer's here but I'm just sitting in my room
I sit and wonder if you think of me as I think of you
I'm lost without you, I don't know what I'm gonna do

Now that you're gone, I don't know if I can carry on
So sorry 'bout the things that I've done
I know that it was over 'fore it started

Now that you're gone, I don't know if I can carry on
So sorry 'bout the things that I've done
I know that it was over 'fore it started

Over 'fore it started
Over 'fore it started

O meu amor tem um jeito manso que é só seu
Que me deixa maluca, quando me roça a nuca
E quase me machuca com a barba mal feita
E de pousar as coxas entre as minhas coxas
Quando ele se deita

O meu amor tem um jeito manso que é só seu
De me fazer rodeios, de me beijar os seios
Me beijar o ventre e me deixar em brasa
Desfruta do meu corpo como se o meu corpo
Fosse a sua casa

Caetano Veloso,"Uma tigresa de unhas negras e íris cor de mel
Uma mulher, uma beleza que me aconteceu
Esfregando a pele de ouro marrom do seu corpo contra o meu
Me falou que o mal é bom e o bem cruel

Enquanto os pelos dessa deusa tremem ao vento ateu
Ela me conta com certeza tudo o que viveu
Que gostava de política em mil novecentos e sessenta e seis
E hoje dança no frenetic Dancin' Days
Ela me conta que era atriz e trabalhou no Hair
Com alguns homens foi feliz, com outros foi mulher
Que tem muito ódio no coração, que tem dado muito amor
E espalhado muito prazer e muita dor

Mas ela ao mesmo tempo diz que tudo vai mudar
Porque ela vai ser o que quis inventando um lugar
Onde a gente e a natureza feliz
Vivam sempre em comunhão
E a tigresa possa mais do que o leão

As garras da felina me marcaram o coração
Mas as besteiras de menina que ela disse, não
E eu corri pro violão, num lamento, e a manhã nasceu azul
Como é bom poder tocar um instrumento",Tigresa,1977
Caetano Veloso,"Hoje eu ouço as canções que você fez pra mim
Não sei por que razão tudo mudou assim
Ficaram as canções e você não ficou
Esqueceu de tanta coisa que um dia me falou
Tanta coisa que somente entre nós dois ficou
Eu acho que você já nem se lembra mais

É tão difícil olhar o mundo e ver
O que ainda existe
Pois sem você meu mundo é diferente
Minha alegria é triste
Quantas vezes você disse que me amava tanto
Quantas vezes eu enxuguei o seu pranto
E agora eu choro só sem ter você aqui

Esqueceu de tanta coisa que um dia me falou
Tanta coisa que somente entre nós dois ficou
Eu acho que você já nem se lembra mais
É tão difícil olhar o mundo e ver

Caetano Veloso,"Não adianta nem tentar me esquecer
Durante muito tempo em sua vida
Eu vou viver

Detalhes tão pequenos de nós dois
São coisas muito grandes pra esquecer
E a toda hora vão estar presentes
Você vai ver

Se um outro cabeludo aparecer na sua rua
E isto lhe trouxer saudades minhas
A culpa é sua

O ronco barulhento do seu carro
A velha calça desbotada ou coisa assim
Imediatamente você vai lembrar de mim

Eu sei que um outro deve estar falando ao seu ouvido
Palavras de amor como eu falei, mas eu duvido!
Duvido que ele tenha tanto amor
E até os erros do meu português ruim
E nessa hora você vai lembrar de mim

A noite envolvida no silêncio
Do seu quarto
Antes de dormir você procura
O meu retrato
Mas da moldura não sou eu quem lhe sorri
Mas você vê o meu sorriso mesmo assim
E tudo isso vai fazer você lembrar de mim

Se alguém tocar seu corpo como eu
Não diga nada
Não vá dizer meu nome sem querer
À pessoa errada

Pensando ter amor nesse momento
Desesperada você tenta até o fim
E até nesse momento você vai
Lembrar de mim

Eu sei que esses detalhes vão sumir
Na longa estrada
Do tempo que transforma todo amor
Em quase nada

Mas ""quase"" também é mais um detalhe
Um grande amor não vai morrer assim
Por isso, de vez em quando você vai
Vai lembrar de mim

Não adianta nem tentar me esquecer
Durante muito tempo em sua vida
Eu vou viver
Não, não adianta nem tentar
Me esquecer

No ganas al intentar el olvidarme 
Durante mucho tiempo en tu vida yo voy a vivir 
Detalles tan pequeños de los dos 
Son cosas muy grandes para olvidar 
Y a toda hora van a estar presentes, ya lo verás 

Si otro hombre apareciera por tu ruta 
Y esto te trajese recuerdos míos, la culpa es tuya 
El ruido enloquecedor de su auto 
Sera la causa obligada o algo así 
Inmediatamente tu vas a acordarte de mi 

Yo se que otro debe estar hablando a tu oído 
Palabras de amor como yo te hable, mas yo dudo 
Yo dudo que el tenga tanto amor 
Y hasta la forma de mi decir 
Y en esa hora tu vas a acordarte de mi 

En la noche envuelta en el silencio de tu cuarto 
Antes de dormir tu buscas mi retrato 
Pero aun cuando no quisieras verme sonreír 
Tu ves mi sonrisa lo mismo así 
Y todo eso va a hacer que tu te acuerdes de mi 

Si alguien tocase tu cuerpo como yo no digas nada 
No vayas a decir mi nombre sin querer 
A la persona errada 
Pensando en el amor de ese momento 
Desesperada intentar llegar al fin 

Y hasta en ese momento tu iras a acordarte de mi 
Yo se que mientras existamos recordaremos 
Y que el tiempo transforma todo amor en casi nada 
Mas casi yo me olvido de un gran detalle 
Un gran amor no va a morir así 
Por eso de vez en cuando tu vas a acordarte de mi",Detalhes,1978
Caetano Veloso,"Chega de tentar, dissimular e disfarçar e esconder
O que não dá mais pra ocultar
E eu não posso mais calar
Já que o brilho desse olhar foi traidor
E entregou o que você tentou conter
O que você não quis desabafar
E me cortou

Chega de temer, chorar, sofrer, sorrir, se dar
E se perder
E se achar
E tudo aquilo que é viver
Eu quero mais é me abrir
E que essa vida entre assim
Como se fosse o sol
Desvirginando a madrugada
Quero sentir a dor dessa manhã

Nascendo, rompendo, rasgando, tomando meu corpo e então
Eu chorando, sofrendo, gostando, adorando, gritando
Feito louca, alucinada e criança
Sentindo o meu amor se derramando
Não dá mais pra segurar

Você nem chega a me ver
Meu som te cega, careta, quem é você?
Que não sentiu o suingue de Henri Salvador
Que não seguiu o Olodum balançando o Pelô
E que não riu com a risada de Andy Warhol
Que não, que não e nem disse que não

Eu sou um preto norte-americano forte
Com um brinco de ouro na orelha
Eu sou a flor da primeira música
A mais velha
A mais nova espada e seu corte
Sou o cheiro dos livros desesperados
Sou Gitá Gogóia
Seu olho me olha mas não me pode alcançar
Não tenho escolha, careta, vou descartar

Dizendo que tudo passou

Você que eu não encontro mais

E quero que você venha comigo
Eu me sento, eu fumo, eu como, eu não aguento
Você está tão curtida
Eu quero tocar fogo neste apartamento
Você não acredita

Bota a sobremesa eu como, eu como

Correr perigo

Caetano Veloso,"Menina do anel de lua e estrela
Raios de sol no céu da cidade

Brilho da lua, oh, oh, oh, noite é bem tarde
Penso em você, fico com saudade

Manhã chegando
Luzes morrendo, nesse espelho

Que é nossa cidade
Quem é você, oh, oh, oh, qual o seu nome

Conta pra mim, diz como eu te encontro
Mas deixa o destino, deixe ao acaso

Quem sabe eu te encontro
De noite no Baixo

Brilho da lua, oh, oh, oh, noite é bem tarde
Penso em você, fico com saudad

Caetano Veloso,"O pintor Paul Gauguin amou a luz da Baía de Guanabara
O compositor Cole Porter adorou as luzes na noite dela
A Baía de Guanabara
O antropólogo Claude Lévi-Strauss detestou a Baía de Guanabara
Pareceu-lhe uma boca banguela
E eu, menos a conhecera, mais a amara?
Sou cego de tanto vê-la, de tanto tê-la estrela
O que é uma coisa bela?
O amor é cego
Ray Charles é cego
Stevie Wonder é cego
E o albino Hermeto não enxerga mesmo muito bem
Uma baleia, uma telenovela, um alaúde, um trem?
Uma arara?
Mas era ao mesmo tempo bela e banguela a Guanabara
Em que se passara passa passará um raro pesadelo
Que aqui começo a contruir sempre buscando o belo e o Amaro
Eu não sonhei:
A praia de Botafogo era uma esteira rolante de areia branca e óleo diesel
Sob meus tênis
E o Pão de Açúcar menos óbvio possível
À minha frente
Um Pão de Açúcar com umas arestas insuspeitadas
À áspera luz laranja contra a quase não luz, quase não púrpura
Do branco das areias e das espumas
Que era tudo quanto havia então de aurora
Estão às minhas costas um velho com cabelos nas narinas
E uma menina ainda adolescente e muito linda
Não olho pra trás mas sei de tudo
Cego às avessas, como nos sonhos, vejo o que desejo
Mas eu não desejo ver o terno negro do velho
Nem os dentes quase-não-púrpura da menina
(Pense Seurat e pense impressionista
Essa coisa da luz nos brancos dente e onda
Mas não pense surrealista que é outra onda)
E ouço as vozes
Os dois me dizem
Num duplo som
Como que sampleados num Sinclavier:
""É chegada a hora da reeducação de alguém
Do Pai, do Filho, do Espírito Santo, amém
O certo é louco tomar eletrochoque
O certo é saber que o certo é certo
O macho adulto branco sempre no commando
E o resto ao resto, o sexo é o corte, o sexo
Reconhecer o valor necessário do ato hipócrita
Riscar os índios, nada esperar dos pretos""
E eu, menos estrangeiro no lugar que no momento
Sigo mais sozinho caminhando contar o vento
E entendo o centro do que estão dizendo
Aquele cara e aquela:
É um desmascaro
Singelo grito:
""O rei está nu""
Mas eu desperto porque tudo cala frente ao fato de que o rei é mais bonito nu
E eu vou e amo o azul, o púrpura e o amarelo
E entre o meu ir e o do sol, um aro, um elo
(""Some may like a soft brazilian singer
But I've given up all attempts at perfection"")",O Estrangeiro,1989

Caminhando sob o sol
Gosto muito de você, leãozinho

Basta eu encontrar você no caminho

Um filhote de leão, raio da manhã
Arrastando o meu olhar como um ímã
O meu coração é o sol pai de toda a cor
Quando ele lhe doura a pele ao léu

Gosto de te ver ao sol, leãozinho
De te ver entrar no mar
Tua pele, tua luz, tua juba

Gosto de ficar ao sol, leãozinho
De molhar minha juba
De estar perto de você e entrar numa

Que sempre precisará de ridículos tiranos?

Será, será que será que será que será
Será que essa minha estúpida retórica
Terá que soar, terá que se ouvir
Por mais zil anos?

Enquanto os homens exercem seus podres poderes
Índios e padres e bichas, negros e mulheres
E adolescentes fazem o carnaval

Queria querer cantar afinado com Ellis
Silenciar em respeito ao seu transe, num êxtase
Ser indecente
Mas tudo é muito mau

Ou então cada paisano e cada capataz
Com sua burrice fará jorrar sangue demais
Nos pantanais, nas cidades, caatingas
E nos Gerais?

Será que apenas os hermetismos pascoais
Os tons, os mil tons, seus sons e seus dons geniais
Nos salvam, nos salvarão dessas trevas
E nada mais?

Enquanto os homens exercem seus podres poderes
Morrer e matar de fome, de raiva e de sede
São tantas vezes gestos naturais

Da deselegância discreta de tuas meninas
Ainda não havia para mim Rita Lee
A tua mais completa tradução
Alguma coisa acontece no meu coração
Que só quando cruza a Ipiranga e avenida São João

Quando eu te encarei frente a frente e não vi o meu rosto
Chamei de mau gosto o que vi, de mau gosto, mau gosto
É que Narciso acha feio o que não é espelho
E à mente apavora o que ainda não é mesmo velho
Nada do que não era antes quando não somos mutantes
E foste um difícil começo
Afasto o que não conheço
E quem vem de outro sonho feliz de cidade
Aprende depressa a chamar-te de realidade
Porque és o avesso do avesso do avesso do avesso

Do povo oprimido nas filas, nas vilas, favelas
Da força da grana que ergue e destrói coisas belas
Da feia fumaça que sobe, apagando as estrelas
Eu vejo surgir teus poetas de campos, espaços
Tuas oficinas de florestas, teus deuses da chuva
Pan-Américas de Áfricas utópicas, túmulo do samba
Mas possível novo quilombo de Zumbi

Acuérdate que en la playa
Con tus manitas
Las estrellitas las enjuagabas

Tu cuerpo del mar juguete
Nave al garete
Venían las olas lo columpiaban

Mientras yo te miraba
Lo digo con sentimiento
Mi pensamiento me traicionaba

Te dije muchas palabras
De esas bonitas
Con que se arrullan los corazones

Pidiendo que me quisieras
Que convirtieras en realidades mis ilusiones
La luna que nos miraba ya hacia ratito

Se hizo un poquito desentendida
Why cuando la vi escondida
Me arrodille pa´ besarte
Why así entregarte toda mi vida

Amores habrás tenido
Muchos amores
María bonita, María del alma
Pero ninguno tan bueno Ni tan honrado

Como el que hiciste que en mi brotara
Lo traigo lleno de flores
Como una ofrenda
Para dejarlo bajo tus plantas

Why júrame que no mientes
Porque te sientes idolatrada

Que ves fantasmas en la noche de trasluz
Why oyes el canto perfumado del azul

Mira el paisaje del amor
Que és la razón para soñar why amar

Yo, que ya he luchado contra toda la maldad
Tengo las manos tan desechas de apretar
Que ni te puedo sujetar

De la neblina del ayer
Cuándo me llegues a olvidar

Que no podemos recordar

A camisinha não deu

Tô na Timbalada
Tô pra badalar
Tá lambendo água
Pra chupar cajá

Sorrir pra ela
É levar pra praia
No meio do samba
Empinar arraia
Azul verde e branca
Sei que ela tem
100 camisinhas
Prá me dar bem

Eu vou, eu vou
Eu vou na gandaia buscar
Eu vou, eu vou

Fui namorar

Transe com quem você quiser
Contanto que seja com quem também
Queira transar com você
Mas use camisinha
Respeite o amor
Respeite o sexo
Proteja sua vida
Salve muitas vidas
Use camisinha.

Use a camisinha

No es otra cosa más que su alma
Que todavía espera 
A que regrese la desdichada

I am lonely in London without fear
I'm wandering round and round here nowhere to go

While my eyes
Go looking for flying saucers in the sky

Oh Sunday, Monday, Autumm pass by me
And people hurry on so peacefully
A group approaches a policeman
He seems so pleased to pleace them
It's good at least to live and I agree
He seems so pleased at least
And it's so good to live in peace and
Sunday, Monday, years and I agree

Go looking for flying saucers in the sky

Choose no way

Crianças cor de romã entram no vagão
O oliva da nuvem chumbo ficando pra trás da manhã
E a seda azul do papel que envolve a maçã

As casas tão verde e rosa que vão passando ao nos ver passar
Os dois lados da janela
E aquela num tom de azul quase inexistente, azul que não há
Azul que é pura memória de algum lugar

Da fundação Casa de Jorge Amado
Pra ver do alto a fila de soldados quase todos pretos
Dando porrada na nuca de malandros pretos
De ladrões mulatos e outros quase brancos
Tratados como pretos
Só pra mostrar aos outro quase pretos
(e são quase todos pretos)
E aos quase brancos, pobres como pretos
Como é que pretos, pobres e mulatos
E quase brancos, quase pretos, de tão pobres, são tratados

E não importa se olhos do mundo inteiro
Possam estar por um momento voltados para o largo
Onde os escravos eram castigados
E hoje um batuque 
Com a pureza de meninos uniformizados de escola secundária
Em dia de parada
E a grandeza épica de um povo em formação
Nos atrai, nos deslumbra e estimula

Nem a lente do Fantástico, nem o disco de Paul Simon

Diante de qualquer, mas qualquer mesmo, qualquer qualquer

Que pareça fácil e rápido
E vá representar uma ameaça de democratização do ensino
De primeiro grau
Se esse mesmo deputado defender a adoção de pena capital
E o venerável cardeal disser que vê tanto espírito no feto
E nenhum no marginal
E se, ao furar o sinal, o velho sinal vermelho habitual
Notar um homen mijando na esquina da rua
Sobre um saco brilhante de lixo do Leblon
E quando ouvir o silêncio sorridente de São Paulo
Diante da chacina

111 presos indefesos, mas presos são quase todos ou
Quase pretos
Ou quase brancos, quase pretos de tão pobres
E pobres são como podres e todos sabem como se tratam os pretos

E quando for trepar sem camisinha
E apresentar sua participação inteligente no bloqueio a Cuba

Não vamos fuçar nossos defeitos
Cravar sobre o peito as unhas do rancor
Lutemos mas só pelo direito

And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica, I made a stop

Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Down at the market, you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
Akee rice, salt fish are nice
And the rum is fine any time of year

But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around

And the dancing girls swaying to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico

Will make the shellfish grin, fin to fin

Caetano Veloso,"Não quero sugar todo seu leite
Nem quero você enfeite do meu ser
Apenas te peço que respeite
O meu louco querer
Não importa com quem você se deite
Que você se deleite seja com quem for
Apenas te peço que aceite
O meu estranho amor

Ah! Mainha deixa o ciúme chegar
Deixa o ciúme passar e sigamos juntos
Ah! Neguinha deixa eu gostar de você
Pra lá do meu coração não me diga
Nunca não

Teu corpo combina com meu jeito
Nós dois fomos feitos muito pra nós dois
Não valem dramáticos efeitos
Mas o que está depois

Não vamos fuçar nossos defeitos
Cravar sobre o peito as unhas do rancor
Lutemos mas só pelo direito
Ao nosso estranho amor

Ah! Mainha, deixa o ciúme chegar
Deixa o ciúme passar e sigamos juntos

Caetano Veloso,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye",Carioca (The Carioca),2004
Caetano Veloso,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Caetano Veloso,"É o pau, é a pedra, é o fim do caminho

É peroba no campo, é o nó da madeira
Caingá candeia, é o matita-pereira

Passarinho na mão, pedra de a tiradeira

É uma ave no céu, é uma ave no chão
É um regato, é uma fonte, é um pedaço de pão
É o fundo do poço, é o fim do caminho
No rosto um desgosto, é um pouco sozinho

É um estepe, é um prego, é uma conta, é um conto
É um pingo pingando, é uma conta, é um ponto
É um peixe, é um gesto, é uma prata brilhando
É a luz da manha, é o tijolo chegando
É a lenha, é o dia, é o fim da picada
É a garrafa de cana, o estilhaço na estrada
É o projeto da casa, é o corpo na cama
É o carro enguiçado, é a lama, é a lama

É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um resto de mato na luz da manhã
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração

É uma cobra, é um pau, é João, é José
É um espinho na mão, é um corte no pé
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração
É pau, é pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um belo horizonte, é uma febre terça
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração",Águas de Março,2004

Eu fico imaginando nós dois 
Eu fico ali sonhando acordado 
Juntando o antes, o agora e o depois 
Por que você me deixa tão solto? 
Porque você não cola em mim? 
Tô me sentindo muito sozinho!

É que um carinho às vezes cai bem 
Eu tenho os meus segredos e planos secretos 
só abro pra você, mais ninguém 
Por que você me esquece e some? 
E se eu me interessar por alguém? 
E se ela, de repente, me ganha?

Caetano Veloso,"Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons,
Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some grave sites, out by the highway,
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance,
I'm getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto,
I've lived all over this town

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey,
I ain't got time for that now

Transmit the message, to the receiver,
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas,
You don't even know my real name
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading,
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime,
I might not ever get home

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no Mudd Club, or C. B. G. B.,
I ain't got time for that now
Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?
Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter,
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no
Headphones, ain't got no records to play

Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send a postcard,
I can't write nothing at all
This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
I'd like to kiss you, I'd love you hold you
I ain't got no time for that now

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock,
We blended with the crowd
We got computer, we're tapping phone lines,
I know that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives,
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle, so many times now,
I don't know what I look like!
You make me shiver, I feel so tender,
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving,
You ought to get some sleep
Get you instructions, follow directions,
Then you should change your address
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day,
Whatever you think is best
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks? 
They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace,
The burning keeps me alive

Cafe De Paris,"They're out of sorts in Sunderland
And terribly cross in Kent,
They're dull in Hull
And the Isle of Mull
Is seething with discontent,
They're nervous in Northumberland
And Devon is down the drain,
They're filled with wrath
On the firth of Forth
And sullen on Salisbury Plain,
In Dublin they're depressed, lads,
Maybe because they're Celts
For Drake is going West, lads,
And so is everyone else.
Hurray, hurray, hurray!
Misery's here to stay.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
There are dark clouds hurtling through the sky
And it's no good whining
About a silver lining
For we know from experience that they won't roll by,
With a scowl and a frown
We'll keep our peckers down
And prepare for depression and doom and dread,
We're going to unpack our troubles from our old kit bag
And wait until we drop down dead.
 
From Portland Bill to Scarborough
They're querulous and subdued
And Shropshire lads
Have behaved like cads
From Berwick-on-Tweed to Bude,
They're mad at Market Harborough
And livid at Leigh-on-Sea,
In Tunbridge Wells
You can hear the yells
Of woe-begone bourgeoisie.

Whoever our vote elects,
We know we're up the spout, lads.
And that's what England expects.
Hurray, hurray, hurray!
Trouble is on the way.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
The horizon's gloomy as can be,
There are black birds over
The grayish cliffs of Dover
And the rats are preparing to leave the BBC
We're an unhappy breed
And very bored indeed
When reminded of something that Nelson said.
While the press and the politicians nag nag nag
We'll wait until we drop down dead.
  
From Colwyn Bay to Kettering
They're sobbing themselves to sleep,
The shrieks and wails
In the Yorkshire dales
Have even depressed the sheep.
In rather vulgar lettering
A very disgruntled group
Have posted bills
On the Cotswold Hills
To prove that we're in the soup.
While begging Kipling's pardon
There's one thing we know for sure
If England is a garden
We ought to have more manure.
Hurray, hurray, hurray!
Suffering and dismay.

There are bad times just around the corner
And the outlook's absolutely vile,
There are Home Fires smoking
From Windermere to Woking
And we're not going to tighten our belts and smile, smile, smile,
At the sound of a shot
We'd just as soon as not
Take a hot water bottle and go to bed,
We're going to un-tense our muscles till they sag sag sag
And wait until we drop down dead.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
We can all look forward to despair,
It's as clear as crystal
From Bridlington to Bristol
That we can't save democracy and we don't much care
If the Reds and the Pinks
Believe that England stinks
And that world revolution is bound to spread,
We'd better all learn the lyrics of the old 'Red Flag'
And wait until we drop down dead.

Land of Hope and Glory,
Wait until we drop down dead.

In Bucharest

They're frightened to cross the street,
They're sullen in Siberia
And timid in Turkestan,

In the Isle of Wight
And jittery in Japan,

When we're asked to remember what Lincoln said,
We're going to un-tense our muscles till they sag sag sag

They're morbid in Mongolia
And querulous in Quebec,
There's not a man
In Baluchistan
Who isn't a nervous wreck,
In Maine the melancholia
Is deeper than tongue can tell,
In Monaco
All the croupiers know
They haven't a hope in Hell.
In far away Australia
Each wallaby's well aware
The world's a total failure
Without any time to spare.
Hurray,  hurray,  hurray!
Suffering and dismay.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,

You can take this from us
That when they Atom-bomb us
We are not going to tighten our belts and smile smile smile,
We are in such a mess
It couldn't matter less
If a world revolution is just ahead,
We'd better all learn the lyrics of the old 'Red Flag'

Hablar de amor sin que se rían de ti
Sé que en el rincón de una pared
Hay más de un lugar para pensar

Sé que en la pared de algún lugar
Alguien dibujó su nombre por amor
Yo no sé quién fue, cualquiera pudo ser

Nadie, nadie, nadie debe esconder
El nombre que dejó escrito en la pared
Nunca, nunca, nunca niegues que una vez
Pintaste en un papel su cara sin saber

Que ella dibujaba grandes corazones
En una pared, en algún rincón
Que ella no pensaba más que en ser amada
Por ilusión escrita en un papel

Sé que desde ayer me he vuelto a creer
Que en un papel, que en un rincón o una pared
Puedo encontrar el corazón de una mujer
Que me busca, me desea, que se muere, por querer

Qué importan los necios que no sienten
Qué importa, qué cuenta la risa de esa gente
Si yo te quiero, si en un dibujo yo
Sé quién eres

Nadie, nadie, nadie debe esconder
El nombre que dejó escrito en la pared
Nunca, nunca, nunca niegues que una vez
Pintaste en un papel su cara sin saber

Amor hasta el final
Procura demostrar
Que en tus palabras
Existe la verdad

Que cuando hablas
No intentas engañar

Ya jugando al desamor

Quizás deba apostar
Pues si pierdo una vez más
Sólo sería tropezar
En una piedra ya conocida

No regales tus promesas
Es más fácil que me mientas
Me asusta tu inocencia
Ansío ese cariño
Aunque nunca fuese mío

Los miedos
Del ayer debieran esconder
Sus dagas impregnadas
De agrios recuerdos

Que quiero adormecer
De cínicos abrazos
Que sobran en mi piel

No regales tus promesas

Me asusta tu inocencia
Ansío ese cariño aunque
Nunca fuese mío no regales

Tiemblo cuando imagino tus manos puestas sobre mis hombros
Quiero bailar contigo, lloro porque es un sueño
Te quiero, te quiero, te quiero, te quiero y quiero seguir soñando

Si me llegas a querer me vas a matar, mujer
Qué puede pasar, mujer, si me llegas a querer
Si me llegas a querer, me vas a matar mujer

Quiero volver a oírte hablando sola frente a un cristal
Quiero ser el cristal que te escuche hablar cada madrugada
Quiero ser un novato, alguien que nunca ha sido
Te quiero, te quiero, te quiero y quiero oídos en tu cama

Tengo miedo por el misterio de ser sincero, no sé quién eres
Tengo miedo porque presiento que he sido poco frente a tus ojos
Dime que sí me quieres, dime sólo esa mentira
Te quiero, te quiero, te quiero, te quiero y quiero decir te quiero

Qué puede pasar, mujer, si me llegas a querer
Si me llegas a querer, me vas a matar mujer
Qué puede pasar, mujer, si me llegas a querer
Si me llegas a querer me puedes matar mujer

Vuelven con palos
Para decir que siguen locos

Se fueron lejos porque creían que allá
En el mar sólo los peces se divertían
Las olas saltan, la luna baila, los remos
Cantan, todos a una sin melodías

Los locos riñen, se pegan, se abrazan
Se tiran de los pelos
Se muerden en la lengua

Los locos chillan, se ríen, se mofan
Se ponen tristes, se tumban en el barro
Cuentan los charcos, están muy locos
Ellos lo saben
Que están muy locos, locos, locos

Entre hogueras sin encender se ven
Siluetas de una mujer que está loca
Que grita frases mirando al cielo

Alza los brazos y se arrodilla para volar
Todos se miran porque, quizás
Sobre las nubes la loca vio un ángel gris

Los locos riñen, se pegan, se abrazan
Se tiran de los pelos
Se muerden la lengua

Se ponen tristes, se tumban en el barro

Girando la ruleta del destino
Acariciando los dedos del peligro
Apostando a números prohibidos

Debes curar tu nocturnidad aunque
No te puedas explicar qué tiene
La noche que no tenga le día
Qué tiene tu sangre que nunca se enfría

Eres hombre reo de la sociedad pues
Buscas en tu noche algo que no hay
Sólo encuentras ojos que nunca te ven
Historias de mentira que nadie se cree

Regalos de una dama de mirada cruel
Que te besa sin saber por qué, agrios
Despechos debajo de la luna, agrios
Desprecios si te mira el sol

Debes curar tu nocturnidad aunque
No te puedas explicar qué tiene
La noche que no tenga el día

Eres el mendigo de una calle gris
De lugares escondidos, turbios y sin luz
Te cargas a la espalda bolsas de dolor
Arrastras la miseria de una triste voz

Solitario cuerpo por el mundo a'lante
Vagabundo eres porque tú lo quieres

Lo más que sueñas

Es tener una aventura que te cambie
Los papeles y descubrir lo que ella tiene

Es su piel morena o es su sangre negra
Son sus piernas largas que hablan sin palabras
Pero su forma de insinuar, es provocadora
Son cien labios rojos en una sola boca

Contando penas de mil maneras
Quemando fechas del calendario
Nadie se niega a una quimera
Que te despierta con piel morena

Con tu cuerpo entero pidiendo embrujo
El embrujo de sus maneras
Eres sólo un preso que se alimenta
Con la sangre de sus venas

Es el tiento de sus manos

Que ni quiero amar, ni nunca más volveré a querer

Y la misma suerte en ti no confía

Otra vez mi pensamiento rumbo a ti

Y me he preguntado por qué otra vez estoy pensando en ti

Antes de tocar aquí yo no era así
Ahora me reviento casi diario
De como era antes tú te debes de acordar

Café Tacuba,"Caminando por la calle va el catrin
Estampa de lotería gritada en juego
Traje a rayas, su bastón y su bombin
""Ese roto"" le gritan a don ferruco

Por palacio y catedral se dirige
Hacia la alameda central

Cita a ciegas, un clavel en el ojal
Sentados frente a una estatua pornográfica
""Mon cherie ca va et
Toi parlez vous francais""

Y hace tanto que eso fué

Que ya tengo miedo de hacerme daño
Intenté la combustión con colonia Samborn's
Y traté de ahogarme en el excusado

Me he tirado ya tres o cuatro veces
De un acantilado y de un edificio
Que no ves que quiero que me salves
Antes de que logre cometer suicidio

Y me compré un escuter para tirarme al mar
Pero es que el mar está muy lejos
Y me he metido cuarenta nembutales ya
Y sólo tengo este pinche viaje

Café Tacuba,"Yo tenia una novia muy refinada
De buenos modales, muy afrancesada

Ella tenia una sirvienta de rasgos olmecas
Ven pinche gata
A mi, coraje me daba que así le gritara
Y deje de querer a esa puta europea
Muy al contrario a su casa no deje de ir
Solo para ver a la Tajin-princes

Cuando yo la desnudaba (a mi novia)
Asco me daba su piel de lejía
Pues yo ya deseaba
Esa piel morena que en nada es del tipo europeo

Así que me decidí, de la ciudad salí
Con todo y su blancura,a mi novia escupí (en la jeta)

Ya vivo en el golfo
Cerca a Chalchihuahuecan
Y vivo mi vida amando
A unos labios jaguar",Labios Jaguar,1992

Ella está a tu lado
Un poco fría se volvió
Pero tú la estás amando

Sobre ti, sobre tus manos
Tú sabes cómo te duele

Yo se que es muy tarde

El alcohol que da otro aspecto a las cosas
Aun la calle parece muy transitada
Una zona en que todo esta vivo
Vivo como el fantasma de un amigo
Es una nostalgia, una decadencia, algo divertido
Pero es un gran miedo a la soledad

No se apagan nunca aquí las grandes luces
Amanece y nunca nadie se da cuenta

Es una nostalgia, un morir muy joven, un olor a antro
Del cual nunca puedo yo escapar",La  Zonaja,1992

Y en tu clase todo el mundo se enteró
Y en tu casa mamá te preguntó
Si acaso fue tu hermano quién te indujo

O, peor aun, fue mariana sí
Fue ella quien te lo propuso

Será mejor llevarlo al hospital""

Por hondo que es el mar profundo
No habrá una barrera en el mundo

Solo es una diversión

A sentirme en la vanguardia
Sin tener que ir a New York
Para ver allá que pasa

No estoy libre de pecado
Con todos los mestizos
También me maleducaron
Por que ya estoy grandecito
Para decidir mi vida
Quinientos años frustrados
Creo que ya fue gran medida

Que no es por Marta, es por mi

Lejos de la gente, cuando a muchos años ms
Ixtepec sabe que nunca, ni muerto podrá parar

Y no he podido salir de aquí
Llevo mas de 3 o 4 meses
Viviendo acá en el subsuelo, en el metro

He cruzado un millón de veces
He querido salir por la puerta
Pero siempre hay alguien que empuja
Para adentro

Y cuando en las noches pienso yo en ti
Se que tu te acuerdas de mi
Pero aquí atrapado en este vagón
No se si volver a salir

Como pastillas, paletones, chocolates, chicles y salvavidas
Tengo ya 6 juegos de agujas, 8 cuters, y encendedores

Creo que me ha crecido ya el pelo con la barba y las arrugas
No se cuando es de día y de noche
No se si llevo 100 años

Después de haber viajado tanto por todo el país
Regresa a su costa amada pa' seguir en el malecón gritando
Vendo pescado frito con limón

Y si supieran las cosas que pudo ver
Que no se parece a nada a los sueños de su niñez
La negrita no comprende de donde fue que salio el cuento ese
Que en otro lugar vives mejor

Por que es muy fácil de pensar
Que hay que viajar para triunfar
Que aquí no hay oportunidad
Que en otro lado si lo habrá
El que experiencia ya adquirió
Nunca se pudo olvidar
Que su cadera al caminar lleva el ritmo de la mar

Por eso un día nublado se regreso
Y vio que acá en su puerto siempre calentaba el sol
Y cuando alguien le pregunta de las cosas que aprendió contesta
""Que viajar a veces no es mejor""

Que quedarse al sol es lo mejor
Que vende pescado con limón
Que si lleva uno lleve dos
Por que al rato to´ ya se acabo
Que ella prepara siempre el mejor
Como este no hay dos en el malecón

A pero eso si duro al trabajo
No se vaya usted a dormir
Como dicen que le paso a mi amigo el camarón
O como al señor cangrejo que por andar de crustáceo
Se lo comieron al ajo
O como este pescadito que tiene el ojito azul
Creo que viene de lejos

Que sientes asfixia al salir
Pero ésto nunca lo esperé
A esta presión quién puede vivir
Otra vez en mi elemento pero en espacio pequeño
No hay arriba, no hay abajo, todo es movimiento

Ya a un gran lugar

Ella está a tu lado
Un poco fría se volvió
Pero tú la estás amando

A través de las persianas
De tu mente
De tus recuerdos
Tú sientes cómo te oprimen
Esos sentimientos

Cuando cae el remordimiento
Sobre ti, sobre tus manos
Tú sabes cómo te duele
Haberlo hecho

Sin embargo
Ella está a tu lado
Nunca solo te dejó
Ni por un instante
En tu cuarto

Desde que tú la hiciste sufrir
Por su cuello tú la hiciste morir
Y no pudo nada ya decir

Ingrata, aunque quieras tú dejarme
Los recuerdos de esos días, de las noches tan oscuras 
Tú jamás podrás borrarte

No me digas que me quieres, que me adoras, que me extrañas

Por eso ahora yo sé que veniste

Y no me importa si lloro un poquito
Porque ese poquito será por tu amor

No vengas para pedirme que tenga compasión de ti

Te pido que no regreses si no es para darme un poquito de amor
Te pido y te lo suplico, por el cariño que un día nos unió

En vez de odiarme tanto
¿No deberías mostrarme tu amor?

No eres nadie para decirme que estoy mal
Como muchos también yo busco la verdad

Eso, si la hay

Vamos todos buscando a tientas algo
Más alla

Antes que política
Ya estabas tú, ya estaba yo

Mira, qué contradicción
En vez de odiarme tanto
¿No deberías mostrarme tu razón?

También busco la verdad
También busco la verdad
Uh la verdad
Uh la verdad",Yo Busco,2012
Café Tacuba,"Lo vieron caer del cielo bola de metal y fuego
Cayó arriba allá en el cerro
Carne para carroñeros

Los zopilotes en círculo van
Localizando en sitio fatal
Los zopilotes en círculo van
Hoy de la muerte se alimentarán

Los cuerpos ya chamuscados
Alguno cortado en tajos
No parecen ser humanos
Dijo un zopilote sabio

Los zopilotes en círculo están
Nadie se atreve el primero a probar
Los zopilotes admirados están
Nadie esperaba esto encontrar

Ay metal retorcido
Sangre de otro color

Ay lo desconocido
Dijo un zopilote
Yo me voy
Lo siguieron todos con temor, con mucho temor

Un zopilote se queda
Para ver que carroñéa
No teme la diferencia
Al contrario la venera

Un zopilote picoteando está
Carne que tiene un sabor especial
El zopilote comienza a pensar
Allá en las estrellas que más habrá

We blaze with scorching heat obliterations everywhere

As much as my single needs to fade away
Shoot my self in the arm and start bleeding

Don't want to go yet,stick a straw in my wound an taste my heart beating
Fucking bitch left me and I ain't even peeped yet

Smoke a bundle till the face lace my brain and neurons

Didn't swim deep enough my head enblowded ten percent
Floated to the surface,the paramedics like what's this stench?

So my girl who left me when she said,'pick me in pcp'
Since I love to smoke I thought it was a joke
Tried to hang myself and I fell free from the rope
Broke both my arms,my neck smashed my themar

Got up somehow and lived in front of a beamer
Cracked my ribcage, look what you did cage,your dying

Cut my wrist and walked past some crips bleeding red
In hopes that I get shot in the fucking head

In the middle of the freeway walking to the city
So much pcp I changed my name to watermouth
Pumpin' acid ace I walked into a Jewish slaughter house

Throw myself on the hook, now that's the chorus
Got split from my neck to my dick,now that's what poor is
Hallow man look at all my dangling parts
Dropping to the gutter with a piece of you in my heart

Little piece of shit that I couldn't fling from my chest
Should of stayed a lot long enough to kill the faggot with
But right now, my skin is getting stripped off
Each one of my limbs is ripped off covered in thick sauce

My head hits the convale an I'm thinkin' a brail of cent
I'm watching a movie alone's alone and your sucking somebody's dick
Six seconds left when I die I'm gonna find her
On some poker dice shit,while my face goes through the grinder

Leave the faggot unconscious and douse him in Goldschlager
Light the match, now kick him till he holler
Kick him harder, he only had forty dollars
Jump in your moms whip your face dripping
Leave the tabs alone, no such thing as safe tripping
Bumps of K help explain what's inside you
Look in the rear-view, he's still dragging behind you
Pull it over, you skidded off half his shoulder
Pouring rain you can still smell the blood odour
Think of all the shit he put your mom through
He's half dead, it's already starting to calm you
Tell him to bite the curb then kick till it's heard
Read the papers nerd, stepfather massacred
Start to laugh, you know it's alright
Cause when they questioned your moms you was sleeping all night

Three in the chest, I saw him drop
The only time that I ever called him pop
Two in his back while he's dead on the ground
One more in the head because he made a little sound
Ran out of bullets so I used the blade
Wear rubber gloves cause he might have AIDS
Better call home because I'll be late for supper
Sorry mom, I just killed this mother fucker

Cut school cause you like fuck school
Mom fuck you, I'll throw you into a truck too
Keep my drugs, I can sneak in more
Let's all go rob my stepfather's sneaker store
I got the codes and pluis the new shocks in
Nobody's watching so jail ain't an option
Fuck trust, tried to kill my family twice
Stupid mother fuckers trying to raise an anti-christ
I steal from the bitch that shit me in the ditch
And plot the death of the fag that said he'd make her rich
In dish washing gloves, anger starts to flood
At gun point, got mom wrapping the carcus up
See through stab wounds, a barbeque at dad's tomb
Barbeque chicken, I can tell mom is glad too
Meet you in the car, rolled the haze
Rubbing my full stomach while I pissed on his grave

One more in the head because he made a little sound
Ran out of bullets so I used the blade
Wear rubber gloves cause he might have AIDS
Better call home because I'll be late for supper
Sorry mom, I just killed this mother fucker

Put me on a pins petition, man listen
My mom might slip in your blood and die in the kitchen
My hands itching to push the blade then my fist in
Pop out your back knocking your spine out of position
Parts missing while they scoop you off the ground
The class clown ready to pull the mask down
Empty the gun, then it's time to reload
Mapping out his murder, pissing for my P.O
Get home, he's on the couch running his mouth
Walked up to him and put his own gun in his mouth
His mouth painted the wall, he's still standing waiting to fall
Heard a car pull up, I shoud've stayed at the mall
But I'm sick of getting treated like a god damn step child",The Soundtrack,2002
Cage,"Blue collar to corporate blessed the unfortunate
Like when I put my foot down that bitch still aborted it
Stuck the canister under my jacket like the lucky one
'Uh, sir you can't leave with that,' Bitch this my fucking son!
Put with the gun crammed in the glovebox
With 151 drum bottles, I don't drink, they gettin' flung
With lit rags in it, kill 10 step-dads a minute
Still won't be a star till the label as a gimmick
Even if I limit timid com-mi-tive cynics
Each one famous suicide at gunpoint to mimic
You too can be a mock-celeb or the last there is
Or be ghost like money that played Casper in kids
I put a sick twist every other frame design so
You see AIDS victims selling pretzels at a slideshow
With a nine shown I brand and skin 'em
Run out of punchlines when you kids stop standin' in 'em

[Chorus]
Yo Chris I think they think you know too much
Yeah Sis I think you put coke up your nose too much
They cut my hands off so I couldn't hold too much
They try to kill me through my dick with these hoes too much
You stack dough too much
You smack hoes too much
Well you can blame it on the mint leaves I roll too much
They cut my hands off so I couldn't hold too much
Don't stand off, bullet holes show too much

They see weed on dust with an ounce a pound
Is like jumping out of building grabbing napkins on the way down
My impant I scarred, I'm anti-star
Though I shine like one buried underground with y'all
And I tried to learn good just wasn't concerned, should
I really be on my sixth bottle of wormwood
My skin is burnin' blisternin' aloe ow
Dragged this big fat bitch in to see Shallow Hal
I drink Jack puff black in Orange County
Bought a gun with a body to stick in this whore's Audi
Knew this kid Craze he would stick dope on a chick open ha'
Then I changed my name to Cage like Nick Coppola
All these snakes with these forked tongues stitched together
After I put down the pepper I switch the weather
Whatever rights they want to shrug off for safety feelin' taken
For a Rabbi appearance 'cause they kneelin' to Satan

[Chorus]

Then, I stepped over the bloody axe frame with wax fame
Rogue pistol runnin' through New York like Max Payne
Out shootin' celebs, I'm rootin' for feds
In a pit of lions then we sip shoot from the heads
I run with maniacs liable to kill at any minute then
I wonder why I can't shake this insanity image
It's been a dead Cage since I've strapped to beds
And shot up with needles and five since I put gas to heads
You was bitch in high school no rep no threat
Riding my jacket like I'm a hand off the fans at coat check
Haters want to put they bitches up no stress
Like your life in the monitor box behind the desk
I scribble shit on paper, pay rent, look at nature
See a menage before lunch, them bitches are ravers
Drive blazers, still inside my North Face
Drippin' formaldahyde and short-circuit my tazer

[Chorus]",Too Much,2002

Yo, I?ll send this to alla my corporate corpses
Trying to abort the thoughts, coming out wilin? 
Time to off the office,
I was surely sort of twisted
Worked at a tv studio, an audio assistant
Easy, do my duty, though at times was in a ?me? mood
Hot I gotta be cool
I was on the brink of fiends truth
Livin in the green room
Made a brother the same color but beyond neon
Pushing me to peon
Barking at dreams to be gone
???talent and many they haven?t any
Was especially a challenge 
When you be like goddamnit
Can he lift his vocal
As he?s cuffing it, how my mic sound?
Thinking on the low, it?s perfect when he put the mic down
Clown stand steady, willing wanting subservient
Sound man blurting in thinking I?d fucking murder them
Steaming when I?m watching duke
Scheming on some hot pursuit
Gotta win as these cats be modelin? what not to do

Get your door?s darkened by the house of card carpenters
Who never thought a slave could be a Spartacus or
Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
Take important conference calls
In corner office walls
Stealin buckets
A bunch of these punch numbers
Five punch just say no to company functions
And I duck into the dungeons
Nothing says kill it 
Like a day of pinching paperclips and staplers for the privilege
Two lives, one is chores for whores
One is where I wanna be when you begin regretting yours
And I?m boredom with a large coffee
Tardy every morning
To a man who authority beyond what it was for
How you gonna pay the rent?

Make rap records matter fact thanks!

And try to find my face again
Buried beneath this house
My spirit screams and dies again
Out back a monster wears a cloak of Persian leather
Behind the TV screen
I've fallen to my knees

I said you got me where you want me again
And I can't turn away
I'm hanging by thread and I'm feelin' like a fool
I'm stuck here in-between
The shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away
I need to get away

Blanket of silence
Makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
Burn all the evidence
A fabricated disbelief
Pull back the curtains
Took a look into your eyes
My tongue has now become
A platform for your lies

I said you got me where you want me again
And I can't turn away

I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down
Like a sittin' duck just waitin' for the fall

Yeah you got my back against the wall

Deep in the jungle
Camouflaged by all the fallen leaves
A hand holds up the sky
While shamefully I make my plea
The alters callin'
But my legs won't seem to stand
Guess I'm a coward
Scared to face the man I am

Diamonds look so stunnin'

Not a lot of people left around,
Who knows now,
Softly laying on the ground, oh
Not a lot people left around, oh, oh

In my life, I have seen,
People walk into the sea,
Just to find memories,
Plagued by constant misery,
Their eyes cast down,
Fixed upon the ground,
Their eyes cast down

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Shake me down,
Cut my hair on a silver cloud,
Broken sound,
Softly laying on the ground, oh
Not a lot people left around, oh, oh

In my past, bittersweet,
There's no love between the sheets,
Taste the blood, broken dreams,
Lonely times indeed,
With eyes cast down,
Fixed upon the ground,
Eyes cast down

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Turn back now its time for me to let go,
Way down had to find a place to lay low,
Lampshade turned around into a light post

Walk around the corner,
Never saw it coming still,
I try to make a move,
It almost stopped me from belief,
I don't wanna know the future,

With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'.

And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder.

Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling,
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.

She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle.
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.

In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'.
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance,
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence.

I wanna take you to that place in the “Roche”
But no one gives us any time anymore
He ask me once if I’d look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off

Now listen to mine""

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall

A thousand lonely stars
Hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't wanna sing anymore

Now listen to mine""

Con el sabiondo paquidermo
Muchos secretos me contó
Pero no solo quiso ver why fue volar
Volar why volar
Hasta llegar, a la nada,
Bajo el sol.

Estoy dispuesto a descubrir
Todo lo que no sea verdad
Estoy dispuesto a marginar
Todo lo que no sea real para ti,
Para mí. para seguir buscando
El penacho bajo la luna

Estoy dispuesto a imaginar
Que no existe represión
Después de tanto reclamar
Bajo su trompa why se echo al suelo
Why se fue, se fue
De su jaula, hacia a la nada,
Sobre la luna.

Gets me nowhere I can’t stay

Took my dreams with you

And I can’t accept it yet

If a worm can turn into a butterfly

Push off the bottom float to each other
Shallow heart, shallow water

As your ship goes sailing by
She?ll be floating in the air
Will she notice you down there?

Empty head, empty bottle
Tip it back she won't follow

So learn to swim while you are young
Old men can't tread water
She?ll be floating by one day
And you'll be missing each other

Let the water wash you clean
For the years have left you fearful
Two as one can float on air
One alone is a sinking vessel

Earth is dry grave?s are hollow

The years run dry

You can rise to the surface
Love can never hurt us
You can see the shore from here swim
And you rise to the surface

Love can never hurt us
Trade the water for the air
Keep her safe, hold her near

Beautiful house full of empty rooms

Left her feeling nothing

Days roll by but her heart won't break

She wishes it would, she'd float away and fly

She picks up the paper
But the words are blurred
And she thinks about writing
Down the way that they were

Just left her with everything
She feels like being nothing

Her eyes stay dry, days still break
Years go by, her heart won't ache
She knows what it should
She'd float away and fly

And how do we get it?
What we need to get it?
How can she feel for what's real?

The story she told us
Unfolded in on itself
Is there a hurt that can heal?

Is it sore, hidden and sore, it's as dark in this moment
As the day she are was born
All hidden and sore, it's dark as when it's over
As the day we are born

It wilts the flowers that your girlhood put there
You're disappointed before you lay your head down

And the hall light won't wake you behind a close door

And your little girl wishes one thing as a dime

And soldiers to say lullabies, high

Caitlin Rose,"New York City, I met a man
Told me that his name was Dan
Said I don't know who I am
Just who I wanna be
Told me that he didn't care
Ran his fingers through my hair
Tossed a coin up in the air
Said 'tails, come home with me'

To the apartment of a friend
Where I didn't have to pay no rent
Or be good company

To put ideas into my head
Can't remember what he said
But I know it wasn't true
Asked him if he had a light
Asked me 'honey where are you sleepin' tonight?'
I said 'one thing I know, johnny, is I'm not going home with you'

So I got lost on the lower east side
'Cause I pissed off my tour guide
I was lucky to be alive

Made them go from blue to green
Made me look just like some kind of acid-washed-up movie queen
Bleached my hair, stained my face
Made me drink just for the taste
And to burn out the monster this town has brought out in me

So Tennessee, when I get home
You just better leave me alone
Don't try to claim me as your own

Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns

Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force

It filled her dear heart full of joy
But she didn't know till she read the inside
It was the last one from her darling boy
Dear Mom, was the way that it started
I miss you so much it went on
Mom, I didn't know, that I loved you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won
I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
You know as you did, when I was a kid
And I'd come home with mud on my feet
The captain just gave us our orders
And Mom, we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But now I'll just say I love you
Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed for there was no name

She prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
And dear God keep America free",Soldiers Last Letter,1995

And stockings in the basin

Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Cal Tjader,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1993

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.

Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

No one else, whoa

Wandering alone, yeah
At night, vision’s so blurry
With the heat steam from your body
Sweat drips like kamikaze
And at night I am the warmest
And at night I know the best place
To keep you under starlight
To keep you gone

Their bodies burned with a ghostly fire
Lost island South Pacific desire
Grass skirts and hula girls, yeah
Cannibal of holocaust
Shameful lust in paradise on holiday
Sun and vice

Wandering alone, yeah
At night, vision’s so blurry
With the heat steam from your body
Sweat drips like kamikaze
And at night I am the warmest
And at night I know the best place
To keep you under starlight
To keep you gone

Deep rivers
Dark jungles in the rain (whoa)
Prowl mountain tops
Primitives designed to win the game (whoa)

Wandering alone, yeah
At night, vision’s so blurry
With the heat steam from your body
Sweat drips like kamikaze
And at night I am the warmest
And at night I know the best place
To keep you under starlight
To keep you gone",At Night I Am the Warmest,
