I quit, here's my rhyme book go head and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage ya find somethin
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumpin
I'm constantly coppin over you, squatin, shit is gotten
To the point, where I'm ain't even writin no more I'm just jottin
This is chicken scratch
Shit is sickin, I've been kickin ass off bullshit, throw away rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap
You crazy? I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat
You Canibus? then it's Dre's beat
You Kay Slay? the fee's waived
I stay beefin with JD to the day Dre two-ways me

Du denkst wie kann sowas sein?
Wie kann dieser Thomas Stein sowas signen?

I still got fiens in the hood puffin on that Magic Dragon 
My guns under my pillow, I sleep wit my shoes on 
Every single night me and my mack get our groove on 
Don't get moved on 
Cause I shoot through your bicepts your tricepts 
Then breeze through ya projects 
When the coke come back 
It's the China White 
And the d don't sweat us in a bag a rice 
Let's ride O T 
And burn the tape 
I got this bad mommy, her mouth's a sperm bank 
Since Yayo be a fearless man 
I donate my heart to them niggas that ran 
And, those niggas in the hood don't want to see me famous 
They rather see my moms make funeral arangements 
I got enough rhymes, to fill 6 notebooks 
I been spittin that shit ever since coke crushed 
You can hear me on your T.V. and radio at the same time 
I never ever say the same rhyme, it's Tony 2 times 
Beware of my wraith, I'm gone school you niggas 
Prepare for class 
Yo I peep where your puns at, peep where you pumped that 
Money you tryin to stack I spent it on blunt wraps

Y'all sweet like ninety-nine bananas
That's why I got ninety-nine niggas wit ninety-nine hammers
They all want a nigga to stop

Third rule pick a day, fourth rule pick a time
Fifth rule pick a fifth, sixth rule pick a nine
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet
So when the shootout you leave him six feet deep
Eighth meet in a fast car with disguise
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
Ninth rule don't say shit cause po-po listen
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system

Just put a toe-tag on your mark

They got scared, ""Cent got money,"" and I got shot
You put pressure on me when you compare me to 'Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot

I'll fire shots at the shepherd and watch the sheep scatter

I'd probably be in the penitentary
But I played the cards, the dead lord sent to me
The whole truth, I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas
Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers
Before I let this police kid harass me

Ain't nothing you can do to stop me (stop me)
Y'all niggas get so emotional (emotional)
You remind me of my bitch

It's not of my nature to make a commitment so let me breathe
What she doesn't understand catch attitudes when I leave her
My other relationships just make it harder for me to accept her as my own
She tries to tie up my phone and
I'm not at home she's thinking I'm not alone
Probably out tryin' to bone anything in the street
I let her know she can leave I ain't tryin' to tie her up
But see it's hard to fuck wit somebody after she touches me
Mami I'm not your regular nigga I know the game
But I don't play by the rules I'm focusing on my moves
That way I will never lose
See I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Bentleys with 22's
You say I confuse you play little trick with your head
Catching feelings ever since the first time I slept in your bed
I'm not here to tease you mislead you with so your dreams
I can't say I love you I don't know what that means
I'm a pimp

Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

When I first met her, I did anything to get her
Paid all her bills and filled her frigerator
Reminiscing on late nights when I tried to lay up
But couldn't get off cause your baby would stay up
She even crashed the whip tryin' to switch in the third lane
That's when I realized this bitch was a bird brain
A pigeon writing her baby pops in the box in prison
Sing-Sing is where he been in
She in the Gucci tights and Fendi high heels
Baby wipes and cans of Enfamil
Motorbikes and grams of fish scale
So 9 to 5 niggas was no frills
Turning young niggas with principals to old men with debts
And all the prank calls was death threats
That bitch got the best sex, all across the globe
And the bitch head game was out of control

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

I wonder when I'm gone if you miss me
Or do you miss that Don Perignon and that Christy
I'm fuckin wit you
I'm feeling your shape I'm feeling your eyes
Later on I'm feeling your ass and feeling your thighs
Sweetheart you book smart and street smart
I knew you was my type from the very, very start
I'm in to tongue kissing, foreplay all day
Momma ain't home so the noise is okay
ODB you know we like it the raw way
Latex, safe sex, no hickeys on the neck
Now you're learning
The lords blesses make me wiser as the worlds turning
My tongue touch the right spot I'll have your toes curling
Whether we just kicking it or we sexing
I'm a pro baby girl I spit game to perfection
So when niggas make mistakes I correct em and
When niggas get out of line I check them man

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

They ain't used to a G like you, BOW!

They, they talking that
That gangsta shit
They ain't about that

Hand me my strap

I'll stop 'em from talking like that
They, they talking that

They ain't about that
Man, matter of fact
Hand me my strap
Show me where they at
I'll stop 'em from talking like that

You think you a killer but we gon' just pay 'em a visit
Put the potato on the barrel so nobody hear it
I keep a holster on my shoulder like I'm John Wayne
Shooting these niggas lights out like LeBron James
Holla my name; give me a reason to see you bleeding
After you feel these hollow tips, nigga, then we even
Full of anger until there's no more bullets in the chamber
Ain't nothing like when you get popped and don't know who to blame-a
Nigga told me, ""Do your dirt all by your lonely""
So I go hit them niggas 'fore 50 could even hold me
I'm waiting, anticipating to put a nigga under
Smoking like we some Jamaicans, fucking with this ganja
Ride with no hesitation, retaliation is a must
Bad as I want to, some shit I just don't discuss
So point him out and watch I knock him off
Everywhere you bitches go, I got a nigga watching ya'll, motherfucka!

They, they talking that

Come on, nigga, I ain't here to make no friends; just cut the checks
I got a long pump that'll put your stupid ass out the steps
Begging niggas don't understand, no
Probably cause my hand glow when I'm anticipating' the lambo
Lean out my bucket for niggas thinking they Rambo
You get one warning, so I suggest you let your man know
These rap niggas portray to be tough, nobody acting soft
Til they laid out in the hospital, eatin' apple sauce
Usually for yapping off and turn apologetic
Waving a white flag, for danger they might have
My niggas buying so much ammo
If you reach in the couch for loose change
You'll probably feel on the handle
Holding sixteens to get your bandages and broke bones
So I suggest you get alarm systems in both homes
There's only one team on top; we number one with a Glock
Fuck around and get your dumb ass shot

They, they talking that
That gangsta shit
They ain't about that
Man, matter of fact
Hand me my strap
Show me where they at
I'll stop 'em from talking like that

General, I salute you
I'll put a hole in any nigga tryna shoot you
It ain't nothing 'cause loyalty is what I'm used to
And what I don't do, I'll have one of my troops do
Nigga we'll kill you

I'm ready for combat, a solider on the front line
Take me to the streets, nigga motherfuck a punchline
It only take one time, for you to send a death threat
And watch these bullets have that ass singing like Keith Sweat
You ain't met me yet
I been camouflaged in the bushes
And I'm co-signing Fifty, 'cause them niggas all pussies
Bustin' shots at ya convoy
You don't want war
No surrender, no retreat, this is Vietnam boy
Check my war wounds, I done took a couple for the team
Only niggas that been on the battlefield know what I mean
Take cover we coming, pulling pins outta grenades
You won't make it to the general, without getting sprayed
Might as well say ""Hello"" to my brand new little friend
Only time he come out, to put holes in grown men
You continue troops and get 'em all blowed back
Walk up on 'em with a deuce-deuce and nigga all that, what!

[Chorus: x2]

Look nigga, I suggest you go home
Cause I won't hesitate to let the chrome touch ya
Nigga I'm never scared like Bone Crusher
Stand alone, provide my own supper
Tell ya baby mama stop coming around here or I'm gon' fuck her
Don't trying to pick up for them lames around you
You get shots for free, like I fragrant fouled you
I'm on the road blowing grade A haze and brown
Got niggas running like the KKK's around
My album's coming, a new year's approaching
My buzz getting bigger, my few ears is open
Can ya team play in the game without you their to coach 'em
There's a very fine line between a pool and the ocean
Sometimes I'm in Atlanta where they make head bounce
And you can come, but after you give Banks head, bounce
These niggas really want war, 'cause if so
Get on your vest, 'cause all you gotta do is say that

Blood in, blood out, la kostra nostra
You don't want to bang wit the best
I'll have Doc removing fragments from your chest
They say God's a forgivin' man, I hope he forgive
Thirty shells I let off don't curse my kid
They say Fifty done blew up, Fifty you changed
Nigga you stunt, I pull out
And you see I'm that same nigga that when he start to roar
I think he's flying
Eight outta eight on moving targets
You run? You still dying
Check my resume, I am oh so loco
Mama ain't raise no chump, I don't talk no pocco

There once was some niggas that tried to murder me
I hit em up, put em in plastic surgery
This 4-5 has made a lot of guys apologize
The truth come out, 'stead of hearin' a lot of lies
Some niggas catch a case and then claim they hard
A couple chest wounds will make a nigga change his heart
I just play my part, and while you shooting up cars
I'm smokin' niggas like a Cuban cigar
Let's get it poppin'

I'm tired of you niggas with your maybe beef
We gonna be here forever, you're temporary like baby teeth
I'm in and out the night clubs, A-D-D
Dark blue Benz, navy seats, eighty sneaks
These niggas tellin' out the blue
So you hang em off the bridge
At least they'll have to helicopter you
The Jimmy lived in the bags, the Bell or Hop will do
I rap for the neighborhood niggas that failed in high school
You can tell I came a long way in my sense, home grown
That's why them little niggas in the projects love me
You provide the beat downs for free, I paid my dues
I don't even freestyle for free
I gave em a break, flew over seas
But it's kinda hard to get homie-sick when there's blue in the trees
Sit back and try to play your role wit the copies
I put more staples in yo ass than a telephone pole, Yea

I put that snub nose to ya and bust nigga
If, you don't know, who I be
You better ask somebody about me
And they'll tell ya I'm a soldier boy
And I done told ya, over and over boy

I come from a big city, the streets corrupt
Now I'm rollin' with snub-noses to heat you up
Out here niggas'll do anything to reach a buck
Cause when you broke you can't afford to fuck ya sneakers up
I take my time, keep my mind on my bank funds
Learn how to separate the real from the fake ones
And on my heater nina rep what could I carry on
My nigga just lost his momma, and his daddy gone
From now on I can provide cause my paper's straight
Family losin' his legs, but I can take the weight
Some niggas hate but I'll be damned if they hold me down
Front niggas didn't know me then, bet they know me now
Blunt and a smile, eventually it'll be a frown
Cause every time I turn around a nigga locked down
While I'm in the world, tryin to bring my loot through
Hopin' one day we can kick it like we used to, my nigga

If, you don't know, who I be
You better ask somebody about me
Oh, you wanna be tough nigga, a look is enough
I put that snub nose to ya and bust nigga
If, you don't know, who I be
You better ask somebody about me

And I done told ya, over and over boy

Uhh, they never seen 26's on a Hummer
My goal is to try to fuck Trina by the summer
Some niggas hate me, but they only made me
Go and put mo' ice in my mouth than Baby
G-Unit and Shady, them dudes is crazy
Next time, we only usin' Dr. Dre's beats
Fuck you, pay me, take your magazine flicks
This ain't no Nelly hurr, take a good look at this
Got the wrists of a chemist and the heart of a hustler
Plus I probably done robbed mo' artists than Russell
Always in trouble, you can blame my mother
Gave birth to a gorilla and raised him in the jungle
I ain't crawled, I stumbled across the Mexican with birds
Papi had coke and new plates and pounds of herb
Keep my hand on my Glock, and my ear to the streets
I'm a country boy, you can hear it when I speak

Bentley Azure dreams, G-5 agenda
The hood had made a nigga heart colder than December
Don't take much to make my gun go off
One shot'll make a hardrock look oh so soft
If you don't know you better ask who I be
Or end up in ICU gettin' fed through a IV
Down in the Lou', they say they feelin' me dirty
In New Orleans they say I'm that nigga, ya heard me?
From them Southside blocks to Watts, Westside don't front
You know about them Grapestreet Gangstas, G'd up
Rollin that weed up
Nigga get outta line, get shot stabbed jacked
Hit with a bat or beat up

Pappa wasn't around so I had to let my brother know,
Never stay in center, play the back and let your money grow,
Most them nigga wouldn't be around if you was bummy yo,
South side Jamaica nigga yeah that's where I come from,
If you see a nigga with me then there's more than one gun,
Five straight soldier ain't that tired of being the dumb one,
Or even satisfied being another niggas dun-dun,
We all know friendships turn sour when you getting it,

I got love for them and I ain't even from there,
Now bust a shot for them boys on the block,
I can feel your pain nigga,
I'm still in the game nigga,
There somethin' bout the sound of a trey-pound,
That make me pull up, hop out and make a nigga lay down,
See every time we round' ya hear some shots go off,
And niggas get there chains snatched when they try and show off,
Shoot outs in broad day we do it the mob way,
And come to find out these niggas is softer than Sade,
I'ma keep living my life with a pistol in my palm and a wrist full of ice,
You can call me the don.

I ain't a marksman my spark and I'll spray shit,
Enough rounds for the Hk I don't play bitch,
Move like I'm militant back on that gorilla shit,
Moody, disrespectful, I'm ruley but niggas can't move me,
I squeeze till I run outta ammo, if it's a problem it's handled,
I'll have your people pourin' out liquor and lightin' candles,
You fuck around I'll blow your brains on my new york times,
Run home turn to the sports section and read your mind,
It's crystal clear you should feel when that gat bust,
First it's crime scene tape then you end up in that black hurst,
We don't go to funerals but we'll go to your wake fam,

Syringes and sirens the only thing on the street
People act like they don't know who did it but they know its me
Every days a death threat but I ain't dead yet
So I go put a whole in the nigga from the next sac
Don't know where I slept at just know where my check at
Its the first of the month
My bitch ain't got her check yet
Juve left me in California I don't respect that
I love him to much to beef so I'ma except that
But I'ma just step back
And focus on buck

And I been having money
I went bought her a house
But she told me she ain't want it
Right then I understood that the hoods in my blood
So I holla Cashville Let them know where I'm from
Niggas know I got a gun
When I come to the club
And If It go down you better tell your people to Duck
Why should I slow down
I just got started targeting artists
Wait till the bullets start hopping
Out the closets
I come to get it popping
I pray to god the news watching
So when they see him his niggas will know who got him
We came from the bottom to the top
From hoopties to a drop

He keeps her fresh chicks white T's and fitted hats now
Uncle Rock-a-whiner we won't put the yack down
Erica the jump shop but he's smoking crack now
The Lunatics the Lost Boys cheap shit is wack now
Country boots shrowden crackers got him on his back now
And Sean runnin' round with his gat now
Up in niggaz cribs sayin' where that money at pound
And Saundra from BK I seen her out in Houston
That bitch travel the world she runnin' round boostin'
And Toya got these bad ass kids they a nusince
Their baby daddy's never come around they useless
Everynow and then I come through on some new shit

Look man, I don't know what you been drinkin' I don't know what you been thinkin'
But get outta line and it's oops upside ya head
The media they write whatever they choose
And the cops stay on my ass so I stay on the news
These other rap niggas couldn't walk in my shoes
Went through a bunch of bullshit while I was paying my dues
They say my music make a gangsta want to pop somethin'
Well tell them niggas to get poppin' & stop frontin'
You heard of me but do you know how I get down
Stay with a vest on, roll wit a couple tre-pounds
In case you motherfuckers want to jump bad now

See Buck been shot, but not more than 50
I don't dance, what I look like signin' wit Diddy?
I got plans, grenades and the G-Unit wit me
And on command, we spray give a fuck who we hittin'
What's in my hand? A tan 'bout a hundred and sixty
Hollow tips, four-fifths with the rubber grip
Crips and Bloods they show me love like I'm claimin' a set
These industry niggas know they better pay me my check
I get a kick outta seein' these broke ass rappers
Ten people showed up that's why your show got canceled
50 whatever they did to the kid is handled

Stay in your place I recommend or say hello to my little friend

Everywhere I go I gotta tag along
Cause my buzz gettin' strong And they mad I'm on
They ride with me when I'm past the mall
Don't wait for me on the bench when I'm running a game of basketball
One squeeze will make a bastard fall
Gasp and crawl
You need a bulletproof vest mask and all
Bring your buddy when it's time to roam (why?)
Cause I got hit the last time I left mine at home
My hand bling full of platinum the shine is chrome
He even got closet space inside of my home
He ain't never been broke he glitchless
So reliable I bought him a rubber coat for Christmas
Infrared beam in the scope for distance
The best company wouldn't proach in business
He who ride with me to the end
We all gotta friend
And mine is a G-you-N.

She meet him his destination hell or heaven
Cause I only bring em out for that 187
He don't have a heart I just keep feeding him shells
He get it poppin' in the hood so his name ring bell
Ms. Jones stay on the third floor she call the cops on me
They came I ran I had to toss my Uncle little homie
Niggas they all got new friends so they stay in there place kid
I stay screamin' on niggas and beatin' up base heads
These niggas sayin' doley just like they pretend
Keep fuckin' around they goin' say hello to my little friend.

We been in a box but we both still spittin'
And when there was beef you even played your position
Got under the seat until we spotted our victim
At first they wouldn't listen to they heard you go off
Remember it was broad daylight in the middle of New York
And little did they know we was ready for war
Bet that nigga wished he'd never stick his head out the door
See whenever you come out something happen on the block
You the reason that nigga done stop rappin' like Pac
People see you ain't run and you even say shit
They just know you ain't nothin' to play wit
Stay wit 16 homies and one in the hole
When the first one get out the next one go
To know where your headed you gotta know where you been
The glock stay with me we friends till the end.

I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes

I'm gettin' the feelin' you wanna take revenge
From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz
It all depends, maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch, ahan
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic but the hearts in tact
So everytime we separate, somebody's marchin' back
You're amazin' in the sack
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black
God bless whoever gave you all of that
If you seen her from the back
You'd understand why dis feel like that
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes

What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tip toed into a crib or two
I've come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though you're busy boo, the evenin's when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky, 'cause I see niggas
When you tease 'em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left
Wild drama, section eight princess
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed
'Cause it's hard to communicate
'Cause she don't speak no ingles
I been around the world from state to state
But now I'm back bustin' in your bathroom
Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on
Cause I'm leavin in a hour flat, really don't matter, she's mad
Even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And, I bet you I can make you smile

They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy

And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show

So the stash box big enough to squeeze the mack in

Hate it when I'm not around

I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with a frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame
Fall in love with my chain

Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only

And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

I dont know where you from but out here we ride
So if you scared of conflict don't come outside
Get your hands on a gun
Cause ain't no one gonna repspect you as a man if you run, dial 9-1-1
I'm hear talkin' to the street now
That's only gonna lead to bulletwounds and beatdown's, retreat clown
You still strugglin down to your last rock
G-Unit is gorillas and Blackchild's the mascot
You thought you wouldn't hear my voice
I'm in the hood cause I'm hood
You in the hood cause you ain't got no choice
Your top seller gettin' sticked for his shine
Either I'm blind, or Ashanti's sideburns is thicker than mine
I'm youngest in charge with my dick in a dime
Grippin' the nine, sippin' that lime
Becardi in a party, you sorry
I'm blowin' wet green right out the safari
That'll put you in a left lean higher than a marley
And as far as Charlie, a studio hour is a waste
She look like she took a bag of flour in the face
You want street credibility instead of I'ma sting you
C'mon Ja you put a fuckin crackhead on your single

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
What goes up must come down, what goes around comes back around
I suggest you run when you see the pound
Or get laid the fuck out on the ground
What goes up must come down, what goes around comes back around
I suggest you run when you see the pound
Or get laid the fuck out on the ground

[Lloyd Banks]
My cousin bringin' back them blueberry bags, I've been waiting all day
On them Shelltops that got Jam Master Jay, on 'em
I got a jeanius and kneehighs that swallows me whole
Tongue's longer than the ones on your Fila's
She's buys anything I desire, prolly cause I'm on fire
The 2003 McGwire, until I retire
My neighborhood breed ballers that slam dunk
Cross overed to crack now they can't even jump
I leave with any panties I want, the industries new face
I'm in a bitch mouth every morning like toothpaste
Place your bet, Envy pull out a few crates
I got enough 16's to battle 2 states
I'm in a spaceship, neck full of grey shit
Bigetes in the braclet, expect nothing basic
Respect and embrace it, your sketch in the basement
I'll have them try to find where the rest of your face is

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
The hoes know I'm lazy as hell, that's why I get the bitch to twist
Dogg, I stay around trees like Christmas gifts
Yea, you laughing and dancing 'til they stick you
And have you holdin' your chest like I'm singing the National Anthem
Have your worried bout the reprecussions after the tantrum
I'll be alone in a mansion, and it's snowing in the Hamptons
Regardless of what these fools say, I'ma be around longer than 'Cool J
Armed with a new K
So dumb in a new way, If I don't fuck Monday, I'm gone hit it Tuesday
My charm get it usually
You put a lot of years into rap, these lil' starvin' chumps
Start your career from the back of a milk carton
Your gased up from whatever he must of told ya
But everything in Army fatigues ain't a soldier
In my upbring we wore the same socks
And buckets in the living room to catch the rain drops

Boy if you want me, then you can have me
I want you to want me and love me unconditionally

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
You want me to want you, you want me to need you
You want me beg and stay by my side
You want me to chase you, you want me to lace you
You want me to just swallow my pride
You want too much from me
Pretending I'm that nigga you lovingg
Last week it was my man, the week before your husband
Girl that ring on your finger means nothing
Its just a waste of money, and he was just a dummy
I know you kiss hI'm and hug him
And tell hI'm that you love him, you lying
Because I hit the first night and I wasn't even trying
You fascinated with the flow
You know I'm about to blow
Come to see me at my show
Admire how my wrist glow
You like the way I get the dough
We can go, just to drow
Let your knees hit the floor
I like it when you do it slow
ain't nobody got to know
We can keep it on the low
I don't like niggas in my business, told you that before

[Chorus]
[Verse 2 - Young Buck]
You want me to hug you, you want me to love you
You want me to miss you everytime you gone
You want to shine, you want to spend time
Girl this is just a fling thing, word is bond
You want too much from me
Everyday calling my phone
You found out my benz sittin on chrome
won't leave me alone
Catchin feelings cause I'm never at home
I should've known not to pick up the phone
Before a nigga got on
You wouldn't take time out to speak
Then you expect me to take your ass out to eat
I can't lie girl you sure look good in that mink
Tonight its on you, you gonna buy me a drink
Whatchu think?

[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Tony Yayo]
You want me to lay out quality time, like you don't know I'm on tour
Fuck you blowin up my cell phone for? huh?
Why everytime we talk you askin for more, huh?
You want a nigga to commit, that our relationship shit and
I didn't string you along, you talkin reckless
Shorty look at my necklace
I don't sell dreams, I sell records
I know your type, used to parade around town
Bumped into an entertainer, now you want to slow down
Introduced me to family and friends as well
Walkin out the house feeling like a piece of show-n-tell
cheatin cause your boyfriend doesn't like to spend
I hate to bust your bubble but I'm just like him

Now I've got task on a nigga's ass
Tell me will they blast me
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
It's gettin' crazy after dark
These narcs be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penetentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me
I'm stackin' G's buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low
Although I'm young I'm still comin up
I'm gettin' paid pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull the strap when there's drama
Buster you ain't heard?
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'

Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin' used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'mma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin' to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin' the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on with it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change
It's thug in my veins
I'm loyal to the game

I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'

Yeah
It ain't my fault I came up fast
And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass
10 grand on every ring I flash
Deep frog--and I'mma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where it's scorchin' hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin' her brain
Get more slugs to boil in your frame
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain
The paint's the same color as oil in the Range
I'm stingy ain't got nothin' for you but some change
I'm good now but the fact still remains
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name

I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'

You ain't the same when Jay-Z's around
I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me
You scream and holler when Eminem's in town
I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me
Snoop put me up on how the hoes get down
I know you like Nelly, like Kelly, Ludacris
Try to run game on me you punk bitch
I know you don't love me

[Tony Yayo]
Gators and ostrich, you know we in power
You could see my outfit on the Discovery Channel
I'm a stunner, my bitches train like robots
They sniff coke, deep throat, and they hold out glocks
It's the brick-copper, the L-sharper
645 NASCAR driver that's known to spit lava
I'm in Cancun, with a model in the bedroom
Her pussy tight like an airplane bathroom
Talk out your mouth piece, baby pah
The baby A-are will make it hot like South Beach
I move like, Bin Laden armed with them hammers
In that new Jag wagon, with James Bond vagrant
Medina all - red; mira give me - head
Bad bitch, look like Eva Mendes
I'm a gangsta, general, comrade nigga
Drug money, blood money in a brown bag nigga

I'm in the candy-painted Range, Cardier frame
Six-by-nines playin so I can hear e'ry thang
Heavy on the gas homie, hoggin up two lanes
The navigation got me to where I'm gon' be stayin
The trunk full of somethin that can get a nigga life
So my seatbelt's on, and I'm stoppin at the light
I done been to Queens before but not behind the wheel
I'm a country nigga, ain't this many buildings where I live
But the business gotta be handled so where this coward at?
We leave a couple niggaz layin, bet them bitches holla back
Ever since Yayo been home it's been on
Smackin niggaz up, employers is gettin sent home (yeah!)
On this battlefield, you know, it's kill or be killed
Leavin niggaz with bulletholes and hospital bills
This is how it is homie, La Cosa Nostra
I won't stop 'til I'm on a ""Wanted"" poster, motherfuckers

Uh-uh, yeah
You should thank the Lord if the ray gon' getcha
Cause the sawed-off'll microwave a nigga like, Adolf Hitler
Fuck pressure, I enter the ring calm
I'm nicer than them Japanese niggaz in ping-pong
Look at my ring don, lease a 100 K worth of bling on
Smokin the same buddha as the courtroom shooter
I got the mind of a genius; the rag-white Jag
Backhand like Venus's, jab like Zab
Ya bitch, I'm makin her knees knock in the lab
Let off, and send her to the weed spot in the cab
And I don't hate all music, I just hate y'alls
And I hear you when you whisper, got the ear of Ray Charles
I'm ahead of my class fucker
And I only serve a bitch once so they treat my dick like the Last Supper
Niggaz callin out my name in vain
When someone jab to the jaw they be the claim to fame

Got a cherry lowrider in the N-why-see
Eve took me to Philly, never been to the pen
Been to Uptown with 50, seen niggaz in Timbs

I done seen Young Buck scuff Air Force One's
In Cashville, but Compton is
Where it's just me, my son, and my bitch
She graduated when Notorious B.I.G. dropped ""Me and My Bitch""

She get them birds past, I put her in first class
And tell her to carry on that Duni and Burke bag
She from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag
And only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags

'Cause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin'

I painted the Rover black
The West coast is back, I can smoke to that
Mom's got the CL-6, that's a fact

Acting like my money ain't no good in the hood; you know what I mean?
Fucking head blown off, nigga; you know?

Man, matter of fact

They, they talking that

Man, matter of fact
Hand me my strap
Show me where they at
I'll stop 'em from talking like that

I'm the topic in every barbershop and beauty salon
Cause these other niggas that rap ain't on the shit that I'm on
Cause 50 this; 50 that; 50 stay with a gat
Thirty-two shots in the clip, hollow tips in the MAC
But when I come through, shh - the talking stop
My money long now, I can make the Pope get shot
Now, we can blow an hour talking bout the stones I rock
Or the hoes I got - catchin' stunts in the drop
Now, Nas, you love the kid, 50 on that killa shit
That big mobster bad man; BGF guerrilla shit
I'm marking my music like diesel on the block
So if you with me you gon' eat, and you gon' starve if you not
Weed smokers love me like they love Buddha
I'll turn your kids to a shooter
Crip niggas love me like they love Hoover
They tell me see careful good, cause niggas wanna see like you
They ain't used to a G like you, BOW!

You think you a killer but we gon' just pay 'em a visit
Put the potato on the barrel so nobody hear it
I keep a holster on my shoulder like I'm John Wayne
Shooting these niggas lights out like LeBron James
Holla my name; give me a reason to see you bleeding
After you feel these hollow tips, nigga, then we even
Full of anger until there's no more bullets in the chamber
Ain't nothing like when you get popped and don't know who to blame-a
Nigga told me, ""Do your dirt all by your lonely""
So I go hit them niggas 'fore 50 could even hold me
I'm waiting, anticipating to put a nigga under
Smoking like we some Jamaicans, fucking with this ganja
Ride with no hesitation, retaliation is a must
Bad as I want to, some shit I just don't discuss
So point him out and watch I knock him off
Everywhere you bitches go, I got a nigga watching ya'll, motherfucka!

Come on, nigga, I ain't here to make no friends; just cut the checks
I got a long pump that'll put your stupid ass out the steps
Begging niggas don't understand, no
Probably cause my hand glow when I'm anticipating' the lambo
Lean out my bucket for niggas thinking they Rambo
You get one warning, so I suggest you let your man know
These rap niggas portray to be tough, nobody acting soft
Til they laid out in the hospital, eatin' apple sauce
Usually for yapping off and turn apologetic
Waving a white flag, for danger they might have
My niggas buying so much ammo
If you reach in the couch for loose change
You'll probably feel on the handle
Holding sixteens to get your bandages and broke bones
So I suggest you get alarm systems in both homes
There's only one team on top; we number one with a Glock
Fuck around and get your dumb ass shot

They, they talking that

They ain't about that

I never liked these niggaz anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a buildin? today
Hey, nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

I got the burner burner, I come to burn and burn ya
Revolver turn ya, call it murder murder
I ain't smilin? I ain't smirkin?, I ain't muh'fuckin? jokin?
See if you think somethin? sweet when your head open

Cross me, force me, go 'head, line me up
I found where you rest at, you grimy fuck
I be out front your raggedy ass crib on a stake out
With a pound, two clips and Chinese take-out

You make it rain, I make it lead shower
You say your prayers, you in your last hour
I have you pushin? up daisies, the coke dump crazy
You chumps amaze me, the wolves they raised me
You don't like me then spray me

This is that face down on the floor, ski mask shit
If I fall off I rebound quick
Like Greg Odin, Tony Yay' I be holdin?
German mouths on my hip ?cause my wrist be frozen

How these rappers claim blood and the books is closed?
How these rappers claim cars and they gun don't smoke?
I catch a nigga on his deathbed
And rip the IV out his arm then jump in the Optimus Prime

Dust the yellow Enzo with the Dalvins on
In my bulletproof Ac', who you stylin? on
When the sun is gone, and the wolves come out
You coward ass niggaz bring your jewelry out

Shit, niggaz is hungry, I ain't nobody chicken
I think a screw is missin?, I'm pimpin?, I'm livin?
Nice with the dice, deuce-deuce six'n

Look how the game change, bad for the system
Niggaz on game shows, two dudes kissin?
Listen, we're not the same, we're not for fame
The industry's punked out, we're not to blame

These niggaz been perpetratin? so long
If they can make it rain, I can make it storm
He's makin? a scene but I can make him calm
I just got a N.B. that'll break a arm

I f**k when I want, I do what I like
She want the same shit I want, the bitch is a dike
She a super freak, the freak of the week
I give her something a suck, she give her something to eat
It never enough, she like it rough
We keep it going and we switch positions, listen

I need a dollar for every time that my heart beat
Now how much it that
I can breath on a track and make money, ha ha
Now how much is that
I'm getting money baby, my truck a Lamborghini
I'm in Ali B-B, where the girls are freaky
Haters wanna be me, hoes glad to see me
Ma I love it when you lie and say my eyes are dreamy
I'm in the club frontin', I'm in the club stuntin'
10 Grand to buy the bar, Ma it ain't nothing

If home girl wit it, I'm get it, hit it, split it
She'll think about me everyday, hour, minute
Second to nobody, baby check it
You look as good as your chess
And when your neck it, I'm ready to fuck
A little head in the truck
If a turn gang good, I'ma let her come up
When the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town
Stash box down, put the magnum down
I'm with G-Unit,
Nigga you not ballin' a the G 2 jet

She got a nigga on the count down
Waitin' on it like... Three, two, one
Yea right now
You got skills on them high heels
When we leave this club, I'm take you were I live
Do me before I get her
I might eat out depending on how I feel
Baby girl got a thing for me
She do what every I say
And I ain't got to make it rain money
Go getta and she ghetto with it
Told shawty don't do it, but she already did it
I'm all on her back, when she move like that
You can find me where every she at

Said she found all that crack under her couches

That glock was pumpin', paper comin', how can niggas chill?
Barrel (?) gold teeth, put gold all in my grill
Shoot out shit, I rob your bitch, I use her as a shield
Shit look at the wheels, whooo, look at the wheels

Bullshit you about, front, them rugers out
Face the sword, no risk, no reward

Price you can't afford, white man at your courts

Say you'll never be a winner, show up at your parade
Outside showing you smiles, inside hoping it fades
Rather be low now, money over the stage
Sanity over fame, eye-candy calling your name
But it changes, their love is dangerous
Fog up your aim, there's a million ways to hit them cages
Shit's contagious, forget my favors

And the snakes in the grass ain't a part of my plan

Trouble can't ignore me, I was born to ball
Fuck is up? I'm one of one, I need a custom cut
Hear the summer come, I want the number one
Bitch, walk in with a freak behind me
Shades damn near to the sticks, Gianni
Too nights and no repeating, mami
I'm guttered up, my streets define me
Now drop your ass to the floor, here to be more
Rob me I'll make a detour, robbery how I get to her
Probably want out like I knew her, I done got colder
Chip on my shoulder, head when I sit in the Rover
Bought me a zipper of the odor, phone numbers slid in the folder
Bullshitting how? Show you my pimping diploma

I do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own money
I just do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own house
I do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own car
I just do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown, I'm grown

Brought an Audemar for when times was hard
Nine calls for the Nine Ward
Mardi Gras, take your top off
I'm a nasty nigga, might slide and roll
Fly your girl out to Miami
Sent her back home like they done LeBron
I ain't tripping if you ain't tripping, party hard 'till he calls the law
Got my own house so I can throw you out
I got my own blood so I ain't putting it out
This is my car and I can smoke it out
Got my own money and like four accounts
Bought my own bottles so I can pour it out
Got my own shooters and they scoping out
Bought my bitch an ass, now it's poking out
If she throw it back then I'mma throw her out
My condo money don't fold out, wild all out
Hoes out, let's roll out, funeral when I go south
Girl, your mouth got the kind of brain I don't know about
I never changed, I'm so South, big chains and a gold mouth
I'm grown now

I do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own money
I just do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own house
I do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own car
I just do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown, I'm grown

I do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own money
I just do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own house
I do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown

Before I fall any deeper

I'm a little more careful perhaps it shows
But if I lose the highs at least I'm spared the lows

To feel my spirit calm

No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it, ""at the mall""

Yo what the deal cousin, gave him a pound now we huggin
In the mall thugging, bugging, spent a few hundred
Shorties must be loving, shit, jigg to my Wallow's
They watch like Movado so I floss like I'm lotto
You ain't lounging, til you've been counting by the thousands
Profiling, pushing more weight than your medallion
We be wilding, locking blocks down just like the Island
Dough piling, we keeps it in the family like Italians
Balling, cop some Charles Jordan and some icebergs
Ice herbs, nice curves, girlfriend with the white fur
Pushed up, feel her like some shots of Tequila
Said her man's a dealer, with all these bags from Antilla
He got to be, but you hot to me, you under lock and key?
Laid it down properly, this cat at Stern's watching me
Moved on me sloppily, prepare for the fallout
With gats to blow the wall out, clear the mall out

Make money money, go shopping!
Take money money, go shopping!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it, ""at the mall""
Make money money, go shopping!

No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it, ""at the mall""

Yo, don't be mad at me, I used to be
King Raggedy, fiends nagging me, shit I had to breathe
Gradually, rocked casually, Sha passed the leave
Vaseline slick shit, green stick shit
Honey got some mean lipstick, my knot's this thick
And I cop the meanest shit, still ride DISCUS
But cops frisk us, the block whispers
Theft need to stop, how we cop
But you can Guess like them jeans you rock
For now I'm rolling right, cause I had four faces
Fighting four cases in ?North face? of Dolomite
So if he's here I ace the toners out my holding tight
Shorty looking innocent there, in Benetton gear
Nothing innocent here, this henneson gear
Give us a year, to really see clear, through these Cartiers
And do it party yea is what I'll probably hear
Sharkskin is what I'll probably wear, designed by Pierre, trust me
And look lovely with it
Cop a 4.2 and get ugly with it, snugly fitted, ruggedly hitting
Fitted in my Coogi knitted, compliments on the doobie did it
Got the movie rented if the crew be with it yo

Make money money, go shopping!
Take money money, go shopping!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it, ""at the mall""

Most times I'm casual, but easily I switch
To some fly shit, like some silk suits by Paul Smith
And purchase some kicks by Kenneth Cole
Cop a Hilfiger, or Polo goose, for when it's cold
Armani, and Gaultier specs cover my eyes
The definition of jiggy so you best to recognize
At the mall, I'm bagging up, much more than gear
Victoria, be whispering mad Secrets in my ear
She wanted me to knock her in the back of Foot Locker
I chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer
Others try to copy, I see em when they mock me
Baseball cap bent, the fresh scent is ?seemiyaka?
All the way from Green Acre's to the Beverly Center
Heads turn, and I'm the main concern when I enter
At Albee Square, niggas wouldn't even dare
With that fake thuggish ruggish when them Brooklyn kids be in there
Saw newriqi L and then a sweet for my girl
Styling, on the cell phone smilin, it's my world
Can't forget the Avorex, pocket for the royalty checks
My crew be showing loyalty, plus utmost respect
Yo son, go pioneer them bimbos, while I get some Timbo's
Later on that night you'll find them nymphos
That's how it goes cause mad heads be in the mall
Let's breeze, we got a show, plus I got another phone call",The Mall,1998

G. Dep,"There's times in my life where I just
I just wanna run away, I just
I just wish the pain would stop
I don't wanna cry no more
I wish the pain would go away

Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal
Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet
Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit
Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough
From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain
One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain
Twenty-three years, three when it happened
Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears
Then my mood switch, thinkin' about this sheisty bitch
Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin' you honey
On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich
That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money
Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin' the grief
Baby moms starts sexin', my so-called beef
Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven
Or relievin' your breathin', long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin'
Pain

I wish this pain, would go away
We're talkin about the kind of pain that
I wish this pain, would go away
Just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone

I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate
Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate
Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone
Cause of a fuckin' chain on?
Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger
And I'm hopin' I don't know the cat with the dagger
Penetratin' my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief
To the City College deceased may you rest in peace
To the families, I never meant to cause no pain
I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame
Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains
Now it seems like I'm goin insane
For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news
But before my shit drops, I stand accused
Don't you think I wish we all was rich?
One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball
The pain..

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna give no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna receive no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
God, please take the pain away

I can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin'
On my knees cryin' and prayin', then I said
""God why?  Got to know how hard we try
Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead""
But it was too late, California sealed his fate
Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now
Wish I could die, I could fly
If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?
That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening three
With platinum wings and said, ""Puff listen to me""
He puts his hands on my head and said ""I live through you
Make hits continuous, this is what we do
I know it might be strenuous and times is hard
Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God
Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids""

I'm tellin' you man
Now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God
I don't give a fuck who it is
Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big
Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints
Man fuck these niggaz man
Fuck these niggaz man
And I'ma tell the same thing to you
When you get your shit done, watch your money, and
Hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit
And soon motherfuckers start screamin' your name out

Never take your eyes off that shit yo
Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo

Buy the cassette, rewind it to death

How I rock shit from N.Y. to Tibet
You got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt
You lost when you nodded your neck
Through the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect
Take the voice that you try to project, check
Darin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz

Come on and get some of our gun craps
I'll straighten out the nigga now
When I snap, make your chest cavity collapse
When I glide the entire map
With the frequent four alarm fire, rap straight up
Put weight down, fuck around, you ate up

How many nigga's think they fuckin' with mines
A nigga God blessed with such an undeniable shine
I hope you know there's nothin' fresher
The manifester apply the pressure
Tie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester
Now fix your fuckin' face up
Empty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw
Everybody hit the fuckin' floor
Only the real mother fuckers belong
I hope nigga's don't end the party before we finish the song

You be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past

Vacate places you don't even need shoes

No one where my bitch live
Plot where I lay up

Splurge something
Now I don't care who I hit
It's who I hit I knew I hit
Who would understand though?
We vandals and land roles
Program for our own channels
And flannel; this man knew any clan
We're here for the cats in the minivan
Got let this schemey plan
Pay me man, scan
Sex, cars, any money
Sex guard the money
With this gun; it be hard to run me
Get it right, or get it tonight
Better tonight
Set up your wife with the head of the night
Don't fold 'cause my goals embedded with ice
To my tents dimming the light
I'm bendin' this mic
Lot of niggas don't comprehend
Lots niggas look sloppy when
They don't see me, and I see them

Then sit on me, that's what I'ma spit filthy
Pretty swiftly, 'til them coppers come and get me
Tried to tell his coward ass it's real

Actin like I can't get through that Slomen Shield
I'm a veteran, I'll take leathers and furs in front of him
Safe cracker, moved from New York to Jers
Still sending [unverifed] kites with birds [unverified]

Nothin's heard, feds wanna tap my word
Take vehicles off curbs, tools off herbs
Jewels off of all you nerds
You swerve, I splurge with all y'all riches

Black wagon, bait boy I'm not braggin'
It's a promise, I'll take em to school like Nostradamus

It's my thing do what I do best
Want the treasure chest, and that dough in your girl breasts
How dare you try to stash yours in your drawls
What's mines is mines, what's yours ain't yours

Get his whip, watch how quickly I paint yours
Watch poppi and them, hit it up with the paint balls
Coward niggas, got the gall, thinkin' I won't lamp in the hall

These cats think they know me Black
Well I hit em over the head and say, ""Homey don't play that""
Listen to they rhymes and say didn't I say that?
Damn, I'm the shit, it's like I'ma nigga they be bitin' my dick

Crowd up around why'all listen to the sound
Yo, this is for the way we rock
Thinkin' Bad Boy gonna stop, we not
Yo, we step up in the scene like oh!
You hear their flow and then there they go
In the Range Ro' see the ringers go blind
There the brain go every single time
Put it in perspective, reflection in step
Step to the left while I rep it to the death
Easily approached, smokin' on the roach in coach
til I'm so high I'm on another plane
Hey, every fucking spot we go, we just rock you see now we know
Fuckin' news cameras they want to get the footage
want to grind out find out where my hood is
Let's just say that this is how we put it, down
why'all niggas cool out and lounge
Fuck around, radios down this
Say we go round this bullshit straight to the plate

G. Dep,"A yo, I walk down the block with my stomach in knots
Spent time hustling, running from cops
Broke as a joke, no ends at all
Can't play ball and my Timbs is small
Can't buy trees with government cheese
I rather be where its breeze, niggas bubbling ki's
My moms got two jobs one on her knees
and writin letters to the governor ""Please call off the deeds""
My baby mother with another brother with cash
and drive by roll down the window and laugh
I solve all my problems with indo and hash
Bought my daughter a Nintendo now she calling it Dad
My landlord's a jerk, the water don't work
My little sister twelve and she bought her own skirt
Rather do Kirk than do her homework
Talk blunts and boys and she'll jump for joy
Shit's twisted, opportunity not but I missed it
Out in the park gettin lifted
So now I'm sittin here shit out of luck without a buck
and it don't make a difference

So do you hear me?
'Cause if you don't I'll come up close and say it clearly
I got to know I got to go
I strive for my pay each and every way
but this type of shit it happens everyday

It's like I'm trapped in a maze walk around in a daze
I won't rest 'til I'm paid or I'm down in my grave
I want to look tough, but my sneakers is scuffed
Everyday pants in the week is enough
I had a little money but it came and it went
Now its either pay the rent or stay in a tent
and it don't make sense how the shit is intense
and all you got up in your pocket is lint, you get the hint?
I had a cigarette for breakfast, just for beginners
Cried for my lunch and sleep for dinner
I tried to go to church, priest called me a sinner
He called me everything except for a winner
I'm walking in the rain wishing things would change
It ain't a game, mad I pawned all the rings and chains
Emotionally scarred form losing my job
Pass the nod nigga, times is hard

[CHORUS]
So do you hear me?
'Cause if you don't I'll come up close and say it clearly
I got to know, I got to go
I strive for my pay each and every way
but this type of shit it happens everyday
Now would you check me?
If I was you and you was me, would you respect me?
I got to know I got to go
I strive for my pay each and every way
but this type of shit it happens everyday

I ain't gonna front, all I want is a blunt
a pair of blue and yellow dunks and my hundreds in chunks
But, people see me, put they purse to the front
I'm waking up early on the first of the month
Honeys don't respect when you call 'em collect
and it's 25 cent you can call 'em direct
I put my life on the line I ain't making a dime
Nigga call me ""Never mind , man you're wastin' your time""
A yo, I'm livin' in the ghetto and I'm tryin' to survive
At the same time a nigga rolling by in a five
Can find a drive for a 9-5
It's like I only get by when I'm feeling the high
And I ain't got no smoke, the elevator broke
I'm at the end of my rope tryin to find a way to cope
I'm sipping on Gin thinking how I could win
I don't know where it begins but this is where it could end

Regardless of the wait i'm gonna stay straight ghetto
Everybody high, don't nobody say hello
Even when the sunshining it ain't yellow
Get out of the borough
If you know it ain't thorough
Niggas play ball, AWOL, on the furlow
Still came down on the furl and pumped hero
Red and grey Macs
Keep it clean as Ajax
Ghettos sling cracks
While you niggas pay tax
Now how ghetto is this
you can catch me in your hallway taking a piss
One hand on my dick one hand on a spliff
Burnt lips from the roach clip, yellow tips
If we ain't closed it I get ferocious
Know this whole shit will leave me in them roaches
In your car motion I cause commotion
And i probably need some lotion
But i don't get fucked

Won't stop for a minute cops telling you hawk
Fake guards telling you pork
Settle for shorts
Running from court
New ports, criminal thoughts
On the blocks bodies acourt
Nobody supports

It's a ghetto nigga thorough niggas that get cake
Five boroughs of niggaz do his ? a ? flip weight
Change garments to trick Jake, you dis jake
I want it yo I got warrants in six states
They come in a stolen whip with switched plates
Stickers hate I never leave a bread to trace
Only evidence I leave is hickies on chicks' face
In the corner with the crooked niggas
But yo shit's straight
We start war to leave with these seven revolvers
Sell case never test the floor
Sticky yank slicking enough why'all
I'm a man enough to put on a dress
To creep up like grand-moma and bust why'all
Get close enough to part your vest and tux off
Who would have thought the lady with the car would crush why'all
Too smart to get caught
But I got fam up north
So if they put me in coughs
I'll call fuck why'all

Knock back the hammer smell the
Pop that cantelope
For the venom in my python spit
It ain't no antidote
Jackpot from crack blocks
I was a man of dope
Snapshots to get your camera broke
You hoes used to plan a gross
With the hands toast
Close and stand opposed
Rubber bands she knows
Grams of the coke
Razor blade tuck the side the line
The banter of the coke
Watching niggas die with my hand on their doe
Singing with the bass
And wash up the ?land? when they float
Choking on your own words
Should have watched the ground when you spoke
One last final approach
Make your whole family ghost
Bust bottles of cham and and we toast
Till your photo stamped in the post
Sex gland cut off jammed in you're throat
Man are you gross
Bitch hanging from the lampost
We shoot from up close
Blow canners the most
Catch an overdose

Love what, do it for the lust
Trust, its never to much
Got to get the money in my clutch
Case close shut
Split a nigga gut
Right through the middle like a dutch
Never did like them much, my man
Gather up the artillery
You feelin' me?
What gives, trying to live its killing me
Its all about the whips
Chicks with the hips
Running the number hole, take the chips, ya slips?

And what I gotta do to get big

Its all a nigga need, indeed
Seems I was the seed in greed
Born in bullshit
Guns was four-cliped
Finding my self where's nuns and poor pits
Bring it
Step on streets and get to slingin
I'm about to make it hot like piss
Been hungry before but not like this
If lifes a bitch
She needs to get cookin
And cause that fools to get jewels and shit tookin
Baby need milk
When I do it up I need silk
Scales on tilt
That's how a nigga built
I need my money torn like wealth on stilts
Niggas fuck around and get a nigga kilt

Know why, I'm the antonym of rich consimamon of poor
How could you think of winning on the floor
Your not sure, take the game and went shopping
Your not pure, took the shot for
A penny for your thought, a nickle for a kiss
Well I ain't got a nickle for ya miss
I'm all up in a twist
Fuck all the glamor and the gliss
I'ma hop and skip
Put a slammer in the mix
Till ya is or ya here, the hammer gonna click, clack
Causing you to yelp ""GET BACK""!
I want the cake
The early American china plate
The meeting out of drapes
And bottles of Alizae
So I can put my hoes on Surgio Valitain
Hey, smile and say

Come here man, You lookin for beef [smacking sound]
Get the fuck over, yea
You thought I wasn't, yea hehehehe
Yea look at me, look at me nigga
Come here, know one thing nigga

[Verse 1: G-Dep]
I think you need to know I'm holdin it down
Wit a hole in this town
It's a hole in da ground, where I stomp
Got these niggaz steady on the watch
Like it's Teddy on da block
If your ready or your not here I come
Nigga you can run you can hide
You can dip you can slide
You can duck you can ride you can flee
I give a nigga, one test now it's one less
That's how easily you can be eliminated
Program to scan rock jams
Get down from where I stand to Scotland
Dustin like Hothman
If that'll stop what you got planned the shot's ?
Ask your man, ask your girl, ask your crew
I'm hittin high, I'm hittin low what a nigga have to do
You want drama I'm a have to act a fool
Had to laugh at the aftermath now I'm after you and

[Chorus: G-Dep]
One way or another I'm a find ya
And I'm a getch ya, getch ya, getch ya, getch ya
One day maybe next week, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna getch ya, getch ya unngghh

Cowardest cats, names don't ring no bell
Been grabbin niggaz up by they coat ?
Coke rhyme but It's dope as hell
Nigga four tooth the ?
Still had to broke in jail
Wit a parole hold just the systems so cold
Had me thinkin under pressure that this kid won't fold
When the feds came in extremely vocal, ain't stutta
Shoutin out my ? name and my social
Wasn't to hard to find I stay local
If I would of known you was sinkin I would of bin by coastals
See I'm a do what I'm supposed to
Even if I gotta dress up and knock on your door like I'm the postal
Your ass is grass and that's that
Better strap up your vest and that's that
Come through wit ski masks and black ?
With the boomshack with the crack crack fuckin rat nigga

[Chorus: G-Dep]
[Verse 3: G-Dep]
Just when you thought it was over
But that ain't the code of a soldier look over your shoulder
Came through low in the rover knowin ya nova
Trouble was seen then see trouble was me
Double your speed, punch through metal fa sure
I got the metal in store, whatch you medallin for
I used to boost pedals ?
NowI'm ? vocal peddal the four let this settle the score
Now check it
Won't have to rest to switch hands and
Six mill-e-on ree-sons you should switch plans
It a happened all too fast to ? fans
Like a wind brass, shoot glass, shit sand
Thinking it would all sink in like quicksand
But, this is why I direct the shit and
Cut now it's done, what now it's won
Like the Wild Wild West it's Dep and ?

First off, how you gon' come off
All this rap shit, get done off
Man listen this a passionate mind
I come through, gun drew splashin a rhyme
Wet dat, dead dat, cash on the line
In an orderly fashion in the back'a the line
Can't talk now, I got cash on tha mind
Bitches and dolla signs dance in they mind
I love dat doe, but y'all niggas love dat flow
Man I don't love dat hoe
All I see is cash flow
Brains an occasional ass hole
What I need is a, whole lotta money involved
I might run into Rob and run in ya job
Real cats take chances
Then I make ya +head spin+ like +break dancers+

[Chorus]
My niggas in the front don't front
My niggas in the back, where you at
My niggas on the side, bout to slide
My niggas in the middle we rock just a little
Then we ride, the ride

My bitches in the front don't front
My bitches in the back, where you at
My bitches on the side, bout to slide
My bitches in the middle we rock just a little
Then we ride, the ride

[Verse 2]
If raps don't work, need ta put some in
I hear y'all knockin' but ya can't come in
Said I'd get cha, wrote the scripture
Chick roastin like motion picture
Have you any idea, how many nice MC's
And how many I feared - None
Just trust me son, I do what must be done
And I just begun, I let em-
Count sheep, rock em to sleep
Got me, cocking the heat, poppin a Jeep
Let's go, Expo top of the line
Exo, Yes ho, hoppin in mine, I got a-
Big Bad Boy you could meet
Men use beef and its all you can eat, I be the-
Dep with a G in the front
Front, fuck around and be in a trunk

[Verse 3]
Ain't no games if you're curious be	
Can't be serious G, seriously, I'm out ta-
Put a big hole in the joint
Like I, sold her the joint, told her to point, its like-
Mind over matter with this
Mad Hatter with this, battle with this
Like a +sentence+, it just +run-on+
I'm pro and you a princess, come on
y'all ain't ready, ain't crazy and ya name ain't Eddie
And ya aim ain't steady
Dream big boy but ya chain ain't heavy
Brain ain't ready, my game ain't petty
Must be stupid or somethin'
Thinkin' this all love like Cupid or somethin'
Live from the 2-1-2
One question: What you gon' do?

G. Dep,"[Verse 1]
Yo, this for my niggas, though, special delivery
Spit like this, get my wrists all glittery
Get cake, snakes get slithery
Lean in, show why'all the meaning of chivalry
Rap ruler, you could ask Buddha
Right jab like Zab Zuda
Every member on my team is the shooter
Tight like a womb, no room for intruders
Spark Buddha, twistin' the Philly
And Good Humor, don't be silly
It's gravy baby, I got it all smothered
Like makeup, I got it all covered
Want a jewel, don't be cruel
It's authentic, don't be fooled
By these phony accusations
Backlash and slanders
Front, and they put pits in ya
Stunts and propaganda
Keep it private, 'cause I'm the commander
In chief, I never stop like beef
Gimme a break, I might shake the building place
Say vacate all women and children

If you ain't ready, I'ma bust through ya curtain
Encore, you're not sure, I'm certain
Wait, make sure the mic workin'
Make cake, sorta like Earth Wind
And Fire, the rap vampire
Retire in the morn'
Warm like campfires
Matter of fact, I'm blazin'
Raisin' the roof up
Slide off with ya rooster
Took her to the stu and seduced her
Let her do a skit, then she hit my producer (Oh)
Not whatcha used to, I'm looser
Ya need to stop fuckin' with them losers, now who's up
The mystic ruler, grand imperial
Filthy, but milky like cereal
Bang this in ya stereo
MC's is dead and I'ma get head up at they burial
And that's disrespectful
I'm strong like Exo mixed with X, yo
And that's the high capability
And yes, I possess that ability

Spit that bar, car low mileagin'

Gimme two hands, few grams and the shaker
Hit the block, watch the kids bake up

Then I'ma take her to Jamaica
And I give her a reason to get curious
But ya pain, it ain't that serious

Shak, shak, right in his back

From even, a tire that snap, I'm light in the sack
I tell you how I feel and that's part of the deal
I'm like, Seagal with the steel but ""Harder to Kill""

Won't be a second we won't; they lettin me go

Niggaz rock the heaters, my clique rocked Adidas
Didn't know the blocks were where the spots would lead us

Waited years to get a premier and did it from here

Take you back to the 80's around
Polo Grounds, Uptown, eight-eighty a pound
Niggaz hit the rooftop, y'all was roofin the rocks
Other niggaz shoe tops, only youth on the block
You dig me - movin in tops and movin these rocks

Ninety-one we got guns, ninety-two it was dough

I can get lost and sit back living off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you acting like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, making my mark on Harlem like Poe did
I said, here's your eviction notice
But you probably already know this
I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV
or pick up your CD, P.D.

[G. Dep]
This is gruesome
Niggas always grab that mic and salt like they really gon' do some'
What's wrong with you son?
Oh you got a new gun, do you know how to use one?
Then you living an illusion, living in a used one
while I'm in the Limited, cruising
You ain't really got a crew son
You giving them amusement, fuck what your Comic Views meant
You's a smoke head
I've been doing this since this Pro-Ked
Broke breads with the cokeheads
Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped
I said, I'm a ""Top Gun"" like Gossett
Run and get your CD and cass-ette
Gossip, lotta niggas got lip
But they ain't got hot yet 'til they got Dep

[Loon]
Why niggaz lie like that? Know they ain't fly like that
Niggaz get fried like that
And you don't want to die like that
Have your momma crying like that
Besides all that, I'm in to get it frying like that
Still on the block and move pies like that
Never my life dealt with guys that rap
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad
Swoll up, why y'all niggas better hold up
Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up
Body get ripped up, and then sewed up
Every nigga I fucked with, niggas is growed up
We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names
All we do is cock back, and spray planes
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang
Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang

[Black Rob]
Keep fronting, I'ma put a crease in your jaw
Might catch me squeezing the four
My nigga I go to war
And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store
why'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw
Predicate assassin, smashin
Open shit, rig scope, focus it
Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit)
Oppose the clique, I send five close to six
Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit
Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists
Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off
Fix your face, we back on the paper chase
Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place
Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that ain't notice
the breadwinner, three-six-five I stay focused nigga

We'll never stop..
One of the greatest teams that ever lived..
It's like in our blood..

G. Dep,"Yeah, check it out, uh yo

Yo, I was sittin' on the block with the deuce-deuce, the bubble goose
Nigga popped up in the blue Coupe, this nigga Moose
This nigga fishy, this nigga he stay pissy
Run up behind niggaz, the blizzy and get busy
I seen niggaz resent, some nigga wrist be broke over this coke
Or pocket full of crispy
Dollar bills make nigga swallow the steel
And most niggaz can't swallow a pill, know how that feel?
But back to the skit nigga, in back of the whip
With the windows half way down about to clap on some shit
And I'm rappin' and shit to this platinum chick
It was fucked up, I got shorty back of the whip
I'm paranoid but still got the gat and the clip
If them niggaz spit, I got to spit back at the whip
If it go down, shorty whole back'll get ripped
And that's low down, real life theatrical shit
So I grabbed shorty hand, took a couple of paces
Said some ""Hail Mary"" maintain my patience
Oh shit, this nigga spit four quick
I threw shorty down and let off the whole clip
Then reloaded but holdin' the whole whip
In broad day, so niggaz done witnessed the whole shit
Had to flee this shit is blasphemy
I took a couple of steps and the nigga blasted me
This nigga Moose got loose from the caboose
Ain't thinkin' about a truce, try to knock my dick loose
My deuce-deuce ain't fuckin' with Moose point forty
I try to save the chick but the nigga done lose shorty
Two to her gut, one to her chest, one to her head
Now shorty layin' puddles of red, fuck it I'm fed
I'm tryna figure was it somethin' I said
That got this dumb nigga bustin' out lead, discussion is dead
I understand this man, he got a cannon in his hand
The sound alone, this shit is bananas
My one plan was to hit him and run fam
But God saved my life, when he made his gun jam
Time to leave but he still tryna squeeze
Instead of tryna buy him some time on his knees
Nigga please, you got no reason to buck up
Knowin' that you 'bout to get shot the fuck up
Duke was brave but his stupid ways
Is the reason why I'm 'bout to twist Duke toupee
And I'ma squeezin' but the gun wouldn't shot no strays
Now we even but the nigga like six two, what would you do?
I'm 'bout to out fox this nigga
Son at one sixty-five, I'ma box this nigga
But what he don't know, Loon 'bout to ox this nigga
Hit him dead in his fuckin neck, when I chop this nigga
But thoughts in my mind, tellin' me let it slide
So I'ma get in my ride and catch Duke another time
Just circle the block smoke a purple of choc
This nigga heart stop, nigga died right on the spot
No bullshit, collapse right on the block
Crackheads went in his slacks, hit him right in his knot
Save me the trouble, now my phone on bubble (they comin' for you)
Feds tappin' my line, like nigga condone the trouble
Walk out my motherfuckin' home is a struggle
Fuck them pigs, I don't own no shovel

What the fuck
Now all that bullshit I done been through with this nigga
I ain't lay a single solitary motherfuckin' hand on this nigga
This nigga drops dead, these motherfuckers is all on my ass
Like I did somethin' to this nigga
Word to my mother, this shit is some real bullshit man
This nigga killed my motherfuckin' bitch
Now I'm runnin' around like motherfuckin' Harrison Ford
Like I'm some motherfuckin' ""Fugitive"" or somethin' man
This is some real bullshit man

Springtime is here, and the wind from the south
Blows strong and warm to clean out your house
The sun has arisen and the lies that were told are
Driven outside with the freezing cold
I can remember a spring just like this
I was 19 yrs. old
Now the time is sorely missed
The first year that I left my mother's house
Out to make my way in this world somehow

I can't believe how the times they have changed
All the dreams that came true still seem so far away
I remember the days sittin' on the front porch with
The sun beatin' down in my neighborhood

I'd sit out all night singin' songs to the moon
Or try and get some sweet honey back to my bedroom

My friends they were few but to me they were true
All we was trying to do was just to make it through
Always thought for the future, but we shouldn't have cared
All the best things in life we shared them right there

So to all those old friend God be with them
I wish, I wish I could see you again
In the same corner bar where it all started from
Dig your plow so deep now the stars have all gone
So wherever they shine may it be warm and bright

G. Love,"Everyone starts with the sweetest dreams
Living long life living beautiful scenes
Make a million dollars wearing gold and jewels
Drive a big black Benz or a Caribbean cruise
Or maybe you dream that you just can't lose
Or playing blues is the path that you choose
Or perhaps your dream of going back to nature's plan
And just live off the land and be a natural man
Or of a beautiful girl who's holding your hand
Loving the one you're with, with her beautiful tan
Like you're holding the riff that laying in your hand
Or you dream of playing band from electric lady land
Riffs just like Jimi Hendrix

While they kick a bunch of crap that I forgot anyway
Educatin's important to make a man complete
But everything I learned in school
I learned again on the street

And when I walk on my path
You know I can't be shook
Stay alert in this day you have to go for yours
The force conspires to help brothers
That help others open doors
Wars and battles, rage round us everyday
While the real troops keep our heads up while we play

Can be quite a disappointing ride

To people all around the world who never heard of me
Just leave another message please
Lord please guide and protect me
I got the love in my heart 
I got fire in my soul
This no type of fire that nobody can control
But when I'm up on the mic
I got the mind overload
They never test me just because they don't rock and roll
I'm singing oh my God Lord have mercy
Thought fools were gettin bad 
But now they're even gettin worse see
Somethings can't be healed up by no doctors or no nurses
It's time to stop the fussin' and the fightin' and the cursin'
This world is hopeless,
But I love it anyway
That's why they givin all the good love for free
And if you need love, with your lovin are you brave?
Come on and give a little good love to me
That's what they want.

Darling darling I said now whered you go?
I said I'll never know, the way you come and go.
When all your moneys gone
Where will you be?
If your love is strong,
That's all you need.

It's a long long way from home but hold on.
It's a long it's a long long way but hold on.
It's a long it's a long long way but hold on.
It's a long it's a long long way but hold on.

And times sure have changed
Everybody's leaving town
Looking for better things
But I found what I want
And I got no problem working
I wish to god
That my heart would stop hurting

Factories outdated

Falling like leaves from the trees

Threw away the keys

And this town is where we're staying
I'll never ever turn my back
On you ever again
Come on let's be together
I got some money put aside
And if I make it big
Would you take a little ride
Would you promise to always
Stay by my side
would you give me true love
And have nothing to hide

Would you give my your love
Would you give me your love
Would you give me your love

I knew I had to have you
I just wanted you to call
Me your bad boy baby blue
I'm so glad I'll be loving you for ever
It's kind of clever how we ended
Up in this situation
We was working at the snack bar on my vacation admiration infatuation elation we were kickin it for the whole damn summer
From freinds
To best freinds
To part time lovers
Now you're moving in the first date of September
I can remmember when I saw you back in December
It was so cold outside
You was breakin up
And so was I and
Neither one of us wanted to give love a try
But we would talk, talk, laugh and have a ball
But then we got drunk and fooled around and had a booty call
A booty call
Ain't nuthin wrong with a bootycall
Everybody like a bootycall
Now and then
Sing
I can tell that were gonna be freinds
I can tell that were gonna be freinds

now were getting serious
Living together
We've had our ups and downs
But you know that we'd whether the storm
And if we ever had some fights they always ended up in the
Quiet storm, warm in the bedroom
A lil bit of heat
And alittle bit of spice
But no 2 people got along all the time alright
So lets stick together like the Al Green song
Cause you always do make me fell brand new
And ill always be lovin you my baby boo
And only do I think that your sexy as hell,
But your independent, strong willed, hard workin
And I liked cha
You like to step up to the party and
Get down on the dance floor like nobodys business
The finest fish in the whole damn sea swimming with me
Skinny dippin
With me road tripin with me
But know she flippin on me yeah
And I'm gonna tell you that that ain't all
She like to get freaky and fool around and have a booty call
Ain't nothing wrong with the booty call
And do you people want a booty call
Everybody need a booty call
Now and then
Hey babby you know I get off in a bought ten minutes you think you and I can hook up after the show
Sing

And this is how we do it

So why would you ruin it
So you thought that G was all washed up
But the ring around the collar is so damn tough
You know I'm not the type of brutha like enoughs enough
And what you want to start something
When you start it all
See I flow like the breeze
Right down the road
Mind my own biz you I find my mother load
I'm getting paid in the shade
For the words that I say
With the rules that I play
For the moves that I make
Its amazing just like the boy
Peter paker sink white as a cloud my souls deep
And deep gets my stuff
The deep that you did
The best tasting water in the bottom of the well
Raining like a thunderstorm
And you about to get wet cause the heat is on
Coming up
Coming on
Coming on (x3)
I'm coming up
I'm coming on

I got the blues brother
Like
I smoke a lotta weed
But it don't get paranoid
Don't freak
I got the flavors like lemonade
My stock is steady rising like I'm on etrade
I don't date a girl with the thunder thighs
I got the mai tai special with the light brown eyes
To make the bread you must have the rise
It pays it pays to adverstise
But I won't shove my shit right down your throat
And if you like my freestyle then check out what I wrote

So please don't pick my brain
Tongue twister try to stump me
So I broke the chain
Breaka breaka one-nine
You know my cover is blown
So lets fire up this joint on the microphone
See I rock the party hard but the party won't break
Said the neighbors were cool but you made a mistake
Damn the cops are coming I'm running out the back door
Jump over the fence you never see me no more

But I can't get you off my mind

With my eyes on the prize
Just sitting round strummin' guitar
Wasting time.
Now I'm fish in the water
Swimming all the seven seas
Lots of people throw their nets
But they can't catch me
And I know if things go my way
It just a matter of time
So nothing left for me to do
But stay like the altitude and get high, so high.
My fingers sticky like Spiderman,
And here's a quintessential part of my master plan.
Stay blue like the sky
And if my luck changes
It's about that time.
And I know if thing goes my way
It might not be too soon
So nothing left to do but jam
An afternoon on the stoop
While my foot stomps a loop
And the whole world revolves

Problem solved.
And I know that if things go my way
Well it's about that time
So let me rise like the sun
And just shine go for mine.
Rewind and playback another funky hot track
Cause my record consoles
Stacked with ten sides cause I'm like that.
Lemonade I'm drinking
Sinking into this music
Like some country blues,
Ethiopians,
Abyssinians grooves puts me in the state of mind now
I'm zoning.
Check the phone off the hook
And cook some Thai noodles for you

*and I'm going where the summer never ends
Yes I'm going where the summer never ends

And I know if I play my cards right
I'll get some loving tonight
That's why I chilled the wine
And put the glasses on ice
And put the baby boo boo to bed,
Yeah,
Lay your head
And I know if the last summer sun
Sets pink tonight and the stars come out
And the vibes all right
It's just a lil daydream
But I really can't pretend
And I hope someday I find a place
Where summer never ends.

Loving Me Lyrics
Artist(Band):G. Love & Special Sauce Review The Song (0)

Will you let me know
If I have done you wrong today?
Cause you won't say nothing to me
And I can't help feeling that you're mad

I can't fight you anymore
I forgot what I'm fighting for
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad

Shall this moment of unsurity pass
Would you speak kind words to me
All that I'm saying is, ""Please treat me nice""
And I promise I won't do no wrong

Ohhh won't you let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad

If you have plans to leave me girl
Won't you just let me know?
Cause you finally got me loving you
And now you wanna let me go

I feel like I could explode
Won't you help to ease the load?
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad



",Loving Me,2004
G. Love,"Well now okay, you want to run me out, run me down
But I heard, you're concerned
Baby that you going down
Gettin' down while I'm gonna roll out of town
Rumors flyin', people lyin'
I'm just tryin', tryin' to keep my head up off the ground
Oh yeah

It's getting harder and harder
I check my pride but you runnin' high
With some other guy and I'm about to die
Tellin' lies, runnin' and cheatin'
And doin' what you please
And no one was surprised
The only thing you need me for is the money

And now I'm so damn confused
Cause even though I paid my dues
Ain't no matter what I do I'm gonna lose
Cause you stone me, stone me, stone me

And now we known each other so long
How we're goin' on and on
I wish I was never gonna be alone
So long, I was dead wrong
Cause you're moving on with your life
Left me in your past, you're past
You're with some other guy
You used to make me high
But now you just stone me
I thought we was in love and now you say
You rollin' holy, left me living lonely
Mmm, what about our son

You have your own child
What you wanna run around
Baby you a wild child
Play on, play on
She get to play on, play on

Then you come a runnin' back
Workin' hard, all alone, too late
Baby I am solo
You hurt me so bad, it took me so long to rise
But baby I survived
Now I don't even wanna see your eyes
You stone me
You hurt me so bad, it took me so long to rise

All my lyrics just bust
Into this new day
Like I was busting a nut
Ohh feels so good
Rising up the ""mornin-ornin"" (morning)
I just got on the radio
It's a positive moment
It's something like
Just the perfect moon
Sonic the waves glaze
For days
In the sunlight haze
I feel good to be alive
All the shit that beat me down
Been doing this
I still survive
It ain't at all complicated
I'm glad I found ya
It's when you open your heart
That love surrounds you

Mmmmmm yeah baby
Mmmmmm aint that right.

I wont live my life
By any rules or regulation
Walk the road less traveled
Stay away from aggravation
As I assure
Like ???
A good time to ride the vibe
So we could all get nice

You want some advice
Stay on the hustle
Do it once
And get it right
I don't just walk
I'll take a hike
'Cause every day's an expedition
I don't just run
I'll take a bike
And put myself into position
Take the car, take a bus, take a train
Rock it with precision
I'm decisive like decision
But yo
I'm only human
And I have my doubts
I wanna know where I fit it
And what this world is all about
It seems when I had my song
That learning was love
Love is what I'm teachin'
So let me show you some

Mmmmmm yeah baby
Mmmmmm aint that right.

Send me sweet kisses darling
I'm a catch them before they fall
Ain't nobody's business
What we do
Ain't nobody's business at all
Ooh not at all
They say that love is all you need to heal your wounds
And not be consumed by the everyday evils the man do
It's just one of those moments that feels too good to be true
When I look in your eyes are you feeling love too?
No fear
No worry
No doubt
No concern
Just the brightest light
And let it burn
I said damn it feels good to hold your hand
Love's the simplest thing
And now I start to understand
It ain't at all complicated
I'm glad I found ya
It's when you open your heart that love surrounds ya
Mmmmmm yeah baby
Mmmmmm ain't that right.
Send me sweet kisses darling
I'm a catch them before they fall
Ain't nobody's business
What we do
Ain't nobody's business at all

Look me in the eye, smile, like you did the very first time I called your name

Hey ma you know that your looking kinda fine, maybe you and I should?

One day these could be the days but who could have known
Loading in the back of a pickup truck
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck
Singing songs loud on the way to the game
Wishing all the things could still be the same
Chinese home runs over the backstop
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
Ain't nothing gonna change, there's no need to complain

Sunday morning and it's time to go
Been raining all night so everybody knows
Over to the field for tackle football
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring
Keep on rolling, never boring
Karma, karma, karma chameleon
We're talking kinda funny from helium

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
Ain't nothing gonna change, there's no need to complain

Monday morning and it's time to go
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues
Like driving a paddle with a burnt-out fuse
My best friend Kimmy wants to go with you
So meet her by the sugar mill after school
My best friend Kimmy wants to go with you
So meet her by the sugar mill after school

I knew I had to have you

Up in this situation
We was working at the snack bar on my vacation admiration infatuation elation we were kickin it for the whole damn summer
From freinds
To best freinds
To part time lovers
Now you're moving in the first date of September
I can remmember when I saw you back in December
It was so cold outside
You was breakin up
And so was I and
Neither one of us wanted to give love a try
But we would talk, talk, laugh and have a ball
But then we got drunk and fooled around and had a booty call
A booty call
Ain't nuthin wrong with a bootycall
Everybody like a bootycall

I can tell that were gonna be freinds
I can tell that were gonna be freinds

now were getting serious
Living together
We've had our ups and downs
But you know that we'd whether the storm
And if we ever had some fights they always ended up in the
Quiet storm, warm in the bedroom
A lil bit of heat
And alittle bit of spice
But no 2 people got along all the time alright
So lets stick together like the Al Green song
Cause you always do make me fell brand new
And ill always be lovin you my baby boo
And only do I think that your sexy as hell,
But your independent, strong willed, hard workin
And I liked cha
You like to step up to the party and
Get down on the dance floor like nobodys business
The finest fish in the whole damn sea swimming with me
Skinny dippin
With me road tripin with me
But know she flippin on me yeah
And I'm gonna tell you that that ain't all
She like to get freaky and fool around and have a booty call

From where I departed since then I started

Like you lost a twenty dollar bill
You got a free ticket from the scratch and win
Its like the swimsuit issue
Could I get a tissue?
It's like you and your baby got nasty cut off and left alone now making eyes

Just chill cuddy

It's those doggone kids ever since

Relighting the page as the joker pays
For the dare on the outside
Just chops I ain't impressed

It's too artificial man
I can't dig it I don't want affects

The things that I used to do
Lord I just won't do no more.
The things that I used to do
Lord I just won't do no more.
I use to sit up and hold your hand baby,
And cry... oh baby please do not go.

I would search all night for ya darlin
Lord knows my search would always be in vain
I would search all night for ya darlin
Lord knows my search would always be in vain
But I knew all along, that you was hid out with
Your other man.

I will send you back to your mother babe
Lord know I'll go back to my family too.
I will send you back to your mother babe
Lord know I'll go back to my family too.
Ain't nuthin I do will please ya girl,

Tears in my eye, low to the ground

Try and get slower, we been nowhere

You would leave me

Like twinkle soul

Is where to go

Baby you and me

Get with the roll

Here's a love song yeah

And I'm gonna sing it to you so slow

In your eardrum getting ready

All night long I rock steady

Always glowing like rudolphs nose at

Christmas time

Sure to glowin

Shining, undermining,

In your veins all in your mind

Upside you brain

Knock down deliver like hot tamales

I start to simmer

I ain't never gonna umm do them no

Lower than the ocean, swimmin in the

Sea

As a Philly cat
I'm with the roll
And the swing of my things
How they work like clockwork
Tick tock tick tock
Times aways lurking in your head
Got to go to work and get fed
That man didn't eat but he goes to sleep
Gets up at dawn not to see the sunrise
But because it's too damn cold outside
Underneath the bridge they pump the city's bilge
Into the alley they sweet the city's filth
The flowers wilt the flowers wilt
Don't tell me about no game
Cause that is a man
And his family
Revolution family
Look at the family
Dig the family
They're living the wrong way
Can't get nothing
Don't get nothing all they wanted was
Something like a job, mercy mercy
But its robbed, mercy mercy
And there's so many street side
Beggars and disabled veterans
Glass-eyed and peddling
Drunk and just meddling
So you conclude it's their fault
They like the street they must like the asphalt
But that is man woman and children
The system has stalled shelter's home
That's not what I call it
I call it bad health
Some say help themselves
Yo if you you gots it
Everyone hundred people a dollar in change
Everyone hundred people a dollar in change
This ain't living
This ain't living
Oh no
You know it's rough, had enough fo holding a
Cup full of spare change
The doctor diagnosed me as a
Dome full of bad brains
So, toe to toe with employers
Cause they're telling me no
Hooked on prescription drugs
So I stay broke, I'd run away
But you can't run away from
Yourself or your health so
I deal with the cards that I'm dealt
Tweet-a-leet-leet
This morning bird sounding sweet
Though I sleep on the streets
I have a feeling I'm free
From society's hand picked hypocrisy
Mercy mercy don't give a damn for me
Mercy mercy now what am I going to eat
Peek through the windows of the restaurant
People eating caviar fifth bucks on lunch
A hand-me-down meal
Full of God knows what
Put it away in my gut
Quick and then I wonder
Why I'm sick, brick for brick
I know the city like my hand print
Just a pit in the gutter
Of a skid-row ditch
But I'll survive the pain
Let me know I'm alive
But I still feel that
This ain't living
Check my beat dig they rhythm
Me belly full but me hungry so I fill it
Once I start gaining taxes start taking
Cause the governments perfected funk faking
Breaking me down striking me down
What goes around comes around but
I keep rising seeing through the lies and
The surprise comes when I see myself

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Spring has sprung cause all it does is rain
Again outisde is dull walls as dull drive
The sea has called fog from the waters
City screams for suns and daughters
Owned by the nights
But they ain't all of that
Tainted cats freaks to roll
Cool in the packs
I'm in the basement mixing
Tripping off my lips and
Elixing my mind with the nightlife
Spring comes misting
Drunk and listening to AM radio
Remembering pump up the volume cause
I know I got it
The soul of speakers thought
I shed skins of old
When I'm taught by the older
Records that I caught I get fat
In my pad I'm not bad
Not smiling passing for time to take a while
Wasting from the wild as I walk to slide
I bring from inside from the center
Epicenter radius oval roll you smooth you
Mold you, I'm like that
Moon to sun to start this seed
Water drip drop drip drop
Your boggie ball your rubber ball
The smooth of a weathered wall
The cycles of the systems
The circles within them
I walk to slide
Walk the slide on the outside
Walk the mile on the in
Keep it clouds on the outside
Keep it cool on the in
Lost in the spin
The face folds to melt the mask
It's hard to get help when
You're coming from the down low
Growing to know the smooth
In change
I walk to slide
From the tombs I got tunes
Like the spoonful
House to groove French to groove
The falling sun
We've had our fun
The sunset came to still
Stays the same

Springtime is here, and the wind from the south
Blows strong and warm to clean out your house
The sun has arisen and the lies that were told are
Driven outside with the freezing cold
I can remember a spring just like this
I was 19 yrs. old
Now the time is sorely missed
The first year that I left my mother's house
Out to make my way in this world somehow

I can't believe how the times they have changed
All the dreams that came true still seem so far away
I remember the days sittin' on the front porch with
The sun beatin' down in my neighborhood

I'd sit out all night singin' songs to the moon
Or try and get some sweet honey back to my bedroom

My friends they were few but to me they were true
All we was trying to do was just to make it through
Always thought for the future, but we shouldn't have cared
All the best things in life we shared them right there

So to all those old friend God be with them
I wish, I wish I could see you again
In the same corner bar where it all started from
Dig your plow so deep now the stars have all gone
So wherever they shine may it be warm and bright
Out to ease my mind on this worried night
It all seemed so simple and good tidings I send
I'll never forget that one year that we spent

At winding me up
So that I can't release you see

I was on stage on my musical mission
Aiming at love of a godly kind
Til love's light shone out
Nearly making me blind

Birds of a feather

I've heard of loving leather
I've heard of loving one night
And writing love letters

Sometimes I want to get her

Sometimes love is better

And I've heard of love severed

There is no surprise
I can feel you over years
And many miles

Some never wait a night

Please let love breathe
You're the one I desire
I'm the one that you need

I could wait that long, but I don't think I might
Come on, give me love in the morning light

I'm going to love you soft and love you sweet
I can feel your heartbeat
Need your attention to get me started right

I'm going to wake you up with a kiss on the cheek
Come a little closer, open up to me
Good morning babe, good morning babe

open your eyes just a little bit
Good morning sunshine, I can't resist
Dreaming about you babe, all through the night
",Gimme Some Lovin',1999
G. Love & Special Sauce,"Baby we've been through a lot
And times sure have changed
Everybody's leaving town
Looking for better things
But I found what I want
And I got no problem working
I wish to god
That my heart would stop hurting
Shops closing down
Factories outdated
People so frustrated
My whole life is changing
Just trying to find some solid ground
A little house with a picket fence
How's that sound

Love is all I need
Love is all I need

I've seen tears that are
Falling like leaves from the trees
Houses boarded up and they
Threw away the keys
But this town is where we're born
And this town is where we're staying
I'll never ever turn my back
On you ever again
Come on let's be together
I got some money put aside
And if I make it big
Would you take a little ride
Would you promise to always
Stay by my side
Woudl you give me true love
And have nothing to hide
Would you give my your love
Would you give me your love
Would you give me your love
If you want to give me your love babe
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
We can make a change in our life babe
Tonight
It's alright
It's alright 
",Love,1999
G. Love & Special Sauce,"Praise god, for it was written in numbers
Soon you'll know of the great joy we feel
Today day to be able to speak freely
And talk eye to eye
With a small group of americans
We feel that the time has come
For your nation to awaken
To it's true spiritual import
And we wish you everything in our power
To that realization

Four mourning doves searching in the park
Saying don't be confused when the night is dark
Eleven white swans swimming in a black lake
Told me keep it real and you'll find who's fake
Two cedar trees half submerged in the water
Don't prophesize about sons and daughters
One new master of the form tai chi
Friends of the accuser and the accusee
One pimp using songs as his hussy
Won't be here next year to tell you 'bout nothing
Two happy kids playing basketball
Til a war broke out and killed them all
A bunch of ideas like fireflies
An eighteen-year-old girl with stars in her eyes
We saw the gentle trickster on the highway tonight
Keep your mouth closed and your eyes open wide

Though the roof may leak in many places
Shining faces shining faces
May she sleep in peace
And wake up in my arms
Some day soon some day soon
Some day soon some day soon

The separation from unity
Is the descent of the angels upon the ladder of consciousness
The return to unity is the ascent of the angels upon the ladder
The descent is good
But the unity that comes is expressed diversity
But in diversity there would be no concept of separation

Those that were numbered
Had a path to follow
Fly as swift as the swallow
Where no enemies can follow
The path that was laid for the righteous man
Don't promote the fool
Claiming he's the wisest man
As they slander our name in shame
When our aim is to do what comes natural
We're hatchin' the fireflies on a river
Feelin' straght from my toes, knees, kidneys to my liver
Clouds drop down the dew
My friends what about you
Clouds drop down the dew
My friends what about you

Though the roof may leak in many places
Shining faces shining faces
May she sleep in peace
And wake up in my arms
Some day soon some day soon
Some day soon some day soon
Though the roof may leak in many places
Shining faces shining faces
May she sleep in peace
And wake up in my arms
Some day soon some day soon
Some day soon some day soon
",Numbers,1999
G. Love & Special Sauce,"Let's all just relax
And get into this groove
The room's starting to move
Now turn the red lights on
You know the kind that I like
Deep blues and reds
With purple highlights

But don't forget my oohhs
And fade in my ahhs

Fade out the parades
And the charades
Making music like love is made
And lovers wait patiently
And with joy
For the right moment
To explor in passion
Why everlasting love is everlasting

But don't forget my oohhs
And fade in my ahhs

Ther's no need to argue for better position
Realize the moment that you're in is magic
Stellare regions cry everything has it's season
Everything happens for a reason
So who are we to worry at any rate
The plane that crashed
We missed 'cause we were running late
And if success eludes you
Then you must choose to do
What other people wouldn't do

But don't forget my oohhs
And fade in my ahhs

So as cold night fades into darkness
Harken to the fire
Where you may find some peace
As many people pass
Some good and some bad
But this fire glows stronger yet
And burning bright reminds us

To ever be reborn
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon

Back to the rappers
A lot of people stake claims
Saying hip hop doesn't matter

But really what could be phatter than
Jungle J.B's beats and streetside sounds
Profound are the sounds
That i was hearing

When at the basketball league
This kid said ""Yo come here and
Put these head phones on your ears""
I was converted then

And practiced it for years
Rap music, like Jazz, Funk and R&B
Blues Reggae Rock n' Roll, and rock steady G.

And DJ's that brought me near to this

Blastmaster, KRS-One the teacher
Run D-M-see and the movie Beat Street
Erik B. and Rakim was Paid in Full
De La Soul came along and broke all the rules

We broke up later but I kept the cassette

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Everyone starts with the sweetest dreams
Living long life living beautiful scenes
Make a million dollars wearing gold and jewels
Drive a big black Benz or a Caribbean cruise
Or maybe you dream that you just can't lose
Or playing blues is the path that you choose
Or perhaps your dream of going back to nature's plan
And just live off the land and be a natural man
Or of a beautiful girl who's holding your hand
Loving the one you're with, with her beautiful tan
Like you're holding the riff that laying in your hand
Or you dream of playing band from electric lady land
Riffs just like Jimi Hendrix

Are you feeling the feeling that I'm feeling
Dreams are like fish you gots to keep on reeling
Are you feeling the feeling that I'm feeling
Dreams are like fish you gots to keep on reeling
Are you feeling the feeling that I'm feeling

""stop daydreaming!""
That's what my teachers used to say
While they kick a bunch of crap that I forgot anyway
Educatin's important to make a man complete
But everything I learned in school
I learned again on the street
Now my time is booked cause I've got the look
And when I walk on my path
You know I can't be shook
Stay alert in this day you have to go for yours
The force conspires to help brothers
That help others open doors
Wars and battles, rage round us everyday
While the real troops keep our heads up while we play
This game of chance that they busy calling life
Can be quite a disappointing ride
You can't blame the youth and you can't blame god
Now who you gonna blame when the dogs in the yard

Experience says ""the kid can't miss""

Doubt suggests ""what you think you can achieve?""

Rapping blues and playing guitar
Now I'm chillin sky's the limit
I'm a rock and 'roll star

Higher than the liars melting in the fire
How high can you ride?
The greatest victory it was
When we believe in legends getting busy like the man
They call ""school's in session"" addressing all you people
Like I know who you are 'cause streets are universal and the world is wide
But no matter what you're running from you just can't hide
If you seek the truth, the truest kid you'll find
So trace your tracks a fact's a fact

Mind games, injustice everyday

Evening dies
My friend rise up to the sunrise
Brand new day
New chance
Some say
If I can make a difference
In this world
Then I may
So I must
So I trust
All my lyrics just bust
Into this new day
Like I was busting a nut
Ohh feels so good
Rising up the ""mornin-ornin"" (morning)
I just got on the radio
It's a positive moment
It's something like
Just the perfect moon
Sonic the waves glaze
For days
In the sunlight haze
I feel good to be alive
All the shit that beat me down
Been doing this
I still survive
It ain't at all complicated
I'm glad I found ya
It's when you open your heart
That love surrounds you

Mmmmmm yeah baby
Mmmmmm aint that right.

I wont live my life
By any rules or regulation
Walk the road less traveled
Stay away from aggravation
As I assure
Like ???
A good time to ride the vibe
So we could all get nice

You want some advice
Stay on the hustle
Do it once
And get it right
I don't just walk
I'll take a hike
'Cause every day's an expedition
I don't just run
I'll take a bike

Rock it with precision
I'm decisive like decision
But yo
I'm only human
And I have my doubts
I wanna know where I fit it
And what this world is all about
It seems when I had my song
That learning was love
Love is what I'm teachin'

Send me sweet kisses darling
I'm a catch them before they fall
Ain't nobody's business
What we do
Ain't nobody's business at all
Ooh not at all
They say that love is all you need to heal your wounds
And not be consumed by the everyday evils the man do
It's just one of those moments that feels too good to be true
When I look in your eyes are you feeling love too?
No fear
No worry
No doubt
No concern
Just the brightest light
And let it burn
I said damn it feels good to hold your hand
Love's the simplest thing
And now I start to understand

Look me in the eye, smile, like you did the very first time I called your name
Tell me everything's gonna be alright, even though I can't stop these tears

Pick it up, push it off
Before you let yourself get colder

Just look into the eyes
The good eyes of a child
See that love
Rise like a river
And flow for a thousand miles

Give me some peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness

Come on, give it to me

Breathe in deep
Feel your heart beat
Just to know that life's worth living
Feel your feet
On the earth
You better love it 
While it's still here spinning

I've got no time to worry
About troubles or misgivings
Need to let it flow
Let yourself go
'Cause if you're hating then you sure ain't living

Give me some peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness

Come on, give it to me

Look'it here
Lot of people talking
We need somebody to listen
Lot of people strugglin'
If you got think you better start givin'

Peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness
Come on now

C'mon give it to me
You've got to give it up

I can not eat this daily bread
With so many people starving
How come the presidents' build more bombs
When nations start disarming
With all that money spent on guns
Instead of food and education
Need to buy a little piece at the end of this day
Start the healing of the nation

Give some peace, love, happiness
Peace, love, happiness...","Peace, Love and Happiness",2008
G. Love & Special Sauce,"Chilling out on a ridge, by the sea, in a ranchido
Cool breeze through the trees sings a song so sweet
For my baby and my boo boo
Asleep they lay
So I picked up my guitar and then I start to play
The music was pulsing blood up to my eyes
I surmised the horizon, sun rising, surprising the hell out
Of the clouds
Like they were kissed for the first time.
The sun was steady rising and I'm sitting in the sunshine

I hear my baby crying and he's just waking up
So I walk through the screen door and I go pick him up
Rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka back and forth
Baby quit crying then I'll go and play some more

[Chorus: ]
Soft and sweet melodies while your momma's sleeping
Let her sleep in late this morning
Let her sleep 'til the sun is burning down
Burning down down down

Baby baby hold my fingers with your little tiny hands
While we lounge in a hammock checking out all the land
I smell the sweet scents of papaya and lime
I smell the ocean breezes, the salt
And my mind is captivated by your big brown eyes
Which remind me of mine
Now I know we're two of a kind
Rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka back and forth
Baby quit crying then I'll go and play some more

[Chorus: ]

The day is getting brighter and the wind is breezing down
The whole tree is shaking, fallen fruit is on the ground
I smile when I'm thinking about the love I've found
Momma's still sleeping so we play these mellow sounds

[Chorus: ]

Burning down, burning down, burning down",Soft and Sweet,2008
G. Love & Special Sauce,"Every once and awhile
I got to use my superpowers
Even or saving or what'll stop
It ain't my fault
All this bad stuff is happening
Now's it's time I put my foot on down
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same
No, no

Well they say that love is all you need
To heal the world
Plus a trillion billion dollars
Have you heard
That President Bush, Santa Claus and Green Goblin
Sadam Hussein, Spiderman and Bin Laden
Britney Spears, Jesus and the whole cast of Friends
Met for brunch last week
To solve the world's problems
Would've called on me
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same

Well if they called on my name
Don't you know I'd do it
Shine my signal all over Gotham
I'd be true
It's my distinct pleasure
To come down from my grass
Get off my front porch
And save your asses
And in the nick of time
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same

Well change has come over me
My muscles blown
So I freestyled my ass across the U.S.A.
Solve the economy, the homeless problem
Save what's left of the environment
Create jobs, for everybody to be doing something
They want to be doing
Yeah

But if you can't do smack
Then you better do something
'Cause this is the time
When you so can't do nothing
That means you and you and you and you
And me too

Oh baby

Then I fly overseas
And set all the slaves free
From prostitution, sweat shop, child labor
South America, the problems in the Middle East
Make a sun power car
We don't have to fight in oil fields
I'll take all the troops back
From wherever they roam
And wherever their fightin'
And whatever side their on
And I'll send on the first plane
Home to their moms
And we could make coffee tables
Out of all these bombs
And save the whales
And the pygmy marmosets too 

Oh baby

Well all this seems kinda hard
But it really ain't nothin'
All you got to do is
Get bit by a spider or something
We could change the world
In a week or a day
And if you got problems
Man, I sweep 'em away
You find yourself in a world full of trouble
Just call on G. Love
Your superhero brother

And I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same
No, no, no",Superhero Brother,2008

Everybody need a flavor
That they can savor for the moment

Don't smoke the reefer

I really should have listened

Pack the crumbs and shake (shake)

Got my grab crap
Keep it next to my hip
I'm going to the airport
I'm going on a trip
I hope I don't get slip by the Feds
'Cause I got this house of Buddha
Right down my leg
That was not cool
It is stinking up the whole damn row
The stewardess is looking at me
I think that she knows
I tried spraying my body
With all this cologne
But the stench is creeping 
Into the front row

It's just the homegrown
From the backyard
I keep it in my pocket
If I go to the bar
So if you want a hit

“...For the police to move into the negro community, exercising gestapo tactics 
Stopping any black man on the sidewalk, whether he is guilty or whether he is innocent 
Whether he is well-dressed or whether he poorly dressed 
Whether he is educated or whether he is dumb, whether he is a Christian
Or whether he is a Muslim 
As long as he is black and a member of the black community 
The white public thinks that the white policeman is justified in going in there 
And trampling on that man’s civil rights and on that man’s human rights

Once the police has convinced the white public 
that the so-called negro community is a criminal element 
they can go in and question, brutalize, murder, unarmed innocent negros 
and the white public is gullible enough to back them up...""",Amerikkka,2017

Back when we lived in that little two room shack
We wanted fame and fortune and we'd live life the way the rich folks do
We knew somehow we'd make it, together me and you

With dreams and hopes of things to come we worked and never stopped
Not much time for you and me, we had to reach the top
We bought that big two story house and soon became the envy of the town
With all our work behind us we'd finally settled down

Now we live (yes we live) in a two story house whoa, what splendor
But there's no love about

I've got my story and I've got mine, too
How sad it is, we now live in a two story house

The house is filled with rare antiques, there's marble on the floor
Beauty all around us like we've never seen before
There's chandeliers in every room, imported silks and satin all about
We filled the house with everything but somehow left love out

It's not about the clothes, the baggy jeans and timbs
Forget about the house, the mansion on the hill
With the swimming pool in the back and the barbecue on the grill
Forget about fortune, forget about the fame
See it's not about money or people screaming my name
I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
That's all, that's all
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar
That's not why I'm singing this song

Some people just love you for the things you've done
And some just love you for all the victories won
Now there's nothing wrong (nothing wrong) with that kind of praise (kind of praise)
But this time around, I love you is all I wanna say

See, I can go on and on like Erykah Badu

That's all, that's all
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar

Now if you never bless me with material things
(Like what?) Like the furs and the diamonds and the escalade or the rims
See you would still be God and that's enough for me to love you
Hey, I love you Lord
Cause I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
You mean more than this world to me
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar
That's not why I'm singing this song

I love you Lord and here's the reason why
You gave your life, you didn't have to die
Everytime I think about it I just cry
As I long as I live you'll be glorified
I know I don't pray just as much I should
I know I don't read just as much as I could
And if I ask you to forgive me Lord I know you would
Tryin' to end this song but you've been so good to me
I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
You mean more than this life to me
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar

You mean more than life to me, you're everything I need
You supply all of my needs

September 11th I woke up about 7 AM
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon
Takin' my time awakin, turnin' my TV on
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw
Me and my children, images were chillin'
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him
That night at my son's side, he cried
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God
He just, kept on pressin' me, wanna know why
Then one week later our bombs were dropped
We seein' them, on CNN, they just won't stop
The infrared, images of brutal attack
He said ""Daddy now we killin' 'em back,"" right right

Souls are captured (souls are captured)
Dreams are stolen (dreams are stolen)

Honest to God, why is the bomb always gettin' the last word
and why, did her uncles have to molest her
and why, did all them cops have to be shootin' to kill?
And why, did all them priests have to act so ill?
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot
And why, is human life always denied for loot?
Tell me WHY did MANDELA have to live in a cage
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate
And why the fuck can't love, seem to defeat hate?
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?

When the enemy comes in like a flood,
The spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against him.
I see the enemy coming in like a flood in our houses, in our churches, in our families.
But what I don't see is the standard. 
People of God where's the standard at?
We in a war y'all. It's time to stand out!

[G.A.]
It's about to go down. The battle has begun.
It's time for you to choose, whose side you gonna be on.
The devil is recruiting, temptin' every man.
But he's already defeated, all we have to do is stand.
No time for mixing light with the darkness.
Be black or be white, no more shades of gray.
Be separated, be holy, no matter what you do, don't bow.
And even if you stand alone, stand anyhow.

Rise up!
Rise up people, put on your strength.
There's a war going on and we will win.
Stand up and fight, let the kingdom prevail.
With power and might, we will stand out.

Stand out!
Be transformed, renew your mind.

God is playin' it cool, don't wanna rub nobody the wrong way.
Almost like we're trying to fit in. Acting like we don't know the name.
It's time for us to stand out and go against the grain.
Forget tryin' to be down, let the world know you've been changed.
How you gonna be the praise leader? But you listen to R & B?
And hip-hop is on your ring tone. I'm trying to tell you God ain't pleased.
And since when did it become cool for you to live together unmarried?
Men with men?
Women with women?
I'm telling you God ain't gon' have it.

No-one could understand.
Each night he'd go out shooting skag,
Met a pusher who sold him a bag.

That's why he was 
Dead on arrival 

Ran out of money so he stole a car,
Tried to run but didn't get far.
Sent to prison, no turning back,
Saw his arm, weaned him off smack.

Out on parole tried to keep calm,
Finally died with a needle in his arm.

G.B.H.,"Lycanthropy is in his blood,
And spreads to those he slays.
Uncontrolled metamorphosis,
Undetectable by day.
But when the moon is waxing,
And all the world's asleep.
Through woods and fields,
The werewolf he will creep.

Even a man who is pure heart,
And says his prayers at night ..
Can become a werewolf when the wolfsbane blooms,
And the Autumn moon is bright.

He instinctively seeks to kill,
The thing he loves the best.
He'll bare his teeth, growl and snarl,
And wish upon you death.

His suffused eyes will glare in hate,
Silver-grey hair will shine.
He'll grip you in his muscular arms,
And on your your flesh will dine.

A Marfisa flower is a start.
Silver topped cane, a crucifix,
A silver bullet through the heart.

That man is not guilty you don't give a toss.

But how could they stop me with this magnum in my hand ?

Just a kid now he always will be.
Gunned down gunned down.
Fell like a stone in a war of his own.

It can blow a hole in a steel door it can blow a hole in you.
It can blow the guts out of any cop, but then what would I do ?

The blood is spilt it burns my eyes a pain I cannot bear.
I'm lying in the gutter crying in despair.

So I've failed in my quest of crime my one and only vice.
Gunned down by a sniper, for trying to improve my life.

You'll feel the heat as they knock you off your feet.

Had no choice, lost and alone.
Eat the flesh, spit out the bone.

Malnutrition was setting in.
They needed protein and a will to win.
Cannibalism the only way ..

With only human flesh to keep them alive ?

There's no one up there there never was.
Only in vain is there a god.
There's too much suffering for him to be ..
An almighty power, a heavenly being.

My god, your god, whose god, there is no god ?

The fabric of prophet's ages old.
Drones on and gathers mould.
Gets a weekly airing from a fool on high.
Who talks and talks till his throat's dry.

A fund for a roof with a hole.
It's the money they'll save not your soul.
Persistent begging from men of the cloth.
Refuse his offer and see his wrath.

Get out of the city today.

And there's a rumblin' underground.

Sniff the air it only brings a stench of the Neu Smell.
Faceless icebergs burnin' down in Hell.

The called him a fag.

There there's a bang like an engine's blew.

Not thirty five thousand feet below.

Needle sharp start like diamonds on velvet,
And the snail trail of a shooting comet.

Everything I see - it all goes down, it all goes down ..
.. it all goes down in my nocturnal journal.

Bats are flying high but, the owls don't give a hoot,
No birds singin', seems the whole world's mute.
The slightest noise, echoes through the streets,
Slumber-lands bounce, to a tiny heartbeat.

Walls of old houses, still creak after all this time,
Explanations don't contain no reason or rhyme.
The moon stays awake with ease,
Bangin' car doors are annoying me.
The rain is coming down, started to lash,
And I'm waiting for the glass to smash.

Empty cans rattle just like skeleton shakes,
To live by night is a chance I take.
Seedy streetlamps spill, a pool of white light,
Banshee screams of another cat fight.

G.B.H.,"The poor man he had no dreams
He had no vices all he had was himself
Spent his days walking around
Thinking of things to do with his time

It's like a dream when I wake and scream
I'm lost and alone and living in a hellhole

Looked at himself then looked at the world
Decided things weren't going too well
Just a man with a sense of justice
Would his days of misery never end

It's like a dream when I wake and scream
I'm lost and alone and living in a hellhole

Bought a gun disciplined himself
Shoot those those bastards right between the eyes
Crime figures fell like dead leaves
The city breathed a sigh of relief

It's like a dream when I wake and scream
I'm lost and alone and living in a hellhole

Bought a gun disciplined himself
Shoot those those bastards right between the eyes
Crime figures fell like dead leaves
The city breathed a sigh of relief

It's not easy when you're making a stand
When it seems that all the world is mad
It's easy to fall by the wayside
But if you act like a sheep you'll get eaten by the wolf

Now the streets are safe for children to play
Couples can go walking in the park
The poor man is happy now
An unknown hero and nobody knows his name

It's like a dream when I wake and scream
I'm lost and alone and living in a hellhole, a hellhole

G.B.H.,"Shivers running down my spine, whose blood I know it's mine ?
I'm a moving target and I can't go home.
Chased forever and a day of my choosing my own way.
I don't want to forget the things I've done.

I am the hunted ..
No-one's hurt now I've escaped no-one killed and no-one raped.
But I'm the monster they want to catch.
My kids live alone with a stranger their mother's dead I killed her.
A moment's anger and a life of pain.

Running scared I know my number, I know no joy, only hunger.
I don't want to forget the things I've done.
Remorse regret, it's more than anger everywhere I go there's danger.
I could take my life but still no wife.

A man obsessed, a man possessed he'll get you in the end

It's a man trap
The jaws of his baby tightly snap
It's a man trap

He's wicked as sin, his mind is narled
He's got plenty but he doesn't share
And to ask for help they wouldn't dare
A wall heath man with wife to keep
Did his duty and stole a sheep
Refused to grovel he refused to beg
Stepped on the trigger and lost his leg
Deported abroad and is long since dead

A blind eye sees more than pain, expressions on heads look so feign.

Four men died today, someone's gotta pay.
Why did four men die today ?
The culprits can't be found, they're hiding underground.
Why did four men die today ?

Hoboes and underdogs strike a new chord, they're sick and tired of acting bored.
Legions of damned citizens try, while all around the rotting die.
Concerned committees study and gen, the final word from Number Ten.

G.B.H.,"Send in the goon sqaud
It's getting out of hand
They're marching all over
Our Promised land
They've got dogs on bits of rope
And bits of rope for hair
I've seen them on the corner
Drinking flat cider

They're raved out right on fortunate sons
A hooligan element spoils it for the genious ones
You've gotta Crush Em, Crush Em, Crush Em like ants,
You've gotta crush em like ants

So where's your home now
And where's your pride
You've liberated nothing
But we're still on your side
David meets goliath
For another round
Black flags are flying
There's bodies on the ground

They're raved out right on fortunate sons
A hooligan element spoils it for the genious ones
You've gotta Crush Em, Crush Em, Crush Em like ants,
You've gotta crush em like ants

Drinking from the poison pool
Divide and conquer divide and rule
The acid rain it may be stinging
But I don't hear no fat lady singing
Sitting in the road now
You're swinging from the trees
Harassing bastards hunting foxes
Saving birds and bees
If your life is boring
Give it a second chance
Work is a four letter word
So give it up and dance

They're raved out right on fortunate sons
A hooligan element spoils it for the genious ones
You've gotta Crush Em, Crush Em, Crush Em like ants,
You've gotta crush em like ants

G.B.H.,"Can't take no more of this daily grind
I need some space to unwind
Not enough Carrots to many sticks
But I'm prepared to take the risks

I'm falling down, I'm falling down, I'm falling down again

There's no respect where's it all gone
The silent ticking of a smart bomb
Buildings crumble people bleed
They've got us crawling on our knees

I'm falling down, I'm falling down, I'm falling down again

Well I'm not the man I used to be
Public enemy number three
It was on the cards you could tell
Now I'm all tooled up and mad as hell

I'm falling down, I'm falling down, I'm falling down again

Self defense is not a crime
Victims end up doing time
Retaliation when they threaten
A water pistol is no only weapon

G.B.H.,"I don't wear a tie don't ask me why I feel uncomfortable in one
And I won't wear a suit cause it might take root

I ain't bothering you why you messing with me I'm just trying to do my own thing
You don't know my story who made you judge and jury stay with rules to which you cling

Free thinkers open minds the opposite of your kind you hate everyone to the core
You got a cruel vent savage amusement
Knuckles dragging along the floor

Never look behind you, we're with you all the way.
Go to bed early, conserve your energy,
tomorrow we'll be fighting with our enemy.

killing those bastards will be a lot of fun.
Take no prisoners, kill them all.

Death is not right, war cannot be won.

fall to the ground and make a splash.

Ain't no peace in the slums just bums and crumbs

Bring da beef to the streets
(Y'all don't really want it)
Keep the heat with me
(So don't run up on me)

All my people see
(Y'all don't really want it)

Police say G.I.B. is a game
But we just hooded up doin' our family thing
Straight hang and swang in the city of Kang
Increasin' my change to an impeccable range

That you can't reach, if you listen I'll teach
Of course I'm a beast on them tracks I release
Whether East or West, I'll envision a check
That my show pay, I'm a predator, hey

So where's my prey 'cause it's possible for me to be poppin' today
I'll keep rockin' the [Incomprehensible] in the home of your place
Bet you won't wanna stay
Keep the chrome in your face, betta watch what you say, hey

('cause our hood is on it)

I'm [Incomprehensible] disturbin' the streets
Money's my mission but the way I live ain't no guarantees
Just visions of casualties sworn to municipalities
Got 'em after me 'cause a coward chose to speak on how I'll eat

But I don't play when it comes to my meat
Like The Isley Brothers leave 'em layin' between the sheets
See we Get It Boyz and know we roll with the heat
If money got a problem, tell him he gon' get beat

Bring da beef to the streets
(Y'all don't really want it)

I'll put you lames in the place where you're eternally restin'
And for that player-hatin' testin', you gon' meet the Smith and Wesson
'cause these bad block niggas take no prisoners at war times
Respect mine, I'll have Guerrillas kickin' in your door time

We're deep with the artillery, impose on your spot
Plenty G's, plus, a silly G, I'll get your ass knocked
Ridin' in a minivan, contraband in my hand
Find these buzzards, split their wig that is my master plan

I don't start it but I finish it a true gun blazer
OGM and H-man, them some true hell raisers
From the WMPG, Northside [Incomprehensible] street
Stay equipped with the heat
So we can take it to the street, yo, bitch niggas

G.L.O.B.E.,"Drinking a German beer with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican bar
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard, from King's College in march
She says that I'm her favorite
'Cause she admires the art of Michelangelo with the flow
Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece of Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect

Cause you'll be gone for a while

Girl, tell me how you feel
What your fantasy
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up
Be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush
Just take it slow

Five-hour layovers from Norway to Egypt

Still lean to the left like the tower out in Pisa

Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy, and maybe see the Coliseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you be my Mona Lisa

How about let's make it plural
Spin the globe, whatever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some euro
And maybe visit Berlin, the wall's with the murals
This is your month baby
Sign of the Virgo

A rose, a burgundy

G.O.,"Man, on a normal occasion
I'd tell you to roll something up
Po some'ing up, but I ain't feeling that way
Everytime I turn around, another funeral
Another away man, how much can we take feel this

I'm riding one deep with my gun, naw I ain't having fun
Wondering how to break the news, to my partna lil' son
His daddy probably the saw the angels, death he couldn't stop it
But God, why'd you have to take my dog Todd Prophet
Already lost Mello, now who gon be next
Think I'm feeling safe fake ass rappers, having plex
Who you playing with, don't take your life for granted
So many good people, seem to be the victims on the planet
Can't understand it, now which religion talking noise
Them Catholic priests, be touching on lil' boys
Can't trust your homeboys, you drop em off at home
He call his partna on the phone, they done broke in your home
Now what's wrong, said the Lord people dying too often
With no health or no insurance, can't afford no coffin
So today no flossing, another wake at eight o'clock
Jam Master Jay wasn't a gangsta, but he still got shot what's up

My partna use to be a baller but
(Now he's gone, ah-oh)
And all I can tell his son, is
(Try to hold on, ah-oh)
Yeah she use to be a star, but
(Now she's gone, ah-oooh)
Hey mama, they thought your son wouldn't make it but
(I stayed strong, ah-oooh)

Now lil' Tamika up the street, wanted a baller real bad
Only 16, but already giving up the ass
You got cash you could smash, you don't have to ask
She needed money for clothes, so she stayed skipping class
Catch her flipping in a Jag, or flipping in the Lex
Laughing at the nerdy chicks, who believed in safe sex
She had one baby, had twins then another
Now didn't slow at 18, all living with her mother
Steady bouncing out of town, rent-a-cars with crack
Missing her kids birthday, what kind of mother is that
The ass started getting flat, without using Metabolife
Whole neighborhood wondering, if Tamika on the pipe
Strip clubs late at night, with bags under her eyes
Had the flu for three months, feeling like she bout to die
Boyfriends disappeared, and so did the queen
HIV in her bloodstream, girl died ay 19 damn

Now Lord I know, I'm in the valley of death
And can't no man predict, how many days he got left
Use to run the street, with some devilish ass demons
High on dust not giving a fuck, smoking wet steady scheming
Had to change my ways, and go another route
Now I use the studio, to let my pain out
No more chasing dreams, gotta make it on my own
Can't be waiting on the next man, gotta get my hustle on
Now in case you ain't know this, playboy I'm focused
Only got one chance, no way in hell I can blow this
Turn my last five dollas, into a quarter million
But money can't change, the fucking pain that I'm feeling
From Chris, Paul to Tremain, who else gon go

Paisagem colorida deslumbrante de vivier
Baailam meteoros e planetas
Dinossauros, borboletas
Brilham os cristais
O canto da cigarra em sintonia
Relembrou aqueles dias que não voltarão jamais

Voa tiê, tucano e arara
Quero-quero ver onça pintada
Os tambores ressoaram, era um ritual de fé
Para o rei de Daomé, para o rei de Daomé

A brisa me levou para o Egito
Onde um solfejo lindo da cantora de Amon
Ecoa sob a lua e o sereno
Perfumando a deusa vênus sem jamais sair do tom
Marajó, Carajá, Bororó
Em cada canto um herdeiro de Luzia
Flautas de chimus e incas
Sopram pelas grimpas linda melodia

When money is low
It's better with someone to hold
And when the road up ahead
Is so unclear 
I'd rather be together not hear
When the circle life throws you a curve
There's someone of better or worse
And when you pick up the pace
But loosing the race
A friendly and familiar face

Everyone wants to be kissing on new years eve
Underneath the mistletoe 
While it's snowing outside
Making fireworks like it's the forth of July

Sometimes it's gotta be a no show
Probably end your heart though
Better to learn crashing by
Then never to fly at all
The chances are it falls apart
Sometimes it's over before it starts
Better to know crashing but 
Then never to fly at all

The ship doesn't sail
You try but you fail
Your lover keeps checking the mail
And whenever your down
From crying out loud
You'd rather see his face in the crowd
If you see the top 
You know it's making it there
Or if you didn't bring somebody who cares
Your a day to late or a minute to soon
Your stealing the stars

Everyone wants to be kissing on new years eve
Underneath the mistletoe 
While it's snowing outside 
Fireworks light up the sky

Sometimes it's gotta be a no show
Probably end your heart though

Better to know crashing but

I'm up early in the morning thinking bout getting this money
All I know is I gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta get it, get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down 
I won't let you down

I'm up early than a mother, chasing mine cause I'm a hustler
Then tomorrow everything is gonna rewind
Only seven days a week and 24 hours a day
That ain't enough for me so I ain't wasting time
Cause only dreams come to sleepers and my life ain't getting cheaper
So you know them dollar signs, they on my mind
When they ask me where I'm goin? I say you already know
I'm bout to hit the streets and go and get what's mine, I won't let you down
Dreams of having finer things, Ridin blades and dreaming should
Make you wanna wake up and get it in real life than see the wood
In your grip, If you slip and don't grab what you see then good
Only place that you gonna be or ever see gonna be the hood

Boy that word ain't no excuse, You know what it mean to me
It means you passing over opportunities repeatedly
Write it on a piece of paper, Only thing I see is P
That paper, paper, paper chaser, better thing for me to be
Nah, my services ain't for free, make that money multiply
Early in the morning I be gone, chase with me, it ain't gonna be no tie
Try to explain and give em game, I don't know why I even try
You do the same if you was I, but you are you so you gonna lie
Make em think that you got cash, tell them ladies you got slabs
Only thing you get is laughs, You can't even bring down half
Of the bill that's on that tab, Only thing wrong with being broke
Is staying broke and making excuses bout it like there ain't no hope

I don't know how many times I gotta tell ya
In the hood, having no condition, I was having something
I remember it like it was yesterday
They was talking down on me and I lost a couple homies
I was getting mine while they used to play
They say I need to slow down but I ain't slowing down for nothing
I don't wanna let the paper get away
So when I'm in the streets grindin, ain't no need to be crying
The best way that you can help me is to pray I won't let you down
Partners that was getting lazy, Females that was acting crazy
Then promoters that tried to play me, Mixtape labels that didn't pay me
My old homies that ain't around me, Dissing rappers that came to find me
Major labels that didn't sign me, left all that nonsense behind me, I got paid

See, rich people ain't going to tell you how to get paid
And broke people act like they the richest people in the world
Always tellin people with money how to get it
Always spendin money that they thought they was gonna get.
Always buying things they can't afford.
Stop making excuses.
If chronic smoke makes him sleepy, he's gonna tell ya he got chronic fatigue
If liquor makes him drowsy, he gonna say he got that grey goose disease
If women keep taking his money, he gonna tell ya he slipped off his sleeve

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile

Were at the best place around

Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound

Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside

I did it my way.

And through it all, when there was doubt,
I ate it up and spat it out.
I faced it all and I stood tall;
And did it my way.

I've had my fill; my share of losing.
And now, as tears subside,
I find it all so amusing.

And may I say - not in a shy way,
Oh no, oh no not me,
I did it my way.

In pianto o in riso
Ã¨ menzognero

La donna Ã¨ mobil
Qual piuma al vento
Muta d'accento
E di pensier
E di pensier
E di pensier

E' sempre misero
Chi a lei s'affida
Chi le confida
Mal cauto il core
Pur mai non sentesi
Felice appieno
Chi su quel seno
Non liba amore

La donna Ã¨ mobil
Qual piuma al vento
Muta d'accento
E di pensier
E di pensier
E di pensier



",La Donna E Mobile,2005
G4,"Never know how much I loved you
Never know how much I cared
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever

When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night.

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou giv-est fever

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chick were born to give yu Fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you Fever

What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

G4,"When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall
We used to love while others used to play
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Someone else moved in from far away

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

G4,"I vow to thee, my country
All earthly things above
Entire and whole and perfect
The service of my love

The love that asks no questions
The love that stands the test
That lays upon the alter
The dearst and the best

The love that never falters
The love that pays the price
The love that makes undaunted
The final sacrifice

And there's another country
I've heard of long ago
Most dear to them that love her
Most great to them I know

We may not count her armies
We may not see her King
Her fortress is a faithful heart
Her pride is suffering

And soul by soul and silently
Her shining bounds increase
And her ways are ways of gentleness
And all her paths are peace","I Vow to Thee, My Country",2005
G4,"(w/ Cliff Richard)

I've had many times, I can tell you
Times when innocence I'd trade for company
And children saw me crying
I thought I'd had my share of that
But these miss you nights
Are the longest

Midnight diamonds (midnight diamonds)
Stud my heaven (stud my heaven)
Southward burning
Lie the jewels that eye my place
And the warm winds (and the warm winds)
That embrace me (that embrace me)
Just as surely kissed your face
Yeah these miss you nights
They're the longest

(How I missed you) How I missed you
I'm not likely to tell
I'm a man
And cold day light buys the pride I'd rather sell
(All my secrets) All my secrets
Are a wasted affair
You know them well

Thinking of my going
How to cut the thread
And leave it all behind
Looking windward for my compass
I take each day as it arrives
But these miss you nights
Are the longest

(Lay down) Lay down all thoughts of your surrender
It's only me who's killing time
(Lay down) Lay down all dreams and themes once remembered
It's just the same
This miss you game

Yeah these miss you nights




",Miss You Nights,2005
G4,"Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along, I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know?
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across, I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
'cause you were all yellow

I drew a line, I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

And your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know?
For you I bleed myself dry
For you I bleed myself dry

It's true

G4,"Written by Freddie Mercury
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go - will you let me go
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go (never)
Never let you go - let me go
Never let me go - ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me

That saved a wretch like me....
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.

    

T'was Grace that taught...
my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear...
the hour I first believed.

    

Through many dangers, toils and snares...
we have already come.
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far...
and Grace will lead us home.

    

The Lord has promised good to me...
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be...

We've no less days to sing God's praise...

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.

And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me.

And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me
I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.

I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.

More cries, it is the moment!

He strikes! A horse rolls, 
Dragging a Picador,
Ah! Bravo! Bull! The crowd shrieks!
The bull goes, he comes,
He comes and strikes again! 

Shaking his banderillos,
Full of fury, he runs!
The arena is full of blood!
They save themselves, they pass the gates
It is your turn now. Go!
On guard! Go! Go! Ah!

I just can't get her off my mind.

I saw Theresa yesterday
She told me ""Everything's okay,
I'm so in love with you today""

Theresa asked me to commit
I think that I could go with it
I never thought I'd have a wife
But I could see her in my life.

I saw Theresa yesterday
She told me ""Everything's okay,
But I'm leaving you today""

The night I climb toward the sky,
Above the city lights I'll fly
How can I live without that girl?
I wanted her inside my world.

I saw Maria yesterday
She asked me up for some cafe
Now I think its gonna be okay
I think its gonna be okay
I know its gonna be okay

Gabe Dixon,"Music goin'
Ooh and all the room is high
Drinks are flowin'
And I'm just hopin' to catch your eye
Rare diseases
Swimming in seas of love
A plastic Jesus
Could be a sign from above?

My door is open
Won't you come follow
One thing's for sure
Gonna make you a happy woman
Gonna make you a happy woman

Go ahead then
With your dirty apes and all your thugs
Take it elsewhere, besides
Your broken down gait's makin' me bug
But I see you comin'
From down the hallway
One thing's for sure

Gonna make you a happy woman
Gonna make you a happy woman
Gonna make you a happy woman
Gonna make you a happy woman

Gabe Dixon,"I was sleeping soundly once upon a night
When I had a simple dream
There you were not saying a word
All I heard was our heart beating.

You were bent on picking apples from the apple tree
When you glanced my way.
With a hand you blocked the sun from your eyes and
Smiled an everlasting smile.
It was so unfortunate
That my alarm clock told me

you're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream,
But I'd just love to make you real.

you're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
But I'd just love to make you real.

Next night I saw the end of
Bloody miscommunication.
All the sides they
Dropped their weapons and they
Drooped their heads in shame and clarity.
All of us who watched from the sidelines
Breathed a sigh.
Then I awoke and saw the paper with the people dying on the cover.

you're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
But I'd just love to make you real
But I'd just love to make you real

I was sleeping soundly once upon a night when I had a simple dream

Gabe Dixon,"Too many times you were all alone
He left you behind cryin' by the phone
You weren't born to lose but losing him is wise
You've got a new fool
And he's just about my size

Live your life just how you love to live it
And things will all fall into place.
Take your strife and try your best to sing it.
In the end you meet your friends.

There is something I must tell you girl,
Been building up so long
See, all the times I served as your love consultant
I wanted to be there myself

Live your life just how you love to live it
And things will all fall into place.
Take your strife and try your best to sing it
In the end you meet your friends.

I love you more than it would seem
I love you more than it would seem

Love to me is not a total stranger
But love to me don't make no sense.
Love can be a capsule full of danger,
But that's a risk I'll have to take.

I love you more than it would seem
I love you more than it would seem

I'm sorry I waited so long but the
Time was so wrong.
I know its just a song but I love you
Things ain't what they seem to be
I have tried to conceal but love overwhelms me



",More Than It Would Seem,2000
Gabe Dixon,"Sitting on the wall
Watching future goin' past
A million births a single day,
A million flags at half mast

The eyes bear holes in creation
A visual vacation

""Would you care for coffee sir?
I can't help but notice your weary head.""
""What's wrong with sleep"" I answered her,
""I think I'll have some milk instead.""

The eyes bear holes in creation
A visual vacation

We work our whole lives
For happiness and bread
Don't let me know
The truth about where we've been led.

Every day it's the same old thing
Get up, get dressed, I got to sing

So I'm sitting on the wall
Staring into the eyes of a girl
Everyone is staring at me
Ratio is one to the world

It never takes too long.

You keep me without chains.
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

[Chorus]
Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
When I thought that I was strong.
But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that you're everything I think I need here on the ground.

(History has given us a proclamation which outlasts the ages
The Carol Of These Kings vibrates the soul
Reminding us that a true King is born)

Midnight strikes and aw
See them rushing through the stained doors
Like kids in a sugarcane store
Is this what they stood in rain for?
Suddenly, Isle 3
Stood a sight so angelically
Inhale voice to the sky
Hear the bells ring it goes:

Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

No panic, no stress
Opposite security threat
‘Cause their eyes declared peace be still
In the midst of hopelessness
On their knees all agree
To reconcile to the King of peace
Many voices, one plea
And you can hear them scream it goes:

Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

So we’re laying down our crowns when the carol bell sounds

Now behold the rich and poor
Neighboring and distant shore
A baby King existing more than
A manger in the Inn
The source of life for man
Whose glory lights the land
The remedy for sin in generation and again and again
We’re thankful for gifts and the presents but
Give us the gift of your presence Sir (please)?
‘Cause we all long to be
A symphony of royalty so with this we sing

We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we’ve traveled so far
Field and fountain
Moor and mountain
Following yonder star
And you can hear them scream they said:
Woo

So we’re laying down our crowns
When the carol bell sounds
Following yonder star

Christmas is here

Never been like all the others, you're one of a kind
I know you're feeling like you wanna break free, it's a sign
Just wanna fly above it all, see where you can land
Know that you can do it on your own cause you can
Know that you can conquer all with a plan
Forget about the negatives buried in the sand

Make a change and find a place in your heart you trust
You ain't always gotta take the first card your dealt
In this life only you can represent yourself
Never let your circumstances hold you back
You were born free, never gotta feel trapped
And on the pursuit to happiness you're gonna feel pain

No estaba a gusto. 

Mozos ponga un trozo
De bayoneta y un café, 
Que a la señorita la invita Monsieur 

Y dos alondras nos observan
Sin gran interés 
El camarero está leyendo el ""As""
Con avidez

Los bares, que lugares
Tan gratos para conversar.
No hay como el calor
Del amor en un bar.

Amor, aunque a estas horas
Ya no estoy muy entero, 
Al fin llego el momento
De decirlo te quiero

Pollo, otro bollo
No me tenga que levantar 
No hay como el calo
Del amor en un bar.

Y sirva otra copita más

You're the reason that I'm gone 

And I wonder how 
How you came to change 
And how you lost your way 
My life's just stayed the same 
(Stay the same) 

Couldn't spend my life, always trying to please you 
The time had come for change 
That's when I realised that I really did need you 
And I knew right then I wouldn't take the pain",Stay the Same,1978
Gabriel,"Do you have a vision? 
Do you have a goal? 
I'm watching you shrugging your shoulders, telling me you just don't know! 
Do you get emotional?
Is there something you're passionate about? 
I can tell that you're still searching, still trying to work it all out... 
It takes time... take your time! 
Um hum. You will know when it feels right... 

Where you gonna be in ten years time?
Will you be happy with the way you've been living your life?
Will you be alright?
'cause when you're looking back to now on the years gone by
Will there be something that you say that you should have done right... in your life?

What would you fight for? For what do you stand? 
How will you go about it? Do you have a master plan? 
What are your demons? How much for your soul? 
Have you found religion... and gone down that road? 
I guess we all need something to believe... 
Times haven't changed... that's how its gotta be! 

Where you gonna be in ten years time?
Will you be happy with the way you've been living your life?
Will you be alright?
'cause when you're looking back to now on the years gone by
Will there be something that you say that you should have done right?
We're talking about your life!

Are you a dreamer? Tell me all your dreams! 
Can you say honestly... what you want to be... 
What you do when your back's against the wall? 
Would you stand on your two feet? Would you admit defeat? 
These are the times you need to be strong... 
Don't you know? Don't you know that it's hard! 
Have you learned to find a way... 
You gotta find a way to carry on... 

Where you gonna be in ten years time
Will you be happy with the way you've been living your life?
Will you be alright?
Yeah… when you're looking back to now on the years gone by
Will there be something that you say that you should have done right
We're talking about your life! Your life!! 

Where you gonna be in ten years time
Will you be happy way you've been living your life?
Will you be alright?
Yeah… when you're looking back to now on the years gone by
Will there be something that you say that you should have done right?
We're talking about your life! Your life!!

Where you gonna be in ten years time? 
Will you be all right? 
Tell me will you get it right? Get it right? 

Where you gonna to be in ten years time? 
Will you be happy with the way that you're living your life? 
Do you feel it being right? 

Where you gonna be in ten years time? 
Will you be all right?

To the sunny side of the street

Sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.""
The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""
John Henry told his captain,
""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,
Lord.
I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.""
John Henry said to his shaker,
""Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on
Down.
Just listen to that cold steel ring. Lord, Lord.
Listen to that cold steel ring.""
The man that invented the stream drill
Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor
Heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord,
Lord.
He laid down his hammer and he died.
John Henry had a little woman.
Her name was Polly Ann.
John Henry took sick and went to his bed.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man. Lord,
Lord.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man.
John Henry had a little baby.
You could hold him in the palm of your
Hand.
The last words I heard that poor boy say,
""My daddy was steel-driving man. Lord,
Lord.
My daddy was a steel-driving.""

You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.

Maldita fantasía que se vuelve realidad 
Me falta valentía en medio de este laberinto 
De dudas y nostalgia que me ocultan la verdad 
No renunciaré a la tregua, estoy rendido 
Te confieso y me lo digo, no escaparé a mi corazón 

Desnudo estoy, persiguiendo una razón 
Para quedarme en tu piel bebiendo de la tentación 
Yo, desnudo estoy, descifrando mis manías 
Mis temores, las heridas no cerradas, mis huidas del amor 
Desnudo estoy 

Las penas se derriten y con ellas mi cinismo 
No sé si mi pasado me robó la libertad 
Ahora me doy cuenta que es absurdo el egoísmo 
Pero no pretendo alcanzar la santidad 

No renunciaré a la tregua, estoy rendido 
Te confieso y me lo digo, no escaparé a mi corazón 

Desnudo estoy, persiguiendo una razón 
Para quedarme en tu piel bebiendo de la tentación 
Yo, desnudo estoy, descifrando mis manías 
Mis temores, las heridas no cerradas, mis huidas del amor 
Desnudo estoy 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
No, no, no, no, persiguiendo una razón para quedarme 
Uuuh, en tu interior 

Desnudo estoy (desnudo estoy), persiguiendo una razón

Gabriel Dell,"Anyone can whistle, that's what they say, easy
Anyone can whistle any old day, easy
It's all so simple, relax, let go, let fly
Someone tell me why can't I

I can dance a Tango, I can read Greek, easy
I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

What's hard is simple, what's natural comes hard
Maybe you can show me how to let go
Lower my guard, learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle, whistle for me

It's all so simple, relax, let go, let fly
Someone tell me why, why can't I
I can dance a Tango, I can read Greek, easy
I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

What's hard is simple, what's natural comes hard
Maybe you can show me how to let go
Lower my guard, learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle, whistle for me
Whistle for me

Gabriel Marian,"You act like a prima donna,
Playing so hard to get.
Sittin' so cool and nonchalant,
Draggin' on a cigarette.
You keep a wall all around ya.
I'll get through some day.
I want your love, baby,
Push, don't shove
Gonna chip that stone away.

Chip away,
Chip away at the stone.
I won't stop until your love is my very own.
Chip away,
That's what I'm gonna do.
Sweet little mama,
I wanna get next to you.

You stand like a marble statue,
Trying to look so hard.
All decked out in your antique dress,
While the boys all promenade.
Even a rock will crumble,
If you strike it night and day.
If hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust.
Gonna chip that stone away.

Chip away,
Chip away at the stone.
I won't stop until your love is my very own.
Chip away,
That's what I'm gonna do.
Sweet little mama,
I wanna get next to you.

Chip away,
Chip away at the stone.
Honey, I won't stop until your love is my very own.
Chip away,
That's what I'm wanna do.
Sweet little mama,
I wanna get next to you.

 Yes I do, yes I do.

 Chip away, chip away, at the stone.
Chip away, chip away, at the stone.

I won't stop.
I won't stop.

Como si fuera tu ultimo dia
Porque no sabes cuando te toca
Tu despedida en esta vida loca

Juan se fue de su casa muy enojado
A su trabajo por una fuerte discucion
Con su familia

Se fue de su casa lleno de coraje
Ciego y salvaje
Fue creciendo su ira a toda
Velocidad
Y se fue sin decirle a nadie ni un adios
Pisandole fuerte al acelerador
Mientras maldecia
A su familia por no comprenderlo
Y se fue
Por la carretera sin control
Y no vio al camion que se le atravezo
Que se lo llevo al otro mundo
Para nunca regresas

Vive todos tus dias como si fuera tu ultimo dia
Porque no sabes cuando te toca
Tu despedida en esta vida loca

Por eso vive todos tus dias
Sin tus rencores y con una sonrrisa

Escalando hacia la sima
Cuando escuches este consejo
No todo es como se mira

Hay que vivir con alegria

Y yo no quiero morir
Y no es ke yo fuera un covarde
Quiero recompenzar a mi jefita y a mi padre

Es un lamento y un motivo

Gabriel o Pensador,"A criminalidade toma conta da cidade
A sociedade põe a cupa nas autoridades

O cacique oficial viajou pro Pantanal
Porque aqui a violência tá demais

E lá encontrou um velho índio que usava um fio dental
E fumava um cachimbo da paz

O presidente deu um tapa no cachimbo e na hora
De voltar pra capital ficou com preguiça

Trocou seu paletó pelo fio dental e nomeou
O velho índio pra ministro da justiça

E o novo ministro chegando na cidade,
Achou aquela tribo violenta demais

Viu que todo cara pálida vivia atrás das grades
E chamou a TV e os jornais

E disse: ""Índio chegou trazendo novidade
Índio trouxe o cachimbo da paz

Maresia, sente a maresia
maresia, uuu   

Apaga a fumaça do revólver, da pistola
Manda a fumaça do cachimbo pra cachola

Acende, puxa, prende, passa
Índio quer cachimbo, índio quer fazer fumaça

Todo mundo experimenta o cachimbo da floresta
Dizem que é do bom
Dizem que não presta

Querem proibir, querem liberar
E a polêmica chegou até o congresso

Tudo isso deve ser pra evitar a concorrência
Porque não é Hollywood mas é o sucesso

O cachimbo da paz deixou o povo mais tranqüilo
Mas o fumo acabou porque só tinha oitenta quilos

E o povo aplaudiu quando o índio partiu pra selva
E prometeu voltar com uma tonelada

Só que quando ele voltou ""sujou""!!!
A polícia preparou uma cilada

""O cachimbo da paz foi proibido, entra na caçamba vagabundo!

Vamô pra DP! Ê êê! Índio tá fudido porque lá o pau
Vai comer!""

Maresia, sente a maresia
maresia, uuu   

Apaga a fumaça do revólver, da pistola
Manda a fumaça do cachimbo pra cachola

Acende, puxa, prende, passa
Índio quer cachimbo, índio quer fazer fumaça

Na delegacia só tinha viciado e delinquente
Cada um com um vício e um caso diferente

Um cachaceiro esfaqueou o dono do bar porque ele
Não vendia pinga fiado

E um senhor bebeu uísque demais, acordou com um travestí
E assassinou o coitado

Um viciado no jogo apostou a mulher, perdeu a aposta
E ela foi sequestrada
Era tanta ocorrência, tanta violência que o índio
Não tava entendendo nada

Ele viu que o delegado fumava um charuto fedorento
E acendeu um ""da paz"" pra relaxar

Mas quando foi dar um tapinha
Levou um tapão violento e um chute naquele lugar

Foi mandado pro presídio e no caminho assistiu um
Acidente provocado por excesso de cerveja:

Uma jovem que bebeu demais atropelou
Um padre e os noivos na porta da igreja

E pro índio nada disso faz sentido
Com tantas drogas porque só o seu cachimbo é proibido?

Maresia, sente a maresia
maresia, uuu   

Apaga a fumaça do revólver, da pistola
Manda a fumaça do cachimbo pra cachola
Acende, puxa, prende, passa
Índio quer cachimbo, índio quer fazer fumaça

Na penitenciária o ""índio fora da lei""
Conheceu os criminosos de verdade

Entrando, saindo e voltando cada vez mais
Perigosos pra sociedade, aí, cumpádi, tá rolando
Um sorteio na prisão pra reduzir a super lotação

Todo mês alguns presos tem que ser executados
E o índio dessa vez foi um dos sorteados

E tentou acalmar os outros presos:
""Peraí, vamô Fumar um cachimbinho da paz

Eles começaram a rir e espancaram o velho índio
Até não poder mais e antes de morrer ele pensou:
""Essa tribo é atrasada demais   

Eles querem acabar com a violência,
mas a paz é contra a lei e a lei é contra a paz""
E o cachimbo do índio continuava proibido mas se você quer comprar é mais fácil que pão

Hoje em dia ele é vendido pelos mesmos bandidos que mataram O velho índio na prisão

Maresia, sente a maresia
maresia, uuu   
Apaga a fumaça do revólver, da pistola

Gabriel o Pensador,"Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come
Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come

É, não me distraí, não me distraí
Me deixa aproveitar a sensação um pouco mais
A sensação de esperança que invadiu o meu peito
Não me envergonha com esse velho preconceito

Não me atrapalha agora não, por favor
Não me apavora com as notícias do terror
O seu terror psicológico e as previsões sinistras
Dos seus mapas astrológicos

Não vão fazer o papai aqui fazer pipi na cama
Não sou do tipo que tem medo de sair da lama
Nós não somos covardes

E nunca é tarde pra cuidar de quem a gente ama
A gente sabe se amar, a gente sabe se amar
A gente sabe da vida

A gente sabe somar, e quer saborear a soma dividida
A gente sabe se amar, a gente sabe se amar, a gente sabe da vida
A gente sabe sonhar, e desse sonho a gente não duvida

Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come
Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come

E quem não mata a fome, a fome mata
Quem não mata a fome some
Quem não mata a fome, a fome come
(A fome não é só um nome)
E tem também a outra fome, fora do abdômen

Cara feia, eu vi na cara de um cara
Que matou um homem, por causa dessa outra fome
Fome de vingança, vingança do destino
E essa cara eu já vi na cara de um menino

E os meninos assassinos vão se renovando
E vão nascendo, vão morrendo e vão matando
É que Ellis pensam que o crime é o único caminho
Pra chegar em qualquer tipo de commando

Mas se os meninos forem mais malandros
Vão saber que ser trabalhador não é ser otário
Um bom exemplo vem da nossa presidência
Porque lá quem tá mandando é um operário

A gente sabe somar, e quer saborear a soma dividida
A gente sabe se amar, a gente sabe se amar, a gente sabe da vida
A gente sabe sonhar, e desse sonho a gente não duvida

Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come
Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come

Não faça cara feia de barriga cheia
Não faça cara feia de barriga cheia
Não faça cara feia de barriga cheia
Nem meta a colher em cumbuca alheia

Quem deixa um pé atrás
Nunca chega na frente
Quem tem medo do futuro
Vira escravo do presente

Não me enche com essa fome de derrota
Nem me bota nesse time que defende o pessimismo
Agora eu sei, cansei da linha burra que separa, desune
E empurra todo mundo pro abismo

O caminho é mais pro alto
No mar e no sertão, na favela e no asfalto
Todo mundo sente fome, fome de futuro
Pra que pichar, se eu posso derrubar o muro?

Não é com tanque, nem com trator
Não é com ódio, nem com rancor
Não é com medo, nem com terror
Minha campanha também é paz e amor

Gabriel o Pensador,"Os filha da puta vivem arrumando desculpa
E motivos pra te pegar te usar e depois te desprezar
Te tomam tudo, a vida, a grana e a alma
E ainda querem que você tenha calma

Por isso eu vou falar
(Pode falar)
Vou contar
(Pode contar)

Sobre os filha da puta que só querem te roubar
Fundam uma igreja ora veja onde já se viu
Enriquecer com a fé alheia
(Puta-que-pariu)

E é inútil tentarmos abrir os olhos do povo
Pois se um abre os olhos mil olhos fecham de novo
E Ellis dizem que você está com o demônio
Mas o demônio habita no seu patrimônio

E Ellis farão o favor de tomar toda sua grana
Porque a grana pra Ellis é uma coisa profana
Só que aí o demônio vai parar com quem?
No bolso do pastor, e do bispo tamém

Filha da puta, filha da puta, filha da puta
Filha da puta, filha da puta, filha da puta

Filha da puta, escuta o que eu vou te dizer
Você está no poder agora mas um dia vai se fuder
Você está numa boa rindo a toa cheio de graça
Mas todos nós ainda vamos ver a sua desgraça

Você se esconde em Brasília essa ilha cercada de filha da puta
De político fajuto me escuta seu puto
Aprovando leis só para vocês e sua cambada
Arranjando obras superfaturadas

Ellis te exploram te chupam o sangue
Só pensam no lucro da sua gangue
Então escuta, pensa e responda a pergunta
Todo político é um filha da puta?

Filha da puta, filha da puta, filha da puta
Filha da puta, filha da puta, filha da puta

E tem outra espécie
De filha da puta que me emputece
É o pai desnaturado machão frustrado que se esquece
De que o tempo das cavernas já passou

E bate na família quando não devia nem bater com uma flor
Na mulher nas crianças mostrando toda a autoridade
De um homem primata no seu machismo covarde
Quando você vê na rua uma mulher com o olho roxo

Tenha certeza que ela é a mulher de um frouxo
Um Zé Ruela que com ela é agressivo, sem diálogo
Trata como égua porque é um cavalo
O autoritário da família, não tem autoridade além da força bruta
Bate no filho e na filha porque é um fi;ha da puta

A parede desabando e eu lá dentro, acelero e acelera o batimento
Tanto bate até que fura, água mole em pedra dura
Cada louco tem a sua loucura
Eu viajo por isso, quase sempre sem visto

Sei que cada feiticeira tem a sua maneira de transformar

Entrei no mar, olhei pra onda, entrei na onda
Entrei na onda e fiz a onda até a areia
Entrei na onda que corre na minha aldeia
A minha onda não é uma onda qualquer
Da minha onda eu saio de cabeça feita
E na areia uma sereia com pernas de mulher
Mais perfeita do que a onda mais perfeita
Adivinhava o meu futuro com os seus óculos escuros
Me filmando nas esquerdas e direitas
Cheguei na areia e a sereia entrou no mar
E só de onda eu me deitei onde ela deita

Predador virando presa, uma sereia com pernas de mulher

Oh young blood
I had this picture of a friend I loved
He pulled the trigger but it didn't end
Now he is gone to make amends
He had no say
Was born to sway between delight from might
And pillow fighting with the demon trend,
Like it be his best friend

After the funeral when people went home
I looked all around me and found myself alone
I did the thing open, was peeking in
Got on my curious and made death furious

Mirame, mirame en la orilla bro,
Gastandome el pellejo
Aguantame antes que me caiga



I bought Oshun
They had her lined up in a liquor store
Between the chicken heads and token toes
For the troubles deep within
I said take them bones
After I took her home and lit a flame
Asked her to do me she should turn me on
Like I'm one of his own

While mama be praying her rosary
And daddy be counting the cavalry
I am with the rest of the kids at the rodeo
Watching how the bulls all go crazy

So dance to the rhythm
Bounce to the rhythm
Shake to the rhythm
And you roll to the rhythm
Sweat to the rhythm
Get wet to the rhythm

Make love to the rhythm
Clean up to the rhythm
When you movin'
You come alive
And when ya grooving
In rhythm we survive, so
Don't panic, don't panic
No drum machine
This is all organic

Stickie on percussion and we mashin' up the place

Givin' you a sound you can shake your soul to so
Hip hoppas punk rockas
Roots rockas even wood stockas

Throw your hands high and
Tell me who you are
