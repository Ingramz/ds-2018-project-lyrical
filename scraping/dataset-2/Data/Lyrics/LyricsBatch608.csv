Little River Band,"I live alone, I'm little known, 
I'm mad about my lady and glad about the way she loves me, 
I go away, but on the day, 
Hate it to be leavin' and want just to be seeing my lady. 
And when I come home, she gives me a feelin' so fine, 
I'm still there locked in her mind, 
And I know it, know it, she wants to be with me, 
I see it all in her eyes, her feelings are hard to disguise, 
And I know it. We talked about the world 
And wanted to share it someday, but never had the chance 
'Cause circumstance took us away, so many things on my mind left to say,
So many nights, and empty days. Now I live alone, I'm little known, 
I'm mad about my lady and sad about the way, 
I'm mad about my lady. And when I come home, 
She gives me a feelin' so fine, I'm still there locked in her mind,
And I know it, know it, she wants to be with me, 
I see it all in her eyes, her feelings are hard to disguise, 
And I know it.",I Know It,1975
Little River Band,"Looked at my window for Robinson Crusoe
All I can see is Daniel Defoe
Everyone movin' in different directions
I don't know which way I can go, tell me

Now I like the blues and I like cathedrals
I like the ladies' hands on my knee
I don't care what you think of my music
I sure care a lot what you think about me

Meanwhile, the man inside me rages
He's tryin' to be free, you know he tryin' to be released
Meanwhile, clean out your cages
The nearer you're gonna get, the closer you're gonna be

The nearer you'll get, the closer you'll be
The nearer you'll get, the closer you'll be
The nearer you get, the closer you'll be

I like the blues and I like the Beatles
I like the ladies' hands on my knee
I don't care what you think of my music
I sure care a lot what you think about me

Meanwhile, the man inside me rages
He's trying to be free, you know he's tryin' to be released
Meanwhile, clean out your cages
The nearer you're gonna get, the closer you're gonna be

The nearer you'll get, the closer you'll be
The nearer you'll get, the closer you'll be
The nearer you get, the closer you'll be

Little River Band,"We used to hang around, and used to be in town almost everyday, 
I used to be a man, you used to understand me in every way, 
But now you don't hardly know me, 
I've changed and I'm different now, 
Oh, you don't even know me, 
I've changed and I'm different now. 

Used to be in school, together played the fool, 
But I let it go, now I'm on the street, 
And if we should ever meet I'd let you know, 
How I've changed and I'm different, 
Changed and different now, no, no, no, 
You wouldn't even know me, 
I've changed and I'm different now. 

You don't know, but I need it so, 
And it's breakin' me down, 
The endless motels they never make me feel at home, 
The way I wanna feel. 

Pretty cool sax solo 
We used to hang around, 
And used to be in town almost everyday, 
I used to be a man, 
And you used to understand me in every way, 
Now you don't hardly know me, 
I've changed and different now. 

Ah, look at me, you wouldn't even know me, 
No, no, no, no. Changed and I'm different, 
Changed and I'm different now, changed and I'm different, 
Changed and I'm different now.

Ah, look at me, you wouldn't even know me, 
No, no, no, no. Changed and I'm different, 
Changed and I'm different now, changed and I'm different, 
Changed and I'm different now.

Oh, its just the be side now.",Changed and Different,1976
Little River Band,"It's hard to be a loner so they tell me, 
But its easy to be alone here and I know, 
I used to live with country girls, 
Now the city's all I know, 
And I'm tryin' to find a way to get back home, 
I'm goin' home. 

Well, it's hard to feel unhappy in the country, 
But it's easy for the city life to bring you down, 
I used to know some country girls, 
And they never were unkind, 
It's hard to tear their memory from my mind, 
You know they're on my mind, oh. 

So I have to get away, way down, 
Way down in the country, 
Where the city life won't change me, 
In the country. 

I'm talking about the country girls, 
Thinking about a country world, have you been there,
Have you been there? 
Find the people, 
They're easy to get to know. 

Go to the country, go to the country, go 
All right, yeah. 
Ooh, it's hard to be a loner so they tell me, 
But its easy to be alone here and I know, I know, 
I know, I used to live with country girls, 
And they never were unkind, 
It's so hard to tear their memory from my mind, 
Whoa, my mind. 

I have to get away, way down, 
Way down in the country, 
Where the city lights won't change me. 

In the country, in the country. 
Walk down here, be a part of real living, 
Country air is taking me home again, 
Used to be living alone in the city. 

Country girls are getting to me, yeah, country girl, 
I just want to be there. 

She takes me, country girl, ah, 
You make me feel like I've found a way to get back home.",Country Girls,1976
Little River Band,"Woh, I'm broke again
Blew my money on the smell of gin
Woh, here I go again
Fallin' down on the same old sin

Oh I know, I know
I know I'm wrong
And I know, I know
I know I'm gone

If I don't change my way-ays
I'm livin' by numbered day-ays
It can never la-ast
My life is disappearing fast
But each day I live some more
Missin' my baby so
Pushin' myself to skid row
There's not much further 
I know...

And if I saw her face
I'd feel so out of place
Wouldn't know what to say-ay
I'd have to look the other way-ay-ay
I'm down on my luck again
Just can't smile and pretend
I'm really a broken man

Woh, I'm broke again
I blew my money on the smell of gin
Woh, here I go again
Fallin' down on the same old sin
Woh, I'm broke again
Blew my money, now I'm broke again
Woh, I'm broke again
Blew my money, now I'm broke again",Broke Again,1977
Little River Band,"We all say that we don't care for money
Money takes a second place
Now I don't care, but it seems kind of funny
Me and the boys in a race

And in between times, crossing county lines
Drinking cheap red wines, coping with our ups and downs

And the band just keeps on a-rollin', we all keep it on goin'
Have another on me, one for the road

Day in, day out, times keep a-changing
Every night a different crowd
It's hard keeping track of how our life's rearranging
At times it helps to cry out loud

As we get older, we'll go our separate ways
Look for better days, there maybe ain't a second chance

And the band just keeps on a-rollin', we all keep it on goin'
Have another on me, one for the road

When the sun don't shine, we hardly get time to be living
We get no rest, but we do our best every night
When we're feeling down, we can call our town
It's at the end of a telephone line
It's sad that we won't be goin' home for a long time

And the band just keeps on a-rollin', we all keep it on goin'
Have another on me, one for the road

And the band just keeps on a-rollin', we all keep it on goin'
The band just keeps on a-rollin', we all keep it on goin'
The band just keeps on a-rollin', we all keep it on goin'
The band just keeps on a-rollin', we all keep it on goin'",One for the Road,1978
Little River Band,"You suddenly find you're standing
Looking over the edge of time
You can't remember handling
Situations and nursery rhymes
Carry me gently 'cross the water
Find me a place where I can hide
Blow me breezes never faulter

Lead me back to sanity's side
Lead me back to sanity's side
I've been a few places darling
Experimented and looked around
It's time I was returning
Get my feet back on solid ground
Carry me gently 'cross the water

Find me a place where I can hide
Blow me breezes never faulter
Lead me back to sanity's side
Lead me back to sanity's side
Out so far I never thought that I would get back
Nearly touched a star
I burnt my fingers tryin' to hold it

It's impossible I should have known it

Little River Band,"Give me the hand of the one I love
Take me away to the sunshine land
I've had enough of this crazy life
Workin' so hard like a mad man

Keep on writin' me mama
Keep on sendin' me news
Keep on wiring me money
Till the blues take me home

Cold, rainy weather
Always getting' me down
Strange talkin' people
Showing me the way

Little River Band,"Friday night it was late, I was walking you home
We got down to the gate, I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?
How to tell you girl, I want to build my world around you
Wanna tell you that it's true
I wanna make you understand I'm talking about a lifetime plan

Well that's the way it began, we were hand-in-hand
Glen Miller's band was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more
And those Porter's tunes made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
On the way back home I promised you'd never be alone

Hurry, don't be late
I can't hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark, walking through the park
And reminiscing

Friday night it was late, I was walking you home
We got down to the gate, I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?
Now as the years roll on, each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing, spending the hours reminiscing

Hurry, don't be late
I can't hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark, walking through the park
And reminiscing",Reminiscing,1979
Little River Band,"Down by the Jordan, it's early in the morning the sun is in the sky 
All the people pass by there's magic in the air, 
Some stop to stare at a man who says he cares 
People cam from miles to hear what he had to say some of them believe in him 
And some just walked away He tried to explain, 
A fall from paradise was meant to be disbelief showed in their eyes, 
Drowning out his distant cries ""I'm telling the truth to you brother 
Telling it true to you sister go tell the truth to the others all over the land"" 
Now we're here on the planet to live, we're able to love and able to give 
There's a lot going down, some win and some lose still we're able to choose 
But think of the times you cry in the night kicked through the years 
There is no choice we have to fight through it all the world goes on, 
It's another day people rushing to a fro, counting hours as they go 
I tried to explain our fall from paradise was meant to be it's written down 
For all to hear, there's not much time, the time is near 
""I'm telling it true to you brother telling it true to you sister 
Go tell the truth to the others all over the land"" yeah, yeah",Fall from Paradise,1980
Little River Band,"I don't worry no more, I've given up tryin', 
It's just like before, 
People pass by me, who try to criticize me, 
You're coming back to knock on my door.

I don't worry no more, I don't worry no more. 
Am I losing my mind, am I losing all direction, 
Is my approach the wrong kind, 
Everyday confusion, is giving me illusion, 
My sanity I'm trying to find. 

Am I losing my mind, am I losing my mind. 
I keep on thinkin' tomorrow, will bring a brighter today, 
And if I beg, steal or borrow, there's no use running away, 
You know what people will say 

""Never thinking on your own, you sit home by the telephone, 
I'm telling you right from the start, 
What you must do will break your heart

Little River Band,"Many a time the thought crossed my mind
Wonderin' 'bout people who walk around blind
They don't seem to see the light of day
Everything is just okay

Taking no head of what they can learn
Running in circles, no point of return
Heading for the door that reads escape
Anything that they can take

Hey boys, come out and dig the dance
Come on and take a chance
Believe in the light of day

Lonesome nights and wasted days
Leads a man from his true ways
Yet he tells you he nobody's fool
Breaking every golden rule

Hey boys, come out and dig the dance
Come on and take a chance
Believe in the light of day

Keep a watch on the sandman of time
Will he gaze into your eyes or mine?
Will he knock on your door and invite you to the other side?
Catch him writing the score as he takes you on another ride
Hang on tight boy, you're starting to slide

Hey boys, come out and dig the dance
Come on and take a chance

WRITER DAVID BRIGGS

You come to me, ask me for that money again, you say that you need it, to ease that nagging feeling inside your brain, you know I love you like a brother, that's why I'm holding out on you, I'll give most anything I can, to see that you pull through. You gotta keep fighting for your life, don't you ever give in, it's such a sensless suicide, letting the needle win. Life is precious too us all, you got to cling to that thread, it's no use you thinking you won't be found in some back alley dead, you're telling me you can't stop, no you can't change, you're caught up in that web, instead of running, it's time to face up to those forgotten feelings inside your head. You gotta keep fighting for your life, don't you ever give in, it's such a sensless suicide, letting the needle win. Oh, my friend you're so fragile, you blow like a leaf in the wind, it's time to ask yourself why, you're hiding away, you're locking the door, don't let no one else in ...

Little River Band,"We are riding on our rainbow
It's nearly at an end
It was given as a promise 
To each and every man
It's a long time since we started 
And the days left now are few
It seems the words sent long ago were true

Life goes on forever
But it changes like the tide
There's a meaning for existence
No need to run and hide
We are fighting for our freedom
We are searching for a way
And we live in hope of some eternal day

We are waiting, we're impatient
We're unfaithful, we are true
There's a lesson in the learning 
Of the different things we do
As it was in the beginning
It shall be at the end
We will come full circle to begin again

Search your heart before you die
Is the cost way too high
To explain all the tears 
We have caused throughout the years
When everything is finished 
And we've done all that we can
Will we come full circle to begin again",Full Circle,1981
Little River Band,"I've changed my mind

I've learned my lesson

Changing my point of view
Is teaching me something new

Guiding light I need you here tonight
I'm walking in the dark alone, close the door
A thousand years or more
Until my guiding light comes shining through

Morning star how you found me wandering near and far

They all say time will heal
But they don't know how I feel

May good fortune be your guide

The winds of change made you come of age
Down in the street was a sea of silence
They couldn't heal you but they shared your pain

You were left to be the lonely one
Now you know you're not the only one

He's so busy with all his plans, got no time for his greatest fan
His son, son of a famous man, keeps on giving you alibis

But other people around keep on draggin' me down to the ground

And every question I raise

Forget your cares and worries
You know that we'll get by, yes, we'll get by

Ain't getting down on bended knee

Sometimes I could hear the whistle blow
My father pushed his headlights, through that northern English rain
He was proud of everything he drove

And mother's hair was fashioned, for that very special day
She cried on board the liner and tried to wave good-bye
Five weeks of remembering, those names we couldn't say

I share my life with the immigrants and the ramblers
I drink my wine with the middlemen and the gamblers

I spend my time with schemers on the phone
But when I dream, I dream alone
I dream alone, I dream alone, I dream alone

As soon as we set foot on the sun-burnt land
The mountains all around us ran with fire
My family knew right then that our best laid plans
Would have to reach a lot higher

I share my life with the immigrants and the ramblers
I drink my wine with the middlemen and the gamblers

But when I dream, I dream alone
I dream alone, I dream alone, I dream alone

Windows all aglow from the brand new TV sets
Screen door always slamming in that endless summer heat

And the rain turns into thunder

In the madness of my day
In a world without much kindness

I can see your shadow
Right there on the ground
And every time I call your name

When I find myself in a faceless crowd
I know you're right behind me baby

Every day becomes a year
How to keep a cool perspective
Isn't always very clear

I need all the shelter
Your lovin' can provide
Like a bridge across the raging river
Take me to the other side

Every time I turn around
I can see your shadow
Right there on the ground
And every time I call your name

And my heart begins to pound

We got down to the gate and I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right
Now as the years roll on
Each time we hear our favorite song 
The memories come along 
Older times we're missing 
Spending the hours reminiscing

Hurry, don't be late, I can hardly wait

We'll go dancing in the dark

Little River Band,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Wanna tell you that it's true
I wanna make you understand I'm talking about a lifetime plan

Well that's the way it began, we were hand-in-hand
Glen Miller's band was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more
And those Porter's tunes made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
On the way back home I promised you'd never be alone

Hurry, don't be late
I can't hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark, walking through the park

Blinded by Stars


My blood does remember the rhythm of a drum

Beat by a boy soldier whose revolution won

I?ve carried pretty flowers to fallen heroes graves

& stood in silence honoring the price our fathers paid


This was their flag but this ain?t their fight

Dirty with oil tattered by spite

This was their flag but this ain?t their fight


So what do you call justice & what is freedom for

Don?t let the towncrier decide if we go to war

'cause this ain?t about your medla

The choice is of the soul

& hate is never brave while mercy?s always, always sold


Blinded by stars tangled in stripes

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

Dirty with oil tattered by spite

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

This is my flag but this ain?t my fight


Now I was born a rebel, I question what I?m told

No wonder this young skin I?m wearin?

Feels so old


Don?t be blinded by stars tangled in stripes

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

Dirty with oil tattered by spite

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

This I s my flag but this ain?t my fight

Lonesome Road Blues


I walked on down that lonesome line

Hung my head and I cried

I wept and I cried under a willow tree

Out by the deep blue sea

My mama, my dear papa can be found,

And my brother on a county road

Now I been down that long plank walk,

I?m on my way back home


You cause me to weep, you do cause me to moan

You cause me to leave my home

I cried last night and the night before

I swear I won?t cry anymore


Your fast mail train comin round that track

Killed my brown eyed boy

They took him down that smokey track

Brought him back on a cooling board

Now I?m lookin down that lonesome line

Just as far as I care to see

I have no money lost my brown eyed boy

These blues won?t set me free


You do cause me to weep, you do cause me to moan

You cause me to leave my home

I cried last night and the night before

I swear I won?t cry anymore

Little Sadie,"Gonna take a long time to get over you
Love's poison addiction offers me no rescue
Gonna be a hard road back to where I started from
'Cause you touched the deepest part of me and filled me
With your song
And I sang along

I believe in you and what you gotta do
But what you're goin' through is poison,
Poison to the two of us
Used to stand so tall
'Til I took the fall, greatest fall of all
Was when I fell for you

Our cloudy skies held lonely forms
Your anger familiar thick as air before a storm
Now lookin' back I know the truth was plain to see
I built my world around you 'cause I
I needed to believe
And I still believe

But the pleasures of a foolish paradise
Is nothing but a sin",Poison,2004

Sadie?s Song


Pretty boy, my faithless fallen angel

Took me completely in his arms

In his eyes, I saw Eden?s garden

But the serpent lay hidden in his charms

Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair

Til that fateful day when I followed him there


He said, climb, little Sadie higher

Spread them downy wings and fly

You will find your crown of gilded glory next to mine

Climb, little Sadie, climb


Icy winds up on Lookout Mountain

Chilled two bodies to the bone

But for that man, I did gladly lay down my back

Upon a bed of stone

Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair

Til that fateful day when I followed him there


Something?s wrong, I heard my voices whisper

I heard ?em whisper something?s wrong

A single shot, he said, ?Fare thee well, Sadie?

The round was cold, my breath was gone

Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair

Til that fateful day when I followed him there

There's an aching hurt inside of me

Just because I don't cry

Is how to take it inside

You turn your cheek you get slapped

What I want baby most of all is the only thing I can't touch

Would you pick up the pieces if I stumble and fall
If my world falls apart could you keep it together
If I can't have you I don't want no one at all


Just because I'm so quiet
Just because I don't cry
The hardest lesson to learn girl
Is how to take it inside


There's leather and jewels to soothe me
But it really isn't what I need
There's an aching hurt inside of me
And it's the kind of thing you don't see

Sitting down in the cold rain
Cheering for the wrong team
'Cause we drank too much

Mary Ann was something
We were all just nothings
But we made it with her
And the last, we made up

We were on our way
How could those crazy days be so long ago?
We were flyin' high, best friends for life
Don't know where it all goes
But you wake one day and the only thing left
You can say is so long

Made it through the '90s
Careless youth behind me
Fresh out of college
And bound to conquer the world

Charlie went to Detroit
Bobby had some exploits
And me, I got married
To a sweet brown-eyed girl
And she held my heart
Somehow, it fell apart

So long ago, we were flyin' high, best friends for life
Don't know where it all goes
But you wake one day and the only thing left
You can say is so long
Time sure can slip through your hands
Time doesn't care about your man

Sunday morning, cold rain
Wipin' of the tear stains
Saying goodbye to Charlie
Man, you left us to soon

Later on at Harrys
Gathered 'round the chair legs
Memories untouched
To the life that we knew

We were on our way
How can just yesterday be so long ago?
We were flyin' high, best friends for life
Don't know where it all goes
But you wake one day and the only thing left
You can say, we'll just say, so long, so long

In the moonlight he could see her blowing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster, waiting there for her brave

Runnin' bear loved little white dove with a love big as the sky
Runnin' bear loved little white dove with a love that couldn't die

Runnin' bear dove in the water, little white dove did the same
And they swam out to each other through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met, the ragin' river pulled them down
Now they'll always be together in that happy hunting ground
