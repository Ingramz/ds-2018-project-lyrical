Guy Clark,"He was sitting in the corner
At a table all alone
A candle burnin' in the darkness
His glass of wine was almost gone

And something about him felt familiar
And it made me stop and stare
The way he held his hands before him
Looked like he was lost in prayer

Hey son, what are you lookin' at?
Why do your eyes look so sad?
There's somethin' in the way he sat there
It made me think about my dad

I'm lookin' for the answer
Just like everyone
I know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and the son

Hey son, why don't you pull up one of those empty chairs?
Bring it over here by my side
Buy me a glass of wine
This looks like a real good place to hide

You know I've always been a fisherman
Fishin' for souls along the way
You kind of remind me of my only son
And I lost him 33 years ago today

I'm lookin' for the answer
Just like everyone
I know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and the son

There's somethin' I must give you
The compass that my father made
It'll point you in the right direction
In case you ever lose your way

You know I've got somethin' here in my pocket
This is little silver cross
I think my son would want you to have it
When you think all the hope is lost

We're lookin' for the answer
Just like everyone
We know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and the son

I left him sitting at his table
But I didn't feel alone
For a moment I could see the light
Oh, we were almost home
For a moment I could see the light
Oh, we were almost home
",Almost Home,2006
Guy Clark,"Well she ain't got no cell phone
You got to call her when she's home
All of her clocks have got hands
Now don't try to e-mail her,
you've got to snail mail her
You got to take pen in hand

Ones and zeros, zeros and ones
She'll have none of that virtual fun
She's a real deal ol' fashioned analog girl
In a digital world

Now she gets online out in the backyard
Hangin' up her ol' blue jeans
She's got all of the memory she can live with
She really hates drum machines

Ones and zeros, zeros and ones
She'll have none of that virtual fun
She's a real deal ol' fashioned analog girl
In a digital world

Out in the garden she's got a website
It sparkles in the mornin' dew
Got a mouse in her pocket,
she's got spam in a can
What's an analog girl to do

Ones and zeros, zeros and ones
She'll have none of that virtual fun
She's a real deal ol' fashioned analog girl

Guy Clark,"Meanwhile down on Biel Street
Drinking in a Biel Street bar
There's a fog rollin' off the Mississippi
Has anybody seen Arkansas?

And the deckhands from the toll boats
Come ashore wearin' Mexican shoes
They headed strait for Graceland
It was the first thing they wanted to do

Cinco de Mayo in Memphis
Marchetti singin' the blues
Soul sisters hugging Senoritas
All sportin' Blue suede shoes

Pork pie hats and sombreros
Hangin' on a downtown street
Swingin' pool cues at Pinatas
Don't that river smell sweet?

And they all come to get 'em some Memphis
A little somethin' for their souls
'Lone riders land up with limousines
Hey, they all came to rock and roll

Cinco de Mayo in Memphis
Marchetti singin' the blues
Southern belles and Senoritas
All sportin' Blue suede shoes

Guy Clark,"Now there's a man you'll hear about
Most anywhere you go,
And his holdings are in Texas
And his name is Diamond Joe.

And he carries all his money
In a diamond-studded jar.
He never took much trouble
With the process of the law.

I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,
Did offer him my hand,
He gave a string of horses
So old they could not stand.

And I nearly starved to death, boys,
He did mistreat me so,
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe.

Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw,
Nearly drove me crazy
With the waggin' of his jaw.

And the tellin' of his story,
Mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe.

Now, I tried three times to quit him,
But he did argue so
I'm still punchin' cattle
In the pay of Diamond Joe.

And when I'm called up yonder
And it's my time to go,
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.",Diamond Joe,2006
Guy Clark,"Now when you write your expose'
I wish you'd leave me out
I'd just as soon you didn't use my name
I'm not crazy 'bout the way
Your book might make me look
I might have been there but
You can't hold me to blame

Now when you write your expose'
Don't kiss and tell it all
No one likes a tattletale writin' on the wall
Don't go talkin' out of school
'Cause you know you got no call
If you can't say somethin' nice
Don't say anything at all

Well I opened up my heart to you
I let it all hang out
I told you stuff that no one else should know
So don't betray my trust in you
Shame, shame if you do
Don't drag that crap back up just let it go

Now when you write your expose'
Don't kiss and tell it all

Guy Clark,"Well, he used to be a pretty good rodeo clown
People loved to watch him horse around
When that rank black bucked em all down
He was a pretty good rodeo clown

Till he met the gal who sold the souvenirs
He could make her smile from ear to ear
They stayed up all night drinkin' rodeo beer
He was a pretty good rodeo clown

He don't laugh much anymore
Since she locked her trailer door
Tears and grease paint will not mix
And old dogs will not learn new tricks
Hes got that smile painted on,
Nobody knows something's wrong
She broke his funny bone
Broke his funny bone

When that new young bull rider came on the circuit
Oh in about, eight seconds flat she was gone
Now he asks himself if she was worth it
You can hide your heart in a barrel for just so long

He don't laugh much anymore
Since she locked her trailer door
Tears and grease paint will not mix
And old dogs will not learn new tricks
Hes got that smile painted on,
And we all knew what was wrong
She broke his funny bone
She broke his funny bone couch",Funny Bone,2006
Guy Clark,"I ain't lookin' for trouble
I can't stay here tonight
I got to leave here on the double
If I want to see the morning light
Don't need no pistol for the tickets
I've got just enough to get us down the line
I don't know what happens next
Your guess is just as good as mine

Move with me Magdalene
I'm tired of the same old scene
There's a greyhound leaving at midnight
If you came with me it'd be like a dream
Come on Magdalene
Move with me Magdalene

I've heard Mexico is easy
I wouldn't stay here if I could
Don't come along just to please you
Let's go while the going's good

Move with me Magdalene
I'm tired of the same old scene
Let's go down to San Miguel
Let's go be somebody else tonight

Guy Clark,"I was sittin' on the fender of someone else's truck
Drinkin' Old Crow whisky, hot 7UP
Out in the parking lot

You can hear the band are playin' right through the wall
Ain't no cover charge, there ain't no last call
Out in the parking lot

Now there's a couple of cowpokes puttin' up there dukes
Wasn't much to it after both of 'em puked
Out in the parking lot

Now someone called the police and the police finally came
And they wrote 'em a couple of tickets
And they took a couple of names out in the parking lot

I love to see the neon dancin' on the gravel
I love to hear the pickup trucks come unraveled
And some have given up, some have given in
Looks like everybody's lookin' for a friend

Oops, there's a couple who could not wait to get home
Now they're probably in love, so let's leave them alone

Hotter than a depot stove

Guy Clark,"Now what's up with the walkin' man
I wonder where he's gone
Marchin' down to Birmingham
I think I'll tag along
Was a walkin' man come by here
A hundred years ago
Walkin' down the trail of tears
Out to Oklahom-i-o out to Oklahome

Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Hand me down my cane
Tune me up my mandolin
I'll be on my way, hey sure does smell like rain

Woody Guthrie was a walkin' man
In the dust bowl days
Had a six string guitar in his hands
He killed a fascist every day
Chuck Berry is a walkin' man
So was Ghandi too
Lace me up my ol' Brogans
That's just what I'll do
I got walkin' left to do

Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Hand me down my cane
Tune me up my mandolin
I'll be on my way, hey
If I had shoes like the walkin' man

I'd walk away and not come back

Guy Clark,"I'd play the Red River Valley
And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, ""Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?""

We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
""Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin'""

Guy Clark,"Well the bus pulled away
In a roaring black cloud
While I stood in the road
And honey I hollered right out loud

Hey darlin' I love you
Hey bus driver whoa
But you can't stop a woman
When she's out of control

[Chorus]
She's crazy for leavin'
I told her so
When the boys at the bus stop
Just said man let her go
She's crazy for leavin'
I told her so
But you can't stop a woman
When she's out of control

So I punched out my truck
On a telephone pole
Now she never looked back
She just said go driver go

Well I know I could have caught her
But I ran out of luck
She was long gone to Lufkin
By the time they cut me out of my truck

[Chorus]

So I kicked and I cussed
That old east Texas road
I throwed rocks at my truck
Which had busted my nose

You add insult to injury
What do you get
You get a bus stop full of honkies
That don't ever forget

Guy Clark,"Standing at the window her face to the glass
As far as she can see the time has come to pass
As far as she can see the sky is all ablaze
And this looks like the first of better days

She's takin' charge of her life for a change
She's takin' it back that she's lost
It's just as clear as the window pane

Guy Clark,"Ain't nothin' in the world that I like better
Than bacon & lettuce & homegrown tomatoes
Up in the mornin' out in the garden

Get you a ripe one don't get a hard one
Plant 'em in the spring eat 'em in the summer
All winter with out 'em's a culinary bummer
I forget all about the sweatin' & diggin'
Everytime I go out & pick me a big one

Homegrown tomatoes homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes
Only two things that money can't buy
That's true love & homegrown tomatoes

You can go out to eat & that's for sure
But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad, put 'em in a stew
You can make your very own tomato juice
Eat 'em with egss, eat 'em with gravy
Eat 'em with beans, pinto or navy
Put 'em on the site put 'em in the middle
Put a homegrown tomato on a hotcake griddle

If I's to change this life I lead
I'd be Johnny Tomato Seed
'Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes in every yard you see
When I die don't bury me
In a box in a cemetery
Out in the garden would be much better
I could be pushin' up homegrown tomatoes",Homegrown Tomatoes [DVD],2007
Guy Clark,"My father had a Randall knife
My mother gave it to him
When he went off to WWII
To save us all from ruin
If you've ever held a Randall knife
Then you know my father well
If a better blade was ever made
It was probably forged in hell 

My father was a good man
A lawyer by his trade
And only once did I ever see
Him misuse the blade
It almost cut his thumb off
When he took it for a tool
The knife was made for darker things
And you could not bend the rules

He let me take it camping once
On a Boy Scout jamboree
And I broke a half an inch off
Trying to stick it in a tree
I hid it from him for a while
But the knife and he were one
He put it in his bottom drawer
Without a hard word one

There it slept and there it stayed
For twenty some odd years
Sort of like Excalibur
Except waiting for a tear 

My father died when I was forty
And I couldn't find a way to cry
Not because I didn't love him
Not because he didn't try
I'd cried for every lesser thing
Whiskey, pain and beauty
But he deserved a better tear
And I was not quite ready

So we took his ashed out to sea
And poured 'em off the stern
And threw the roses in the wake
Of everything we'd learned
When we got back to the house
They asked me what I wanted
Not the law books not the watch
I need the things he's haunted

My hand burned for the Randall knife
There in the bottom drawer
And I found a tear for my father's life
And all that it stood for",Randall Knife [DVD],2007
Guy Clark,"Won't say I love you babe
Won't say I need you babe
But, I'm gonna get you babe
And I will not do you wrong
Livin's mostly wastin' time
I waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's don't take too long
You're soft as glass
And I'm a gentle man
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon.

Days up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some
But don't turn none away
Everything is not enough
Nothin' is to much to bear
Where you been is good and gone
All you keep is the gettin' there
To live is to fly
Low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes

It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think on all the poetry
And the pickin' down the line
I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think to much
On things you leave behind
I may be gone
But it won't be long
I will be a-bringin' back the melody
And the rhythm that I find

We all got holes to fill
Them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own
But choice is yours to make
And time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone
To live is to fly
Low and high,
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the tears out of your eyes",To Live Is to Fly [DVD],2007

They want me to turn around like this is hokie poke
They want to break me down like erv before I choke

And number 20 on the Lakers couldn't hold me y'all
I'm climbing over y'all I'm still scoring
85 percent of y'all awake but still snoring
Got knowledge yourself and now my style is much older now
We dirty ent we all we got we hold it down

Females fans sayin that I'm there baby daddy WHOA
More attention then Justin and Janet
How I Midwest swing and how St Louis ram it
Deerty ent dammit, got more bread than a sandwich
And my writst got more nuggets than Carmello and Camby
Look, I'm from the Lou and I'm important like the arts
So tours look for me like an important part
Find your talent use your talent get your money
Or don't find your talent and don't use it and stay bummy
But that don't owe me cause I built it from scratch
My next shit is a house with a house in the back
Man I'm been while since middle school
I was that little dude that been round more waist lines than hoola hoops

I've dragged trouble through the door
And I've spilled wine on it all

It'll probably bleed through
Maybe I can paint over that

I've got some ink beneath my skin
A good idea at the time
I won't be doing that again
Not with any arm of mine

I left my footprints down the road
And the part of me that shines
Ain't the part of me that's showed

Guy Clark,"Days up and down they come, like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some, don‚Äôt turn them away.
Everything is not enough, and nothing is too much to bare
Where you‚Äôve been it‚Äôs good and gone, all you keep is the gettin' there

Oh, to live is to fly,
Both low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes.

We all got holes to fill, them holes are all as real
Some fall on you like a storm, sometimes you dig your own
The choice is yours to make, time is yours to take
Some sail up on the sea, some toil upon the stone.

Oh, to live is to fly,
Both low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes.

Goodbye to all, my friends, it‚Äôs time to go again
Think of all the poetry and the picking down the line
I‚Äôll miss the sister beer, the bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don‚Äôt pay to think too much on the things you leave behind.

Oh, to live is to fly,
Both low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes.

Shake the dust off of your wings
And the tears out of your eyes.",To Live Is to Fly,2012
Guy Clark,"There's nothin' like cornmeal on a dance-hall floor for dancin' the night away,
Slippin' and slidin', effortlessly glidin' in the arms of my sweet Lillie Mae,
So I shined up my boots and ironed my shirt, and pulled on some new blue jeans.
Oh, I brushed off my hat, slicked back my hair; I'll beat all that she's ever seen.

There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Doin' the cornmeal waltz.

Way out on Ranch Road 17 there's a dance hall in the live-oak trees,
Yellow lights strung up all around, so all the little kids can see.
Pickups are parked near to the road; the beer is so cold it might freeze.
Stars are all out, the band's in tune, and it smells like a barbecue breeze.

There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Doin' the cornmeal waltz.

Beat-up old Stetsons, beehive hair, belt buckles bumpin' in time.
There's little girls dancin' on their daddies' toes, spinnin' around on a dime.
Grandma and Grandpa are out on the floor, dancin' like they've lost their minds.
There's old maids and bachelors and sweethearts alike, all movin' in three-quarter time.

There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Just doin' the cornmeal waltz.",Cornmeal Waltz,2013

That shines in the Mexico sun.
There are boats and they cross from one side to the other,
At dusk when the hot day is done.
From there to Acu√±a to Del Rio, Texas,
You valley up through San Antone.
With the pesos I've saved up for years then I'll trade
For the chance to send dollars back home.

Coyote, coyote, qu√© hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun.
Coyote, qu√© hiciste cabron?

He steps out of the shadows, he won't look in my eyes
His hand's out to take all I've got.
He says that he's smuggled a thousand good men
And he says that he's never been caught.
So with seventeen other, braceros like cattle
Packed in for that long final ride.
In the semi-truck crossing the border it's dark,
And it's hot as an oven inside.

Coyote, coyote, qu√© hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun.
Coyote, qu√© hiciste cabron?

The braceros are asking in whispers,
Why the truck stopped in the heat of the day?
At first sign of trouble, he's left us all there
By the road and he's walking away.

Swallow it down with a shot of pride,
And as pebble just step outside.

You gotta draw the line somewhere.

Guy Clark,"I decided to improve my social station
I joined a fraternity organisation
Tucked in my shirt
Signed on the line
Right away they said about to improve my mind
The car I drove
The books I read
The food I ate
The booze I drank
The girls I took out
My breath

Said ""Kid, we don't much like the way you walk
And you gonna have to change the way you talk""
They said ""your dress is kind of sludge
And your attitude is mighty grudge""
Said ""you got to learn to bubble""
""You got to bubble with enthusiasm"" I started bubble
""Most important thing you can't forget
Is learning the entire Greek alphabet""
I never did really understand
That that's gonna make me anymore a man
But I learned it
I can whip through that Son-of-a-beta backwards in five seconds
Then they hit me with some pretty bad news
Concerning the payment of monthly dues
I never did know where that money went
I never was sure it was well spent
But I paid it
I'm no trouble causer and besides I figured that's life
If you want good friends it gonna cost you

Well, finally got to be party time
I got a great big old jug of wine
I went back to the house in about an hour
When the boy's were drinking whiskey sours
Brandy Alexanders
Frozen daquires
Reciting the Greek alphabet to one another

I could see I was gonna have to do my very best
To get myself out of that fraternity mess
I stood right there outside the door
And I chugged that wine like never before
Walked inside and bubbled
All over a couple of their dates

So now everything's back to normal again
But there is still lots of room for improvement my friend
'Cause that fraternity stuff is too much for me
Next time I'm gonna join a sorority

took about six hours or so
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
said they'd let me know
I put in my time till the Pocono line
shut down two years ago
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
now I can't stay there no more


Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
to move some old cars around
maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out
van and do a little settlin' down
Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
and the junkyard's a pretty good ways
that job's about a half week old besides
it'd be gone now anyway


Unemployment said I got no more checks
and they showed me to the hall
my brother died in Georgia some time ago
I got no one left to call
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
a little short on food that's all
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
we're headed down into fall


I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
hustled up a little dough
but I got drunk and I woke up rolled
a couple of months ago
they got my harp and they got my dollar
them low life so and so's
harps cost money and I ain't got it
it's my own fault I suppose


The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
two freights everyday
if it was just me I'd be headed south
but Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
says we gotta wait and see
in my heart I know it's a little boy
hope he don't end up like me


Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend
I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
hope she don't break down and cry


Marie she didn't wake up this morning
she didn't even try
she just rolled over and went to heaven
my little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
caught a Chesapeak on the fly

so's to meet me by and by

Plain it was she did agree

His four to hart, and his trey to spade

Preparations soon where made

They voted club the days commander
Gave him an army face and number
All but the outlaw jack of diamonds
And the aces in the sky

Spirit me a game of stud
Stakes unscarred by limitation
Between a man named Gold and man named Mud

Till his long, green eyes did glow
And Mud was left with the sighs and trembles
Watching his hard earned money go

Flushes fell on Gold like water
Tens they paired and paired again
But the aces only flew through heaven
And the diamond jack called no man friend

Now, the Diamond Queen saw Muds ordeal
Began to think of her long lost son
Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy
And prayed to the angels every one

Now, the Diamond Queen, she prayed and prayed
And the Diamond Angel filled Muds hole
The wicked King of Clubs himself
Fell in face down in front of Gold

Now, three kings come to Clubs command
But the angels from the sky did ride
Three kings up on the streets of Gold
Three fireballs on the muddy side

But Lord, that Queen of Diamond's joy
When the outlaw in the heavenly hall
Turned out to be a wandering boy

And Mud he raised and Gold did call
And the smile just melted on his face

Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles

When things were not so complex.
And how he worshiped the ground she walked on.

A prince could have within his keeping;
His spells to weave and steal a heart
Within her breast, but only sleeping.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long

Got together a new kind of orchestree

Bring back the memory of a thrill
I've been looking high and I've been looking low
Looking for my Shanghai Lil

I learned to love her
The little devil was just a butterfly
But you'd discover something on the level
Shining in her eye

Oh, I've been trying to forget her
But what's the use, I never will
I'll be looking high and I'll be looking low

Guy Lombardo,"Too many tears, each night I go to bed
I lie awake and shed too many tears
Your memory is bringing me too many tears

Too many years I wasted loving you
And you know I've been through
Too many years I cared a lot what have I got

Too many tears, I know I should have found a new love
And don't you think I didn't try?
But I found out a number two love, never seems to satisfy

I gave you everything
And in return what did you leave for souvenirs?

That we were really through
I said I didn't love her
That we'd begin anew

But we just couldn't say goodbye

The chair and then the sofa
They broke right down and cried
The curtains started wavin'
For me to come inside
I tell you confidentially
The tears were hard to hide
And we just couldn't say goodbye

The clock was striking twelve o'clock
It smiled on us below
With folded hands it seemed to say
""We'll miss you if you go""

So I went back and kissed her
And when I looked around
The room was singin' love songs
And dancing up and down
And now we're both so happy
Because at last we've found.
That we just couldn't say goodbye",We Just Couldn't Say Goodbye,1989

I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Guy Lombardo,"Oh, how we danced on the night we were wed
We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said
The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies
Except for a few that were there in your eyes

Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating, were murmuring low

And starting on a family tree,

It's Love-Love-Love!
If your knees go knockety knock;
It's Love-Love-Love!
If you're coo-koo like the coo-koo in the clock
It's Love-Love-Love!

Complete with running dog and cat,
Imagine having running dog and cat
And we will have welcome all over the mat.

And she smiled while I softly played my Penny Serenade

Si, si, si, you can hear it for a penny
Si, si, si, just a Penny Serenade

In her eyes shone the tender dawn of love and sweet surrender
As for me, in my heart I played a lover's serenade

Si, si, si, hear my love song for a penny
Si, si, si, just a Penny Serenade

For that night so divine she was mine, no word had been spoken
When I woke from my dream she was gone, my poor heart was broken

Still I pray that wherever she may be she will remember
In her heart she will always hear my Penny Serenade

So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane 
Couldn't compare to you 
You are perfection you're my idea 
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you 
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share
Sweetheart the way we care

I see the magic of Christmas shining bright, shining bright
Like the star that led the kings and shepherds
All to a tiny stable on that night, Holy night
With the lambs and the donkeys, cows and the camels breathing low

The perfect Child of God was born so long ago
In the dancing flame of the Christmas candles
I hear the whisper of angels soft and clear, soft and clear

As they watched in the night over Baby Jesus
I know they're watching me, always near, always near
I love the Christmas gifts and the trimming of the tree

I'm my own Grandpa  
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
Oh, I'm my own Grandpa

Many many years ago
When I was twenty-three
I was married to a widow 
Who was pretty as can be
This widow had a grown up daughter
Who had hair of red
My father fell in love with her
And soon they too were wed

This made my Dad my son in-law
And changed my very life
For my Daughter was my Mother 
Cause' she was my Father's wife
To complicate the matter
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the Father of a bouncing baby boy

My little baby then became
A brother in-law to Dad
And soon became my Uncle
Though it made me very sad
For if he was my Uncle
Then that also made him Brother
Of the widow's grown up Daughter
Who of course was my Step-Mother

I'm my own Grandpa
I'm my own Grandpa  
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
Oh, I'm my own Grandpa

My Father's wife then had a Son
Who kept them on the run
And he became my Grandchild
For he was my Daughter's son
My Wife is now my Mother's Mother
And it makes me blue
Because although she is my wife
She's my Grandmother too

If my wife is my grandmother
Then I'm her Grandchild
And every time I think of it
It nearly drives me wild
For now I have become the strangest case you ever saw
As Husband of my Grandmother

She just smiles and shakes her head, then she softly sighs

When her sailor went to sea to see what he could see
She saw that he ate spinach, now he's big as he can be
When he's home they stroll along, they don't give a hoot
She won't let go of his hand, even to salute

If her sailor she can't find on the bounding main
She is hopeful he will soon come home safe again
So they can get married and raise a family

Yeah, always!  'Cause things may not be fair, always.  But that's exactly when I'm gonna be true always.  Not for just sixty minutes, not for twenty-four hours, not even for a whole darned YEAR, three hundred and sixty-five days, but I mean always!!

That's when I'll be there always

Guy Lombardo & His Royal Canadians,"And then she holds my hand, mm
And then I understand. mm
Her eyes afire with one desire
Then a heavenly kiss
Could I resist?
And then she dims the light, mm
And then she holds me tight. mm
Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise
 
And then he holds my hand, mm
And then I understand. mm

And then he dims the light, mm
And then he holds me tight. mm

They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise

Guy Lombardo & His Royal Canadians,"It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
 
There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon

So wait and pray each night for me

I love you, don't let us part
I love you, I always knew it would be you

Come, be my own, come make your home in my heart

Guy Lombardo Orchestra,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you if you're young at heart (young at heart)
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart (young at heart)

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on the way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart (young at heart)
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart (young at heart)

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

And speak out from her face.
And fish jump in her boat all day, 
And flog your feet like steel.

There go the dead.
Out through the roof.

Like it was proof.

And they wait for you in town,
They pull back on the lever,

I want you to pull me down,
And cover me with vines,
I want too much.

Even now, even now, even now, 
I want no more, and I want too much.
I want too much.

Shh...

Your kiss left me a bloodied mess,
And a trail behind,
I want too much.
If you fall, then I confess,
Better you this time,
I want too much.

And even now, even now, even now,
I want no more, I want no more, 
And even now, even now,
I want no more, and I want too much.
I want too much.
I want too much.

Guy Pedersen,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1962
Guy Pedersen,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year or maybe less

She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

She sits alone 'most every night

He says he's busy, but she says, ""Is he?""

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per

Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

He says, ""Now, Judge, suppose I fail?""

To a fallen race
Through Christ the savior of all men
There's hope in saving grace

Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

It's power is eternal, eternal
It's glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again
Who will on Christ believe, will believe

Than gold or silver ever could afford

Yet we build dividing walls between our brothers and ourselves

But I, I don't care what label you may wear

The bond we share is all I care to see
And we can change this world forever

And with a mighty voice together

And it will echo through the earth

Guy Penrod,"There's a line that is drawn through the ages 
On that line stands an old rugged cross 
On that cross, a battle is raging 
To gain a man's soul or it's loss 

On one side, march the forces of evil
 All the demons, all the devils of hell 
On the other, the angels of glory 
And they meet on Golgotha's hill 

The earth shakes with the force of the conflict 
And the sun refuses to shine 
For there hangs God's son, in the balance 
And then through the darkness he cries

It is finished, the battle is over 
It is finished, there'll be no more war 
It is finished, the end of the conflict 
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart, the battle was still raging 
Not all prisoners of war had come home 
These were battlefields of my own making 
I didn't know that the war had been won 

Oh, but then I heard the king of the ages 
Had fought all the battles for me 
And that victory was mine for the claiming 
And now praise his name, I am free",The Old Rugged Cross,2016
Guy Penrod,"Huh

And there are people who think they're not receiving
Anything from God at all
Oh, They are shaken from their believing
When they don't see results take quickly fall

But don't you waver and keep on living
In the way God want you to
Don't get discouraged and keep on giving
Soon it will come back to you

Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way

Good measure pressed down shaken together running over
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way

Oh, Keep on working seeking the kingdom
Instead of working for your needs
Just keep on sharing the love of Jesus
You know, growing comes from clemensies

Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way

Good measure pressed down shaken together running over
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way

Uh every way!

Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way

Good measure pressed down shaken together running over
Soon it's gonna come back home 
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way (give it away)
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home

Guy Penrod,"[Chorus]
If you want more happy than your heart will hold
If you want to stand taller if the truth were told
Take whatever you have, and give it away
If you want less lonely and a lot more fun
And deep satisfaction when the day is done
Then throw your heart wide open and give it away

He was workin' in his garden when I happened by
He waved me over with that look in his eye
And he started breakin' off some ears of corn
Here boy, today this corn is just right
Just boil it up for your supper tonight
I've learned it's true what my pappy used to say
Nothing's quite as good 'til you give it away

[Chorus]

There's been a lotta water go over the dam
Since the day in the garden with my Uncle Sam
So I hope you'll hear these words I have to say
There are two kinds of folks-takers and givers
There's gripers and complainers and big hearted livers
It depends on how we choose to spend our days
We can hoard up all we've got, or give it all away

[Chorus: x3]",Give It Away,
Guy Penrod,"There's only one thing that I long for
When I reach my home on high
To see my Jesus in His glory
And to reign with Him on high

I'll be so glad to see my mother
Who has gone, gone on to that land
Oh, but I long to see my Jesus
And by His side to stand

Without a father, without a mother
I've had to make this journey by myself
Sometimes so friendless, heartaches seem endless
So many sorrows I have known

But I know my Lord will call me
To that mansion in the sky
And I shall reign with Him forever
In that sweet home by and by, ny and by

So many times my heavy burden
Have borne, borne me to my knees
But then I prayed, ""Oh, blessed Jesus
Won't You help me if You please""

And He would hasten to my rescue
I no longer have to cry
And so I'll keep my Savior with me
On my journey, journey to the sky

Well, well, well

Without a father, without a mother
I've had to make this journey by myself
Sometimes so friendless, heartaches seem endless
On my journey, journey to the sky, to the sky",My Journey to the Sky,

Baby I remember when
You and I just began 
Knowing we were more than friends I had 2 make you understand 
Said I gotta get to know ya 
Give me one chance to show ya 
Just what you mean to me 
And everything that we could be
So we talked a little 
And we danced a little 
Told me that I treated you like the perfect gentleman 
From the day love started 
We could not be parted 
Lets get back to how our love was

Back in the day
All we had was you and me but
That was all we ever needed
I was your superman girl
You were meant for me
Back in the day
The way I said I love you daily 
But girl I haven't told you lately
I'm gonna love you baby
Like I loved you back in the day
All of those things I wort
You cried everytime you read
The Friday night theater show
Where I would be watching you instead
All the bad jokes id say
But you would laugh anyway
You were my closest friend
Together 24/7 
Forever till the very end
But I haven't been there baby
Or sent you flowers lately
Lets get back to how our love was

Its then I realize I've been

I'm still crazy for you

I've been workin' night and day and all week long, 
Ooh, all week long baby,
Gotta make a living,
But I love the feeling,
When the weekend comes,
And I just can't wait, and I just can't wait.

Everybody, get that feelin',
Everybody shake the shake, (come on),
Put your hands up to the ceiling,
Everybody shake the shake (ayayay),
Everybody get that feelin',
Everybody shake the shake (shake it with me now),
Put your hands up to the ceiling,
Shake the shake, shake the shake.

I've been workin' night and day and all week long, 
Away, all week long,
Gotta make a living,
But I love the feeling,
When the weekend comes,
And I just can't wait, and I just can't wait.

Guy Sebastian,"I never thought I would meet
A girl like Emily
With her ocean eyes and her crazy smile
Suddenly she and me
Were talking about all them dreams of walking down the aisle
Should have known she would go
And leave me all alone
How could I believe I was the only guy
I wish that I could have seen
What was right in front of me
Its true, love makes you blind

Chorus:
Emily was meant for me
I thought we'd be in love for eternity
But the master plan
Had the upper hand
In a story of a single man

Tell me how this story ends
Let me tell you about Sherilee
She brought me to my knees
Cause physically she was the prototype
Always looking so heavenly
But her personally was showing signs her head ain't right
She wouldn't stop calling me
Checking up on me every time I leave
Started stalking me
She was popping up everywhere I would be
It's poisonous recipe
I know the only remedy is to make her just a memory

[Chorus]

Sherilee was meant for me
I thought we'd be in love for eternity
But the master plan
Had the upper hand
In a story of a single man
Tell me how this story ends
I don't want another love gone wrong
Just another name within this song
I can't close the door
How will I ever know
If she's the one for sure

[Chorus]

Who will be the one for me
Someone I can love for eternity
I know I don't understand

In a story of a single man

Guy Sebastian,"You posses a beauty deep within
That soothes me when I'm around you
Your skin is butterscotch on porcelain
My sweet tooth is glad I found you
Now I am in search of words to sing
A melody fit for a queen
As sweet as what I'm feeling in my heart

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine

Never had I seen a perfect face
Till my eyes fell upon you
And never had I felt true love's embrace
Until the day I held you
Now I am in search of words to sing
A melody fit for a queen
As sweet as what I'm feeling in my heart

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine

And when I think of how
I wonder
I think of how I am when I'm with you
'cause you're the sweetest berry on the vine

Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate

Guy Sebastian,"Baby let me take this chance to review
Everything I'm feelin' when I'm with you
I think it's 'bout time we set this thing straight
I know you feel it too, so
Baby don't ya get all coy with me
'cause I know that you like this boy you see
As much as you ignore it won't go away
Oh baby...

I don't need to read between the lines
'cause baby nothing ever felt so right
I ain't gonna leave until you're mine
(You know I'm gon getcha)

[Chorus]
Girl, don't try to hide that smile
'cause I see it in your eyes
And I can tell you're excited, 'cause
You know I'm gon getcha!!!
Girl, this feeling can't go unheard
Won't stop till you're in my world
And baby I just can't hide it
You know I'm gon getcha!!!

Never been the kind to tolerate playin' games
It's just when I see two people feelin' the da same
It doesn't take a scientist to explain
You gotta get up, get up, get movin'

So baby tell me what you gonna do
'cause what you feel for me I feel for you
As much as you ignore it won't go away

I ain't gotta read between the lines
'cause baby nothing ever felt so right
(You know I'm gon getcha)

[Chorus]

Baby you're so fine
And if it takes all night
To getcha by my side
Won't stop till your mine

Ending begin
The grass is baby blue
The sky is army green

Down feels like up
I miss you so much
When or where will you be coming back to me
And help make sense of it all

[Chorus]
Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
My inside out's so upside down
Whenever you're not around

Fast foward rewinds
I'm walking backwards in time
Everything that's new feels like I've done before
The moon lights the day
Since the sun lost its way
You can't hear that you're the one I'm looking for
I need you to show me the way

[Chorus]

Round in a square circle I keep turning
But everything aligns whenever I'm with you

Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
Round and round and round I go

",Out of Place,2006
Guy Sebastian,"A million words a million souls
I'm stil trying to find my own
I didn't look but I found you
Throught the fog throught the haze
I lost sight of your face
Now I'm dreaming of the next time

When our stars collide
I'm gonna hang myself out
Till I dry
I'm putting it on the line
When our stars collide
Gonna make myself heard
Eat my pride
And tell you your the one
When our stars collide
I know they will collide

Burning out in the night
When I saw your satillite
Going round to remind me
I found a moon and made it ours
Then we lost it in a cloud
But we'll find another next time

I will keep gazing til you find my sky
Then I won't let you go
",Stars Collide,2006
Guy Sebastian,"I've met the darkness
Been held by the night
Lonely was there in my arms
I've been with broken
I've stared in her eyes
Emptiness left me this scar

But I heard your voice
Calling me out of the cold

CHORUS:
And now I can live again
I have been chosen to run with the wind
I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

I've walked through fire so I could become
All that you said I could be
And now my breath has a reason
My sky has a sun
Cause in you I've found all that I need

Your touched revived me
It was your love that opened my eyes


CHORUS:
And now I can live again
I have been chosen to run with the wind
I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

I broke through the rain
Stuck through the storm
Now I know I remain
And I can do the impossible
I can reach the unreachable

Its my time
I will rise and live

And I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

And now I can live again
I have been chosen to run with the wind
I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

I wish I could be with you
And I miss so much about you
And I wish my heart was unbreakable
Oh I wish my heart was unbreakable

I'm tryin' to find out who I am
In the memory of you and me
I'm tryin' to see things as they are
Not the way I wish that they could be
But for now I'll just pretend
To hold you in my arms again
For one last moment

If you were here tonight
I'd never let you go
And I would find a way to say the things I never said
And you would find it all

You'll never fight them alone

When your little heart breaks
Know that we feel each and every ache
Before you I never did know
Just how deep my love could go
All of the milestone and things that I've done
They can't compare to you my son

Why are we running now that the race is done?

Exodus, but the sex in us is a welcome mat back to Jamrock
So even when the band stops
Guitar still playin' even though the hand's not
And all of this amounts to poltergeists and haunted houses so
Even when we die, we'll still be alive

She ain't even down for the oky-docky
Know this we're the coldest team
Is on the scene, I'm born to lead
I don't even sleep long enough to have a dream
Reality, unfortunate
Girls hanging on me like on the mits
And I play the game like a tournament
I'm tryin' to win stomping in my Ugg like Timbs ay

White shirt down to my knees

Have me stick it two like a vale crow
Stick and straight up like scale crow
Shoulda seen the pic she send to my cell phone
Xrated, don't hate it
Dough play that, motivated
Been getting tours since I graduated
Paper chaser
Pourin' out lookin' for the whole man to chase her
When she left I had a whole pillow full of makeup

High waist crop top, red lips top shop
Flash tat, holes at the knees

Guy Sebastian,"From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?

Take time to learn me like court appointed attorneys
Restore the order, we either join or adjourning
Less you join I'm up performing the journey
In all earnest, I go so Bernie
Takes another nigga to turn me
Get it straight, I ain't late on states
I'm just sternly stating
How what I do, with grace takes another nigga to turn mean
My return means like blockbuster with a tick
And I ain't kind but I don't hit
So you starting at the end, that's the part where you begin
I skip the bullshit so we can start it where we win
Yeah, spoiler alert
I can hear you all saying ""boy you're a jerk""
But it's cool though, know we gotta rule yo
Get in, then we win and do it all again, ho

From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one

Now me and words, we made a deal, that I'm gon' keep 'em real
And they show me their secrets, I can even cop a feel
Victorious, can't match wit, with warriors
I match wig with wits, similarly can't mix matchsticks with forests'
Only you can prevent what I do
Only due can prevent what's my view
I match matchsticks with wicks
Wicker man, take a sip of liquor and
Spit the lip off warriors
And spit flames, nigga get in the gang ah

From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
I think you're number one

It's road rage, without a roll cage
Takes courage to run on these roadways
I know you like ""no way"", but I'm a full race
All so every soccer Terry Fox moulding, go ahead
Don't stop, go ahead
Sitting in your car, just listening to the bars
And there's traffic all around and you feel like falling down
And the music that I'm spewing out, enough to calm him down
'Fore you know you watch your car with your briefcase walkin' round
And them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production
And Sebastian on the hook, like being dug by Michael Douglas
So don't start that walk through Echo Park
My life's a one-on-one and you caught up in the jam
Just show some love back to your number one fan

From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too

Hey there

You used to be too wise.

Though she won't throw a crumb to you

Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air

Break it and she won't care

Or are you not seeing things too clear?
Are you too much in love to hear?
Is it all going in one ear
And out the other?

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

My gilded lily, he's worth cash money
My gilded lily, he made me a smarty
I wear my lily to all the right parties go

I was the envy of all the horde
I proclaimed myself overlord
My gilded lily gives me all this and more
I puke my guts all over the floor

I found the entertainment banal so,
Through trenches of flesh we carved a canal
Lead harlequin then drew his last
He held a bejeweled theatrical mask

The door heaved and then exploded
We split the bill and then drove home loaded
When we got there the paint was peeling
We rose an Jell-O cubes to the ceiling

I wear the lily Gaily festooned in a manner silly
Draped in apparel I bathe in the smell I gild the lily
Adroitly crafted yet willy nilly I wear the lily
When I part with Milli Vanilli

And soon the pleasure barges
Rolled with the sun, pleasantly bloated
We mingles as one amidst debris of Debauchery,
I looked for the lily and just found me

And all the while gilded lily faded
Though it was the best I created
But gilded lily was still in place
It made a mockery of my face

And delivered us a surprise
The hulking mass of what we despised
We lurched away as we moved to snuff it
And we delivered a princely buffet

Soon the continent split all asunder
And the radios blared to the blunder
My gilded lily expanded while spinning
That's when I found out that we were winning

Fondly clutching our raging piss-ons
We piled up, peeled out, veered off and then we were gone",Gilded Lily,1991

GWAR,"In the fortress of GWAR, much torment does remain
Despite all of the bodies that had been hacked in twain
So many had died in the viscous campaign
That their femurs alone made a fine mountain

The Master was no longer GWAR's sovereign
Of wealth and women they had none to gain
What goal was left for them to attain
So Oderus did call for conclave

First came Balsac, his council was wise
His War-Axe gleamed, he was a loyal knight
Plus forty dancing bears he did provide
Then, first in prowess, he stood his lord beside

Beefcake the Mighty, his ass was wide
Brought eighty laden oxen, he was a good ally
Jizmak the Gusha, his legion was described
For many hours he barked at the tribe

But then, timely, the catering arrived
Booze, drugs, food, four hundred hundred mule-loads high
Flattus Maximus, this he did supply
And now the mighty brothers of GWAR did band

They will to journey and slay without plan
Bring sledge and terror to the cities of man
Open Oberammergau
Like hell was a womb, it tore

And from the womb the creatures poured
Troll, goblin, Manticore
Siege machine and armored whore
There will be battle like never before

The Surface World learned of the malaise
Black Pope, usurper, he saw through the veil
They plan their defense in the land of the wasted
Africa, bitter fruit she had tasted

Ensign of industry, let it be raised
There the camp of the Black Pope was placed
His legions breath, through the valleys the raced
Charlots they rode, and their skulls were iron-plated

Belching fire, freshly painted
8000 Battalions of Knights freshly sainted
But before they fought, they were vaccinated
To protect them from the AIDS that had been created

To continue the reign of Black Pope unabated
The people at home, got a version G-rated
Here the GWAR invaded
Began the violation

The War Barges, forecastles swarming
Disgorging the troops, formations forming
The low drone of the horning
Sounding out a call, then a warning

A nuclear salvo where GWAR was encroaching
Within a second ten legions were toasting
Balsac said, ""Did you feel something?""
The Lord was not boasting

The enemy is vast, steel carpets the terrain
Still they are forming, armors detrains
They send forth a Captain, OJ by name
Flattus struck him in the brain

Burst the helmet, made two parts of the mind
Chopped through his gorget, through chest, into spine
And the good captains blood flowed like wine
Flattus said, ""So ends a cowards time.""

Balsac is angry, he'll have no more
He hurls his axe, with great effort
To smite Regis with terrible force
His shield breaks, his hauberk unsews

The axe bursts through his chest and torso
Bright blood spurts, the guts are loosed by the throw
And with that axe the soul from body goes
Said Jizmak, ""That was a heavy blow.""

Beefcake the Mighty, clotted with spew
His sword falls, skulls burst in two
The eyes burst from sockets, he is not through
Thousands of warriors he does this to

Piling up the corpses of those he slew
Until it was hard to tell if the pile grew
Balsac said, ""He is a princely lord""
Said Beefcake, ""Yes, it's true.""

Jizmak smites, his hammer whirls
Foreheads explode, entrails twirl
Breaking open brain-pans as well
Red blood flowing as souls speed to hell

Oderus smites the Black Pope, exposing his brain
The blade continued through meat and membrane
Bright blood flowed in the grass where he was lain

But when one day my mood changed
And I melted your brain

I murdered you
And ate your soul

The deepest hole

I scream out your name
Or at least what I think you were called
Fate's finger gives me the blame
If you saw my tears I know you'd be appalled
A fistful of teeth
As I eat our baby I'm thinking of you
You are not here to feed me
So I ate our baby, I wish we'd had two

Fighting just crime had become such a bore
That one magic night when I raped with a mop...
That sure got 'round the shop!

In a drug deal gone way wrong
By some weird Asian dude

Still they called it suicide...

It fucking sucks on the losing side
And speaking of which, my face is on fire!

Gwen Bunn,"Some days I wake up and I feel like
I don't know what's wrong and don't care what's right
And I ain't sayin' that's it you
Just saying times I think of myself more than I do you
To give you proper love I gotta love myself some
You gotta find yourself something, get you a hobby or something
During grey spaces we existing in
When we ain't quite a couple but we more than friends
I think about coexisting and how to succeed at it
We gotta give each other space just to breathe a bit
I don't want things to become too routine with us
It's alright, everyday we ain't gotta talk that much
Just knowing I got you in my life enough for me
And you respect me having individuality
That's what makes us happy
That's what keeps us whole
Even in love you gotta keep your soul
Catch me?

Sometimes we just existing and that's alright
Days we ain't unhappy or on cloud nine
Just keepin' up wit traffic riding zoning out
I asked you what's wrong you tell me nothing babe I'm alright
I guess every journey come wit long yellow lights
Slow down is what it's telling me, I'm tellin' me, look
You oughta really listen to the signs you get in life
Tryna follow my own advice
Too many of my friends approaching 30
Upset that they ain't nobody's wife
I know better than to rush hmm
That's suicide
We just starting out
We got a few hills to climb
If you meet me halfway I swear I got the time
To figure it out, why I'm asking for a little some space
'Cause even couples need a couple of minutes for a mental break
So don't trip babe, I'm just tryna breathe, relax
Love ain't easy days gon' come like that

'Cause that's my rollercoaster
My rollercoaster love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Rollercoaster love

My insecurities don‚Äôt help at all
There's still love there
Hope he don't stay upset for long
Are we there yet?
On some Ice Cube and Nia Long
Seems we are
Packing his bags about to ribbit on
Ugh huh, fine whatever
Bounce then nigga
Knowing I regret that decision
I'm gon‚Äô miss ya
Love funny
It gets cold in the summer and winter
Ya heart just wanna cuddle up
Make up sex wit a nigga, ooh
I promise baby I'm still deep in love wit you
Yep, yep I know the MO, this is how we do
Up and down rollercoaster, too emotional
Got me feeling sick inside
I only like it when we ride
In the bedroom like a coupe, uh
Arguments we loop, uh
Going in circles I wanna circle back wit him, uh
Back when we were friends, yeah them happy days
I really miss my boo boo hoping he don't stay way

Or will my heart remind me,
That once we walked in a moonlight dream?

Can I forget you,
Or will my heart remind me,
How sweet you made the moonlight seem.

Will the glory of your nearness fade,
As moonlight fades in a veil of rain?

Can I forget you,
When every night reminds me,
How much I want you back again.

Gwen Catley,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Telling people what I've found

Get up, Larry
Listen

Keep the fires burning, keep the fires burning
Keep them burning hot
Work on your love, yeah (Yeah!)
You gotta give it all you've got

We spend a lot of time searching for love
And never know where it's coming from
And as soon as we get it somehow
We seem to think that our work is done

But the same thing it took to get that love
Are the things that you'll have to do to keep it
You gotta stay on your J.O.B.
You gotta give a little, take a lot
Give it all you got, oh

Keep the fires burning, keep the fires burning
Keep them burning hot
You gotta work on your love, yeah (Yeah!)
You gotta give it all you've got

We say a lot of things that we really mean
To each other when love is new
Lots of promises and all the things we've said
And the things we intended to do

But as time goes by things get cold and dry
There's no more water in the well
And there ain't no way that two can come together
If we stay locked in our cell, oh

Keep the fires burning, keep the fires burning
Keep them burning hot, hmmm
You gotta work on your love, yeah (Yeah!)
You gotta give it all you've got, oh

(Work on it) Oh, you've gotta work on it
(Work on it) Work on it, yeah, yeah

Keep the fires burning, keep the fires burning
Keep them burning hot, y'all, aha
You gotta work on your love, yeah (Yeah!)
You gotta give it all you've got

We spend a lot of time searching for love
And never know where it's coming from
And as soon as we get it some lord, somehow
We seem to think that our work is done

And the same thing it took to get that love
Are the things that you'll have to do to keep it
You gotta stay on your J.O.B., yeah
You gotta give a little, take a lot

Anticipating your arrival

I only want to fly first-class desires, you're my limousine

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye 
The kid don't play
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla  
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

You've got to give me everything

So I had to holla back; guess I didn't get enough
Still be the one to land, and I send the tick-tock
If you give me a clap, I'm gonna give an encore
Don't want it to end; I wanna skank some more 
I'm tripping on the best dream that I never had
I guess behind the orange curtain is not so bad

From the West Side of Anaheim, a small world after all
Hanging out at the hotel, selling makeup at the mall
Making out to ""Purple Rain"" just like everybody else
Dame un beso, now stop, I'm trying to save myself
In the ordinary calling girl way
Back in the seven-one-four days
Trying to figure what I wanna be

Ain't nothing better than a great, big, huge hit
You know, I'd pay you just to let me run, dance, and sing
I know I'm living the E-ticket dream
For a girl from O.C., it's almost unheard of
So I wanna thank you all so much for the love (especially my girlfriends)

Pharrell on repeat, make a hurricane in Miami
Working with him, I'm gonna get myself another Grammy
I got the L.A.M.B., and he's rocking the Ice Creams
Blend it together, something fresh and kinda in between
Remember music is something that I love
So I don't really give a fuck
The music don't come in no color

(The sweet escape)

If I could be sweet
(Sorry boy)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
We can make it better
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet'
(Sweet escape, sweet escape)

I want to get away to our sweet escape
I want to get away, yeah",Sweet Escape [Remix],2007
Gwen Stefani,"Uh, uh, uh, huh, yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic

Red from blond, yeah bitch, I'm drastic
Why this? Why that? Lips stop asking
Listen to me baby, relax and start passing
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic

This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassing
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughing
Easy come, easy go, E V gon' be lasting

Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't gizell, cat walk and imagine
A lotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now, let me blow your mind

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Now, while you gritting your teeth
Frustration baby, you gotta breathe
Take a lot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me

Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find

Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your lines

And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now, let me blow your mind

Let your bones crack, your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blasting, sets while I mash out

Yeah nigga, mash out, D are E
Back track, think back, E V E
Do you like that? You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too

Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn she much thinner know now I'm complete

Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die, bitch, double are, can't crawl
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake nigga it was planned on

And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now, let me blow your mind
",Let Me Blow Your Mind,2008
Gwen Stefani,"If I could escape I would but, first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold'

If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet'
(The sweet escape)

If I could be sweet
(Sorry boy)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
We can make it better
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet'
(Sweet escape, sweet escape)

I want to get away to our sweet escape
I want to get away, yeah

You held me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground

So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy waiting on you to come save me
I can see that your angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me

If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together
