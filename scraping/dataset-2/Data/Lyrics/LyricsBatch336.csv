Guy Clark,"He was sitting in the corner
At a table all alone
A candle burnin' in the darkness
His glass of wine was almost gone

And something about him felt familiar
And it made me stop and stare
The way he held his hands before him
Looked like he was lost in prayer

Hey son, what are you lookin' at?
Why do your eyes look so sad?
There's somethin' in the way he sat there
It made me think about my dad

I'm lookin' for the answer
Just like everyone
I know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and the son

Hey son, why don't you pull up one of those empty chairs?
Bring it over here by my side
Buy me a glass of wine
This looks like a real good place to hide

You know I've always been a fisherman
Fishin' for souls along the way
You kind of remind me of my only son
And I lost him 33 years ago today

I'm lookin' for the answer
Just like everyone
I know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and the son

There's somethin' I must give you
The compass that my father made
It'll point you in the right direction
In case you ever lose your way

You know I've got somethin' here in my pocket
This is little silver cross
I think my son would want you to have it
When you think all the hope is lost

We're lookin' for the answer
Just like everyone
We know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and the son

I left him sitting at his table
But I didn't feel alone
For a moment I could see the light
Oh, we were almost home
For a moment I could see the light
Oh, we were almost home
",Almost Home,2006
Guy Clark,"Well she ain't got no cell phone
You got to call her when she's home
All of her clocks have got hands
Now don't try to e-mail her,
you've got to snail mail her
You got to take pen in hand

Ones and zeros, zeros and ones
She'll have none of that virtual fun
She's a real deal ol' fashioned analog girl
In a digital world

Now she gets online out in the backyard
Hangin' up her ol' blue jeans
She's got all of the memory she can live with
She really hates drum machines

Ones and zeros, zeros and ones
She'll have none of that virtual fun
She's a real deal ol' fashioned analog girl
In a digital world

Out in the garden she's got a website
It sparkles in the mornin' dew
Got a mouse in her pocket,
she's got spam in a can
What's an analog girl to do

Ones and zeros, zeros and ones
She'll have none of that virtual fun
She's a real deal ol' fashioned analog girl

Guy Clark,"Meanwhile down on Biel Street
Drinking in a Biel Street bar
There's a fog rollin' off the Mississippi
Has anybody seen Arkansas?

And the deckhands from the toll boats
Come ashore wearin' Mexican shoes
They headed strait for Graceland
It was the first thing they wanted to do

Cinco de Mayo in Memphis
Marchetti singin' the blues
Soul sisters hugging Senoritas
All sportin' Blue suede shoes

Pork pie hats and sombreros
Hangin' on a downtown street
Swingin' pool cues at Pinatas
Don't that river smell sweet?

And they all come to get 'em some Memphis
A little somethin' for their souls
'Lone riders land up with limousines
Hey, they all came to rock and roll

Cinco de Mayo in Memphis
Marchetti singin' the blues
Southern belles and Senoritas
All sportin' Blue suede shoes

Guy Clark,"Now there's a man you'll hear about
Most anywhere you go,
And his holdings are in Texas
And his name is Diamond Joe.

And he carries all his money
In a diamond-studded jar.
He never took much trouble
With the process of the law.

I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,
Did offer him my hand,
He gave a string of horses
So old they could not stand.

And I nearly starved to death, boys,
He did mistreat me so,
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe.

Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw,
Nearly drove me crazy
With the waggin' of his jaw.

And the tellin' of his story,
Mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe.

Now, I tried three times to quit him,
But he did argue so
I'm still punchin' cattle
In the pay of Diamond Joe.

And when I'm called up yonder
And it's my time to go,
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.",Diamond Joe,2006
Guy Clark,"Now when you write your expose'
I wish you'd leave me out
I'd just as soon you didn't use my name
I'm not crazy 'bout the way
Your book might make me look
I might have been there but
You can't hold me to blame

Now when you write your expose'
Don't kiss and tell it all
No one likes a tattletale writin' on the wall
Don't go talkin' out of school
'Cause you know you got no call
If you can't say somethin' nice
Don't say anything at all

Well I opened up my heart to you
I let it all hang out
I told you stuff that no one else should know
So don't betray my trust in you
Shame, shame if you do
Don't drag that crap back up just let it go

Now when you write your expose'
Don't kiss and tell it all

Guy Clark,"Well, he used to be a pretty good rodeo clown
People loved to watch him horse around
When that rank black bucked em all down
He was a pretty good rodeo clown

Till he met the gal who sold the souvenirs
He could make her smile from ear to ear
They stayed up all night drinkin' rodeo beer
He was a pretty good rodeo clown

He don't laugh much anymore
Since she locked her trailer door
Tears and grease paint will not mix
And old dogs will not learn new tricks
Hes got that smile painted on,
Nobody knows something's wrong
She broke his funny bone
Broke his funny bone

When that new young bull rider came on the circuit
Oh in about, eight seconds flat she was gone
Now he asks himself if she was worth it
You can hide your heart in a barrel for just so long

He don't laugh much anymore
Since she locked her trailer door
Tears and grease paint will not mix
And old dogs will not learn new tricks
Hes got that smile painted on,
And we all knew what was wrong
She broke his funny bone
She broke his funny bone couch",Funny Bone,2006
Guy Clark,"I ain't lookin' for trouble
I can't stay here tonight
I got to leave here on the double
If I want to see the morning light
Don't need no pistol for the tickets
I've got just enough to get us down the line
I don't know what happens next
Your guess is just as good as mine

Move with me Magdalene
I'm tired of the same old scene
There's a greyhound leaving at midnight
If you came with me it'd be like a dream
Come on Magdalene
Move with me Magdalene

I've heard Mexico is easy
I wouldn't stay here if I could
Don't come along just to please you
Let's go while the going's good

Move with me Magdalene
I'm tired of the same old scene
Let's go down to San Miguel
Let's go be somebody else tonight

Guy Clark,"I was sittin' on the fender of someone else's truck
Drinkin' Old Crow whisky, hot 7UP
Out in the parking lot

You can hear the band are playin' right through the wall
Ain't no cover charge, there ain't no last call
Out in the parking lot

Now there's a couple of cowpokes puttin' up there dukes
Wasn't much to it after both of 'em puked
Out in the parking lot

Now someone called the police and the police finally came
And they wrote 'em a couple of tickets
And they took a couple of names out in the parking lot

I love to see the neon dancin' on the gravel
I love to hear the pickup trucks come unraveled
And some have given up, some have given in
Looks like everybody's lookin' for a friend
Out in the parking lot

Oops, there's a couple who could not wait to get home
Now they're probably in love, so let's leave them alone

Hotter than a depot stove
Hide in the cellar

Yer clouds as green can be

Even take your cotton balls
Suck red river just as dry as a bone
Dump it on Wichita falls

Guy Clark,"Now what's up with the walkin' man
I wonder where he's gone
Marchin' down to Birmingham
I think I'll tag along
Was a walkin' man come by here
A hundred years ago
Walkin' down the trail of tears
Out to Oklahom-i-o out to Oklahome

Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Hand me down my cane
Tune me up my mandolin
I'll be on my way, hey sure does smell like rain

Woody Guthrie was a walkin' man
In the dust bowl days
Had a six string guitar in his hands
He killed a fascist every day
Chuck Berry is a walkin' man
So was Ghandi too
Lace me up my ol' Brogans
That's just what I'll do
I got walkin' left to do

Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Hand me down my cane
Tune me up my mandolin
I'll be on my way, hey
If I had shoes like the walkin' man

I'd walk away and not come back

Guy Clark,"I'd play the Red River Valley
And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, ""Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?""

We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
""Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin'""

Guy Clark,"Well the bus pulled away
In a roaring black cloud
While I stood in the road
And honey I hollered right out loud

Hey darlin' I love you
Hey bus driver whoa
But you can't stop a woman
When she's out of control

[Chorus]
She's crazy for leavin'
I told her so
When the boys at the bus stop
Just said man let her go
She's crazy for leavin'
I told her so
But you can't stop a woman
When she's out of control

So I punched out my truck
On a telephone pole
Now she never looked back
She just said go driver go

Well I know I could have caught her
But I ran out of luck
She was long gone to Lufkin
By the time they cut me out of my truck

[Chorus]

So I kicked and I cussed
That old east Texas road
I throwed rocks at my truck
Which had busted my nose

You add insult to injury
What do you get
You get a bus stop full of honkies
That don't ever forget

Guy Clark,"Standing at the window her face to the glass
As far as she can see the time has come to pass
As far as she can see the sky is all ablaze
And this looks like the first of better days

She's takin' charge of her life for a change
She's takin' it back that she's lost
It's just as clear as the window pane
She'll survive at all cost

Guy Clark,"Ain't nothin' in the world that I like better
Than bacon & lettuce & homegrown tomatoes
Up in the mornin' out in the garden

Get you a ripe one don't get a hard one
Plant 'em in the spring eat 'em in the summer
All winter with out 'em's a culinary bummer
I forget all about the sweatin' & diggin'
Everytime I go out & pick me a big one

Homegrown tomatoes homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes
Only two things that money can't buy
That's true love & homegrown tomatoes

You can go out to eat & that's for sure
But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad, put 'em in a stew
You can make your very own tomato juice
Eat 'em with egss, eat 'em with gravy
Eat 'em with beans, pinto or navy
Put 'em on the site put 'em in the middle
Put a homegrown tomato on a hotcake griddle

If I's to change this life I lead
I'd be Johnny Tomato Seed
'Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes in every yard you see
When I die don't bury me
In a box in a cemetery
Out in the garden would be much better
I could be pushin' up homegrown tomatoes",Homegrown Tomatoes [DVD],2007
Guy Clark,"My father had a Randall knife
My mother gave it to him
When he went off to WWII
To save us all from ruin
If you've ever held a Randall knife
Then you know my father well
If a better blade was ever made
It was probably forged in hell 

My father was a good man
A lawyer by his trade
And only once did I ever see
Him misuse the blade
It almost cut his thumb off
When he took it for a tool
The knife was made for darker things
And you could not bend the rules

He let me take it camping once
On a Boy Scout jamboree
And I broke a half an inch off
Trying to stick it in a tree
I hid it from him for a while
But the knife and he were one
He put it in his bottom drawer
Without a hard word one

There it slept and there it stayed
For twenty some odd years
Sort of like Excalibur
Except waiting for a tear 

My father died when I was forty
And I couldn't find a way to cry
Not because I didn't love him
Not because he didn't try
I'd cried for every lesser thing
Whiskey, pain and beauty
But he deserved a better tear
And I was not quite ready

So we took his ashed out to sea
And poured 'em off the stern
And threw the roses in the wake
Of everything we'd learned
When we got back to the house
They asked me what I wanted
Not the law books not the watch
I need the things he's haunted

My hand burned for the Randall knife
There in the bottom drawer
And I found a tear for my father's life
And all that it stood for",Randall Knife [DVD],2007
Guy Clark,"Won't say I love you babe
Won't say I need you babe
But, I'm gonna get you babe
And I will not do you wrong
Livin's mostly wastin' time
I waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's don't take too long
You're soft as glass
And I'm a gentle man
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon.

Days up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some
But don't turn none away
Everything is not enough
Nothin' is to much to bear
Where you been is good and gone
All you keep is the gettin' there
To live is to fly
Low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes

It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think on all the poetry
And the pickin' down the line
I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think to much
On things you leave behind
I may be gone
But it won't be long
I will be a-bringin' back the melody
And the rhythm that I find

We all got holes to fill
Them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own
But choice is yours to make
And time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone
To live is to fly
Low and high,
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the tears out of your eyes",To Live Is to Fly [DVD],2007

They want me to turn around like this is hokie poke
They want to break me down like erv before I choke
I'm not a jack at all I'm quick draw mcgraw
And number 20 on the Lakers couldn't hold me y'all
I'm climbing over y'all I'm still scoring
85 percent of y'all awake but still snoring
Got knowledge yourself and now my style is much older now
We dirty ent we all we got we hold it down
I'm feeling cooler than cool, my wrist colder wow

Aiyo I'm fresh out the gate, from the Lou with a grammy in my rezzie

Chicks taugh me how to walk, so when I run I'll be ready
Females fans sayin that I'm there baby daddy WHOA
More attention then Justin and Janet
How I Midwest swing and how St Louis ram it
Deerty ent dammit, got more bread than a sandwich
And my writst got more nuggets than Carmello and Camby
Look, I'm from the Lou and I'm important like the arts
So tours look for me like an important part
Find your talent use your talent get your money
Or don't find your talent and don't use it and stay bummy
But that don't owe me cause I built it from scratch
My next shit is a house with a house in the back
Man I'm been while since middle school
I was that little dude that been round more waist lines than hoola hoops

I've dragged trouble through the door
And I've spilled wine on it all

Maybe I can paint over that
It'll probably bleed through
Maybe I can paint over that
But I can't hide it from you

I've got some ink beneath my skin
A good idea at the time
I won't be doing that again
Not with any arm of mine

And I have stumbled in my time
I left my footprints down the road
And the part of me that shines
Ain't the part of me that's showed

Guy Clark,"Days up and down they come, like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some, don’t turn them away.
Everything is not enough, and nothing is too much to bare
Where you’ve been it’s good and gone, all you keep is the gettin' there

Oh, to live is to fly,
Both low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes.

We all got holes to fill, them holes are all as real
Some fall on you like a storm, sometimes you dig your own
The choice is yours to make, time is yours to take
Some sail up on the sea, some toil upon the stone.

Oh, to live is to fly,
Both low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes.

Goodbye to all, my friends, it’s time to go again
Think of all the poetry and the picking down the line
I’ll miss the sister beer, the bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don’t pay to think too much on the things you leave behind.

Oh, to live is to fly,
Both low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes.

Shake the dust off of your wings
And the tears out of your eyes.",To Live Is to Fly,2012
Guy Clark,"There's nothin' like cornmeal on a dance-hall floor for dancin' the night away,
Slippin' and slidin', effortlessly glidin' in the arms of my sweet Lillie Mae,
So I shined up my boots and ironed my shirt, and pulled on some new blue jeans.
Oh, I brushed off my hat, slicked back my hair; I'll beat all that she's ever seen.

There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Doin' the cornmeal waltz.

Way out on Ranch Road 17 there's a dance hall in the live-oak trees,
Yellow lights strung up all around, so all the little kids can see.
Pickups are parked near to the road; the beer is so cold it might freeze.
Stars are all out, the band's in tune, and it smells like a barbecue breeze.

There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Doin' the cornmeal waltz.

Beat-up old Stetsons, beehive hair, belt buckles bumpin' in time.
There's little girls dancin' on their daddies' toes, spinnin' around on a dime.
Grandma and Grandpa are out on the floor, dancin' like they've lost their minds.
There's old maids and bachelors and sweethearts alike, all movin' in three-quarter time.

There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Just doin' the cornmeal waltz.",Cornmeal Waltz,2013

That shines in the Mexico sun.
There are boats and they cross from one side to the other,
At dusk when the hot day is done.
From there to Acuña to Del Rio, Texas,
You valley up through San Antone.
With the pesos I've saved up for years then I'll trade
For the chance to send dollars back home.

Coyote, coyote, qué hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun.
Coyote, qué hiciste cabron?

He steps out of the shadows, he won't look in my eyes
His hand's out to take all I've got.
He says that he's smuggled a thousand good men
And he says that he's never been caught.
So with seventeen other, braceros like cattle
Packed in for that long final ride.
In the semi-truck crossing the border it's dark,
And it's hot as an oven inside.

Coyote, coyote, qué hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun.
Coyote, qué hiciste cabron?

The braceros are asking in whispers,
Why the truck stopped in the heat of the day?
At first sign of trouble, he's left us all there
By the road and he's walking away.

Swallow it down with a shot of pride,
And as pebble just step outside.

You gotta draw the line somewhere.

Guy Clark,"I decided to improve my social station
I joined a fraternity organisation
Tucked in my shirt
Signed on the line
Right away they said about to improve my mind
The car I drove
The books I read
The food I ate
The booze I drank
The girls I took out
My breath

Said ""Kid, we don't much like the way you walk
And you gonna have to change the way you talk""
They said ""your dress is kind of sludge
And your attitude is mighty grudge""
Said ""you got to learn to bubble""
""You got to bubble with enthusiasm"" I started bubble
""Most important thing you can't forget
Is learning the entire Greek alphabet""
I never did really understand
That that's gonna make me anymore a man
But I learned it
I can whip through that Son-of-a-beta backwards in five seconds
Then they hit me with some pretty bad news
Concerning the payment of monthly dues
I never did know where that money went
I never was sure it was well spent
But I paid it
I'm no trouble causer and besides I figured that's life
If you want good friends it gonna cost you

Well, finally got to be party time
I got a great big old jug of wine
I went back to the house in about an hour
When the boy's were drinking whiskey sours
Brandy Alexanders
Frozen daquires
Reciting the Greek alphabet to one another

I could see I was gonna have to do my very best
To get myself out of that fraternity mess
I stood right there outside the door
And I chugged that wine like never before
Walked inside and bubbled
All over a couple of their dates

So now everything's back to normal again
But there is still lots of room for improvement my friend
'Cause that fraternity stuff is too much for me
Next time I'm gonna join a sorority

took about six hours or so
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
said they'd let me know
I put in my time till the Pocono line
shut down two years ago
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
now I can't stay there no more


Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
to move some old cars around
maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out
van and do a little settlin' down
Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
and the junkyard's a pretty good ways
that job's about a half week old besides
it'd be gone now anyway


Unemployment said I got no more checks
and they showed me to the hall
my brother died in Georgia some time ago
I got no one left to call
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
a little short on food that's all
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
we're headed down into fall


I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
hustled up a little dough
but I got drunk and I woke up rolled
a couple of months ago
they got my harp and they got my dollar
them low life so and so's
harps cost money and I ain't got it
it's my own fault I suppose


The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
two freights everyday
if it was just me I'd be headed south
but Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
says we gotta wait and see
in my heart I know it's a little boy
hope he don't end up like me


Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend
I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
hope she don't break down and cry


Marie she didn't wake up this morning
she didn't even try
she just rolled over and went to heaven
my little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
caught a Chesapeak on the fly

so's to meet me by and by

Plain it was she did agree

His four to hart, and his trey to spade

Preparations soon where made

They voted club the days commander
Gave him an army face and number
All but the outlaw jack of diamonds
And the aces in the sky

Spirit me a game of stud
Stakes unscarred by limitation
Between a man named Gold and man named Mud

Till his long, green eyes did glow
And Mud was left with the sighs and trembles
Watching his hard earned money go

Flushes fell on Gold like water
Tens they paired and paired again
But the aces only flew through heaven
And the diamond jack called no man friend

Now, the Diamond Queen saw Muds ordeal
Began to think of her long lost son
Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy
And prayed to the angels every one

Now, the Diamond Queen, she prayed and prayed
And the Diamond Angel filled Muds hole
The wicked King of Clubs himself
Fell in face down in front of Gold

Now, three kings come to Clubs command
But the angels from the sky did ride
Three kings up on the streets of Gold
Three fireballs on the muddy side

But Lord, that Queen of Diamond's joy
When the outlaw in the heavenly hall
Turned out to be a wandering boy

Now, Mud he checked and Gold bet all
And Mud he raised and Gold did call
And the smile just melted on his face

Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles

A prince could have within his keeping;
His spells to weave and steal a heart
Within her breast, but only sleeping.

That's why I seem to have more than my share,

She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long

The room was singin' love songs
And dancing up and down
And now we're both so happy

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share

And she loved a sailor boy, he was only three
Now he's on a battleship in his sailor suit
Just a great big sailor but she thinks he's very cute

 She loves her sailor and he loves her too)

Soldier boys all flirt with her but to him she's true
Though they smile and tip their caps and they wink their eyes
She just smiles and shakes her head, then she softly sighs

(Oh, bell bottom trousers, coat of navy blue
 She loves her sailor and he loves her too)

When her sailor went to sea to see what he could see
She saw that he ate spinach, now he's big as he can be
When he's home they stroll along, they don't give a hoot
She won't let go of his hand, even to salute

If her sailor she can't find on the bounding main
She is hopeful he will soon come home safe again
So they can get married and raise a family
Dress up all their kiddies in sailor's dungarees

Give me mountain juice, turn me loose
Leave me wave my arms about

But we'll travel the road
Sharing our load
Side by side.

honey Through all kinds of weather
What if the sky should fall?
Just as long as we're together,
It doesn't matter at all.
When they've all had their quarrels and parted

We'll be the same as we started
Just a-traveling along
Singing a song
Side by side.

See that sun in the morning,
Peeking over the hill?
I'll bet you're sure it always has and sure it always will.
That's how I feel about someone,
How somebody feels about me.
We're sure we love each other
That's the way we'll always be.",Side by Side,2000

I'm a lucky son of a gun
Wherever I go I guess you know
I tip my hat to none
With a whoop and a holler and a dime and a dollar
I'm a lucky son of a gun.


I'm just a rollin' stone, I wander on my own,
And always take my own advice
I've travelled every trail, and never been in jail
‘Cos I've deserved it once or twice


My horse has been my pal, but once I met a gal,
And thought a kiss would be no crime
I darn near lost my life, she was the sheriff's wife,
I just got out of town in time.

Guy Penrod,"The love of God has been extended
To a fallen race
Through Christ the savior of all men
There's hope in saving grace

The love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

It's power is eternal, eternal
It's glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again
Who will on Christ believe, will believe

Oh, the love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

His glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love Of God, precious love of God

Even though we're all walking the same road
Yet we build dividing walls between our brothers and ourselves

But I, I don't care what label you may wear
If you believe in Jesus you belong with me
The bond we share is all I care to see
And we can change this world forever
If you will join with me, join and sing

So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side
As long as there is love we will stand

The day will come when we will be as one
And with a mighty voice together
We will proclaim that Jesus, Jesus is King
And it will echo through the earth
It will shake the nations and the world will see, see that

Soon it's gonna come back home on every way

Good measure pressed down shaken together running over
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way

Uh every way!

Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way

Good measure pressed down shaken together running over
Soon it's gonna come back home 
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home on every way (give it away)
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home 
Keep on casting
Your bread upon the water
Soon it's gonna come back home

Guy Penrod,"[Chorus]
If you want more happy than your heart will hold
If you want to stand taller if the truth were told
Take whatever you have, and give it away
If you want less lonely and a lot more fun
And deep satisfaction when the day is done
Then throw your heart wide open and give it away

He was workin' in his garden when I happened by
He waved me over with that look in his eye
And he started breakin' off some ears of corn
Here boy, today this corn is just right
Just boil it up for your supper tonight
I've learned it's true what my pappy used to say
Nothing's quite as good 'til you give it away

[Chorus]

There's been a lotta water go over the dam
Since the day in the garden with my Uncle Sam
So I hope you'll hear these words I have to say
There are two kinds of folks-takers and givers
There's gripers and complainers and big hearted livers
It depends on how we choose to spend our days
We can hoard up all we've got, or give it all away

[Chorus: x3]",Give It Away,
Guy Penrod,"There's only one thing that I long for
When I reach my home on high
To see my Jesus in His glory
And to reign with Him on high

I'll be so glad to see my mother
Who has gone, gone on to that land
Oh, but I long to see my Jesus
And by His side to stand

Without a father, without a mother
I've had to make this journey by myself
Sometimes so friendless, heartaches seem endless
So many sorrows I have known

But I know my Lord will call me
To that mansion in the sky
And I shall reign with Him forever
In that sweet home by and by, ny and by

So many times my heavy burden
Have borne, borne me to my knees
But then I prayed, ""Oh, blessed Jesus
Won't You help me if You please""

And He would hasten to my rescue
I no longer have to cry
And so I'll keep my Savior with me
On my journey, journey to the sky

Well, well, well

Without a father, without a mother
I've had to make this journey by myself
Sometimes so friendless, heartaches seem endless
On my journey, journey to the sky, to the sky",My Journey to the Sky,

Baby I remember when
You and I just began 
Knowing we were more than friends I had 2 make you understand 
Said I gotta get to know ya 
Give me one chance to show ya 
Just what you mean to me 
And everything that we could be
So we talked a little 
And we danced a little 
Told me that I treated you like the perfect gentleman 
From the day love started 
We could not be parted 
Lets get back to how our love was 
[Chorus]
Back in the day
All we had was you and me but
That was all we ever needed
I was your superman girl
You were meant for me
Back in the day
The way I said I love you daily 
But girl I haven't told you lately
I'm gonna love you baby
Like I loved you back in the day
All of those things I wort
You cried everytime you read
The Friday night theater show
Where I would be watching you instead
All the bad jokes id say
But you would laugh anyway
You were my closest friend
Together 24/7 
Forever till the very end
But I haven't been there baby
Or sent you flowers lately
Lets get back to how our love was

When I look into your eyes baby
Its then I realize I've been
Acting like a fool
I'm still crazy for you

I hear that voice enticing me
Uncertainty inviting me
Feels so good

How can I
Get back the life with you and me

Then my only worry 
Was for Christmas what would be my toy

Would not get a thing 
We were happy with the 
Joy the day would bring 

Sneaking out the back door 
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine 
Greeted at the back door 
With boy thought I told you not to go outside 

Tryin' your best to bring the 
Water to your eyes

'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl 
Just don't tell I'll give you 

Anything you want in this whole world 
Mama gives you money for Sunday school 
You trade yours for candy after church is through 
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy) 

Teacher sends you to the principal's office right down the hall 
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right

Always looking so heavenly

My sweet tooth is glad I found you
Now I am in search of words to sing
A melody fit for a queen
As sweet as what I'm feeling in my heart

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine

Never had I seen a perfect face
Till my eyes fell upon you
And never had I felt true love's embrace
Until the day I held you
Now I am in search of words to sing
A melody fit for a queen
As sweet as what I'm feeling in my heart

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine

And when I think of how
I wonder
I think of how I am when I'm with you
'cause you're the sweetest berry on the vine

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine

Guy Sebastian,"Girl, before you turn and walk away
Leave me standing here 
Just know I'll always love you
I never want to make the same mistakes
That I made
I only have myself to blame 
Girl, I'm sorry

Baby, I will wait for you, forever
However long it takes
For fate, to bring you back to me 
I wish I realized
Seen it through your eyes
All the things I put you through
Forever, I will wait

It's hard to watch you
Move on with your life

Guy Sebastian,"Out feels like in
Ending begin
The grass is baby blue
The sky is army green

Down feels like up
I miss you so much
When or where will you be coming back to me
And help make sense of it all

[Chorus]
Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
My inside out's so upside down
Whenever you're not around

Fast foward rewinds
I'm walking backwards in time
Everything that's new feels like I've done before
The moon lights the day
Since the sun lost its way
You can't hear that you're the one I'm looking for
I need you to show me the way

[Chorus]

Round in a square circle I keep turning
But everything aligns whenever I'm with you

Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
Round and round and round I go

",Out of Place,2006
Guy Sebastian,"A million words a million souls
I'm stil trying to find my own
I didn't look but I found you
Throught the fog throught the haze
I lost sight of your face
Now I'm dreaming of the next time

When our stars collide
I'm gonna hang myself out
Till I dry
I'm putting it on the line
When our stars collide
Gonna make myself heard
Eat my pride
And tell you your the one
When our stars collide
I know they will collide

Burning out in the night
When I saw your satillite
Going round to remind me
I found a moon and made it ours
Then we lost it in a cloud
But we'll find another next time

I will keep gazing til you find my sky
Then I won't let you go
",Stars Collide,2006
Guy Sebastian,"I've met the darkness
Been held by the night
Lonely was there in my arms
I've been with broken
I've stared in her eyes
Emptiness left me this scar

But I heard your voice
Calling me out of the cold

CHORUS:
And now I can live again
I have been chosen to run with the wind
I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

I've walked through fire so I could become
All that you said I could be
And now my breath has a reason
My sky has a sun
Cause in you I've found all that I need

Your touched revived me
It was your love that opened my eyes


CHORUS:
And now I can live again
I have been chosen to run with the wind
I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

I broke through the rain
Stuck through the storm
Now I know I remain
And I can do the impossible
I can reach the unreachable

Its my time
I will rise and live

And I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

And now I can live again
I have been chosen to run with the wind
I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

In the loneliness of all I see

To where we started

I wish I could be with you
And I miss so much about you
And I wish my heart was unbreakable
Oh I wish my heart was unbreakable

I'm tryin' to find out who I am
In the memory of you and me
I'm tryin' to see things as they are
Not the way I wish that they could be
But for now I'll just pretend
To hold you in my arms again
For one last moment

If you were here tonight
I'd never let you go
And I would find a way to say the things I never said
And you would find it all

Guy Sebastian,"From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?

Take time to learn me like court appointed attorneys
Restore the order, we either join or adjourning
Less you join I'm up performing the journey
In all earnest, I go so Bernie
Takes another nigga to turn me
Get it straight, I ain't late on states
I'm just sternly stating
How what I do, with grace takes another nigga to turn mean
My return means like blockbuster with a tick
And I ain't kind but I don't hit
So you starting at the end, that's the part where you begin
I skip the bullshit so we can start it where we win
Yeah, spoiler alert
I can hear you all saying ""boy you're a jerk""
But it's cool though, know we gotta rule yo
Get in, then we win and do it all again, ho

From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one

Now me and words, we made a deal, that I'm gon' keep 'em real
And they show me their secrets, I can even cop a feel
Victorious, can't match wit, with warriors
I match wig with wits, similarly can't mix matchsticks with forests'
Only you can prevent what I do
Only due can prevent what's my view
I match matchsticks with wicks
Wicker man, take a sip of liquor and
Spit the lip off warriors
And spit flames, nigga get in the gang ah

From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
I think you're number one

It's road rage, without a roll cage
Takes courage to run on these roadways
I know you like ""no way"", but I'm a full race
All so every soccer Terry Fox moulding, go ahead
Don't stop, go ahead
Sitting in your car, just listening to the bars
And there's traffic all around and you feel like falling down
And the music that I'm spewing out, enough to calm him down
'Fore you know you watch your car with your briefcase walkin' round
And them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production
And Sebastian on the hook, like being dug by Michael Douglas
So don't start that walk through Echo Park
My life's a one-on-one and you caught up in the jam
Just show some love back to your number one fan

From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave and oh man
Were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
Love's never made a fool of you
You used to be too wise. 

Hey there
You on that high-flying cloud 
Though she won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday she'll come to you. 

Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She's got you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care 

Won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things too clear?
Are you too much in love to hear?
Is it all going in one ear
And out the other?

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

We rose an Jell-O cubes to the ceiling

Draped in apparel I bathe in the smell I gild the lily
Adroitly crafted yet willy nilly I wear the lily
When I part with Milli Vanilli

And soon the pleasure barges
Rolled with the sun, pleasantly bloated
We mingles as one amidst debris of Debauchery,

And all the while gilded lily faded
Though it was the best I created
But gilded lily was still in place
It made a mockery of my face

And delivered us a surprise
The hulking mass of what we despised
We lurched away as we moved to snuff it
And we delivered a princely buffet

And the radios blared to the blunder

GWAR,"In the fortress of GWAR, much torment does remain
Despite all of the bodies that had been hacked in twain
So many had died in the viscous campaign
That their femurs alone made a fine mountain

The Master was no longer GWAR's sovereign
Of wealth and women they had none to gain
What goal was left for them to attain
So Oderus did call for conclave

First came Balsac, his council was wise
His War-Axe gleamed, he was a loyal knight
Plus forty dancing bears he did provide
Then, first in prowess, he stood his lord beside

Beefcake the Mighty, his ass was wide
Brought eighty laden oxen, he was a good ally
Jizmak the Gusha, his legion was described
For many hours he barked at the tribe

But then, timely, the catering arrived
Booze, drugs, food, four hundred hundred mule-loads high
Flattus Maximus, this he did supply
And now the mighty brothers of GWAR did band

They will to journey and slay without plan
Bring sledge and terror to the cities of man
Open Oberammergau
Like hell was a womb, it tore

And from the womb the creatures poured
Troll, goblin, Manticore
Siege machine and armored whore
There will be battle like never before

The Surface World learned of the malaise
Black Pope, usurper, he saw through the veil
They plan their defense in the land of the wasted
Africa, bitter fruit she had tasted

Ensign of industry, let it be raised
There the camp of the Black Pope was placed
His legions breath, through the valleys the raced
Charlots they rode, and their skulls were iron-plated

Belching fire, freshly painted
8000 Battalions of Knights freshly sainted
But before they fought, they were vaccinated
To protect them from the AIDS that had been created

To continue the reign of Black Pope unabated
The people at home, got a version G-rated
Here the GWAR invaded
Began the violation

The War Barges, forecastles swarming
Disgorging the troops, formations forming
The low drone of the horning
Sounding out a call, then a warning

A nuclear salvo where GWAR was encroaching
Within a second ten legions were toasting
Balsac said, ""Did you feel something?""
The Lord was not boasting

The enemy is vast, steel carpets the terrain
Still they are forming, armors detrains
They send forth a Captain, OJ by name
Flattus struck him in the brain

Burst the helmet, made two parts of the mind
Chopped through his gorget, through chest, into spine
And the good captains blood flowed like wine
Flattus said, ""So ends a cowards time.""

Balsac is angry, he'll have no more
He hurls his axe, with great effort
To smite Regis with terrible force
His shield breaks, his hauberk unsews

The axe bursts through his chest and torso
Bright blood spurts, the guts are loosed by the throw
And with that axe the soul from body goes
Said Jizmak, ""That was a heavy blow.""

Beefcake the Mighty, clotted with spew
His sword falls, skulls burst in two
The eyes burst from sockets, he is not through
Thousands of warriors he does this to

Piling up the corpses of those he slew
Until it was hard to tell if the pile grew
Balsac said, ""He is a princely lord""
Said Beefcake, ""Yes, it's true.""

Jizmak smites, his hammer whirls
Foreheads explode, entrails twirl
Breaking open brain-pans as well
Red blood flowing as souls speed to hell

Oderus smites the Black Pope, exposing his brain
The blade continued through meat and membrane
Bright blood flowed in the grass where he was lain

Only an odor reamains

So burn the bitter butter
Break out our murder machines
Bring me my scabbard my halber, my hauberk
Fetch me my enchanted greaves

The drugs they aren't helping it is the time for the old gods to die
To arms is the only cry

The say war is all we know
If only that were true
No matter how I work my schedule
There's always other things that I do
But excuse me now, there's a tank at the door
And that slave's head just rooled 'cross the floor...
He tries to say something and that something is puke
Right about then the pigs set off a nuke

When I said I loved war I lied
It fucking sucks on the losing side
And speaking of which, my face is on fire!
A lightning withdraw! we quickly retire!
A flury of carnage, my brainpan is nicked!
To my unending shame my ass just got kicked!
And as the shells fall in a relentless hail
The fortress was gutted and we had to bail...

Going in circles I wanna circle back wit him, uh
Back when we were friends, yeah them happy days
I really miss my boo boo hoping he don't stay way

Gwen Catley,"Can I forget you?
Or will my heart remind me,
That once we walked in a moonlight dream?

Can I forget you,
Or will my heart remind me,
How sweet you made the moonlight seem.

Will the glory of your nearness fade,
As moonlight fades in a veil of rain?

Can I forget you,
When every night reminds me,
How much I want you back again.

Can I forget you,
When every night reminds me,
How much I want you back again.","Can I Forget You?, song (from the film ""High, Wide and Handsome"")",1999
Gwen Catley,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Like to watch you all the day
And it certainly seems fine
Just to think that you'll be mine

Makes the living worth the while
So I've got to run around
Telling people what I've found

And when I told them how beautiful you are
They didn't believe me, they didn't believe me
Your lips, your eyes, your cheeks, your hair
Are in a class beyond compare
You're the loveliest girl that one could see
And when I tell them
And I certainly am goin' to tell them
That I'm the man whose wife one day you'll be
They'll never believe me, they'll never believe me
That from this great big world you've chosen me

Don't know how it happened quite
May have been the summer night
May have been; well, who can say?
Things just happen any way
All I know is I said ""yes""
Hesitating more or less
And you kissed me where I stood
Just like any fellow would

Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You

So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

And you should have told me when you met me
All these things I should know
I should have asked, we should have talked
About this so long ago

It's not fair, it's not fair
And don't leave me here

It feels so lonely here

We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next, you never know
We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next, you never know

And how can I accept this
How is this happening to me

It's not fair, it's not fair

There's me, there's you (Hoko ten)

They're hard to find in the States, got me feeling couture

What's that you got on
Is it Comme des GarÃ§on
A Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong
Mixed up with second-hand clothes
Flip the landscape when Nigo made A Bathing Ape
I've got oooo! expensive taste
I guess I better save up.

You bring style and color all around the world (you Harajuku girls)

Your lookin' so distinctive, like DNA
Like nothing I've ever seen in the USA
Your underground culture, visual grammar
The language of your clothing, is something to encounter
A ping-pong match between eastern and western
Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection
Just wait til you get your little hands on L.A.M.B.
Cause it's super kao wai, that means super cute in Japanese

And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the pay back, the pay back, the pay back

Champagne kisses, hold me in your lap of luxury
I only want to fly first-class desires, you're my limousine
So eloquent, the way we ride, our passion, it just multiplies
There's platinum lightning in the sky
Look I'm livin' like a queen

This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, baby
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love, we're rollin' in cashmere

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
When we touch it turns to gold
Sensitive and delicate, kinda like a tuberose
You know you are my treasure chest
It's pure perfection when we kiss and
You're my Mr., I'm your Miss
Gonna be until we're old

Have all your stories memorized
I've kissed your lips a million ways
But I still love to have you around

But I still love to have you around

And you're the one I want and it's not just a phase

Gwen Stefani,"Yo, VIP, let's kick it!

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye 
The kid don't play
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla  
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Adopting all your history, it's hard being me too
Are your secrets where you left them
Cause now your ghosts are mine as well
I think it's time I met them and I think it's time you tell

And you should have told me when you met me
All these things I should know
I should have asked, we should have talked
About this so long ago

It's not fair, it's not fair
And don't leave me here
How's this happening to me
It feels so lonely here

We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next, you never know
We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next, you never know

Now we share the closet, now you've let me come inside
And now you're finally undressing, and I feel like I might die
The damage is infectious, the confession is too late
And how can I accept this
How is this happening to me

It's not fair, it's not fair
And I come up for air
How's this happening to me
It feels so lonely here

We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next, you never know

You lied to me all these years

The sun's getting cold; it's snowin'
Looks like an early winter
For us
Looks like an early winter
For us
An early winter
Oh, I need you to turn me over

Why? Why do you act so stupid?
Why? You know that I'm always right

It looks like an early winter
For us
It hurts, and I can't remember sunlight
An early winter
For us
The leaves are changing color
For us
(It gets too much, it gets so much)
Starting over and over, and over again

Gwen Stefani,"Don't know what I'm doing back in the studio
Getting greedy 'cause he said he had another sick flow
So I had to holla back; guess I didn't get enough
Still be the one to land, and I send the tick-tock
If you give me a clap, I'm gonna give an encore
Don't want it to end; I wanna skank some more 
I'm tripping on the best dream that I never had
I guess behind the orange curtain is not so bad

From the West Side of Anaheim, a small world after all
Hanging out at the hotel, selling makeup at the mall
Making out to ""Purple Rain"" just like everybody else
Dame un beso, now stop, I'm trying to save myself
In the ordinary calling girl way
Back in the seven-one-four days
Trying to figure what I wanna be
Hanging in the garage, me and ND

I'm just an Orange County girl
Living in an extraordinary world

A lot of things have changed, but I'm mostly the same
These are a few of my favorite things
Still rollin' 'cause the 'Sound Of Music' 
Ain't nothing better than a great, big, huge hit
You know, I'd pay you just to let me run, dance, and sing
I know I'm living the E-ticket dream
For a girl from O.C., it's almost unheard of
So I wanna thank you all so much for the love (especially my girlfriends)

Pharrell on repeat, make a hurricane in Miami
Working with him, I'm gonna get myself another Grammy
I got the L.A.M.B., and he's rocking the Ice Creams
Blend it together, something fresh and kinda in between
Remember music is something that I love
So I don't really give a fuck
The music don't come in no color
It's time to move on hit you with the chorus

Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic

Red from blond, yeah bitch, I'm drastic
Why this? Why that? Lips stop asking
Listen to me baby, relax and start passing
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic

This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassing
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughing
Easy come, easy go, E V gon' be lasting

Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't gizell, cat walk and imagine
A lotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now, let me blow your mind

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Now, while you gritting your teeth
Frustration baby, you gotta breathe
Take a lot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me

Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find

Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your lines

And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now, let me blow your mind

Let your bones crack, your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blasting, sets while I mash out

Yeah nigga, mash out, D are E
Back track, think back, E V E
Do you like that? You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too

Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn she much thinner know now I'm complete

Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die, bitch, double are, can't crawl
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake nigga it was planned on

And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year

I want to get away to our sweet escape
I want to get away, yeah

You held me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground

So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy waiting on you to come save me
I can see that your angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me

If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet'
(The sweet escape)

If I could be sweet
(Sorry boy)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
We can make it better
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet'
(Sweet escape, sweet escape)

If I could escape, if I could escape

'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold'

If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet'
(The sweet escape)

If I could be sweet
(Sorry boy)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
We can make it better
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet'
(Sweet escape, sweet escape)

I want to get away to our sweet escape
I want to get away, yeah",The Sweet Escape [Konvict Remix],2008
