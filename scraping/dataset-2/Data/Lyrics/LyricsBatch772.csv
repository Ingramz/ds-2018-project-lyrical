Necrophobic,"Live by the sword and help to contain
The helpless minds of you all
Die by my hand in pools of blood
Clutch yourself as you fall
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
Children slaughtered in vain
Raping the maids, in which they serve
Only the words of the lord

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

Watch as flowers decay
On cryptic life that died
The wisdom of the wizards
Is only nurtured life
Black knights of hell domain
Walk upon the dead
Satan's sips upon
The blood in which he need

Die by the sword",Die by the Sword,1996
Necrophobic,"Leave the world of mortals to walk
Into the mist to stalk unto the other side

Plains of otherness
The utter emptiness
Where time have ceased and dark and light collide
Crossing the river of death and water cold
Slowly walking up the bridge
The jeweled bridge I walk for what seems a lifetime
In the night it's jewels glow

There on the other side
On shore of no return
The one for me awaits
Cannot avoid the eyes
In which the fire burns
Comed this far it is too late
And He calls my name
First a whispering then louder
And he wants me to follow
And to Enter the Eternal Fire...

I walk this endless night
His eyes the only light
Repeatedly he whispers my name
Fingers move and twist
Through crimson thick dark mist
And voices cry of agony and pain
Close now to his kingdom bleak world dark and still
I follow the voice whispering my name

Approach the gate of sin
Opened up to let me in and there, He stand in flames
Price now I must pay for eternity my soul his claim
For years of pleasures, victory and gold
The one who stand in flames
Now rise and walk my way and reach out for my soul
Fall down. The Eternal Fire...

I stand at the jaws of the pit
The heat scorch my flesh
The fall seem never to end
My hair burn
My eyes can't see
The flames slowly eat my soul
Pain tears my mind
Hear my cries oh Lord

Have mercy oh Lord
This can't be
Raging flames all over me
Inferno of heat",Enter the Eternal Fire,1996
Necrophobic,"Originally performed by Venom
By the shores of the ageing sea
Fools scream out destiny
They speak of vengeance and your gods
into the fire - out of the flame
The beast awakes - thousands are slayen
The mystic reads - forgotten tales
All hallows hail - your falling waves

Nightmare - this is your prize eternal
Nightmare - make no disguise infernal
Nightmare - you'll realize you lost in
Nightmare - Nightmare

Inside explodes - the butcher strikes
You'd love to die - your baby cries
Lead candles burn - just a decoy
The giant child - your his new toy

In the eye of the lions teeth
Your flesh becomes his meat
You lie devoured still full of life
Temples of ice - white desert breeze
The golden sun - prepares to freeze
Dying of thirst - drowing in pain
You wake in sleep - it starts again
",Nightmare,1996
Necrophobic,"We are the darkened souls
By nightfall we arise
The gates are open wide
The holy blood shall flow
Demonic desires to sacrifice
We burn the Christian ground
Crushing all that's sacred
Jesus Christ dethroned

Peeling the skin of the priests
Burn the holy bible
The horizon turns to black
Darkness and evil unleashed
The horde of infernal souls
Inverted is our cross
In the name of Satan
We summon the lord of hell

Christian slaughter
The season of Satan invoked
Christian slaughter
The unholy flame now burns

Gathering the darkness
To initiate the dark age
A time filled with hatred
Expulsion of all light
A creation of a shadowland
Where the wasteland lies in ruins
A realm darker than black
Eternally silent and cold

Under the diabolical moon
Legions of hell arrive
Descend upon the weak
As eternal devastation awaits
Welcome down to the abyss
The kingdom of pure evil
Where the fires forever burn
Where lord Lucifer possesses the throne

Christian slaughter
The season of Satan invoked
Christian slaughter
The unholy flame now burns

Necrophobic,"In the twilight hour at the dusk of my life I face the reaper's smile
I leave all fear as I cross the gates and begin my journey down
I found myself anesthetic to dwell forever in sin
But slowly I awoke to feel my hatred burn within

I have sailed my ship on a sea of blood, endless deep and red
I hit the shore with sails all torn, wounded, almost dead
Stranded in the underworld, growing like a seed
But I will find the ones above and I will make them bleed

Sinners come, sinners burn, sinners never leave
I'm not like them, I will return
My vengeance you will see

I punch my fist right through your flesh and tear out your fucking spine
Bending as hell until it snaps, now you are truly mine
Where is your almighty father now, forsaken you weep in pain
Wishing you where on that pathetic cross of yours as I mount you again, and again

This is where I've always been and what I always meant to be
A spirit in the shadow of Satan's mind, now finally I can see
The flames of hell burn in my soul and Lucifer's wrath is mine
Hell will be wherever I go and the reaper will be my guide

Superlunary orbital cosmic ecstasy
Out of the sky I burst in might
My vengeance you will see",Act of Rebellion,2002
Necrophobic,"Soon it is time to join the immortals
I strike on command, defeat leads me forward
Dust in the air, the bitter taste
Of death in my mouth, soon I'll be there

I am but one of thousands to go
The beast in my heart is all that I know
I slay to the ground all that I see
Death by my hand is all that will be

Up in the sky circling above us
Awaiting our death, awaiting our fall
The carnivores smile, the shadow of death
A vulture all black, but I have no fear

Soon it is me who is stabbed to the ground
My soul flying free, my spirit unbound
The greeting of death as my life fades away
Left on the ground my limbs to decay

Bloodhymns now loud and clear
Bloodhymns as life disappears

As I stand by the sea of blood
And bodies raped by silence
I hear the souls, the immortal ones
Sing a hymn for the dying

A new day will dawn and I will be gone
The blood that is spilled will dry in the sun
The sadest of songs still in the air
The anthem of blood will always be there

Wherever I go I still will be blind
Whatever they do, I'll always be numb
Infest my soul, devour my flesh
Scatter my dreams, only hatred is left",Blood Anthem,2002
Necrophobic,"Cut through my skin
Let my blood paint your face
In pleasure I scream
As my soul lies devoured

The ultimate enchantment
A dimension beyond pain
Light the black candles
Darkened ceremony begins

The cult of blood
The opening of hell has been done
The cult of blood
The hour of magic has begun

Cast your black spells
Let me be possessed
Show me desire
Visions unholy revealed

Engraved in my flesh
I bear the sign of thee
Embraced by the flames
The world beyond I see

Carry me through the passage
Grant me the powers of darkness

Floating through the sphere
Where damnation breeds
Ruler of utter dark
Bless me, infernal majesty

Necrophobic,"I am forever
Forever I will be
In the shadows of the old
My path litten by their gloom

Do what thou wilt
Dreams shall flesh
In the shadow of the shaman
Dreams shall flesh

I call for the ancients
For the bearer of light
In the dark I'll find my way
Never to be led astray
Lend me your torch
and I'll clothe my soul in black
Come with me into the night
Dance with me eternally

Dancing shadows around me whispering
Nosferatu, Mortiis, Incubus
Crawling, howling, roaring, ecstasy
Blood, skulls, death, blasphemy

Inverted pentacle
I dug myself so deep
Into the unholy soil
The black lotus seed

Witchcraft, black magic, sorcery
Kresnik, Dhampir, Kudlak, Kallikanzaros
Strigoii, Moroii, Draugr, walking dead
Slaughter of the weak and innocent

We are forever
Forever we will be
Purest evil side by side
Blackest star upon the sky
I seek for the kingdom
where hatred's burning free
And all the wisdom born of fire
will be a part of me",Dreams Shall Flesh,2002
Necrophobic,"The time will come when heaven will face our last attack
And hell will be among us under a sky solid black
Eternally dark and silent, their final destiny
Whose souls are put on fire by our hatred burning free

We strike with wrath upon them, born of christian blood
And so they meet the reaper, stripped of all their faith
The sea of blood is boiling, with rage it hits the shore
Their kingdom and their glory swept away forever more

Ooh...helfire
Aah...helfire
Aah...helfire
Ooh...helfire

Hidden in the shadows, about to seal their fate
Gathered in fury, we are to storm the gates
Darkness now is growing stronger than the light
In silence we're awaiting the long eternal night

The father and the spirit, their holy bastard son
As lies they'll be remembered, unholy we have won
Soon they lay forgotten, buried underground
Of heaven they'll see nothing, nor ever hear a sound

Ooh...helfire

Necrophobic,"In emptiness I roam
Through the sombre dawnings
I am a living dead
Haunted by shadows

End my fucking life - I will not cry
Let me fucking burn - I feel no pain

A life extinct, drowned in sorrow
Dazed by hate and deceit
I sense but immense apathy
When I hear the death bells toll within

Mourningsoul in torment
Dwell in the obscure
Forever to lurk the unknown
Where will I find my fate

Spread your deadly wings
Let them embrace my soul
Fly me through endless nights
Let me enter the dark domain

Bury my soul among the storms
When I step into an age of darkness
I yearn for thy blessing
Invoke the beast in me

I seek redemption, not for my soul
My salvation is not like yours to behold
The darkest sky bares scars of light
And even death is much to bright

Without a heart one cannot bleed
What is already dead can never leave
The utter cold is what I choose
With a frozen soul and my eyes closed

Take me down to hell - I'll swear the oath
Mark my bleeding soul - I'll sign in blood

As I watch my final sundown
Surrounded by past recollections
In the gathering dusk
Sorrow is exceeding me
When I close my eyes one last time
I see my burning wrath",Mourningsoul,2002
Necrophobic,"Driven by an iron will
Driven by a ghostridden thrill

Guide me to the entrance
Guide me through the netherworlds
Down the roots of Heldrasill
Aah, it's so cold here

So this is the kingdom
The domain of the frozen great
There I can see the ancients
Gigantic hrimthursar

Through Elivagor that cross the sphere
A frozen river of giant tears
Through Helivagor, the white domain
The hrimthurs dwelling where Ymer reigns

O, Aurgelmer
Oceans made of blood
Mountains made of bones
and the earth is flesh
The moon is full
The sky is clear
The night is still
O, Aurgelmer

In the frozen empire
So far away
I travel over iceclothed mountains
Far away alone

I start to shiver as my aura turns pale
Into second death

Necrophobic,"Ancient evil whisper through the winter breeze
Predatory creatures in desperate need of human blood
Hear the deaden choirs as they rise up from the abyss
The fallen angels condemned to wander endless nights

Metamorphosis, a last step into the unknown
From Faust to Mephisto, from light to dark, it has only begun
Float through Baphomet to coalesce with the unholy goat
The world is ours, the earth is now in our control

Nosferatu, prince of death, I speak thy name
Immortalized you haunt the night and thou wilt slay

There she lies with angellike face so peacefully
Pale white skin, unscarred, speaks of her innocence
She looks so calm but in her dream she twist in despair
Hallucinating of a rising burning hell

Incubus enter her dream
Fertilize her virgin womb
Plant the astral shadowseeds
Let her fucking burst

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

Help me sing it


How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know
When it's time,
Time to let go
Sing

All I really want
is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

I ask for the sign
From the sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me
But when you think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me

Oh I cannot hide the way I feel inside
(No I don't know why)
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
(Every day I wanna cry)
If I give you one more try
To there rules, will you abide
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything all right

All I really want
is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

I just wanna be so, so, happy
But the answer lies in me
I do believe
That we can be happy
I said I wanna be happy, yeah

Life is too short
To be tryin to play some games
Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way
Why do you have to play with my mind
All the time
Help me sing it

All I really want is for me to be happy
Ohhh, just help me sing it
All I really want is for me to be happy
Yeahhhhhhh
All I really want is for me to be happy
Oh, you know I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah
~repeat through chorus~

I don't wanna have to worry about nothin no more
Said I wanna be, said I wanna be, said I wanna be
All I really want
is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want is for me to be happy
Ohhh, just help me sing it
All I really want is for me to be happy
Yeahhhhhhh
All I really want is for me to be happy
Oh, you know I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah

I don't wanna have to worry about nothin no more
Said I wanna be, said I wanna be, said I wanna be
All I really want
is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine

If it makes you feel right
I could tell you nothing's wrong
It wouldn't make it alright

Go, see the world, it could change your mind
See what you find, digging in the dirt
Hide yourself away, out of sight and sound
See the more you learn, suggest you know

Yeah uhh uh
Freeway flow still in effect I might end up peallin a clip
Till the bullets still in the clip, clip still in the teck
I might end up stealing you bitch
Catch a body hide out in the Jets, Jets jersey with hat to match
Smack you bitch I'm in the club with Mack Jay and Dame
You cats better stay in your lane or lay in a ditch
Cause I'm ridin and my click feeling the same, till its my time to feel the flames
Imma chill in the blue flame all in the six
With my mind on my money and my money on my brain
Last thing he know all these hoes ain't use to know me now they like the boy
Ill take em to the black door give em the dick
she screaming that she been her before
Its like the five o'clock traffic jam we in the mix
you in the zone with the ROC bitch
Its the Lockness monster of rap boa constrictor of spitters the Nile river of flows
Be with Hova still roll with my niggaz and by the way all my niggaz move boulders
Like Barney rubble any trouble free muffle the gat
I'm young and black with a chip on my shoulder
Its my first album bout the brothers is back like men in black same city as Will
Freeway know for pulling the gat out all ya stacks haters want to rap
Put up ya deal haters I line em up shut em down shut up they trap
Go through they act, I one up they back, hit up they will
Other than that I'm killing theses tracks earning these stacks
trying to turn my vocals to a million

Til' this day, you won't get nuttin' from me
Got? some hot seashells prolly drop you'd tell
Before the cops come we bounce in big ass excursions
Huggin the road, fallin back
Blowin the spice with the windows cracked
Just another day around the way duckin the law
Got the ozium in the tuck, AC on defrost
Nuttin sweet with Neef, he ain't outta control
Back seat of my Jeep, we swingin episode
SS shotgun, let off 21, who want some
Bust a peggy who got dumb dumbs (pow, pow pow)
Fuck you think I come from
You betta go get one before its too late

Ay!

Black prophet, ya better believe, born to stop it
Yes I was, asalaam alaikum, not sayin I'm no apostle
Sometimes I pack a pistol, revolution calls
Ya better believe, from Mecca to Watts I'm speakin to all of, y'all
This (?? ??) will be the Final Call
So listen now, if you will sit back and let me speak the truth
Verbal in your wisdom, amounts to sayin nothin troop
Revolution calls, so pick up the gun it's on the run
Hip-Hop here, Africa here, now some live in fear
No fear, I clean myself don't put my backpack on the shelf
so's I can feed myself..
So follow me now, supposedly, we walk the road of bein free
Take it personal G, I'm speakin the truth and bitin the fruits
Drop the seeds get off your knees, don't be beggin Allah for mercy
Allah God, ain't no time for false prophets
Pullin metaphors out my pocket, I need to stop it
Grab the snake, by his head, make sure when you passin through
Ya best believe, from Mecca to Watts, I'm speakin to all of, you
Tell me revolution didn't come true, in ninety-two
I took 'em down from Western, to Slausson, along with you
Hypocrite no liar, I didn't burn 'em down for nuttin
From Mecca to Watts you best believe though, show yo' face
Unless you holdin up the place, be movin on
Revelation come, I won't be singin no song
Tryin to push no mountin, or bathin in no fountain
Move them apples out my face I coulda sworn I drank 'em down
Not tryin to be profound hysteria (?) I'm bringin 'em down
Still some, they hide behind the cross, now who's the boss?
Just because I meditate, doesn't mean I think I'm great
The devil, you're meddlin with my fate, nope we're not too late
Drop them on your left and, pick up your right arm
I-S-L-A-M don't think I'm slangin Islam
My people, they're witnesses the strongest in the belly of the beast
I say pack a piece, (?) just don't give me no grief
To say the least, now Jeffrey Dahmer had a piece
I step on the scene, friction (?) so you can see me
You know what I mean, tell-lie-vision will deceive you
At the age of three, you'll never be no good nigga
And I suppose you believe the devil
How you figure revolution comes
You better believe I'm pullin the trigger
Some sit back, and they choose to be rememberin
I'm stompin in my Timberlands, I'm comin at ya
African, marketplace, nod or sing or show my face
Reminiscin on, how we used to be, huggin and kissin
Now we con-dit-ioned
So follow me now, supposedly, we walk the road of bein free
Spiritual acceptance, inside your residence
Lookin inside yourself, somethin what's on your mind
Now that we're ropin and copin on the straight and narrow path
Don't be, hidin behind no superficial laughs
I guess I'm drinkin dirty water can't afford no Evian
From Mecca to Watts you best believe the revolution's on
Elijah Muhammad said, that many of us are soon to rise
Blue sky high-rises open up your eyelids
And realize, you're a gift kid by finger usin
That some of the words, that I speak, nope I'm not abusin
Walk with me, lead the weak, not your everyday
politician but I'm slangin thoughts no cost to the boss
Just take what's yours of course, our legacy was stole

Ho un nodo in gola che è difficile mandare giù
Fumo un po', sposto via la tenda 
Cielo grigio piombo io non lascio che mi prenda
La nostalgia che sale lentamente come mai 
Io penso a te mi chiedo adesso 
Dove sei cosa fai chissà se tu avrai mai pensato a me 
Al nostro fuoco che bruciava e mo' è cenere

Ma tutto passa piano e pure se fa strano 
Io sorrido perché so che oggi non ti chiamerò 
Quel che viene venga e mi sta bene 
Quel che è stato è già passato e mo' il passato se lo tiene
E piove già da un tot 
La pioggia bagna la mia pelle ma mi asciugherò 
Perché so che il tempo è ciclico 
E so che un po' di tempo è quello che ci vuole 
Mentre un guaglione sta scacciando il male sta aspettando il sole

Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me 
Salvami risplendi e scaldami
Voglio il sole
Cerco nuova luce nella confusione di un guaglione

E oggi è come ieri 
Ma forse è un'impressione frutto della mente di un guaglione 
Sarà che non c'è il sole 
Sarà che tutto sembra resti uguale 
Sarà quel che sarà sono preso male 
Ma nessuno chiama e non so chi chiamare 
Cerco di schiodarmi e penso solo a quello che ho da fare 
Uh gesù gesù 
Sono io la vittima dei demoni che tornano e che vengono a tirarmi giù 
I miei cattivi pensieri che mi aspettano braccano 
Parlano e parlano 
Dove sono I raggi che scaldavano un guaglione? 
Dove sono gli altri della mia ballotta mo' che sono nel ciclone? 
In dopa trovo la mia cura in dopa mischio le radici e la cultura 
L'energia pura la musica mi detta le parole 
Caccio queste rime e so che prima o poi ritorna il sole
 
Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me 
Salvami risplendi e scaldami
Voglio il sole
Cerco nuova luce nella confusione di un guaglione

Vada come vada e va da sé 
Conto solo su di me e già so che già sai che
Un chico fa quel che s'ha da fare quando amore non c'è 
Devo imbustare perché in tasca manca money 
Sempre più difficile restare calmo in questa situazione 
Sclero 
Non ne voglio più parto da zero 
So che in qualche modo devo andare su ma
Non c'è più luce solo buio che fa male 
Non c'è più pace solo rabbia che ogni giorno sale 
So bene dove sono e adesso voglio stare qui
Sentire il beat 
Se sei all'ascolto vieni a prendermi rapiscimi 
Musica colpisci al cuore boom cha boom cha 
Però non c'è dolore 
Uh distendi le tue mani guaritrici su un guaglione 
Mentre sta aspettando il sole

Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me 
Salvami risplendi e scaldami
Voglio il sole
Cerco nuova luce nella confusione di un guaglione

Oggi non c'è sole intorno a me

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy

Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Negative Space,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1970

This announcement from the producers of this record contains
Important information for radio program directors, and is not for broadcast.
The first cut on this record has been cross-format-focused for
Airplay success. As you well know, a record must break on radio in order to
Actually provide a living for the artists involved. Up until now, you've
Had to make these record-breaking decisions on your own, relying only on
Perplexing intangibilities like taste and intuition.
But now, there's a better way.
The cut that follows is the product of newly-developed
Compositional techniques, based on state-of-the-art marketing analysis
Technology. This cut has been analytically designed to break on radio. And
It will, sooner or later.
For the station that breaks it first, the benefits are obvious. You
Lead the pack. Yes, no matter what share of this crazy market you do
Business in, no other release is going to satisfy your corporation's
Current idea of good radio like this one. On this cut, we're working
Together, on the same wavelength, in scientific harmony.
But remember, this cut is const
Ructed for multi-market-breaking
NOW. Don't waste valuable research with needless delay. We've done the hard
Work of insuring your success; the final step is up to you.

Hi! I'm Candy Jo, and I'm shooting the Ingram M-10, or the Mac-10!
GUNS.
This gun is one of the most well-known machine guns in the world,
(GUNS.) not only because it has been featured in numerous Hollywood movies,
(GUNS.) but also because it has derived underworld popularity. (GUNS.)
The Mac-10 is the weapon of choice because of its concealability. (GUNS.)
With this gun, even I could stop most of the bad guys out there.
GUNS.
As you 
Can see, this gun is really fast! (GUNS.) It fires a 9
Millimeter round at a rate of 1200 rounds per minute! (GUNS.) That's, like,
20 shots per second! (GUNS.)
Not only that, it weighs just six and a quarter pounds, and it's
Only ten and a half inches long. (GUNS.)
Hello, my name is Julie, and this is the M-16. (GUNS.)
I'm shooting the MPK submachine gun. It's made in Germany, (GUNS.)
The MP stands for Machine Pistol. (THIS is a real gun.) This gun fires a 9
Millimeter cartridge at a rate of 550 rounds per minute. (GUNS.) That's
Close to 10 rounds per second!
(""they're no more difficult to operate than
A household appliance"")
What surprises me is how easy this gun is to handle. (GUNS.) I
Guess that's what makes it so much fun! (GUNS.)
The barrel on th
E MPK is six inches long, and I'm shooting it with
A 30-round magazine. (GUNS.) It weighs just six and a half pounds, (GUNS.)
And has a clever folding wire stock. (GUNS.) Those Germans really know how
To make a machine gun! (GUNS.)
Now THIS is a real gun.
 Not one of those wimpy submachine guns.
I mean, I've never fired a gun before in my life! (GUNS.) But let
Me tell you, once I got that machine gun in my hands, there was no stopping
Me! (GUNS.) It's a blast! I love it! (What a blast!)
It's a blast!

S a blast!

Issue to the Soviet Bloc Army, I might add! (It's a BIG gun!)

The fifty round drum is a lot of fun, because you can just shoot,
And just keep on shooting! (GUNS. GUNS. GUNS. GUNS.)

Control it, (GUNS.) I don't know what it is, but all the girls talked about
It...

I was going to be shooting the Uzi, I immediately recognized it as the gun

Ei! Será que eu já te vi em algum lugar? 
Tá aqui sozinha agora já não tá é 
Aí não sei o que não sei que lá

Para dissolver

Ninguém pode me impedir de fazer

Eu sei que não é tudo que eu posso mudar,
Mas eu não vou deixar, não posso deixar de ser livre,
Já não existe, escravidão não me oprime
Enquanto eu viver não vou esquecer,
Sei que não posso errar, sei que vou me lembrar quem eu sou

Fazer acontecer, lutar pra vencer,
Sem mudar o meu jeito de ser,

Sei que não estou só,
Se eu ficar na pior, ao menos eu tentei, eu tentei!

Haja o que houver minha voz vai ecoar,
Não penso em desistir, não ouso me calar, pois

Ninguém pode me impedir de falar
Ninguém pode me impedir de fazer
Ninguém pode me impedir de ser

Se eu me preocupar com o que vão dizer
Estou certo do que tem melhor pra te oferecer
E na busca incansável de quem sabe o que quer
Desafio, barreira, panela, funil, isso é o que é
Tudo isso já está na nossa conta
Só que felizmente nada disso mais me desaponta
E continuo forte, seguindo em frente
Sem roer a corda, constante, pra frente!

Eu sei que o tempo não volta,

Se entregar por inteiro, viver uma louca paixão
E se deixar levar, seguindo o coração
Deixando dores pra trás

Sei que vou te encontrar e amar cada vez mais
Esquecer o tempo vendo o pôr do sol na beira do cais
E assim como um par de pássaros voar pra um lugar
Só nós, a sós, com nossa voz iremos cantar
Essa hora chegará a mim virá, pode apostar, pode apostar

Só o amor constrói, sentimentos de paz
Só o amor constrói, o destino é quem faz
Só o amor constrói, constrói, de fato 
A maior felicidade é te ter ao meu lado

O destino me fez ir embora
O tempo vai nos dizer quem é quem
Pode não ser o fim da nossa história
O destino me trouxe até aqui
Minha intuição me diz pra continuar
Seguir meu coração

O destino nos uniu, você já sabe
Tudo começou como se fosse amizade
Naturalmente a gente foi se envolvendo
Foi se gostando, se conhecendo
Aquela noite eu me lembro, foi fatal
Não esperava o seu beijo num luau
Uma viagem se tornou inesquecível
Eu percebi que era mais que um amigo
Todo dia eu corria pra te ver
Eu admito, apaixonado por você
Mas de repente um casal as vezes briga
Eu fico triste, pois você é minha vida
Eu quero mais te amar todo o tempo
Convivência assim, sem sofrimento
Tô cansado de ficar aqui sozinho
Amor eu tô voltando, aí é o destino

O destino me fez ir embora (seu bye bye, assim, não foi legal)
O tempo vai nos dizer quem é quem (cê foi embora, amor, nem me deu tchau)
Pode não ser o fim da nossa história
O destino me trouxe até aqui (uma paixão não termina assim)
Minha intuição me diz pra continuar (tenho certeza, não é o fim)
E seguir meu coração

Quando eu acordo você vai dormir
Você me achou e eu te perdi
Entre encontros e desencontros
Será que é isso que a vida preparou
Para nós, saiba que não vou desistir
De estar com você

O tempo vai nos dizer quem é quem (cê foi embora, amor, nem me deu tchau)

Com a luz do sol já que não tem despertador
Ele não tinha nada, então também não tinha medo
E foi pra luta como faz um bom trabalhador

O homem que não tinha nada, enfrentou trem lotado
A sete horas da manhã com sorriso no rosto
Se despediu de sua mulher com um beijo molhado
Pra provar do seu amor e pra marcar seu posto

O homem que não tinha nada, tinha de tudo
Artrose, artrite, diabetes e o que mais tiver
Mas tinha dentro da sua alma muito conteúdo
E mesmo sem ter quase nada ele ainda tinha fé

O homem que não tinha nada, tinha um trabalho
Com um esfregão limpando aquele chão sem fim
Mesmo que alguém sujasse de propósito o assoalho
Ele sorria alegremente, e dizia assim

A de quarenta sempre foi o seu amor maior

O homem que não tinha nada, tinha um problema
Um dia antes mesmo foi cortado a sua luz
Subiu no poste experiente, fez o seu esquema
Mas a noite reforçou o pedido pra Jesus

O homem que não tinha nada, seguiu a sua trilha
Mesmo caminho, mesmo horário, mas foi diferente
Ligou pra casa pra dizer que amava sua família
Acho que ali já pressentia o que vinha na frente

O homem que não tinha nada
Encontrou outro homem que não tinha nada
Mas este tinha uma faca
Queria o pouco que ele tinha, ou seja nada
Na paranoia nóia quem não ganha te ataca

E escreveu no asfalto ""saudade do Josué""

Che su un ciglio sa restare
Per questo senz'avere
Paura di cadere giù

Io non lascio traccia
Come pioggia sulla neve
Quando cado mi confondo
Con quello che già c'è
Si scioglie la mia faccia
Nel fango dei ricordi
Quando vivo mi confondi
Con quello che già c'è
Sono invisibile

Non ho del sale sulla lingua e non mi aspetto
Che piovano parole tanto qui è un deserto
La voce che si asciuga e resta dentro al petto
E non c'è rischio che si perda per difetto
Se zitto sai restare
Non devi più pensare
Al rischio di cadere giù

Io non lascio traccia
Come pioggia sulla neve
Quando cado mi confondo
Con quello che già c'è
Si scioglie la mia faccia
Nel fango dei ricordi
Quando vivo mi confondi
Con quello che già c'è
Sono invisibile

E mi manca l'aria
E mi manca il fiato
E non ha sapore
Questa mia pelle senza odore
E ancora mi credi
Fatto di niente
E non ti accorgi che son io
A scegliere di essere
Pioggia su neve
Su quello che già c'è
Sono invisibile

Io non lascio traccia

Negramaro,"Ho sentito dire che c'è
Un matto in giro con le tasche
Piene di parole 
E sogni che nessuno ha realizzato
E non sa coltivare 
Se non dentro la sua testa vuota
E dentro le speranze 
Di chi non ha mai deciso niente
Sono ancora avvolti in cellophane 
E carta d'alluminio
E pesano di tutti quei rimpianti 
Che ogni uomo ha dentro
E pensano che siano ottimi rimedi contro il tempo
Perché possa un giorno 
Muoversi in un altro senso

Ho sentito dire che quel matto 
È ancora in giro adesso
E vomita parole da un megafono 
Che resta spento
E non si dà mai pace 
Fino a quando ogni sguardo è appeso
Alle sue tasche ancora troppo piene 
Di conigli e fiori
E solo adesso me ne rendo conto 
Che non c'è nessuno in giro
E che è soltanto quel che penso 
Mentre poi mi guardo intorno
Ci che vedo è il mio riflesso 
Su uno specchio troppo stanco
Di morirmi sempre addosso

Quel matto son io
Che vorrebbe un cappello più grande
Ed un paio di mani più attente
Che nascondan bene perfino alla gente
Il segreto
Di quel che son io
Che se avessi un cappello più grande
Ti terrei da quel mondo distante
Tra fiori e conigli non pesa alla gente il segreto
Di te
Tra fiori e conigli perfino la gente ha paura 
Di me

Ho sentito ridere dell'uomo delle debolezze
Ogni volta che per ogni sbaglio ha perso le certezze
Dentro a quel cilindro nero 
Non nasconde più sorprese
Solo quello che rimane 
Senza trucco e senza attese
Sembra un pozzo senza fine e senza fiori da mostrare
I conigli tremano non sanno più scappare
Poi mi guardo intorno
È sbiadito il mio riflesso
Su uno specchio troppo stanco
Di morirmi sempre addosso

Che vorrebbe un cappello più grande
Ed un paio di mani più attente
Che nascondan bene perfino alla gente

E tutti gli altri mesi li ho rapiti e poi rinchiusi 
E quello che voglio è che tu 
Tradisca i tuoi destini e poi mi segua ad occhi chiusi 

Il rosso mi piace di più 
Spalmato bene in viso fa sembrare un po' più vivi 
E quello che chiedo è che tu 
Tu tinga di speranza tutti quanti i miei sospiri

Nasconde molte cose che nel cielo vedi chiare 
E quello che cerco è che tu 
Non abbia ancora troppe cose vere da sputare 

La fine mi piace di più 
Hai solo un letto caldo e spento ancora da rifare 
E quello che spero è che tu 
Ai piedi di quel letto possa dirmi ""C'è un mondo da rifare""

Da un cielo terso e limpido
Che non nasconde alcun rumore

Nel mondo di con tutti che ci sia poca bellezza da salvare e da rubare
Non sanno mica quanta ne nasconda questo mio stupore

Negramaro,"Ho leccato via il sale dagli occhi
Per saperti più forte degli altri
Ho nascosto le pieghe del nostro cuscino perché tu non possa annoiarti
Ho rubato l’odore dei sensi
Ti ho sentito con il naso che menti
Ho tenuto ben stretto tra i denti il respiro per non far sapere i tormenti
Ho sentito il rumore del cielo
Diventare ogni giorno più grande
Ho copiato i frastuoni
Che fanno anche gli alberi quando la vita è ingombrante
Ho ingoiato il sudore del mare
Indossando le nuvole grigie
Ho capito che tutto appartiene al resto che manca non solo se esiste
Vivere non è abbastanza se
Non c’è distanza che
Non ti permetta di desiderare
Perdersi per poi riprendersi
Non è dividersi
Siamo sostanza che non può sparire

Ho strappato le ali dei sogni
Per cadere ogni volta sui tetti
Preferisco restare coi gatti sul mondo che tanto comunque ritorni
E ti accorgi che quello che senti
Ha radice nel posto dei santi
Ma tradotto nei gesti dell’uomo che sbaglia ogni volta si torna perdenti
Ho invitato le nuovi stagioni
Per cambiare la pelle del giorno
Ho coperto ogni singola parte di pelle del corpo con petali e fiori
Ho chiamato per nome coi santi
Troppo comodi troppo distanti
Li ho convinti ad avere paura di quelli che giocano a fare i potenti.
Vivere non è abbastanza se
Non c’è distanza che
Non ti permetta di desiderare
Perdersi per poi riprendersi
Non è dividersi
Siamo sostanza che non può sparire
Vivere non è abbastanza se
Non c’è una danza che
Non ti convinca di poter volare
Liberi senza rinchiudersi e infine arrendersi a questa stanza che non sa dormire

Mi sono accorto proprio adesso
Che non ha muri quest’inverno
Dagli occhi passa solo vento
E porta via con se il rimpianto
Di un cielo che non si è più spento
Illudimi che adesso posso
Vivere
Vivere
Vivere non è abbastanza se
Non c’è una danza che
Non ti convinca di poter volare
Liberi senza rinchiudersi e infine arrendersi a questa stanza che non sa dormire.
A questa stanza che non sa dormire
In questa stanza che non sa dormire
Siamo sostanza che non può sparire
Non puoi sparire

Riaffiorano sbiaditi in mezzo a tanti altri

Chi eravamo noi

Ridammi indietro il cuore che non voglio più tornare
Ridammi indietro il cuore, e no

Tu che te ne fai di un uomo indifferente e
Hai scoperto mai chi eravamo noi?
Sembra un'altra ormai la vita che tu vuoi
Stringimi fino a sentire che ancora

Ridammi indietro il cuore
Ridammi indietro il cuore che non riesco più a parlare e
Ridammi indietro il cuore che non posso più aspettare
E ridammi indietro il cuore, non ne voglio più parlare
Tu ridammi indietro il cuore che non posso più aspettare

Portami indietro a guardare l'eclissi
Nascondimi dalle paure degli altri
Insegnami come affrontare gli abissi
Per poi risalire nei cieli più alti
Raccoglimi dalle cadute nei boschi
E spingimi verso sentieri già persi
Raccontami di quanto siamo più forti
Adesso che abbiamo trovato noi stessi
Ricordami ancora quei giorni felici
Se sono legati a dei baci rubati
Cancellami tutti i pensieri più tristi
Se mai per noi due ce ne fossero stati
Inventami storie di miei vecchi amici
E quanti ne ho avuti se li ho rispettati
Raccontami di quando ci siamo visti quell'unica volta in cui ci siamo amati (amati)

Ne ammazzi metà

Che sei solo e in mutande
Quando inizi a capire
Che tutto è più grande

E una botta che dò
Tra un amico che perdo
E un amico che avrò
Che se cado una volta
Una volta cadrò
E da terra, da lì m'alzerò

Ho imparato a sognare,
Quando inizi a scoprire
Che ogni sogno
Ti porta più in là
Cavalcando aquiloni,
Oltre muri e confini
Ho imparato a sognare da là
Quando tutte le scuse,
Per giocare son buone
Quando tutta la vita
È una bella canzone
C'era chi era incapace a sognare
E chi sognava già

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way,
""Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way""

Più del possibile
Hello, hello, amore mio
Hello, hello, amore mio
Cosa posso fare per tornare a ridere
Di questa cosa antica che
Tu chiami vivere?
Hello, hello, amore mio
Hello, hello, amore mio

Ma voglio stare bene
Sopra questa barca che va e non va
Spegni quella luce
Guarda come brilla la città
E senti come piove
Ora siamo soli io e te
Lacrime di giove
Si che siamo vivi ancora

Mentre il meglio dei miei anni
Sta ballando dentro a un gin
In bianco e nero su YouTube
Mi ripasso “I have a dream”
C’è tutto un mondo che si è perso
Per arrivare fino a qua
Oggi ho gli esami di coscienza
E di uscire non mi va",Voglio Stare Bene,2018

No challenger, my mission can't fail

Focus till it manifest pin-point accurate
That's a sure bet, and Villain's no gambler
Freeze-frame a thought like it's caught on camera
Advice is free of charge, just pay attention
A donation as they say in this dimension
A game-winning strategy, support your favorite charity
Playing with polarity could drain a whole battery

Erased all the tension that my mind was inventin'

And building the empire higher, acquire light
And he's growing to be enlightened, a frightening sight
Like Michael Myers when he strikes with the knife
Better grab your reds it's about to get epic
So shoot it in high res while they aligning with the message

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2003

The sweet fulfillment of your secret longing

Neil Byrne,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Though many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
Twas grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Was blind but now I see",Amazing Grace,2010
Neil Byrne,"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who out drew you
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who has seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Neil Byrne,"There's a spot in old Tir conaell, there's a wee house in the glen, 
Where dwelt an fairest colleen, who charmed the hearts of men, 
She was winsome hale and hearty, shy and graceful as the dawn, 
Neighbours loved that widow's daughter, happy laughing Noreen Bawn.

Till one day there came a letter, with her passage paid to go, 
To the land where the Missouri, and the Mississippi flows, 
Then she said goodbye to Ireland, and next morning at the door, 
That old mother broken hearted, bid farewell to Noreen Bawn.

Many years that mother waited,till one evening at the door, 

Stood a gorgeous looking lady, costly were the clothes she wore, 
Saying mother dont you know me, for I've only got a cold, 
But thoes purple spots upon her cheeks, the tragic story's told.

There's a graveyard in Tir Conaill, where the blossoms sadly grow, 
There's a sorrow stricken mother, kneeling o're that lonely grave.
My Noreen, oh my Noreen its lonesome since you've gone, 
Twas the shame of emigration, laid you low my Noreen Bawn",Noreen,2011
Neil Byrne,"As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying ""Stand and deliver"" for he were a bold deceiver

[Chorus]
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o. Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

[Chorus]

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny drew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

[Chorus]

't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

[Chorus]

Now there's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

[Chorus]

If anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenny
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

Neil Byrne,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see, is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go

There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that will sing
Within your heart

Neil Carswell,"My baby makes me proud, Lord don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd
Cause people like to talk, Lord, how they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights, I know she'll be leaving with me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad I'm a man
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My, behind closed doors

My baby makes me smile, Lord don't she make me smile

So what now?
What advice can you give me?
What advice can I give humanity?
I suppose so
Live your life
Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others
Remember that you’re not your salary
You’re not your house you’re not your car
And no matter how big your bank account is
Your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s
So enjoy the days you have
Worry not bout the days that came before you
Nor the ones that will follow you in death
Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed
And the fact that you are living is what life is all about
So live your life to the fullest
According to your happiness and the betterment of all

Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Oh no, man
I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one

One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap
When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, accept Him",AfricAryaN,2017

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The song that Crosby sings

Baking down upon our sides

Your hands gentle in reply

Cools the sweat inside my palms

Held my hand out, and I let her take me

Unknowing what is and denying what seems

When the evening comes to set me free
When the quiet house that wait beyond the day
Make peaceful sounds in me

Took a drink from a glass of old wine

And feel it one more time

Can you hear it, babe
From another time
From another place
Do you remember it, babe

And the radio played like a carnival tune
As we lay in our bed in the other room
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream
In a penny arcade, if you know what I mean

And here's to the times we used to know
It's hard to hold them in our arms again

Echoes just beneath the heart

Sail along, sail along in search of a star that you can hold.
And we journey far to where that star may lead to (lead to).

And of river queens of paupers and of men with means,

But something's lost when somethings gained
Living everyday

From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all",Both Sides Now,1981
Neil Diamond,"One, knowing I'm one, hearing of two
And like a child believing dreams

The night alone will hear
And the night don't care

Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in a summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was lo-ong
And the moon stood still for the night birds song
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

But if you stay I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go-o I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

If you go away as I know you must
There'll be nothin' left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face 
Can I tell you now as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly till your next hello
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I-I love so much

For the good's gone from goodbye

Are you going away?
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace
Left behind.
Well I could have loved you better
I didn't mean to be unkind
You know, that was the last thing on my mind

Echoing through painted smiles
And I knew each morning after
I never loved, was never touched
Gave not at all, got back as much
In the co-o-omfort of
A modern day version of lo-o-ove

Truly, how I've cursed the sweet taste
Of lips that ask so-o much of me
Still I wonder with every embrace
Could I give, and not break
Should I care, and forsake
All the co-o-omfort of
A modern day version of lo-o-ove

Close my eyes and keep on runnin'
Realise it isn't gonna work anymor-ore
For me, yeah-eah
I'm afraid, well maybe that's somethin'
Never cared enough to be afraid of anything
Before, not before ...

And I was night time
I one day woke up
To find her lying
Beside my bed
I softly said
""Come take me""
For I've been lonely
In need of someone
As though I'd done
Someone wrong somewhere
I don't know where
Come lately

You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the words
I am the tune
Play me

Song she sang to me
Song she brang to me
Words that rang in me
Rhyme that sprang from me
Warmed the night
And what was right
Became me

You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the words
I am the tune
Play me

And so it was
That I came to travel
Upon a road
That was thorned and narrow
Another place
Another grace
Would save me

You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the word
I am the tune

Neil Diamond,"Suzanne takes you dow-own 
To her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And you know the girl's half-crazy
That's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges 
That come all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her 
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength 
And lets the river answer 
That you've always been her lover-er

And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watchin' 
From a lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain 
Only-why drownin' men could see him
He said all men are sailors, then
Until the sea shall free them
Bu-ut he, himself, was broken
Long before the sky would ope-en
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a sto-o-one

And you want to travel with him
Ahh you want to travel bli-ind
And you-ou think that you might trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Suzanne takes you down 
To her place by the river
And you can hear the boats that go by
You can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey 
On Ou-our Lady of the Harbor
And she shows you where to look 
Amid the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morni-ing
They are leanin' out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds her mirror",Suzanne,1981

And it never made a sound
So we never ran for cover

And it brought us together
Maybe tore us all apart

And someone is waiting to see me too
Yeah, but Laura
I want to see you again

Cause I remember when
Love was new and you were mine
My love

So why should we pretend
We were lovers but now we're friends
Don't want to say good-bye to you again
My love

[Chorus]
It should have been me
That's holding you instead of someone else
I needed you but never let it show
It should have been me
That's loving you
Through all the lonely nights
I knew that I should have never let you go
My love

What we once had is gone
No tears, no right, no wrong
We could never be the same again

You still believe our love could grow
Don't want to say good-bye to you again

With another broken heart
On my own again

Neil Diamond,"I get up in the morning and I go to work.
I try to keep busy but I feel the hurt.
I see you around me everywhere I turn,
But you're gone - lost in Hollywood.

You got up one morning,
Said you had to go.
You would've gone
Even if I told you ""no.""
And all I could say was,
""Baby just take it slow,
You take care,
Don't get lost in Hollywood.""

You had your dream, you had to find it.
I begged you, ""Girl, please don't go.""
Now when I call to find if you're in,
The answer always is ""no.""

You had to make it on your own,
Just had to do it all alone for a while.
Was not a lot that I could say.
You had to have it your own way,
I suppose.
Like some river that flows to the sea.

And I should've known,
That in time you would be leaving me,
Leaving me.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.

I get home in the evening,
But I just can't sleep.
I lay on your pillow,
And I feel your heat.
And everything here
Just keeps on reminding me
That you're gone - lost in Hollywood.

I walk the streets, it sounds of laughter,
But I hear only the pain.
The morning comes,
The sunshine greets me,
But I feel only the rain.

But something gets me through the day,
Something in my heart keeps saying to me,
I just know you can't be far away.
When you come home
Everything's going to work out okay,
Okay.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.

If you know where to find her,
Then kindly remind her.
While searching for finer,
She's left love behind her,
Yeah.

She's lost in Hollywood.

Hey, has anybody seen my girl?
She's lost in Hollywood.",Lost in Hollywood,1986
Neil Diamond,"How can I stay in this place

That we could never find an answer

Leaving my heart in my hands
Saying goodbye is such a chore

And we had something,
There can be no doubt

When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind

And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
It all went wrong

I dreamed a dream of time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

When I was young and unafraid
When dreams were made
And used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid

No song unsung, no wine un-tasted
But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
And they tear your hope apart

As they turn your dream to shame....
She slept this summer by my side
She filled my days with endless wonder
She took my childhood in her stride

But she was gone when autumn came
And still I dream she'll come to me
That we will spend the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be

And there are storms we cannot weather

So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
But life can't kill

We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way

Why, you've become a grown-up girl

In a corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be

Teacher'd say, ""He's just not trying
He's got a good head if he'd apply it""

With dragons and kings

Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way

He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeers really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two

Many times, many ways
""Merry Christmas to you""

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

All you get is pain 
When I wanted sunshine I got rain 
 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer

Neil Diamond,"Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink and I'll tell you some lies
Got nothin' to lose so you just sing the blues
All the time

Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here with nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile

First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do when the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold when you love's on the rocks

First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say

Go to my head
Make me forget that I
Still need her so

Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
But memories won't go
No, memories won't go

I'd have sworn
That with time
Thoughts of you
Would leave my head
I was wrong
And I find
Just one thing
Makes me forget

Don't let me be alone

Stay and let me look at you
It's been so long, I hardly knew you
Standing in the door

Stay with me a while
I only wanna talk to you

To find ourselves again

September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way

Look at what you've done
Why, you've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In a corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before

September morn
Do you remember
How we danced that night away
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way

Neil Diamond,"The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came
From country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went

Born is the King of Israel

Hang a shining star upon the highest bough

Neil Diamond,"Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible says
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas Day

Hark, now hear the angels sing
New king's born today,
And man will live for evermore,
Because of Christmas Day

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear the child
Not a single room was in sight

By and by they found a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark, now hear the angels sing
New king's born today
And man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas Day

While shepherds
Watched their flocks by night
They saw a bright new shining star
And heard the choir from heaven sing
The music seemed to come from afar

Trumpets sound and angels sing,
Listen to what they say
That man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas Day",Mary's Little Boy Child,1994
Neil Diamond,"O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by

Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love

Oh morning stars together,
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the king
And peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven

Oh morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the king
And peace to men on earth

Neil Diamond,"Dry your eyes, take your song out
When it's a newborn afternoon
And if you can't recall the singer, can you still recall the tune?
Dry your eyes and play it slowly, just like you're marching off to war
Sing it like you always wanted, like you sung it once before
And from the center of the circle, to the biggest of the waiting crowd
If it ever is forgotten, sing it long and sing it loud
And come dry your eyes

And you taught us more about living, than we ever cared to know
And we came to learn a secret, and we never let it go
And it was more than being holy, though it was less than being free
And if you can't recall the reason, can you hear the people see?
Right through the lightening and the thunder, to the dark side of the moon
To that distant falling angel, that descended much too soon
Come dry your eyes

Dry your eyes, take your song out
It's a newborn afternoon
And if you can't recall the singer, you can still recall the tune
And come dry your eyes
Come dry your eyes
Dry your eyes",Dry Your Eyes [Live At Winterland Ballroom / 1976],1996

Neil Diamond,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you,""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by",As Time Goes By,1998
Neil Diamond,"Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand,
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more

So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell
I can feel
You are love

Do you love me
As I love you

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

Neil Diamond,"You are my special someone
All I will ever need
I know I'd be lost without you
I hope you'd be lost without me
I've searched alone
But your the only one
You're what I want
When things are said and done
I guess I only needed
Someone who was just like you
Someone who'd be
My special someone too
I stumbled down love's main highway
But not without takin' some falls
I've seen my illusions fly away
Until I had none left at all
And then you rescued
What was left of me
What maybe some would call a fantasy
But me, I'd have to say it only proves
How strange love moves
I need to be your special someone too
'Cause what I needed most
Is what she gave to me
And where she lays her head
Is where I want to be
There's something wrong with losing
What we finally found
Now when I've lost my way
I've got my special someone round
And when she needed love
She found it here with me
Now where I lay my head
Is where she wants to be
I've got a secret but it's one
That's hard to keep
I want to tell the world
That special someone is my girl
That special someone is my girl
She wants to be my special someone too",My Special Someone,2001
Neil Diamond,"I've been up, I've been down
I've been so turned around
That I've seen my fate
In the eyes of others
I've been high, I've been low
But there's one thing I know
There's a lot to give
When we give to each other
So I bring you my song
Hoping you'll sing along
Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight
And turn down the lights
First we're here, then we're gone
But the music plays on
From the heart of one
To the heart of another
It's goodnight, not goodbye
We're just done for awhile
We'll be back again
With some new things discovered
And we'll bring you our song
Hoping you'll sing along
Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight
Come turn down the lights
So I bring you my song
Hoping you'll sing along
Turn down the lights
Turn up the music

(Thanks very much, I'm gonna do one song for you, but I'm gonna do it good)

Dry your eyes, take your song out
When it's a newborn afternoon
And if you can't recall the singer, can you still recall the tune?
Dry your eyes and play it slowly, just like you're marching off to war
Sing it like you always wanted, like you sung it once before
And from the center of the circle, to the biggest of the waiting crowd
If it ever is forgotten, sing it long and sing it loud
And come dry your eyes

And you taught us more about living, than we ever cared to know
And we came to learn a secret, and we never let it go
And it was more than being holy, though it was less than being free
And if you can't recall the reason, can you hear the people see?
Right through the lightening and the thunder, to the dark side of the moon
To that distant falling angel, that descended much too soon
Come dry your eyes

Dry your eyes, take your song out

Got a beautiful sound

Like the clickety-clack

And it's fit me as well
As a hand in a glove
Yes it does, yes it does

What a beautiful noise
Comin' up from the park
It's the song of the kids
And it plays until dark

It's the song of the cars
On their furious flights
But there's even romance
In the way that they dance
To beat of the lights

It's a beautiful noise
And it's a sound that I love
And it makes me feel good
Like a hand in a glove
Yes it does, yes it does

Made of joy an of strife

By a passing parade

I can almost hear my mother
Callin', ""Neil, go find your brother
Daddy's home, and it's time for supper
Hurry on""

And I see two boys
Racin' up two flights of staircase
Squirmin' into Papa's embrace
And his whiskers warm on their face
Where's it gone
Oh, where's it gone

Two floors above the butcher
First door on the right
Life filled to the brim
As I stood by my window
And looked out on those
Brooklyn Roads

I can still recall
The smell of cookin' in the hallways
Rubber drying in the doorways
And report cards I was always
Afraid to show

Mama'd come to school
And as I'd sit there softly crying
Teacher'd say, ""He's just not trying
He's got a good head if he'd apply it""
But you know yourself
It's always somewhere else

I built me a castle
With dragons and kings
And I'd ride off with them
As I stood by my window
And looked out on those
Brooklyn Roads

Thought of going back
But all I'd see are strangers' faces
And all the scars that love erases
But as my mind walks through those places
I'm wonderin'
What's come of them

Does some other young boy
Come home to my room
Does he dream what I did

And goodies on his sleigh
