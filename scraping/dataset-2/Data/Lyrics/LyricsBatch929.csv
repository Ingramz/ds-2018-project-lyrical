Rick Sheppard,"Oh, when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot you wish your tired feet were fire proof
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be havin' some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

From the park you hear the happy sound of a carousel
Mm-mm, you can almost taste the hot dogs and french fries they sell
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be

Rick Sheppard,"When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stars
And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street

On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Up on the roof

At night the stars put on a show for free
And darling you can share it all with me
I keep-a tellin' you

Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a Paradise that's trouble-proof
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof

Up on the roof",Up on the Roof,1996
Rick Silanskas,"A long and lasting love
Not many people find it
But those who do their whole life through
Put their heart and soul behind it
A long and lasting love
A long and lasting love
Is what I've always dreamed of
And when I look into your eyes
I knew I'd really seen love

A long and lasting love
We share for many reasons
A special bond
That goes beyond the changing of the seasons
A long and lasting love
A long and lasting love
Someone I can care for
Someone to bethere for the rest of my life
A long and lasting love

I never thought that I would meet someone so beautiful
I never thought I'd see a love like this
Tonight I'll show you that our love is something beautiful
And I'll seal it with a kiss

A long and lasting love
Is what I've always dreamed of
And when I looked into your eyes
I knew I'd really seen love
A long and lasting love
A long and lasting love

Rick Simerly,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Rick Simerly,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2003

I've told my heart to know my tears at the bottom of the ocean
I hit the ground, I hate the dirt
When cold turkey on the church
I just keep on running running running running

I camp real good, and laying low
I got the hang of breaking
But today I feel like volcano

Cant hold it down, it's breaking loose

It came unexpected

Hit me like a nap trip
With you, you're my rusty car
I'm afraid, but there's no point in loving loving loving
Jumping off the window seat
Laying all the cities
I left a note to pay my bills, I wonder if they'll miss me
Cause I don't know when ill return

Walking out quite late one night 
Not feeling happy or feeling down 
In the dark I stumbled over something on the ground 

As I got to my feet 
I heard a strange voice singing low 
Shout out a song I won't forget 
Until my dying day I know 

She said 
Sha, la, la 
Sha, la, la

When I heard her singing 
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la

First my impulse was to run 
But then the magic caught my ear 
An unforgettable refrain 
A song for all the year

Well then I heard her singing 
Sha, la, la
Sha, la, la

In despair I cried out loudly 
Begging for her to come out 
Suddenly has it began 
The sha la song died out 

At last I realized who had sung it 
Quite amazed I turned to see 
The tall trees waving me goodbye 
The sha la song and me 
They sought me

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice
In the church where the wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Inside a window
Wearing a face she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

Father Mackenzie writing the words to a sermon no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks
In the dark because nobody's there
What does he care

Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

Look at all the lonely people
Look at all the lonely people
Look at all the lonely people
Look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
No body came

Father Mackenzie wiping the dirt from his hands
Has he walks from the grave
No one was saved

Where do they all come from

Where do they all belong

Merry go round 
Go round 
And they make me dizzy 
People shouting as they shot and win 

And my head is ringing 
My ears are flitting 
And my hair is thinning 
And the carnivals spinning 
 
After the people have gone 
I walk along down sideshow ally 
And from the tent I hear some crying 
The sound of someone in pain 

And written brightly on the canvas and woodwork 
So that everybody could see 
Was the question they pose to the public 
When is a man not a man 
When he's a freak in the sideshow 

But we all got to cry 
Yes, we all got to cry 
And we all got to cry

Maybe, I'm silly to think we'd have made it.

When he took her home and he said,
""I need you, won't you stay?""
And all through the night his eyes had a light
That burned very bright and she hoped
His words weren't well read lines
A little ill at ease she whispered ""Baby, please...

Treat me gently in the morning
Take my heart but stay with me
Treat me gently in the morning, please""

Her mamma said, ""Silly girl you should marry him or leave
He'll only make you grieve when he decides it's over
Wake up child""
But the years fell away, they grew closer they found
Though they had their ups and downs just like lovers do
Still she'd say, ""It's okay to fight, when were alone late at night
I'll always say...

Treat me gently in the morning
Take my heart but stay with me
Treat me gently in the morning, please""

It all went so fast one day he went away
He said St. Tropez but he died that winter in a plane
The last thing he sent was a postcard from Rome
It read, ""I'm coming home, Lady, I love you""
And under his name was a P.S. that read

Rick Springfield," Well I'm sick of hanging out on the street
Every saturday night with the boys
Listening to the radio's big beat
We crank it just to hear the noise

Yeah we talk about the girls, girls, girls
And we talk, talk, talk all night
Sure we're all romeos and casanovas
But we can't seem to get it right

Seems I'm making it harder and harder
While everybody else is doing well
I get confused by their bodies
I get tangled in their curls
How do you talk to girls
How do you talk to girls
What's a poor boy to do
Tell me how do you talk to girls? 
How do you talk to girls? 

I see this girl over there right away
I'm trying to think of something to say
Well I think I'll have one more drink
I'll be ready to make my play
But this guy moves in and he talks to her
And she nods her head
Well I'm used to missing out on the girl
But I want to know what he said

Seems I'm making it harder and harder
While everybody else is doing well
I get confused by their bodies
I get tangled in their curls
How do you talk to girls? 
How do you talk to girls? 
What's a poor boy to do
I'm tangled up in their curls

How do you talk to girls? 
How do you talk to girls? 
Out of wisdom and out of pearls
Tell me how do you talk to girls

Am I stupid or misunderstood
I'd say something clever if I only could
We're only ten feet apart
But it feels like the world

How do you talk to girls? 
How do you talk to girls? 
Out of wisdom and out of pearls

You've got me calling your name in my sleep 
We've held each other while we cried through the night 
It always turned out alright
But I fell victim to a parallax view 
I sensed a change but I swore it was you 
I shied away when you needed me most 
I didn't see what I was doing, now I'm left destitute
I never knew how lost I could be 'til today 
My panorama's dark, my sight's been stripped away 
I can't seem to bridge this break between us two 
Don't you know I need you back now, baby 
Can't you see I'm Still Crazy For You
We've thrived in shadows from scene to scene 
My mind still wanders to the Tavern on the Green 
We lived for moments that we stole away 
They seem as vivid today
We had our problems, when we hadn't the time 
You clung to yours and I did to mine 
Didn't I see how they tore us apart 
Now I'm a banished refugee, there's nothing left for me

She's in the back room counting stock
And down in a warehouse out by the dock
Jesse's lifting crates and breaking rock
But when the whistle blows to end the daily fight
And the working forces turn out the light
Jesse takes that little girl and he holds her tight
As the day fades away he says
We're all that matters tonight
Tonight's the night, I know I'm right
And heart to heart, we'll make it tonight
So hold me tight, and love me right
The world can wait for tomorrow tonight
Patty comes like an angel and takes his hand
Jesse says, baby, I've got a plan
He says, I wanna get married and make a stand
But there's just one thing you gotta understand
Now the pressure of living and the daily fight
Could hurt us in time if our perspective ain't right
So shut the door and put out the light
And baby, be here, because we're all that matters tonight 
Tonight's the night, I know I'm right
And heart to heart, we'll make it tonight

Is she really goin' out with him, he's not her type
And doin' all the things she used to do to me
Well, I'd say something to her, but I get so jealous
When I think of her lovin' somebody else
And I can't think why we ever let go
I must have been crazy
Tell me what kind of fool am I to just let go
To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I, to lose you
She was cold sometimes, but she made me feel alive
She was such a spoiled baby, but baby, she could love
And she loved me like nobody ever will again
I thought we'd be together when the world went down
When the curtain fell and the lights came up
But the gods or whatever make the world go around
Shuffled when they should have cut
(Chorus)
Did it come too easy to the two of us
Did we go too wrong to ever make it right
Were we too busy checkin' out the left hand
That we didn't see the right
And tell me what kind of fool am I to just let go
To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I, oh baby please
Oh baby, please come back
I meant to say in time, baby we could work it out, but
I never meant to say goodbye
Tell me what kind of fool am I
What kind of fool am I
What kind of fool am I...to lose you

Well I was sure that I heard the director yell,
Take it from the start
And I could feel my body crushing yours
Camera dollied into place
Your husband's in the front row, I couldn't look him in the face

Part of the pleasure was that it felt so wrong
But it grew too fast, too strong

Don't you think your friends are talking alyson? 
They're blaming it all on me
I'm blaming it all on love
Well don't you think your friends are talking alyson? 
Just a little sexual tension
Under the guise of love

Young and tragic, I really felt the part
While we were sweating and screaming tearin' out his heart
Well I was sure I heard the wind and the wires
Crying in sympathy
For star-crossed lovers, ally that ain't you or me

Part of the pleasure was that it felt so wrong
But it grew too fast, too strong

Don't you think your friends are talking alyson? 
They're blaming it all on me
I'm blaming it all on love
Well don't you think your friends are talking alyson? 
Just a little sexual tension
Under the guise of love

For a limited run in to your local bedroom
We knew the curtain would be coming down soon
Reviews were mixed, the press was unkind
Ally I hope they will forgive us in time, in time

Part of the attraction was that we knew it couldn't last
So we closed our eyes and held on

Don't you thing your friends are talking alyson? 
Who were we trying to fool? 
What was I thinking of?

Rick Springfield,"He was raised in the English way
His daddy taught him respect, he taught him how to pray
They sent him off to boarding school
Where he learned how to live by someone else's rule

And he went to confession
He went to confession
Holy Father, wash my sins away
He went to confession
He went to confession
Mother Mary, take the pain away

He read letters from home at night in his bed
And got this uneasy feeling when his father said:

Fear of God and the feel of the rod
Will raise a good boy
The fear of God and the feel of the rod
Will raise a good boy

He bought his daddy's car, and he learned to drive
And when he left school, he got a nine-to-five
He met the girl, and he got his spouse
And they had the child, and they got the house

And he went to confession
He went to confession
Holy Father, wash my sins away
He went to confession
He went to confession
Mother Mary, take the pain away

He loved his son, and he helped him build walls and fronts
He knew he'd heard it before
Someone had said it once:

Fear of God and the feel of the rod
Will raise a good boy
The fear of God and the feel of the rod

And I held you back just like all the rest
I think I got what I want

Everybody's got to fight their demons
And you know I had to fight mine, too
It took a lot out of me, it took a lot out of you

To be living in oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can wake you
Living oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can shock you, too

Baby please, I'll get what you want

Can't you tell me you and me ain't lost
I know what I did, I know what it cost
Now I'm yours and I've got what you want

All the fightin' will have been for nothin'
If at the end I can't have you
I'll throw it all away if that's what you want me to do

Living in oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can wake you
Living in oz, living in oz
Sometimes the dream can shake you, too

Funny how desire can burn you up inside
And make you commit emotional suicide
Everybody's got the desire to leave their mark
Some just do it over a trail of broken hearts

And all the people that protect and serve
would disappear if the well dried up
I'm thirsty for affection
Let me drink from your loving cup

Left one or two hearts in a ruin
Spent all that precious time doin'
Things we figured that Presley might have done

Stole a few cars, never got caught

We got caught up in the image
Of playing young rebels by the handbook

Looking back I guess we had some attitude
We were gonna be hard and tough

We're gonna play tonight
It's gonna be alright
We're gonna shine

Look in the mirror watch our faces change
We were gonna be McCartney clones
We skipped school to see the Rolling Stones
And sang their songs on the train on our way home

We were gonna be like all of them
Uncompromising to the very end
Live for girls, guitars and glory
And someday they'd write our story

Sometimes I think that they clapped in sympathy

I hear he's got himself a wife and kids
And I'm still chasing whatever it is

Wishin' I was still runnin' with the same old crowd

From her question to her kiss
She said she'd had a little much to drink
She didn't usually do this
But she was looking for another head to scalp tonight
And she had me right between her sights

I turned to face her as the jukebox clicked off
Playing a favorite song
And she looked pretty in the low lit bar
But something was wrong
I saw a dull red neon sign flashing in her eyes
It said "" VACANCY,"" she had motel eyes

[Chorus:]
They were black as the night
And shone like a star
Fueled by the light
From a medicine jar
I looked again but there was nothing there
But ice in her eyes
There's no disguising motel eyes

She had the angles all down pat
Her average must be high
And though it could have been a pleasure
I just had to say goodbye
Though there was something wicked
About the way she flexed her thighs
She scared me with her motel eyes

But they found bright lights
And endless nights
And men just used her innocent ways
He found it all so pretty, hypnotized by the city
They lost sight of the reasion
They lost count of the days

And they were two souls searching for each other
One spirit looking for the other
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock

Two souls searching for heaven

He acquired a knife edge
Still the city didn't acquiesce to his demands
Some nights she cried for pity in the heart of the city
The city smacked her hands

He met her one endless night
Her eyes had a light
There was something familiar about the smell of her
Skin
He held her tighter and tighter 
As he danced inside her
She knew from the moment that she let him in

And you know they're kinda close only a blind crazy fool
Would think I was him it's like saying green is blue
But let me tell you brother it started being a bother
When he made the cover of Time magazine

I was at this party in the well-heeled hills
Just the other night
Her name was Shelly I introduced myself
She just smiled and said ""all right""
Well we got talkin' and drinkin' wine
And she said she liked my music thought it was fine
She said, ""Let's make love, your place or mine,""
And in the middle of the passion I was on the borderline
When she called out a name but it wasn't mine

She called me Bruce, Bruce
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce
I can hear her
My name is Rick I'm gonna stick it to ya babe

And there's this kid walking carrying a guitar
You know I told him that I played
He asked me my name you know I told him
I said it plain as clear as day
Well he seemed really, clearly, sincerely impressed
And as he pulled a piece of paper for me to sign from his vest
He said, ""I thought Born To Run was one of your best.""
Aww wait a minute man, who do you think I am?
He answered, ""Mr. Springsteen, your a famous man.""

He called me Bruce, Bruce
I can hear him calling Bruce, Bruce
He called me Bruce, Bruce
I can hear him
My name is Richard gonna hit it to you babe

You know my mama called me long distance yesterday
And as she got off the phone I swear I heard her say
Bye bye Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce 
She called me Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear her 
My name is Ricky gonna stick it to you babe
She called me Bruce",Bruce,1984
Rick Springfield,"He just turned seventeen
When the moment came
He was standing on the corner
In the pouring rain

She pulled up along side
And rolled the window down
And said, ?Can I drive you
To some part of town??

he's sitting beside here
With a great big smile
The lady had class
And she stood out a mile

His heart was a beating
Like a big bass drum
Thinking at last
His time had finally come

He started Tallinn? fast
Trying to loosen up
But he felt kind a stupid
So he shut up

She said, ?don't think I'm fast
?Cause I'm really not?
But his fever went all wild
It was getting hot

She pulled into the driveway
Of a big brown stone
He was champing at the bit
And then her heart be told

She said, ?My husband?s working
He?ll be gong all day?
But he couldn't believe it
When he heard himself say

I'm getting cold feet
I'm getting cold feet

Lady, doncha hear me talking to you
Hey there's something that you can do
I'm so nervous I just might shoot you
I've got them cold, cold feet

Well, a couple years on
And our hero?s grown
He's a professional musician
With a band of his own

hadn't had much luck
With the girls that he meets
Might get another case of cold feet

He met a girl not too long ago
She thought she could change him but it wasn't so
As soon as she mentioned long term romance
He went into that same old song and dance

I'm getting cold feet
See-see-cold feet

I'm getting cold feet , see-see-cold feet
Darlin? doncha hear me talkin? to you
No there ain't something you can do
I'm so nervous I just might shoot you

I've got cold, cold, cold, cold
Upset about it
Cold, cold, cold, cold

Go without, um
Cold, cold, cold, cold
Said I've got them cold, cold feet

He increased his quota
Of one night stands
It was a kind of complex
You understand

He would treat ?em real mean
He was low down and dirty
Now he's got to make some changes
'Cause he's nearly thirty

'Cause he had a dream, just the other night
He was standing in God?s ever-present light
And God said I?d like to let your life run it?s coarse
But you'd understand me having second thoughts

I'm getting cold feet
See-see-cold feet
I'm getting cold feet
See-see-cold feet

Listen doncha here me talking to you
I think you know what you have to do
You gotta make some changes
You got them

When my radar picked her up on the arm of another
I've been lookin' for the one and I'll tell you brother
I had the feeling we were gonna be more than friends

We were each other still looking for the one
With the fire in her eyes living inside a paradise
Still looking for the one on like the light
Darlin' don't let me sleep alone tonight still looking for the one
And wake in the morning all alone and looking for the one

I'm a lonely, lonely soul in search of another

Rick Springfield,"You know it gets too much
And sometimes she cries like a baby
But she's almost certain it'll pass
When she becomes a lady

But while she's still a young girl
Love is avoidin' her
And thank God for the radio
And the color TV, oh, oh, oh, oh

Heroes are hard to find in the cold world
But not in her mind
And she's talkin' to Jesus
During the radio station breaks

And she's on her knees, fallin' on her knees
Askin' how the world can be so cold to her
And she listens to the records, playin' on the radio
And she's fallin' in love with a singer

Now she's feelin' better and she's feelin' good
But she's coming down by the time the song is over
And she starts feelin' lonely
Feelin' she's the only ordinary solitary one
All alone the solitary one

Oh, hurryin' home, oh God, it's been one of those bad days
But with a flick of a switch and a twist of the dial
She gets love on the airwaves
And they send her favorite lovers to keep her satisfied
And she's talkin' to Jesus during the radio station breaks

And she's on her knees, fallin' on her knees
Askin' how the world can be so cold to her
And she listens to the records playin' on the radio
And she's fallin' in love with a singer, ooh

Now she's feelin' better 'cause she's feelin' good
But she's comin' down by the time the song is over
And she starts feelin' lonely
Feelin' she's the only ordinary solitary one
All alone solitary one

And she's on her knees, fallin' on her knees

You better tell me now baby

Hungry to touch, I'm eager to please
Out of control and I hand you the keys
Every night I am burning to make love to you

But don't try to tell me you think it's all physical
It goes much deeper than that

You ought to know it's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart

When we make love, it's a passionate thing
You shudder and shake, sink you teeth in my skin
I almost believe you were made to be played by my
hands

And you got the power, it amazes me still
How you play my emotions with consummate skill
I don't have to look any further than into your eyes

So don't try to tell me you think it's just physical
It goes way deeper than that

You better know it's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart

Go down to the river of the spirit that runs through you

So I, I could go through

And no signs somehow it still lead me to you

And it's ringin' loud and clear
Now, I'm ready to reveal all the things
That before I could never say

Inside everything I believe
And it's all gonna come around someday

As the smallest stream runs to a river
And every river runs to the sea
So every little bit of love I give to another
You know that I believe it comes back to me

There is no absolution whether I'm the garden or the rose
If I ain't part of the solution, yeah you know how that goes
You can always leave but you bring it all back home someday

As the smallest stream runs to a river
And every river runs to the sea
So every little bit of love I give to another
You know that I believe it comes back to me

Every single thing I say, everyone that I betray
Any love that I take when I do not make it in return
Every thing I do and every time I've been unfaithful too
All the things that I believe are lessons I must learn

As the smallest stream runs to a river
And every river runs to the sea
So every little bit of love I give to another
You know that I believe it comes back to me


As the smallest stream runs to a river
And every river runs to the sea
So every little bit of love I give to another

There's no need to right the wronged
Laid down my burden 
I know I did not carry the weight
Not sure to who responsibility belonged 
I turned a blind eye
While waiting for the hand of fate to still the waters
Heal all the broken hearts
And hope it could be done without a sacrifice
And maybe I just wouldn't pay the price 
I've fought this long enough
Now I send the prayer to heaven for the chance to be
A better man than the man I see 
I send the prayer to heaven; lay your hands on me 
I ain't a saint, but to this I swear: I send the prayer
And now I feel all I can do is not enough
My Rome is burning, and I'm standing at the deep abyss
But every passion started with an act of love 
And every act of love started with a single kiss
Father, father, your gift was my world of light 
And I've betrayed you with a single Judas kiss 
I've been my own executioner 
But it's not just me anymore
Now I send the prayer to heaven for the chance to be
A better man than the man I see 
I send the prayer to heaven; lay your hands on me 
I ain't a saint, but to this I swear
Burn my wasted pride
Open your heart to this
There's a voice that's crying somewhere 
Deep inside my soul for shelter
Now I send the prayer to heaven for the chance to be
A better man than the man I see 
I send the prayer to heaven; lay your hands on me 
I ain't a saint, but to this I swear

One spirit looking for the other 
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock
Two souls searching for heaven 
Rolling the dice looking for a seven 
To the tick, tick, ticking of time 
Gotta beat the clock
Too many nights on the ledge 
He acquired a knife-edge 
Still the city didn't acquiesce to his demands 
Some nights she cried for pity in the heart of the city 
The city smacked her hands
He met her on endless night 
Her eyes had a light 
There was something familiar about the smell of her skin 
He held her tighter and tighter 
As he danced inside her 
She know from the moment that she let him in
They'd been two souls searching for each other 
One spirit looking for the other 
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock
Two souls searching for heaven 
Rolling the dice looking for a seven 
To the tick, tick, ticking of time 
Gotta beat the clock 
Beat the clock 
Beat the clock 
Beat the clock
Two souls searching for each other 
One spirit looking for the other 
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock
Two souls searching for heaven 
Rolling the dice looking for a seven 
To the tick, tick, ticking of time 
Gotta beat the clock

To touch their harps of gold

Sing, I do hear them singing

Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say",Sweet and Lovely,1996
Rick Stepton,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,1996
Rick Stepton,"Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
Want you to know it really is pleasin'
Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away

Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me

Rick Stepton,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1998
