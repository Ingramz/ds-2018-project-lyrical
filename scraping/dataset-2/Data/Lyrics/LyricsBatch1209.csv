Tom Waits,"Well you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

And you got paid on Friday
And your pockets are jinglin'
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a 6
And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Then you comb your hair
Shave your face
Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace
All the other days 
In the week you know that this'll be the Saturday
You're reachin' your peak

Stoppin' on the red
You're goin' on the green
'Cause tonight'll be like nothin'
You've ever seen
And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night

Tell me is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin?
Telephone's ringin'; it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye?
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.

Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
'Cause you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumblin'
You're stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night

Well you gassed her up
And you're behind the wheel 
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrellin' down the boulevard,
You're lookin' for the heart of Saturday night

Is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin?
Telephone's ringin'; it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smilin' from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.

Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumblin'
Stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
And you're stumblin'
Stumblin onto the heart of Saturday night

Tom Waits,"One fine morning I woke up early
Bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao
One fine morning I woke up early
Find the fascist at my door
Oh, partigiano, please take me with you
Bella ciao, bella ciao, goodbye beautiful
Oh, partigiano, please take me with you
I'm not afraid anymore

And if I die, oh, partigiano
Bella ciao, bella ciao, goodbye beautiful
Bury me upon that mountain
Beneath the shadow of the flower
Show all the people, the people passing
Bella ciao, bella ciao, goodbye beautiful
Show all the people, the people passing
And say, ""oh, what a beautiful flower""

Tom Walker,"Well, I'll be going out tonight
We could go to yours
You could come to mine
I got no money for the pub, no
Could probably scrape enough for the bus though, yeah

And what a time to be alive
Four bottles down my neck and I'm feeling fine
So let's hear it for the good times
Let's hear it for the good times

And counting our blessings
But it don't take us too long
'Cause our lives ain't like a movie
Or a Katy Perry song
And counting our blessings
'Cause we got friends to lean on
Got no money in our pockets
We're too busy getting drunk
We're counting our, just counting our blessings
Just counting our, just counting our blessings

Well, I really hate to kill the vibe
But who's going to the shop
We could use supplies
I'm busy playing FIFA
You won't know I'm gonna beat ya'

And what a time to be alive
Fat Freddy's on the Drop on Spotify
So let's hear it for the good times

We're counting our

And when the night is over
Lay your head upon my shoulders
Glad I'm coming down with you
'Cause nothing really matters
As long as you're right here

Been counting our blessings
'Cause our lives ain't like a movie
Or a Katy Perry song
And counting our blessings

Tom Walker,"Let's get drunk
I'll pour my heart out through my mouth
This year's been hard for us no doubt

Let's raise a glass to a better one
And all the things that we've overcome
Are bring home to us 'cause
Me and you we can hold this out
Only you understand how I'm feeling now yeah

And I know, I can tell you anything
You won't judge, you're just listening
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me

'Cause my darling, you and I could take over the world

Let's get drunk
We'll reminisce about the days
When we were broke, not getting paid and taking trips on the weekend
When I would drop down to see you
And we would paint the town
Too many chugs, I'll be passing out
'Cause I can never keep up quad vods now I'm puking up

And I know, I can tell you anything
You won't judge you're just listening, yeah

Staring at this screen

Must be city love

Tom Walker,"The second someone mentioned you were all alone
I could feel the trouble coursing through your veins
Now I know, it's got a hold
Just a phone called left unanswered, had me sparking up
These cigarettes won't stop me wondering where you are
Don't let go, keep a hold

If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guiding like a lighthouse to a place where you'll be

If you've lost your way (I will leave the light on)

Hiding from the truth ain't gonna make this all okay

Tom Walker,"Showed up at the right time
In a broke down limousine
All you had was red lights
I went and turned them all to green
I found you in the landslide
And pulled you out again

The hardest conversations
Are the ones you never had
Well you don't have to say it
'Cause you know I understand

Tom Walsh,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Tom Waring,"I remember the bliss
Of that wonderful kiss.
I knew that a boy
Could never have more joy
From any little miss.

I remember it quite,
'Twas a wonderful night.

Oh, how I'd adore it
If you would encore it.

Should do, Baby;

So don't, don't, don't
Say it won't, won't, won't

Come true, baby,
My heart begins to hum,

So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before.

Sweets we've tasted before
Cannot stand an encore.
You know that a miss
Who always gives a kiss
Would soon become a bore.

I can't see that at all,
True love never should pall.

I was only teasing;
What you did was pleasing.
Oh,

Do, do, do
What you've done, done, done

Tom Waring,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

And if you're quick enough to rise

And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you

Across my dreams with nets of wonder

Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name

Tom Wopat,"When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go?
Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk""
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted to go and see my Bessie again

commemorative holiday to celebrate the sacrosanct glory of the national stupidity, it's because everyday, thank God, from Diapoque to Chuí, from the Pampas to the rubber tree jungles, it is already celebrated, most gloriously celebrated

Tom Zé,"I saw a blind man reading the string of a viola
blind against blind in a duel in the hinterland
I saw the blind man tie a cobra in a knot
I saw the blind man imprisoned in the cage of sight
Black bird flying very far away
And the dragonfly discerning the darkness

I saw the moon on the tail of the comet
I saw the bass drum and the windchest pounding
I saw the lightning while the sky was flashing
And the triangle swallowing sparks
I saw the white milky way against the black
I saw day and night come together

I saw the father, I saw the mother, I saw the daughter
I saw the calf give birth to the calf
I saw the replica of the replica of the bible
In the invention of a science singer
I saw God's lamb in an empty egg
I grew cold and I asked you to give me warmth

I saw a blind man reading the string of a viola
blind against blind in a duel in the hinterland
I saw the blind man tie a cobra in a knot
I saw the blind man imprisoned in the cage of sight
the white wing, the white wing, the white song
And the dragonfly discerning the darkness

daughter of tactic

shove it up your verb
you son of a letter

Shove your usury

Fear, betrayal, desire — fright

The dolls, the hide and seek
We dreamed of better things
In the tall weeds

I rolled with you
Flashback
Silhouette of the memory
You're eyes are getting heavy

And when I speak
You sleep on cue

Did they make you wear a dress did they
Held you down and tickled you did they

Did they laugh and make you watch did they
They wish they had a little girlie

Wait for the world to say it's sorry

Remember our prayers and our virtuous deeds
Make him the prophet, the martyr – pass him the disease
Shut are the eyes of the one bringing us to our knees

It serves an example rather blind than having the sight
Let us burn this scapegoat and gather our might
Let this messiah now die, thus ending our plight

We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

And laughed before, and loved before

So you tellin' me that I ain't down?
But first of all, when I was broke as fuck
You niggas did not give a fuck
Now all of the sudden
Ya lovin' me when we drunk, playa hata
We know who you are, can find out where you live
Better protect your kids
Fuck it, let's blow up his crib
10-o'clock news: ""Nobody lived.""

You better roll
Cause we give no love where we got to buck
Break you off somethin' proper with hate
I 'll break you off somethin' proper with love

For the body dippin'
Grips in the wasteland all from mad-testin'
Even though they know about death - a cold place to rest in

Tomi,"I?ve been waiting for you, for you, to come
And I know that you are far way where you?re coming from
Said you?re taking the bus
Or your taking the train
And if you happen to miss them both
You promise to get on the plane
I?m so happy that you found your way home
Always wanted you near
But you left me alone
I?ve been waiting for the time we never, never spent
Don?t think you comprehend what to me
You really mean

I am waiting for you
But I know you?ll never come through 
I am waiting for something
But I know I?m waiting for nothing

Every minute I?m waiting feels like an hour
And every hour seems to me like eternity
I?m looking for my sunshine like the sunflower
But I can?t seem to find my security
Keep looking out the window
But I don?t see you coming
Keep lying to myself that something must have happened
But you still running to me 
I can hear you knock on the door see your shadow on the wall
I need some closure to go on
But I think I?m losing you overall

Hook Repeat

I?m leaving the gate 
Cause I lost all my faith
I won?t torture myself and sit here and wait
I don?t know what you want me to say
Could have met me half way
You should have told me you?re not coming
You shouldn?t have had me misled

I started out a long, long, long time ago
But my journey held most things I did not know
But I was sure and believed the plan You gave
Was so secure inside of me

In latter days I found failure down
And complacency came to pull me down
They wrestled deep inside of me, now the passion's gone
Staring me right in the face, asking me if I am sure

Now when I need strength to endure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through
I anoint myself

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep the love, that I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day
Kneel and pray
This is how I remind myself

Now my savior's gone, it seems like I have it down
I've stood through it all, it feels still to rise and come around
Trying to guarantee this day I'm going forward
And the battle starts all over again

Now when I need to know for sure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through
I anoint myself

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep in my heart what I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day
Kneel and pray
This is how I remind myself

Sometimes in this world, challenges come
And emotions get carried away
But in faith be strong and to His word hold on
And when if doubt comes, guard up yourself
Stand there and say I remember

Sometimes gotta remind myself
What I've been called to do
Is first to be with you

Sometimes I gotta remember, oh yeah
That you called me, Lord
Yes, you did and I'm at your disposal

Sometimes gotta remind myself
What I've been called to do
Is first to be with you

Sometimes, gotta remind myself
That you called me, called me
And I'm at your disposal

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep in my heart what I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day

Sometimes gotta remind myself

And the Gospel in our mouth we set the captives free

Tommy Aldridge,"And here, my prize, the Black Widow. 
Isn't she lovely? And so deadly. 
Her kiss is fifteen times more poisonous than the rattlesnake. 
And you see her venom is highly neurotoxic 
Which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system 
Causing intense pain
Profuse sweating
Difficulty in breathing
Loss of consciousness
Violent convulsions 
And finally death. 
You know what I think I love the most about her 
Is her inborn need to dominate and possess. 
Such power and dignity, unhampered by sentiment. 
If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy
I feel that man has ruled this world as a stumbling dimented child-king long enough!
And as his empire crumbles, my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor!

With a laugh so obscene

Tommy Alverson,"Well, I had a buddy back in '81,
And we made ourselves a pact.
We were headin' for the new pipeline,
We were never comin' back.
Well we worked 80 hours making time and a half,
But La Grange was too damn hot.
We drove back home at the end of that week
And we spent it all on pot.

So I'll see you in Houston,
If I ever get out that way,
I'll see you in Dallas,
But I won't have long to stay,
If you're ever out west son,
And you're feeling like slowing down,
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.

Well, I played ball every single fall,
I could run just like the wind.
Went to college like they asked me too
But they didn't ask my friends.
Don't think I seen a single classroom,
But I drank a lot of beer.
My buddies still love to listen to me when I talk about that year.

[Chorus]

Now I got myself a little band,
And we're pretty good I guess
But I never learned how to wear my hair,
And I never learned how to dress.
So I'm leaving for the last time honey,
I'm never more to roam.
Gonna pack my bags a little heavy this time gonna head my ass back home.

So I'll see you in Nashville,
If I ever get out that way.
I'll see you in Austin,
But I won't have long to stay,
If you're ever out west son,
And you're feeling like slowin down.
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.
I'll see you around,

Tommy Boyce,"We were speaking of belief
Beliefs and conditioning
All belief possibly could be said to be the result of some conditioning
Thus the study of history is simply the study of one system of beliefs
Deposing another and so on and so on and so on
A psychologically tested belief of our time is that the central nervous
System, which feeds it's impulses directly to the brain, is unable to
Discern between the real and the vividly imagined experience,
If there is a difference, and most of us believe there is
Am I being clear?
To examine these concepts requires tremendous energy and discipline
To experience the now without preconception or belief
To allow the unknown to occur and to occur requires clarity

But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ahh.

Now, I'm standing here,
Strange, strange voices in my ears,
I feel the tears,
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.
Words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.
Words that never were true,

Tommy Bromley,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1996
Tommy Bromley,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in

Tommy Bromley,"It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
 
There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon
 
It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning

Tommy Bromley,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1998
Tommy Bromley,"I was just a lonely Melisande, Pity pity me.
Came a little wizard, waved his wand,
Dreamed you up for me.

Now I feel a tingle each time I glimpse your face go dreaming by;
Proving the heart is quicker than the eye.

When I Look At You, I hear lovely music
Can it be my heart that sings?
When I Look At You I look at an angel
Tell me where you've parked your wings.
Dizzy me, Silly moon, crazy quilt of a sky
Are you real, or a dream 
That got caught in my eye?

When I Look At You I'm looking at rainbows
Stars come tumbling down from above
And I'm in love with you, my love !",When I Look at You,1998
Tommy Bromley,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2012

Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""

Tommy Cash,"The devil went down to Scunthorpe
Looking for a soul to steal
In a bind and way behind
He was willin' to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Pickin' on a guitar, playing it hot
And the devil jumped on a hickory stump
And said I'll tell ya what

I guess you didn't know it
I'm a guitar player too
And if you care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a real good guitar boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a guitar of gold to get your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you

The boy said my name's Johnny, it might be a sin
I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret
I'm the best that's ever been

Johnny resin up your pick
And play your guitar hard
'Cause hell is here in Scunthorpe
And the devil deals the cards
Now if you win you'll get
This shinny guitar made of gold
But if you loose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And said I'll start this gig
And fire flew from his finger tips
As he resined up his pick
He strummed the pick across the strings
It made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
Let me show you how it's done

Fire on the mountain run boys run
Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Ready says you don't fight, no child, no
Let's go

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
He laid that golden guitar
On the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said Devil come on back 
If you ever want to try again
I told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best I've ever been

I would always say

I wondered if I'd ever have 
Someone for my own

I guess my kiss was pretty lush 
She smiled real big and began to blush
It tickles, it tickles 
I like it but it sure feels funny, 
It's a ticklin' me

Oh I got me a name in the neighbourhood 
The girls all liked it, I knew they would
I let it grow for a month or two 
Just to see what I could do
There was a girl named Fanny Smith 
Told me she didn't like to kiss
I caught her off guard and I didn't miss
I didn't know it'd feel like this

Well her eyes bugged out
Her face turned white
She hugged me up with all her might
I swear it took her breath away 
She giggled and I heard her say
It tickles, it tickles
You sure are a lot of fun, 
It's a ticklin' me

Well I guess I pert'near run 'em wild 
They all went crazy over my style
They said I was the best around 
The kissinest man they'd ever found
The good ol' days are here again 
I used to do it and I still can
Said a widder that I know 
I guess you'll never get too old

Well I guess I got that ol' know-how 
You ought to see me in action now
My kiss has still got that ol' sting
The widder says I ain't lost a thing
It tickles, it tickles 
I feel just like I'm young again, 
It's a ticklin' me",It Tickles,1992
Tommy Collins,"
I'm just a plain ol' country kid and I like to do what's right
But just like any other boy I like to hold 'em tight
Sometimes I got resistence, but no matter how I try
When a cute little gal just looks at me with a gleam in her eye
And I say ""You better not do that"", and she say ""Why?""
And I say ""Because you just better not do that""

When I was in the country school I always had a girl
They'd laugh and giggle awful cute and put me in a whirl
And everyday at recess time they followed me outside
I'd scratch my head and wonder are they ever satified
I'd say ""Honey, you better not do that"" and she'd say ""Why?""
And I'd say ""Because you just better not do that""

(Instrumental Break)

When I was a little older, I went to the country dance
I went to have a little fun, I wasn't thinkin' about romance
But the dim lights just lured 'em on and they'd snuggle up to me
I knew I couldn't last too long, 'cos I'm human you see
And I'd say ""Baby, you better not do that"", and she'd say ""Why?""
And I'd say ""Because you just better not do that""

Now that's the way my life has been, ain't it a cryin' shame
How much longer can I last if I keep playin' a game
Sometimes I don't know who I am, don't they know what they're doin'
I'm afraid in years to come that girls will be my ruin
And I'll say ""Now honey, you better not do that"", and she'll
say ""Why?""
And I'll say ""You just better not do that"", and she'll say ""Why-y-y?""
And I'll say ""Oh...well...oh...aah...oh...well it's alright if you do that""",You Better Not Do That,1992

Tommy Conwell & the Young Rumblers,"Well there's one thing I'd like to rearrange
But after everything's already happened & there's nothin' left 2 change
They can take their advice and use it all on themselves
Cause when all the talking stops I want to have something else
I want to have a little faith, I want to know what a guy and a girl
Can do when they're dizzy
Cause they're just not spinning with this world

Aw if we never meet again, if goodbyes remain unspoken
I won't glorify our past but our bond remains unbroken
If we never meet again

Well there's one thing that I'll never forget
It's the beauty of a friendship that's not over yet
I know how just one smile can be planted like a seed
And I want to do that for somebody else the way it was done for me
I want to have a little faith
There's something better at the end of this path
But these memories get old and fade like photographs

Aw if we never meet again, if goodbyes remain unspoken
I won't glorify our past but our bond remains unbroken
If we never meet again

Well there's one thing I'd like to even up
You can be what they've made you into or U can make your own luck
U can't blindly fight your enemies, U can't blindly follow your friends
I've seen it happen so many times, I know it's gonna happen again
But I gotta have faith, I gotta know that a guy and a girl
Can still make it even when they're just not spinning with this world

Tommy Dodson,"If you believe within your heart you'll know
That no one can change the path that you must go
Believe what you feel and know you're right, because
The time will come around when you say it's yours

Believe there's a reason to be
Believe you can make time stand still
You know from the moment you try
If you believe, I know you will

Believe in yourself, right from the start
You'll have brains, you'll have a heart
You'll have courage to last your whole life through

If you believe in yourself, if you believe in yourself
If you believe in yourself as I believe in you

She is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine,
When she dances by
Senoritas stare and caballeros sigh

Toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Tangerine,
She is all they say
With mascara'd eye and chapeaux by Dache.
Tangerine,
With her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame.
And I've seen

But she's only fooling one girl

Your eyes that promise sweet nights,
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.
In dreams I seem to hold you, to find you and enfold you,
Our lips meet and our hearts, too, with a thrill so sublime

Those cool and limpid green eyes -
A pool wherein my love lies.

So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, make my dreams come true.

Haunts my reverie

I wandered down into old mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenes meant ""please love me
And I could say frenes
A lovely seorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenes
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone

My life was torn like wind-blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace

You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love you",Tin Roof Blues,2013
Tommy Dorsey,"Deep night, stars in the sky above
Moonlight, lighting our place of love
Night winds seem to have gone to rest
Two eyes, brightly with love are gleaming
Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
Vow that you'll love me always, be mine alone

Deep night, whispering trees above
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
Deep night, deep in the arms of love

Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
Vow that you'll love me always, and be mine alone

Deep night, whispering trees above
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
Deep night, deep in the arms of love",Deep Night,2013
Tommy Dorsey,"A fellow needs a girl to sit by his side, at the end of a weary day.
To sit by his side and listen to him talk and agree with the things he'll say.
A fellow needs a girl to hold in hid arms when the rest of the world goes wrong,
To hold in his arms and know that she believes that her fellow is wise and strong.

When things go right, and his job's well done,
He wants to share the prize he's won.
If no one shares and no one cares,
Where is the fun of a job well done? Or a prize you've won?

A fellow needs a home, his own kind of home, but to make this dream come true,
A fellow needs a girl, his own kind of girl, my kind of girl is you.",A  Fellow Needs a Girl,2015
