Keep your hands off her
Keep them big mitts down
Keep your hands off her
So keep them big mitts down
So keep your hands off her, hear what I say
She don't belong to you

She's a heavy hipped mama
Got them great big legs
She's a heavy hipped mama

Got just what it takes, oh yeah

Rod Stewart,"It's been a long road,
To get from there to here.
It's been a long time,
But my time is finally here.

And I can feel a change in the wind right now.
Nothing's in my way.
And they're not gonna hold me down no more.
No they're not gonna hold me down.

Cause I've got faith of the heart.
I'm going where my heart will take me.
I've got faith to believe.
I can do anything.
I've got strength of the soul.
And no one's going to bend or break me.
I can reach any star.
I've got faith,
I've got faith,
Faith of the heart.

It's been a long night,
Trying to find my way.
Been through the darkness,
Now I finally have my day.

And I will see my dream come alive at last.
I will touch the sky.
And they're not gonna hold me down no more.
No they're not gonna change my mind.

Cause I've got faith of the heart.
I'm going where my heart will take me.
I've got faith to believe.
I can do anything.
I've got strength of the soul.
And no one's going to bend or break me.
I can reach any star.
I've got faith,
Faith of the heart.

I know the wind's so cold,
I've seen the darkest days.
But now the winds I feel,
Are only winds of change.
I've been through the fire,
And I've been through the rain,
But I'll be fine.

Cause I've got faith of the heart.
I'm going where my heart will take me.
I've got faith to believe.
I can do anything.
I've got strength of the soul.
And no one's going to bend or break me.
I can reach any star.
Cause I've got faith,
Cause I've got faith,
Faith of the heart

I'm going where my heart will take me.

And no one's going to bend or break me.

Rod Stewart,"Did you ever stand and shiver
While looking at a freezing river
Have you froze to the bone
With just a coat to keep you warm

To keep you from a howlin' wind
To keep you from a howlin' wind, now listen

Have you perished in the drizzling rain
Tried to light a lift but all in vain
With your sock on your head
And that old coat on your back

To keep you from the drizzlin' rain
Oh, to keep you from the drizzlin' rain, goodbye

One more time

Did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowed
Laid your head on an isle like me
With the Times on your face
And that old coat on your back

That kept you from withering away, good God
It just kept you from withering away

I know

And did you ride a lift on a steam train, now listen
Had the misfortune not to pay your fare
Thrown off the next stop
Thrown in the doorway of a shop

With that coat to keep you from the wind
Oh, that old school coat to keep you
From the wind, and that ain't all

Have you had some good friends on the road with ya
Who'd stand by you through thick and thin
Here's to Kevin and Ben, Susie and Len
And that coat which never lets you down

It never, never, never lets you down
It never, never, never lets you down

That old coat which never lets you down
That old coat which never lets you down

Kept me from the drizzlin' rain
And oh, kept me from the drizzlin' rain",An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down,1998
Rod Stewart,"Nineteen years old and as sweet as she could be
All dressed up like a downtown Christmas tree
Dancin' and hummin' a rock 'n' roll melody
She's the daughter of a well respected man
Who taught her how to jerk and understand
Then she became a rock 'n' roll music fan

Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller
Her daddy doesn't have to scold her 
Her partner can't hardly hold her
Because she never gets any older
Sweet little rock 'n' roller

Should of seen her eyes when the band began to play
And the famous singer sang and bowed away
When the stars were gone she screamed and yelled hurray
Ten thousand eyes were watchin' them leave the floor
Five thousand tongues are screaming out ""More"" and ""More""
About fifteen hundred waiting outside the door

Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller
Her daddy doesn't have to scold her 
Her partner can't hardly hold her
Because she never gets any older

Rod Stewart,"How you doin', Annaheim? I don't know what else to call ya'
If I knew all your names, I'd call ya' your bloody names
Here's one that we did when we was here
Were many of you here last night?

Alright, well I changed me shirt anyway
No, I haven't changed me trousers

Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My love has found another, gone away
Withered up my future, my life is filled with gloom
Day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain

Curse so badly, I don't want to go outside
Everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I've got to cry, 'cause crying sheds the pain
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain
I wish it would rain

Let it rain

Looking down at my tear stained face pressed against the window pane
But I search the sky desperately for rain
'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops, no one will ever know
When I'm crying, crying when I go outside
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain
I wish it would rain

Let it rain

Rod Stewart,"Is it my imagination
Or have I finally found something worth living for
I was looking for some action
But all I found were cigarettes and alcohol

You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
Cause when it comes on top

You gotta make it happen!
Is it worth the aggravation
To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for
It's a crazy situation
But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol

Going to shut the bellboy out tonight

When the world is dead I'm going to make the bed

Rod Stewart,"Every face that crammed this hall
And in this room our hats were hung
And words were written and songs were sung
And we held our glasses high
And we dared to reach for the sky
And we never would grow old
When we were the new boys

And on these streets we were like kings
We'd roll and tumble, fight and sing
And in these smoky pubs the yarns were spun
And many a sweetheart was lost and won
And on these green fields we played for pride
No quarter given, no compromise
We were lovers and we were sons
When we were the new boys

Behind this cellar door on cheap guitars
We played our blues til the early hours
No one listening but a few old friends
We never dreamed it could ever end
This was our moment, this was our space
This was a jewel of a time to have graced
But they're all sweet memories now
When we were the new boys

All my life I've been running
down the side of this hill
But way down deep in my heart
don't want the water to ever be still

Blown and scattered like autumn leaves
Some are lawyers and some are thieves
Some are now behind the sun

Rod Stewart,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony
(cloud nine)  you're a million miles from reality.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
Cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free

While the sun is bright or in the darkest night

Goodbye, ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost at such a cost

And the keys from the jailor

And the old men in wheelchairs know
That Mathilda's the defendant
She killed about a hundred
And she follows wherever you may go

You'll go waltzing Matilda with me

in a hotel someplace

I messed around with all the rules
Apologized, then realized
I'm not different after all

Me and the boys thought we had is sussed
Valentino's all of us
My dad said we looked ridiculous
But, boy, we broke some hearts
 
In and out of jobs, running free
Waging war with society
Dumb, blank faces stared back at me
But nothing ever changed

Promises made in the heat of night
Creepin' home before it got too light
I wasted all that precious time
And blamed it on the wine
 
I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win
 
Never found a compromise
Collected lovers like butterflies
Illusions of that grand first prize
Are slowly wearin' thin
Susie, baby, you were good to me
Giving love unselfishly
But you took it all too seriously
I guess it had to end

I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win
 
Now you ask me if I'm sincere
That's the question that I always fear
Verse seven is never clear
But I'll tell you what you want to hear
I try to give you all you want
But giving love is not my strongest point
If that's the case, it's pointless going on
I'd rather be alone

Village children always fighting for fair share
And the six o nine goes roarin' down the creek

Well she's really lookin' fine for eighty four
And she asked me if some time I'd fix the barn
Poor old girl, she needs a man down on the farm

And it's good old country comforts in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old fashioned feeling in my bones
Country comforts and the road that's going home

Down at the mill they've got a new machine
Foreman says it cuts manpower by fifteen
Oh, but that ain't natural old man Grayson says
'Cause he's a horse drawn man until his dying days

So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
well Maybe just one little kiss more (Put some music on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink (No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say no, no, no, sir (Mind if I move a little closer)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense in hurting my pride)
I really can't stay (Baby don't hold out)
Ah, but it's cold outside)

C'mon baby

I simply must go (Baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (Ooh baby, it's cold outside)
This welcome has been (I'm lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at that storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Man, your lips look so delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
Well maybe just one little kiss more (Never such a blizzard before)

I've got to go home (You'll freeze to the bone out there)
Say, lend me your comb (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (Your eyes are like starlight now)
But don't you see (How can you do this thing to me)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Making my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay (Get over that old out)
Ahh, but it's cold outside

Baby it's cold outside

Brr its cold
It's cold out there
Can't you stay awhile longer baby
Well I really shouldn't alright

Songbirds sing; winter turns to spring.
Every winding street in Mayfair falls beneath the spell.
I know such enchantment can be, ''cause it happened one evening to me:
That certain night, the night we met,
There was magic abroad in the air,
There were angels dining at the Ritz,
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.
I may be right, I may be wrong,
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.
The moon that lingered over London town,
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown.
How could he know we two were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars;
It was such a romantic affair.
And, as we kissed and said 'goodnight',
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
When dawn came stealing up all gold and blue
To interrupt our rendezvous,
I still remember how you smiled and said,
""Was that a dream or was it true?""
Our homeward step was just as light
As the tap-dancing feet of Astaire
And, like an echo far away,
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
I know ''cause I was there,
That night in Berkeley Square.",A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square,2004
Rod Stewart,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts

The morning sun, when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes, you're everything

I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me

Loud empty places
Look at the way that we live,

On cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give.

And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight

In your world I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friend's missing

And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friend's missing

I ain't missing you and there's a storm
That's raging through my frozen heart tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friend's missing

I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I can't lie to myself
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I'm lying to myself

Oh yes, 'cause I ain't missing you
Missing you, missing you, missing you, oh yeah
I ain't missing you at all",Missing You,2006
Rod Stewart,"You always won, everytime you placed a bet
You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet
Everytime they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk
You always said, the cards would never do you wrong
The trick you said was never piay the game too long
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

And you're still the same
I caught up with you yesterday
Moving game to game
No one standing in your way
Turning on the charm
Long enough to get you by
You're still the same
You still aim high

There you stood, everybody watched you play
I just turned and walked away
I had nothing left to say

'Cause you're still the same
You're still the same
Moving game to game
Some thlngs never change
You're still the same

Rod Stewart,"Everytime we say goodbye 
I die a little 
Everytime we say goodbye 
I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me 
Who must be in the know 
Think so little of me
They allow you to go 

When you're near 
There's such an air 
Of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it 
There's no love song finer 
But how strange the change
From major to minor 
Everytime we say goodbye

Rod Stewart,"Sugar, sugar
She sits alone waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking

If you want my body and you think i'm sexy
Come on sugar let me know.
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so
Tell me so baby

He's acting shy looking for an answer
Come on honey let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so i can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think i'm sexy
Come on honey tell me so
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know

'Cause at last he's got this girl home
Relax baby now we are alone

They wake at dawn 'Cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other neither one's complaining
He say's i sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee

About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea

And I said, ""Fly on my sweet angel, fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side""

It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home 
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts
 
The morning sun, when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes, you're everything

I laughed at all of your jokes

Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried
 
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band 
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be

One less gal to look after, I should be happy

I know that since she left 
My life's so empty
Though I try to forget to 
It just cant be done
Each time the doorbell rings
I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of her
Cause I still lover her so
Each day though, I start out
Crying my heart out

One less gal to look after, no more laughter
No more love
Since she went oh she went away

Why did she leave

Why did she go away

There are sun beams and moon beams enough to shine

Woman it's fading away from me

It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same

While looking at a freezing river
Have you froze to the bone
With just a coat to keep you warm

To keep you from a howlin' wind
To keep you from a howlin' wind, now listen

Have you perished in the drizzling rain
Tried to light a lift but all in vain
With your sock on your head
And that old coat on your back

To keep you from the drizzlin' rain
Oh, to keep you from the drizzlin' rain, goodbye

One more time

Did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowed
Laid your head on an isle like me
With the Times on your face
And that old coat on your back

That kept you from withering away, good God
It just kept you from withering away

I know

And did you ride a lift on a steam train, now listen
Had the misfortune not to pay your fare
Thrown off the next stop
Thrown in the doorway of a shop

With that coat to keep you from the wind
Oh, that old school coat to keep you 
From the wind, and that ain't all

Have you had some good friends on the road with ya
Who'd stand by you through thick and thin
Here's to Kevin and Ben, Susie and Len
And that coat which never lets you down

It never, never, never lets you down

Trying to make the other side?
Ever seen a young girl growing old
Trying to make herself a bride?

So what becomes of you my love?
When they have finally stripped you of
The handbags and the gladrags
That your granddad had to sweat so you could buy, baby

Once I was a young man
And all I thought I had to do was smile
You are still a young girl
And you bought everything in style, listen

But once you think you're in, you're out
'Cause you don't mean a single thing without
The handbags and the gladrags
That your granddad had to sweat so you could buy

Sing a song of six-pence for your sake
And take a bottle full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake
And bake them all in a pie

They told me you missed school today
So what I suggest, you just throw them all away
The handbags and the gladrags

Rod Stewart,"Oh yeah
In these days of changing ways
So called liberated days
A story comes to mind of a friend of mine

Georgie boy was gay I guess
Nothin' more or nothin' less
The kindest guy I ever knew

His mother's tears fell in vain
The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest

Pa said there must be a mistake
How can my son not be straight
After all I've said and done for him

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Leavin' home on a Greyhound bus
Cast out by the ones he loves
A victim of these gay days it seems

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
And soon became the toast of the great white way

Accepted by Manhattan's elite
In all the places that were chic
No party was complete without George

Along the boulevards he'd cruise
And all the old queens blew a fuse
Everybody loved Georgie boy

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

The last time I saw George alive
Was in the summer of seventy-five
He said he was in love I said I'm pleased

George attended the opening night
Of another Broadway hype
But split before the final curtain fell

Deciding to take a short cut home
Arm in arm they meant no wrong
A gentle breeze blew down fifth avenue

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Out of a darkened side street came
A New Jersey gang with just one aim
To roll some innocent passer-by
There ensued a fearful fight
Screams rang out in the night
Georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone

A leather kid, a switchblade knife
He did not intend to take his life
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night

The sight of blood dispersed the gang
A crowd gathered, the police came
An ambulance screamed to a halt on fifty-third and third

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Georgie's life ended there
But I ask who really cares
George once said to me and I quote

He said ""never wait or hesitate
Get in kid, before it's too late
You may never get another chance
'Cause youth a mask but it don't last
Live it long and live it fast""
Georgie was a friend of mine

Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch my heart
Saying together forever
Breaking up never

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

Precious memories keep a lingering on
Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you're gone
Left this emptiness
I only reminisce
The happiness we spent
We used to dance on the music
Make romance through the music

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

Rod Stewart,"Each day through my window
I watch him as he passes by
I say to myself ""what an incredible guy""

To have a love like that
Must surely be a dream come true
Out of all the women in the world
He belongs to only you

But it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Soon we'll be married
And raise a family
A cozy little home out in the country
With two kids or three

I tell you I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream
How real it all seems

Ohh but it was just my imagination
Once again runnin' away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Every night on my knees I pray
Dear Lord hear my plea
Don't ever let another take his love from me
Or I will surely surely die

His love is heavenly
When his arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality he doesn't even know me

Just my imagination
Once again
Runnin' away with me
Ohh just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

I messed around with all the rules
Apologized, then realized
I'm not different after all

Me and the boys thought we had is sussed
Valentino's all of us
My dad said we looked ridiculous
But, boy, we broke some hearts
 
In and out of jobs, running free
Waging war with society
Dumb, blank faces stared back at me
But nothing ever changed

Promises made in the heat of night
Creepin' home before it got too light
I wasted all that precious time
And blamed it on the wine
 
I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win
 
Never found a compromise
Collected lovers like butterflies
Illusions of that grand first prize
Are slowly wearin' thin

Giving love unselfishly
But you took it all too seriously
I guess it had to end

I awoke to find you gone
You wrote 'I love you baby
But it's time for me to move on'
And so my teenage heart laid scattered on the floor

But I think about you every minute now
No don't forget me now that we're apart
Just open up that great big loving heart

And you'll always be
You'll always be
You'll always be a part of me

Take your time to embrace romance
Teach your children how to sing and dance
Love may hurt but it's worth the chance
I'll be right by your side

Try to be the best you can
She'll come crashing to every man
And always take the higher ground
I'll be right by your side

I hear your laughter echo through this house
I miss all of this there is no doubt
I wasn't perfect this I would admit
I was always tryin to make the pieces fit

Don't ask me now the time has gone
I've loved you since the minute you were born
So many times we have laughed and cried
I see you now it fills my heart with pride

It's the power of a woman and the weakness of a man
When the lodge go down and the loving begins
You bring me to my knees

One night with you has messed up my head
The well rehearsed tease and the things that you said
The erotic suggestions and the next metaphors
Made me want you more

[Chorus]
Tell me how do you do the thing that you do to me
Over and over again
I'm addicted to your sexual religion
And I don't feel no shame
Tell me how do you do the thing that you do to me
Over and over again
I'm a helpless disaster in the temple of love
A slave to the pleasure and pain

When you're out on the dance floor
I'm checking your hips
And you let down your hair and your pop those lips
You're a heartbreaker honey and I can't let you go
You drive me out of my mind

And this drug that you're dealing is a powerful stuff
Your loving is working and sometimes not
You're a angel of Eden and an angel of love
And I just can't work you out

I can tell by the look in your eyes
You've been bored for a long, long time.
You need love and so do I

Yeah
I don't really want to challenge you
Marry you or remember you.
I just wanna make love to you
For twenty four hours or more.
Or more

An interlude from reality

You go your way, honey, I'll go mine.
I'm the one who didn't waste your time
Remember me this way.

And if you never see my face again,
Think of me as a permanent friend,
The one who loved you like a hurricane
Then disappeared,
Disappeared,
Disappeared.

Rod Stewart,"I didn't know what day it was 
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon

Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical

I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsley prints
I put down to experience

The big bossed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance

You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey what do you see in me

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

You're an essay in glamor
Please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided
You're the best team I've ever seen

And there have been many affairs
Many times I've thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
'Cause you're the warmest thing I've ever found

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul","You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim) [San Diego, CA 11/5/84]",2014
Rod Stewart,"Through a smoke-filled glass on a desperate night
When the sole of my shoe lets in rain
When the heart's tired of running and the milk's gone sour
Will your feelings still be the same?

When the match won't light so the flames don't tremble
And the years are condemning us, too
I'll need a soulmate to hold me and a friend for life
And I'm hoping it might be you

When I think of life as a chance not taken
Or as a compromise tinged with regret
When the kids leave for breeding and the TV's king
Will you tell me we're not done yet?

Will you think of me as a distant island
Or will you come with me to the moon?
I'll need a soulmate to hold me and a friend for life
And I'm hoping it might be you

Give me asylum and I'll keep the faith
Keep me in coffee and so safe
And I'll feed your cats and I'll paint walls
And I'll be your one-night stand

Will you come with me in the certain knowledge
That the catch is there's no catch at all?
I'll need a soulmate to hold me and a friend for life
And I'm hoping it might be you
Yes, I'm certain it must be you",Friend for Life,2015

Rod Stewart,"I was just a little boy without care
I remember looking up and seeing you there
I never wandered too far from your sight
'Cause all the love I needed was there in your eyes

We grew up in a war zone city with a cast iron wind
Broken lives, darken streets, and twisted steel
But around our house the sky seems so blue
And on a wing and prayer we just muddled through

And we always kept the laughter and the smile upon our face
In that good-old-fashion british way with pride and faultless grace
I shall never forget those childhood days for as long as I shall live
And I'll always find my way back, always find my way back home

Tell me why in wars that made our family strong
As our defiant little island weathered the storm
There never seemed enough on my plate
You said be grateful, say grace, don't complain

How can I ever thank you for the lessons that I've learnt
And the precious warmth and comfort that I've felt at every turn
And the roses sacrifice their lives for freedom and for peace
I will always find my way back, always find my way back home

I'll give you stories, operation burning skies
And our nation with its back against the wall
Like a wide-eyed school boy I hang on with the record
Stories I was too young to recall

And we always kept the laughter and the smile upon our face
In that good-old-fashion british way with pride and faultless grace
I shall never forget those childhood days for as long as I should live
And I'll always find my way back, always find my way

And we always kept the laughter and the smile upon our face
In that good-old-fashion british way with pride and faultless grace
I shall never forget those childhood days for as long as I should live
And I'll always find my way back, always find my way back home

We shall fight on the beaches
We shall fight on the landing grounds
We shall fight in the fields, and in the streets
We shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender",Way Back Home,2015
Rod Stewart,"Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand yes I am

In the days between the hours
Ivory towers, bloody flowers
Push their heads into the air
I don't care if I ever know
There I go

Don't push your love too far
Your wounds won't leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
Did someone bow their head?
Did someone break the bread?
Good people are in bed
Before nine o'clock.

On the pad before my eyes
Paper cries, tellin' lies
The promises you gave
From the grave of a broken heart
Hmm

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand
Yes I am oh

I sit here in my lonely room

Don't you know that people cry's a lie, oh
Don't you push your love too far,
You know your wounds won't even leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
And don't you forget what I say

So everyday I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow (here I go!)

Off again, there he go to another dimension
My mind, body, soul imprisoned
My eye probably going ballistic but listen
I'm missing a couple of screws, they ain't never do drilling
True, you been sipping away at the truth
Through a side of wisdom ado (do-do)
Rolling through, hitting switches, rolling ditches, blowing kisses
To the bitches, holding biscuits, what's the business
Beat the system, co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray to father, Lord forgive us
And only God can judge me and he don't like no ugly
I look so fucking good most dykes'll fuck me buddy
Yeah I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her holla if ya need some dick
But the devotion its getting hopeless
But hold it, I'm getting close as my soul is, I'm seeing ghosts
A solo is now a poet, hypnosis overdose on potions
Adjusting to the motions and getting out all my emotions

Everyday I spend my time
Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand

For the Porsche's get em nauseous

Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Wanna show me in my good shoes

How I'm finna get a deal and come back and the whole hood look like you

Can't drive, bitch I'm legally blind bitch
If I leave or die, it's up to me to decide

Rod Stewart,"Here's a song I sing for you
About a girl that I once knew
Julia
She lived in a great big house
With golden gates where servants bowed
For Julia

Unashamed I'd sit outside and wait for hours
Hoping that she'd climb down from her ivory towers
This beautiful girl as pretty as any flower had a hold on me

Upstairs in my lonely room
I would dream of being cool
With Julia
I lived in obsessive bliss
Carefully planning my first kiss
Off Julia

One day I was feeling awfully brave and asked her
If she'd like to come on a date, I just had to
She bent down and gently kissed my face and said oh someday

Oh my god how I loved this girl
But no one ever said that love could burn

Waiting by the phone for days
For a call that never came
From Julia
But love is cruel and has no wings
But I still hear angels sing
For my Julia

I remember being overwhelmed by her prettiness
If only she would look my way I might be in business
To tell the truth she didn't even know I existed, Julia

Summer took her pretty clothes
Winter came in grey and snow oh Julia
And I found out she'd moved away
Her best friend said to the north country
Julia

Now all this happened many years ago my friend
Regrettably there is no happy end, oh no

I think about these past few weeks, oh will they say we've failed?
From our school days they have told us we must yearn for liberty
Yet all I want in this dark place is to have you here with me

Oh Grace just hold me in your arms and let this moment linger
They'll take me out at dawn and I will die
With all my love I place this wedding ring upon your finger
There won't be time to share our love for we must say goodbye

Now I know it's hard for you my love to ever understand
The love I bare for these brave men, my love for this dear land

I had to leave my own sick bed, to him I had to go

They'll take me out at dawn and I will die
With all my love I'll place this wedding ring upon your finger
There won't be time to share our love for we must say goodbye

Now as the dawn is breaking, my heart is breaking too
On this May morn as I walk out, my thoughts will be of you
And I'll write some words upon the wall so everyone will know
I loved so much that I could see his blood upon the rose

Rodan,"Ghidra has arrived, you guys could take five
By the time it's over, no snakes alive
Take the dive, I'm tellin' you, you better off
Then up against a flow to make her, take her sweater off

From the set off when it came to scripts he could hardly brag
It's the result of concentration and lolly-gag
I said, ""Yeah right"" he pulled the mic out a snotty rag
Sealed up air-tight and wrapped up in a body bag

Get a advance and catch chance writer's block
After spendin' the first and last penny
My own worst enemy tell me if I'm OD and usual flow
And made deals with these cats who keep sending dough, so

The Three Headed said it, never get busted
He's a man of his word who's not to be trusted
Beats encrypted, multi-faceted encrusted
Shorty pawn, keep mic rusted

Sort of mellow type of fellow
Who sometimes spaz on wife like Othello
Hell no he won't use words like illuminati
Or Gotti all shotty might use karate

Azar the Gaza cut I'll ask why a mask
With the gall style caps say nice fly
Exact dough till it stack high, white ho, black
Guy the rap game, black eye

Exhiliration, Jet Jag's accelerations
Touch speeds minds can't concieve
Achieve altered, attitudes and angles, angels answer
Aura, illumilation, awesome interperation

Awkward alarm, ankle house arrest and who's best?
Monster Island Czars crush pawn dreams to be king
A frank reality calculation could never be
Quest destined, distant competition dusted

Disgusted raise for second, crowded
Clouded confusion, conclusion simple, plain
Self education, self made millionaires
Serpents slitherin', sidewind searchin'

Stalkin', heat sensin' can't have me Jet Jag's riki tiki tavi
Superhero hit zero to sixty hot pursuit, pedal to the floor
Handlin' lyrics, traction swervin' left right makin' head fix
Layin' high stakes levitates, quick hit breaks
They fly past hit war parts fly loose, kill a mongoose

Fake niggaz contiue to practice the art of intimidation
Sterile minds concieve and threw up all artificial insemination
Syntax a sequential rage unless it's all deliberate
Angle wide words clear, but population stay illiterate

Consider it God's a fine power, fools get rid of it
Men build dreams on promises but lacken' the will to deliver it
You, I disolve connivers like saliva on tic tacs
World is strange, but get the job done like sises mix max

Flip tracks, murder stinks, drunk niggaz killin' six packs
Chokin' on venom, suffered tricknological kick backs
Poverty stricken' minds, all thoughts barely worth two cents
Build history through time, many a design on blueprints

Anooshes slides in the sky, eight-five percent never knew
Wise men arise, pull files like internal revenue
Forever true, appauled? There's self evidence with leverage
Upset? The beast belly concoct

Homogenised beverage
Clever shit, calculate a sabatoge trojan horse
Gift from? See through any G motion that grows in force
Chose to toss to teach familiar line throughout the underworld

God of elevation kills Superman, rape Wondergirl
The discounted, decapitated rapist it's acceptable
The everyday occurrence a fatal outcome's inevitable

Might as well join the forces boss
Chance take a loss like coin toss
Roll with the double headed nickel
Pawn the pawn a Jet Jag with the sickle you and a pickle

King Ghidra yo you ass betta leave 'em alone
Before ya go catch a seizure and leave 'em blown
If you ain't the best of the best in the top three

Either myself, I and me don't even think of caps
But act like you had a slight inkling perhaps
Or get smacked back in the ring like Bob Backlund
Ink jet black and wack

Shut up ha ha ha, young man

Saw the sun slidin down,
On the dyin embers of an empire
See their faces appear,
Everyone who was ever sold out and laid low,
Their voices submerged
In the sound of a choir
Weve got time on our side...

And revealed is the real world,
And it feels like my world
From the crystal cold winter,
So petrified and numb
That the blazing-bright sun overthrows,
The river of brightness flows

See, it starts with a glint
Of a sparkle in the eyes,
And a breath becomes a word becomes a deed
And if the deed is done right,
The whole worlds set alight,
But if you hesitate it goes,
And youre damnin up the river
Just to figure how it flows,
If thats the price of knowin,
Maybe I dont wanna know

cos it feels like the real world,
And it feels like our world
From the ring on your finger,
So cold on my skin
To the diamond-light stars long ago,
The river of brightness flows.",River of Brightness,1998
Roddy Frame,"Here she comes now sister in shadow
Lights up my day 'til there's no tomorrow
Almond eyes set in olive skin,
Betray the anger burnin' white within
There she goes dumbin' down for them all
And speakin' in code when sufferin' is calling
When the city's steppin' out to play
She cuts a dash in tenement grey
Her memory lingers then fades and turns to black
Slippin' through my fingers, shiftin' shape and doublin' back

What you gonna do when the bells are ringin'
Happiness and joy and the birds are singin'
For you sister shadow and it's all so dutiful
Where you gonna go when the city is swingin'
Really reelin' and you're feelin' like it's so unreal
Sweet, sweet nothings loud and clear, sister shadow

Here she comes now sister of shiva
Dark destroyer, holy deceiver
I feel her rising as you're drawing near
Look in your eyes i see her shadow appear
Love is blind, it's a one way twistin' track
She's always behind me but there's no turnin' back

What you gonna do when the bells are ringin'
Happiness and joy and the birds are singin'
For you sister shadow and it's all so dutiful
Where you gonna go when the city is swingin'

Roddy Frame,"Falling free, unashamed,
Couldnt be tied and tamed
Lost my wings, drawn to danger,
Unforgiven now Im bound,
Found and freed,
Tethered to hope and need,
See my strings, tied to an angel,
Made in heaven
Freedom calls sea of wonder
This could be the first one
First enthralls then draws me under
Drowning and undone

We will walk the line together,
Sense it curving by degrees
Its written in air,
And nothing can erase it
While we talk about the weather
A storm is building on the breeze
But we wont despair,
Well turn around and face it
See my strings tied to an angel
Made in heaven",Strings,1998

Now you're back in my arms again
Let your heart be rearranged
While you were sleeping the reaper's been reaping
The times have changed

Speak softly to me
You have more power than the bomb
The tears in your eyes are just medals and prizes
The war is over
Miracles will come and go watch it all work out
But don't give in

If you should climb to the top of the world
Just to take it on the chin
What would would it matter if the world were to shatter
Is it the world you believe in

You crawl to the ends of the earth
As the scenery's caving in
On knees burnt by gravel the season's unravel
Your reason for living

With flesh and blood and small change
We start a little something new
Rather lead and be mistaken than following and fakin'
For the sake of seeming true
All the stars and satellites shine down on you
But which will you heed?

If you should climb to the top of the world
Just to take it on the chin
What would would it matter if the world were to shatter
Is it the world you believe in?

You crawl to the ends of the earth
As the scenery's caving in
On knees burnt by gravel the season's unravel
Your reason for living

If I should drown in the light of your eyes
Well I'd rather die giving
Walk the line with some grace say it wasn't a race
Ain't that a reason for living?

Roddy Frame,"Laser guns are set to stun, sabers interlinked
And try to know the one who shuns the world for inner space
And nothing comes between the sadness and the scream
Exploding rooms of pain; dematerialize again
And gogo bars filled with showgirl stars and Friday set aflame
With crashing cars, sunburst guitars, amphetamines and fame
And crawling from the smash, aliens all slain
A beam of light and a flash, lifts you up to where
You know that you can choose to
Never have to feel that way again
Rushing through the stars, captivated by the worlds beyond
So far, unknown
Floating in a car, past the gates of Must Destroy dot com
You are alone, it's a small world, and you've grown.

Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And create one family oh...

Rodger Fox,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

Rodger Fox,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

Blubber like a baby if her man goes away
A weeping and a wailing how he's done her wrong?

Is the only man among men

I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear
I'll scrub my neck and I'll brush my hair
And start all over again

Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh

That I walk with a sweet and girlish gait

When my date comes to get me at my place.

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Rodgers & Hammerstein,"When I was a boy, world was better spot
What was so was so, what was not was not
Now, I am a man, world have changed a lot
Some things nearly so, others nearly not

There are times I almost think
I am not sure of what I absolutely know
Very often find confusion
In conclusion, I concluded long ago

In my head are many facts
That, as a student, I have studied to procure
In my head are many facts
Of which I wish I was more certain, I was sure
Is a puzzlement

What to tell growing son?
What for instance, shall I say to him of women?
Shall I educate him on the ancient lines?
Shall I tell the boy as far as he is able
To respect his wives and love his concubines?

Shall I tell him everyone is like the other
And the better of the two is really neither?
If I tell him this I think he won't believe it
And I nearly think that I don't believe it either

When my father was a king
He was a king who knew exactly what he knew
And his brain was not a thing
Forever swinging to and fro and fro and to

Shall I, then be like my father
And be willfully unmovable and strong?
Or is it better to be right?
Or am I right when I believe I may be wrong?

Shall I join with other nations in alliance?
If allies are weak, am I not best alone?
If allies are strong with power to protect me
Might they not protect me out of all I own?

Is a danger to be trusting one another
One will seldom want to do what other wishes
But unless someday somebody trust somebody
There'll be nothing left on earth excepting fishes

There are times I almost think
Nobody sure of what he absolutely know
Everybody find confusion
In conclusion, he concluded long ago

And it puzzle me to learn
That tho' a man may be in doubt of what he know
Very quickly he will fight
He'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so

Oh, sometimes I think that people going mad
Ah, sometimes I think that people not so bad
But not matter what I think, I must go on living life
As leader of my kingdom, I must go forth
Be father to my children and husband to each wife
Etcetera, etcetera and so forth

If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way
Everyday I try to live another day
If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way
Everyday I do my best for one more day

And to my greatest joy, my love is there

Underneath my counterpane

Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was

To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Rather well preserved, the wrinkles didn't show

But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",The Overture,2006
Rodgers & Hart,"Sing for your supper
And you'll get breakfast
Songbirds always eat
If their song is sweet to hear

I say now sing for you lunch
And you'll get dinner
Dine with wine of choice
If romance is in your voice

[Bridge]
I heard from a wise canary
Trillin' makes a fellow willin'
So little swallow, swallow now
Now is the time to

[Chorus]
Sing for your supper
And you'll get breakfast
Songbirds are not dumb
They never buy a crumb of bread
It's said
So sing and you'll be fed

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

One more time
I said sing and you'll be fed
Oh yeah
I said sing and you'll be fed",The Sing For Your Supper,2006
Rodgers & Hart,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's A Small Hotel,2006
Rodgers & Hart,"This can't be love because I feel so well 
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs 
This can't be love I get no dizzy spells 
My head is not in the skies 

My hearts does not stand still 
Just to repeat 
This is too sweet to be love 
This can't be love because I feel so well 
Yet I long to look into your eyes",The This Can't Be Love,2006
Rodgers & Hart,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Rodgers & Hart,"Falling in love with love
Is falling for make believe
Falling in love with love
Is playing the fool

Caring too much
Is such a juvenile fancy
Learning to trust
Is just for children in school

I fell in love with love one night
When the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes
Unable to see

I fell in love with love
With love everlasting
But love fell out with me

Oh, I fell in love with love one night
When the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes
Unable to see

I fell in love with love
With love everlasting
But love fell out with me",Falling in Love With Love,2006
Rodgers & Hart,"It happened
I felt it happened
I was awake
I wasn't blind
I didn't think
I felt it happened
now I believe in matter over mind.

And now you see we mustn't wait
the nearest moment that we marry is too late!

Have you met Miss Jones
someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me

Then i said Miss Jones
you're a girl who understand
I'm a boy who must be free.

And all at once I lost my breath
and all at once was scared to death
and all at once I hold the earth and sky!

Now I met Miss Jones 
and well keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I",Have You Met Miss Jones?,2006
Rodgers & Hart,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Rodgers & Hart,"Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do
Old girl you're through
Sit there, count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue.

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can ever count on
Are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

Won't you just sit there
Count the little raindrops
Falling on you
Cause it's time you knew
All you can ever count on
Are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use old girl
You might as well surrender
Cause your hopes are getting slender and slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer up little girl blue",Little Girl Blue,2006
Rodgers & Hart,"My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
Each day is Valentines day

Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak

12 years old and you dealin' crack
Your momma only 26, how she deal with that?
Got a deadbeat dad, but he far from dead
He never knew chocolate milk make you fart real bad (Naw!)
One thing that I wish I could change
Just to see my daddy wavin' at a football game
Just to see my daddy standin' when they say my name
Walk me to the locker room and say, ""Son, good game!"" (For real!)
You make a tackle, but nobody there to clap for em
So I'm writing down my feelings, never knew it was a rap
Our house burnt down, we livin' in motels
So no matters how it sound, let me give you the whole tale!
Goddamn! Now the tears won't stop!
Momma held down three jobs, can she live on top?
Never flew on a plane 'til my LP drop
So I told her once week that her ears are gonna' pop!
(ROSS!)

Oh, yeah!
I'm only human
I'm a man, I make mistakes

Wake up Sunday morning, wanna see my son
He already wanna see his sister, he ain't seen in months
I know it's about the dollars, so I'm steamin' blunts
At the custody hearing and I'm clean as fuck! (BOSS!)
I ain't mad at'cha girl, do your thing!
Last night I hit the club and I threw that change! (Yeah!)
I'mma write you off, unemployed to a Boss!
Another young broad, I'll run in there raw!
Raw, raw, oh yes I am!
Chevy on ground, call it Mex-I-Can
I run D.C. like Leo G
In A-T-L, I keep a bird in the P-O-T
M-I-A! I'm The Mayor on my J-O-B

Bink in VA, drinking V8
Squeek-kays got me ready to sneak the DA!

I know I'm not perfect (For real!)
But I perfected, what I had to work with
Trunk full of sack, saying my prayers
Let me cut the music down so The Lord can hear!
Psalm 27, ink tatted in my arm
Made me think back, when I was baggin' up a bong
Young D-Boys always bragging about the run
I was on my third Rolley, now, I guess we're the bomb!
Now it's deep cuts in the club for the watch
Might let two dimes just fuck while I'll watch!
I'm a Delano, it's Tony Soprano
I fuck with Chicanos
They get it, G, I know!

Rodney Appleby,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water [5.1 Surround Sound/Stereo],2006
Rodney Appleby,"You tell me what you're never gonna be
And I'll show you what you just can't see
If you want good living gotta grab it with your hands
If you don't, then don't bother making no plans

Free being what you want to be
Seeing what you want to see

Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain

You won't get nothing if you got no wheels
If you got no wheels you'll never know how it feels
There's no reason for the things you said
Don't get moving you'll pretty soon be dead, dead and forgotten

Free living the life of a king
You can't have everything

Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain

Everybody fighting for a living in the street
One step back and you're out of the heat
There's just one thing when you set yourself free
You have a good time boy but watch out for me

Free being what you want to be
Seeing what you want to see

Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain

Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain

Barely wearing that mini-skirt
You looked so good it almost hurt
I said baby your've making me crazy and you said

It's easier to get forgiveness than permission
So why wait when you know what I'm missing
We could keep on keeping our distance
Spend our whole lives wishing when it's
Easier to get forgiveness than permission

I started thinking 'bout the day we met and how lonely I'd be if I had let
My head take my heart outta asking your name
I wouldn't be loving you night and day
Oh you're so right so if you wanna hold me tight remember

We could keep on keeping our distance
Spend our whole lives wishing when it's

'Cause we're gonna sleep till noon tomorrow

Rodney Atkins,"He said just think it over
Write me a list
So we can figure out
What we both deserve
She hardly could believe it
That their love had come to this
Dividing and deciding his and hers
But she grabbed a paper napkin
Asked the waitress for a pen
And one by one she wrote down
What she wanted most from him

Honesty, sincerity,
Tenderness and trust
A little less time
For the rest of the world
And more for the two of us
Kisses each morning,
""I love you""s at night
Just like it used to be
The way life was
When you were in love with me

He said the fence needs fixin',
The peaches need pickin'
And the cows need bringin' round

And that summer sun had me sweatin' like a dog

Lookin' back now I'm sure glad I didn't
Cause just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I caught glimpse of the farmer's daughter

She was just gettin' home from Panama city
She was all tanned up and my kinda pretty
When her eyes met mine
I was thinkin' that I would sure love my job
As the days got shorter our talks got longer
The kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger
So we'd hop in the truck and get all tangled up
Every chance we got
We were down by the river all night long
When the sun came up I was sneakin' her home
And draggin' my butt to work
With the smell of her perfume on my shirt
I'd be on the tractor she'd be on my mind
With that sun beatin' down on this back of mine
Just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I fell in love with the farmer's daughter

Whoa and there ain't no better life for me

I'm still haulin' hay and feedin' the hogs

Rodney Atkins,"I packed up my pick-up at seventeen
With uncle Bob's old Martin guitar and a dream
Went from singin' in church
To singin' for tips in a honky-tonk
Till I became a jukebox flash
Play anything from Zeppelin to Cash
As a hard headed hard livin'
Cover singin' cover of my own self
Forgot who I was and where I was from
Then early one morning my daddy showed up

Lifelines, where would we be without lifelines
When we're lost at sea the devil's got you thinking
That the boat ain't sinking, but you're boots are getting wet
That's the thing about lifelines, they tell you the truth
When you won't reach you have to get a hold of you
You're lucky to find a few in your lifetime
Thank God for lifelines

These days I come home every Sunday afternoon
Mama always says ""I was just thinking about you
How's my favorite son?""
""Say, you mean your only one?
Oh I'm good, almost as good as your gravy""
She said, ""Your sister stops by with her kids everyday
But the horse has been tough they're gonna be OK
Your daddy keeps them busy watching Barbers on the Water
Let some Castor cares away""
She said, ""Son I know you gotta make money
But don't forget to make time to slow down and stop by
Have a real piece of pie, here""

Lifelines, where would we be without lifelines
When we're lost at sea the devil's got you thinking
That the boat ain't sinking
But you're boots are getting wet
That's the thing about lifelines they tell you the truth
When you won't reach you have to get a hold of you
You're lucky to find a few in your lifetime
So thank God for lifelines

Where would we be without lifelines
When we're lost at sea the devil's got you thinking
That the boat ain't sinking
But you're boots are sure getting wet
That's the thing about lifelines they tell you the truth

You're lucky to find a few in your lifetime

Rodney Atkins,"I miss my baby so much after being gone
Out on that lake at fishin' all weekend long
So I bought her flowers and a bottle of the good stuff
But when I walked in I knew, well I didn't bring enough

'Cause she ain't as happy as I am to be home
If looks could kill I'd be cold as a stone
I'm already ready to kiss and make up
Looks like tonight I'm out of luck oh no
Cause she'd rather fight than you know what

Had reservations at that Japanese steak house
Don't need to go where they're throwing knifes around
Just take my ear for love all the wrong I've done
Just get it over while she tears me a new one

She ain't as happy as I am to be home
If looks could kill I'd be cold as a stone
I'm already ready to kiss and make up
Looks like tonight I'm out of luck oh no
'Cause she'd rather fight than you know

What I'd like to do if I could just somehow
Get her in the mood oh but I can see right now
She ain't as happy as I am to be home
If looks could kill I'd be cold as a stone
I'm already ready to kiss and make up

Looks like tonight I'm out of luck oh no
'Cause she'd rather fight than you know what
I might be sleeping in my truck

What made you think that love was gonna be so easy

Does she get to you, like no one else
Could she make your life heaven or a livin' hell
Did you think beautiful would drive you so crazy
Oh she's a girl ain't she

Is she on your mind every other thought
Is there nothing you wouldn't do for her just because
Does she hold your heart in her hands
Did she walk into your life and change your plans

Did she want a ring, did you tell her no
Or is it on her finger now, yea I thought so
Does she always get whatever she thinks she needs
Well she's a girl ain't she

Is she on your mind every other thought
Is there nothing you wouldn't do for her just because

Horns a honkin', I've about had it I'm lookin' for an exit sign
Gotta get outta here, get it all off my mind
Then like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin' through the radio static
Changin' my mood, a little George Strait 1982

Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey

Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road

I've been cooped up, tied down 'bout forgotten
what a field looks like full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need the curvin', windin', twistin' dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowin' through my baby's hair

Yeah it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two lane country who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road

Maybe it's the feelin'
Or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot

Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab you honey

Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road

Rodney Atkins,"I was late for work
Had to pull to the side
While a funeral train of cars drove by
With their lights on
It was just my luck
It went on and on for miles
I kept checkin' my watch, grittin' my teeth
Then suddenly it dawned on me
Whoever this is is gonna be missed
For a long long time
And it got me thinkin'

When it's my time to go
The end of my road
I hope it looks like this
Two hundred cars
Stretched out as far
As the hearts I touched while I lived
And I hope I leave
Half as much love behind
When it's my time

So I followed that last car
Down to the church
Took off my ball cap
Tucked in my shirt
I Just had to see
What kind of life
Could cause such a traffic jam

Heard story after story
People laughed, people cried
It didn't take long to understand why
Every pew was full
There's a lot of good souls
Be better from knowin' him
Now I'm one of them

When it's my time to go
The end of my road
I hope it looks like this
Two hundred cars
Stretched out as far
As the hearts I touched while I lived
And I hope I leave
Half as much love behind
When it's my time

Felt a hand on my back
Turned around, someone asked
'Did you know him well?'
And I said 'Yeah,
Well enough to know'

They were the cutest kids I'd ever seen in this front yard
As they handed me my glass, smiling thinking to myself
Man, what a picture-perfect postcard this would make of America

It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song, it's a ride in a Chevrolet
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids selling lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America

Later on when I got home, I flipped the TV on
I saw a little town that some big twister tore apart
And people came from miles around just to help their neighbours out
And I was thinking to myself I'm so glad that I live in America

Goin places with my mom and dad,
It used to scare me to death, how momma used to act
After six or seven beers she's had.
We were sittin at a table when momma got disabled
All the liquor runnin to her head,
Soon I got to chokin', daddy wasn't jokin' when he grabbed me by the arm and said...

""Don't look now your momma's got her boobs out showing everybody in town.""
Faces turnin' red we were wishin we were dead,
There where people standing all around
When momma gets to drinking there ain't much thinkin',
And there's nothing anybody can do,
Just hope and pray there never comes a day when my momma's out drinkin' with you

Well, we got her in the truck
And we started drivin' home
When momma said she had to go,
Daddy pulled it over,
We were standing on the shoulder while momma's puttin' on a show
Then he started up the truck and momma stood up with her pants still around her knees,
When we heard momma holler
If ya give me a dollar well I'll let you take a peek at these.

""Don't look now, your momma's got her boobs out.""
Showin' everybody in town
Faces turnin' red, we were wishing we were dead
There were people standing all around

I crawed in the window got inside she kicked me in the balls and then I cried,Called me a name said I'd lied kicked me again and I thought I died.
She took my clothes set them on fire, hit me with her curling iron.I tried to block it with my watch, then she kicked me in the crotch again.
Yea today's the day my wife met my girlfriend.

Well I tried to tell her but she didn't care thing's weren't what they seemed, She had a pan on the stove of full of boiling water and my nat's would soon be steamed. I tried to run, scream for for help, she hit me in the nurts with a rinestone belt. It was like nothing that I'd ever felt, I thank god I wasn't wearing a kilt. She grabed the bat from beneath the bed swung it once and missed my head, She rared back, swung it again, Then she hit me in the twin's again.

We were young when we first met,

And I won?t ever forget the way you made me feel that night back then,

Little did I know my life had change forever

inside of you my angel had appeared

All at once the baby came along,

everything was moving fast

but nothing seemed wrong


Chorus

Thank god for that

Things we didn?t know

Thank God for that

If we did we might turn back

Thank God for that

He must have known that we weren?t through

God gave me all I need

He gave me you


We struggled the first few years

There was laughter

There were tears

Through it all somehow we made it work,

Our babies brought us joy

Held us close together,

what we didn?t have we made with love,

Sacrifice you gave when I was gone

Dreams you let me follow

always brought me home


Chorus

Thank god for that

Things we didn?t know

Thank God for that

If we did we might turn back

Thank God for that

He must have known that we weren?t through

God gave me all I need

He gave me you


Everything we have been through

Will bind our love forever

Not a day will ever pass

that we won?t be together

here we are much stronger than we've ever been before

Our souls are sown together and our hearts forever more

I look forward to our future

And what our days shall be

Our kids our life our love are all we?ll ever need

The mother that you are is made me proud

And the wife that you have been

I am so glad I found


Chorus

Thank god for that

Things we didn?t know

Thank God for that

If we did we might turn back

Thank God for that

He gave me you

I'll rage that niggaz think that derrty don't need a cage
I should be put on display for the display i displaying
Half you niggaz is dyin and all the rest are decaying
I'm doin tracks in motels, steady rocking girls bells
Kinda like a young Elvis, I ain't in nellyville
I never squeal, not the type to kiss and tell
But if I catch you in the shower I might kiss your tell

Now as I blast off, Kweezie writting movies rolling took that nass off
Mostly leader will be a number runners, ass off
I had every with dirty even, got a nascar
And you know we fucked up at it boss
Hey yo my radar read, maps in Japanese
Clap at gs smack em back on there E's
Drop on wacks, simple facts that rap needs
And its always kris I miss and rap trees
And I got my game, I said I got my game
From the og's, smoking reefer moonshine
Popping oldies, but the whole plane change
Yo you know me, shipped in from cali got it home
Cops and goldies, then we smash some ass
Free autotericoop call nasa to do the numbers
All the freshman from the vocals started firin' the booth
Got more whips and chains, then I'm a start in roots

Man down pimp in distress, I think I'm falling
For anything but the okie doke, I'm old school 
Like her and bonz and nukee ropes I can't stand them groupie folks
They want me to turn around like this is hokie poke
They want to break me down like erv before I choke
I'm not a jack at all I'm quick draw mcgraw
And number 20 on the Lakers couldn't hold me y'all
I'm climbing over y'all I'm still scoring
85 percent of y'all awake but still snoring
Got knowledge yourself and now my style is much older now
We dirty ent we all we got we hold it down
I'm feeling cooler than cool, my wrist colder wow 
If there's a fashion king then I deserve the crown
I'm you city, you dressing up I'm dressing down
And you keep messing up, me and your girl goin' be messing around

Aiyo I'm fresh out the gate, from the Lou with a grammy in my rezzie
Nelly bought me a prezzie with a diamond in the bezzie
Chicks taugh me how to walk, so when I run I'll be ready
Females fans sayin that I'm there baby daddy WHOA
More attention then Justin and Janet
How I Midwest swing and how St Louis ram it
Deerty ent dammit, got more bread than a sandwich
And my writst got more nuggets than Carmello and Camby
Look, I'm from the Lou and I'm important like the arts
So tours look for me like an important part
Find your talent use your talent get your money
Or don't find your talent and don't use it and stay bummy
But that don't owe me cause I built it from scratch
My next shit is a house with a house in the back
Man I'm been while since middle school
I was that little dude that been round more waist lines than hoola hoops

There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now

And like a lighthouse
You must stand alone
Landmark the sailor's journey's end

I've been sailing on

Old memories just keep holding on and you been on my mind

You been on my mind sometimes
I think I must be going blind
Ive seen a world baby without you
But I dont see myself there too

Hardly does a day go by when I dont see your clear blue eyes
Many night I just wonder why and you been on my mind
Youve been on my mind so long
Ive been thinking that something was wrong
Ive told myself I should forget
But I dont seem to have it yet
I dont dream that you might change I dont think that Im acting strange
I tell myself its all in vain and you been on my mind

Youve been on my mind Ive said
Till its all thats in my head
Yes I know what I must do
But I dont think youll be there too

Guess its time for me to go but as it is Ill never know
Just what it is that I long for so and you been on my mind

Rodney Crowell,"Fancy meeting you here, tonight
It's such a small world, New York ain't my town
I don't come around, but once in a while

This is such a surprise to see you
Girl, your looking so good; it's been a long time
Since you've crossed my mind 
It's such a small world

Just one night on the town,
I came looking around for something to do 

Just a change of my plans on leaving, 
And I stay around and I run into you
Which just goes to prove it's such a small world

It's such a small world

I've lived alone for awhile

It's such a small world

It feels like I've gone out of style

You and me will always be
Just looking for something that's already happened
Years go by but you and I don't have to look beyond today

Maybe just for tonight
We can turn out the light

Lay your heart on the line
Let go of your mind

You know just what to say
You know just what to do

You still look like the day when I first met you

I'll be gone once again come morning
Like I've always done
But to see you tonight
Makes everything right, it's such a small world

Hey, right here you stand as if it was planned

Rodney Crowell,"If today weren't just like any day, perhaps I'd try
To shed this worn out skin so thick and learn to fly
But I came home to face your ice and steel
If looks could kill I would be gone today

There's a fire that's burning in your eyes, not in your heart
And I can fan the flames but I can't make a spark
And I don't like the way I make you feel
If looks could kill I would be long since gone

And if looks could kill then I'd be pushing up your daisies
If looks could kill then I would not be going crazy

There's a stool that I've been glued to for so many nights
And a bar to pour my heart out on and make it right
And I don't have to tell myself it's real
If looks could kill my heart would beat no more

And if looks could kill then I'd be deep in peaceful slumber
If looks could kill then I would not be going under

There's a gun out in the hallway covered up in dust
That works well enough to turn this heartache into dust
So go on and let your lawyer make a deal
If looks could kill, if looks could kill I would be long since gone",If Looks Could Kill,1993

She's crazy for leaving!

I told her so!
And the boys at the bus stop just said ""man, let her go!""

Ya add insult to injury and what do ya get?
Ya get a bus stop of honkies that don't ever forget!

With her head held high she digs down deep and struggles like we all will

I'm headed down south where the grass grows tall
Where the mockingbirds singing and the whippoorwill calls

Spanish moss on the Natchez Trace
Gulf wind blowin' wide across my face
French girls dancin' to a big bang drum
Back down south where I come from

Where the river flows like warm molasses
Rain fogs up my readin' glasses
Honey suckle strong enough to curl
Your hair back down there

One fine mornin', gonna pull up stakes
I'm gonna chalk it all up as just a bad mistake
Gonna hit the decks runnin' bid a fond farewell
By the time I get to Memphis I'll be outta my shell

Cotton fields just as white as snow
Sweet magnolia blossoms grow
Big moon shinin' like an ice cream cone
Back down south where I belong

Where the river flows like milk and honey
The nights are slow and the eggs are runny
I wouldn't mind sittin' in a rockin' chair back down there
Jewel of the south cross my heart, shut my mouth
Come the mornin', I'll be home in the sweet Delta dawn

One fine mornin' and it won't be long
I'm leavin' put early with my glad rags on
I'm gonna pull a load of wool off of my own two eyes
And sharpen my senses countin' railroad ties

When the mile long trestle makes a clickity-clack
The whole dang town is gonna welcome me back
Ticket to the land of the sugar cane back
Down on the Pontchartrain

Where the river flows like a grand mariner
Sweet olive takes my breath away
Sunday mornin' walkin' on the Jackson Square back down there

You heat up the night like a hot summer wind
The taste of your lips just sets me on fire
Everywhere I turn got love to burn again
I love to please you baby and smell your sweet perfume
The way you walk and the way you talk just keeps me on the moon

Rodney Crowell,"I'm back on board that '49 Ford in 1956
Long before the sun came up way out in the sticks
The headlight showed a two rut roadway, back up in the pines
First time I heard Johnny Cash sing I walk the line

I got my thrill behind the wheel upon my daddy?s lap
Grandpa rode co-pilot with a flashlight and a map
Cane pole out the window it was in the summertime
First time I heard Johnny Cash sing I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I never will forget that day, I know the time and place
Sounded like the whole thing came right down from outer space
I still can see those headlights and that dashboard in my mind
The first time I heard Johnny Cash sing I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

All these long years later it's still music to my ears
I swear it sounds as good right now as anything I hear
I've seen the Mona Lisa, I've heard Shakespeare read real fine
Just like hearing Johnny Cash sing I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've know proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Because you're mine, I walk the line

We used to hit the streets and go swimming in our birthday suits

Skiing in a bar ditch behind a moped
13 stitches on the corner of a sardine can
We were dirt poor Houston kids
Our whole family living on the skids
But we always had a nickel for the coming of the ice cream man

Mosquito truck blowing up DDT
Barefoot heathens running wild and free
Air raid buzzer at a noon-day scream
Living in a dream
On Telephone Road

I used to love them cherry Cokes down at the Prince's Drive-In
And the cheeseburgers tasted so good I like to come untied
There's a Chinaberry tree I remember
I used to climb in and out of my window
The night I left was on the day before my Grandma died

Sawdust spread out on a dance hall floor
Jukebox ripping at an all-out roar
Barmaid smiling at a 10 cent tip
Living is a trip
On Telephone Road

Magnolia Garden bandstand on the very front row
Johnny Cash Carl Perkins and The Killer putting on a show
6 years old and just barely off my daddy's knee
When those rockabilly rebels
Sent the Devil running right through me

A drive-in movie in the trunk of my car
One-eyed sailor in an ice house bar
Spit-shine Charlie and ol' Peg-leg Bill
Are dressed up fit to kill
On Telephone Road

Telephone Road, Telephone Road

Barbecue and beer on ice
A salty watermelon slice
At the Little Taste of Paradise

And it burns, burns, burns

We don't want to feel that empty.

Then there's something in the wind when the days go getting shorter
And the nights run cold and clear
Down here.

We'll take each new day to give what we need to do our part
While were learning how to live
With a lifelong broken heart.

It's a privilege to remember.
The sound of days gone past will last.
We can see you in the stars
Come some vivid night in November
And with the last few leaves that fall,

Surely, each new day will give
What we need to do our part
To keep learning how to live
With a lifelong broken heart.

Oh, you beautiful one,
So clearly a gift.
Life had designs of its own
To set you adrift.

So go lightly where you must,
Travel soft upon new wings.
You will never be alone.
Go on.
When we cannot understand,
When we cannot find new meaning,
We'll seek out the ones you loved
And love.

Taking each new day to give
What we need to do our part.

I could fly, fly, fly.
Tie my dreams up in a sack and lay my head down on the track,
And die, die, die.
My life's been so sweet I just can't stand it.
I must admit I've made out like a bandit.

Drinkin' wine, wine, wine.

I knew love once way back when--she had almond eyes and olive skin,
And long black hair.
She was Irish-Spanish mix-breed, I was southeast Texas hayseed,
We were almost there.
Her daddy did not like my kind around.
The true love took the next train out of town.
Earthbound.

Earthbound; where there's fathers and daughters in pain.
Earthbound; mama's boy walkin' home in the rain.
Earthbound; like a ship run aground, think I might stick around.
I'm Earthbound.

With each new day that passes I'm in need of thicker glasses,
But it's all okay.
Some day I'll be leavin', but I just can't help believin'
That it's not today. (hey)
Every golden moment I have found I've done my best to run right in the ground.
Earthbound.

Earthbound; see the sky big and beautiful blue.
Earthbound; fallen angels come calling for you.
Earthbound; keepin' close to the ground, think I might stick around.
Earthbound; Tom Waits, Aretha Franklin, Mary Karr
Earthbound; Walter Cronkite, Seamus Heaney, Ringo Starr
Earthbound; the Dalai Lama and Charlie Brown make me wanna stick around.

He's cold and he's hard
He's got an eye for deception

He's swimming in concrete
Drowning in fear
And he keeps it all locked in his heart

This man is a tyrant, a fault finding hack
You can't tell him nothing
There's no turning back
He leaves blood on the highway
And scattered debris
He crawls from the wreckage
But he still doesn't see
He's alive
The man is jive

There's a man in the mirror
I don't like his looks
His teeth they are crooked
His hands are like hooks
He speaks 4 letter language
Because his mind is so small
His voice is like venom
I don't like him at all

But all you can smell is a rat

Why do you insist on your head in the sand
Building walls all around you, you don't understand
These ways are outmoded,
But all you can change is your hat

Is all you deserve

I aim for heaven but I wake up on the floor
I'd take up with rattlesnakes to get my point across
I'd argue with a parking brake to show em who's the boss
It's my intention to inspire
Instead I'm preachin to the choir

I had some money but I blew it living high
My wine and women were the best that you could buy
I tried to prove myself a man of certain taste
But all I've got to show you now is written on my face
I'm not someone you'd admire but I'm still preachin' to the choir

I'm born a lion but I don't believe it fits
I'm no king of the jungle out there livin by my wits
This morning's paper called for romance on a whim
I reckon I'd believe em' if they told me sink or swim
I'm under water not on fire but I'm still preachin to the choir

Baytown Texas there's a fisherman I knew
He read the bible and he spit tobacco too
He said that crap about the rod you spare to spoil the child
Is only propaganda meant to keep you in denial
Go on and follow your desire but he was preachin to the choir

Time is of the essence when you're hanging by a thread
And the answer to your questions won't unravel in your head
When you're staring at forever from the edge of life's abyss
No one's gonna tell you how it all came down to this
If you say different you're a liar
I'm just preachin' to the choir

When I'm standing at the St. Peter's gate a trying to slip on in
I might as well plead guilty to the worst of who I've been
I used to like to think I had a special way with words
But right now I'm convinced I've more in common with the birds
I'm not ready to retire I'll keep on preachin to the choir

Rodney Crowell,"Ridin' Out The Storm Lyrics
The New York City winter comes in cold grey sheets of steel
The numbness in his hands and feet is all that he can feel
Alcohol and sterno turns a doorway to a bed

And the ghost of who he might have been lives on inside his head
In a canyon made of brownstone on a sidewalk icy black
He wanders nearly barefoot with his righteousness in tact
A man of many mansions in a cardboard box replete

He lies sleeping with an angel while his heart pretends to beat
The wind blows down on Lonely Street like an ice pick through the air
Midst the Sunday times and coffee grinds and wino's in Times Square
Five flights up on Easy Street you know she's safe and warm

Way down low neath a foot of snow he's riding out the storm
I offered him my winter coat politely he refused
Like an educated man he spoke with words I seldom use
He said I don't need pity for these choices are my own

He bowed his head just slightly and quietly moved along
Its not like he's a victim of the homeless life he stalks
Nor helpless to get back across the fine line that he walks
Riding out the storm means yesterday's already spent

Tomorrow don't mean nothing it won't even make a dent",Ridin' Out the Storm,2003

My ragged old heart's been blessed

You ain't seen nothing yet
I'm still learning how to fly
It's the dreams that die hard

You can't let down your guard
When there's so much at stake
I'm halfway to heaven, halfway to hell
But I might roll a seven
You never can tell
Life's been good it's true
When I'm feeling just like new
The same old rules need not apply
I've got a past full of sticks and stones
And a good feeling in my bones
I'm still learning how to fly
I want to go faster
I don't want to slow down
I don't want to get off of this merrygoround
I want to be reckless
I want to be vain
I want to make love like a runaway train
Life's been good I said

When the winds of change hit hard and knock you off your guard
And you find out there's a serpent in the grass
Though forked tongues might speak if truth is what you seek

This too will pass
When your all tied up in knots and your friends are taking shots
And the sun comes up and kicks you in the ass
When your stumbling down the aisle and you feel like you're on trial

This too will pass
Sometimes you've gotta go down the middle of the road
Where compromise puts speed bumps in your path
If you know what you won't let no one say you don't

This too will pass
Sometimes you gotta crawl through the middle of it all
But don't compromise your heart for something crass
When everything you do just feels like nothing new

This too will pass
When your all locked up in pain be careful who you blame
This too will pass",This Too Will Pass,2003
Rodney Crowell,"It's time to go inward, take a look at myself
Time to make the most of the time that I've got left
Prison bars imagined are no less solid steel

Time to go inward would you believe that I'm afraid
To stare down the barrel of the choices that I've have made
The ghost of bad decisions
Make mountains out of everything I feel

Outside my window the wind weaves a path through the trees
The moon takes a shine to the shadows that fall on the leaves

It's time to go inward, hmm
I don't know if I can do it after all that I've become
I've been a fool for money
But it's vanity that always leaves me flat

It's time to go inward, man I hope I have the nerve
To take an inventory of the causes that I serve
They say a man without a conscience
Is like a man without a country or somethin' like that

It's time to go inward, time to be still
If I don't do it now I don't believe I ever will
My mind is like a chatterbox
Whose noise pollutes the pathways to my soul

Time to go inward, time to get a grip
Time to put an end to one long bad acid trip
I'm all out of excuses now
For the way I've let my choices take a toll

Jesus and Buddha and Krishna and Minnie Pearl knew
To do unto others the things you want done unto you

And try to solve the riddle
Of what it is I have to offer to this world

Rodney Crowell,"'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrist and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
""Come in,"" she said ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

And the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount
Nothing really matters much, doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
""Come in,"" she said ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Now there's a wall between us, something else been lost
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn'
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make her mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

When this body won't carry me no further

You wouldn't know it looking at this picture
That her eyes were blue, hair was red

You wouldn't know she traveled far and wide

I could cross that great divide

I can feel you in my heart
But that's not close enough

On one more last goodbye

The time to put away these things is long since overdue

If indeed I do get lonesome in my mansion on the hill
There's this neighbor's wife I covet for her beauty and her skill
The way she puts herself together sleek in vagabond couture
Makes each mailbox conversation one more heartache to endure

Rodney Crowell,"Life without Susanna started when Townes Van Zandt died
From that day on she hid out undercover
Her Percocet and cigarette along for the ride

She made the bed inside her head a shelter
Each new day a sliver through the blinds
I tried tough love, tenderness and anger
But nothing pierced the fortress inside her mind

The first time I saw her she threw me that smile
Pure angel of mercy east Texas style
A poet in gingham, an assassin in jeans
The most near perfect woman I'd ever seen
She was hardly routine

Life without Susanna troubles me in ways hard to express
As she withdrew I grew distant and judgmental
A self-sure bastard and a stubborn bitch
Locked in a deadly game of chess
The upside of my status as a cut above the rest

The last time I saw her was close to the end
I cried like a baby for the shape I was in
No lipstick, no powder to soften the tone
The most worthy opponent that I've ever known
Was already gone

Life without Susanna is something we all have to face
So welcome to the world as we don't know it
Big blue knuckleball free floating somewhere out in space
Where life without Susanna is no man's saving grace
This is life without Susanna and I can't find my place",Life Without Susanna,2017
Rodney Crowell,"I had a dog named Banjo and a girl named Muffin
I'd just blew in from Texas and I didn't know nothing
I found my way around this town with a friend I made named Guy
Who loved Susanna and so did I

Now there was this run down shack on Acklen Avenue
That I shared with Skinny Dennis
And a poet name of Richard Dobson who had a novel he'd never finish
That's when Johnny Rodrigues, David Olney and Steve Earle first came through
And every other guitar bum whose name I never knew

There was this tight-rope-walker who called herself the queen of Poughkeepsie
Who ran away from the circus with some roustabout redneck gypsy
They were Townes Van Zandt fans and prone to combustion
They fought like dogs in Spanish and made love in Russian

I wish Newberry and Buck White would drop on by the house tonight
Things have changed round here you bet, but it don't seem much better yet

I first met Willie Nelson with some friends at a party
I was twenty-two years old and he was pushing forty
There was hippies and reefer and God knows what all I was drinking pretty hard

I was drinking in a hotel bar
Two women came up and kissed me and you were watching from a distant star
I know it doesn’t make much sense
But what can I tell you

Judging by the evidence
I’m feeling reckless

I don’t know why I would go there 
All to make a fuss over what
I’ve got a woman like you and what do I do,
Pretend I might be something I’m not

I know you know it’s not your fault, it’s just something inside me

Would that I were worth my salt
But I’m feeling reckless

You give me more than I give back
It’s more than a social skill I lack
So slay me with your tender mercy
And comfort me with words of steel

You can catch me in a lie 
When I cast a roving eye 
But you’ll never know the way I feel

I know you know you’re smarter than me
Tell me something I don’t know
There’s so much more that I could be

Rodney Crowell,"It's like I'm sitting at a bus stop waiting for a train 
Exactly how I got here is hard to explain 
My heart's in the right place, what's left of it I guess 
My heart ain't the problem, it's my mind that's a total mess 
With these rickety old legs and watery eyes 
It's hard to believe that I could pass for anybody's prize 
Here's what I know about the gifts that God gave 
You can't take 'em with you when you go to the grave 

It ain't over yet, ask someone who ought to know 
Not so very long ago we were both hung out to dry 
It ain't over yet, you can mark my word 
I don't care what you think you heard, we're still learning how to fly 
It ain't over yet

For fools like me who were built for the chase 
Takes the right kind of woman to help you put it all in place 
It only happened once in my life, but man you should have seen
Her hair two shades of foxtail red, her eyes some far out sea blue green 
I got caught up making a name for myself, you know what that's about 
One day your ship comes rolling in and the next day it rolls right back out 
You can't take for granted none of this shit 
The higher up you fly boys, the harder you get hit 

It ain't over yet, I'll say this about that 
You can get up off the mat or you can lay there till you die 
It ain't over yet, here's the truth my friend 
You can't pack it in and we both know why 
It ain't over yet 

Silly boys blind to get there first 
Think of second chances as some kind of curse 
I've known you forever and ever it's true 
If you came by it easy, you wouldn't be you 
Make me laugh, you make me cry, you make me forget myself 

Back when down on my luck kept me up for days 
You were there with the right word to help me crawl out of the maze 
And when I almost convinced myself I was hipper than thou 
You stepped up with a warning shot fired sweet and low across the bow 
No you don't walk on water and your sarcasm stings 
But the way you move through this old world sure makes a case for angel wings 
I was halfway to the bottom when you threw me that line 
I quote you now verbatim, ""Get your head out of your own behind""

It ain't over yet, what you wanna bet 
One more cigarette ain't gonna send you to the grave 
It ain't over yet, I've seen your new girlfriend 
Thinks you're the living end, great big old sparkle in her eye 
It ain't over yet",It Ain't Over Yet,2017
Rodney Crowell,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City

Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Trying to understand the thing that you want MJ to do
Ain't it funny how the time easily slips away
I've been thinking about you sugar every moment every day
And we lay upon the beach we can each get cosy
On the other end where the people don't know me
Show me, any little thing that you feel like
Let me know the spot that gets you hot and make it feel right
Introduce some plans, to the elementary game
We can be connected with a number and a name
Strange how women make you chase them for awhile
Then when you approach them they get timid like a child

Thinking about the entrance you made at the club scene
You know you're looking goodSo I just let it ride

To tell you the truth, competiton is blowing my hustle about position
Concidences keep us apart
It's hard to listen to somebody that you don't even trust
you don't know
Places that I want you to come, you don't go
Half all playing the game of cat and mouse
But before you start running your mouth or getting out
You don't want a man, you want somebody to play with
Knowing it's impossible for you to stay with

And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop 
Say you're coming home
",Stop to Love,1988
Rodney Good,"Say goodbye - maybe that's one way to go
Walk away and say it's over, call it history
Do I believe we'd better off apart?
Can I see my world without you in it?
Baby, not for a single minute

[Chorus:]
Let the moon give up the night
All the stars leave heaven on high
The sun would burn out before I'd ever lose you
We can get over any wall
If we have to fly, run, climb, or crawl
Love will always lead us back
Where we belong

Just today I woke up shakin' from a dream
I got a glimpse of life without you
All the good was gone
Then I realized you were lying next to me
I knew right then, baby, come whatever
When the going gets tough, we'll face it together

[Chorus]

Baby, all we got to do is reach out
No laying blame, no guilty party
Lay our daggers down on the ground
Hold each other and say we're sorry

[Chorus]

Love is gonna let us back
Where we belong",Where We Belong,2000
Rodney Hayden,"Way down in Virginia
Amongst the tall grown sugar canes
Lived a simple man and a dominiker hen
And a rose of a different name.

Well, the first time I felt lightning
I was standing in the drizzling rain
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin
And a rose of a different name.

Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
And help me leave that black rose alone.

When the devil made that woman
Lord, she threw the pattern away

She was built for speed with the tools you need
To make a new fool every day.

Way down deep and dirty
On the darker side of shame
I caught a cane cuttin' man with a bottle of gin
With a rose of a different name.

The devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
Help me leave that black rose alone.

An army towel, covering my belly

A hundred like me
I followed a naked body
A naked body followed me, Next! Next!
I was just a child when my innocence was lost
In a mobile army whorehouse
A gift of the army, free of cost. Next! Next! Next!

Me, I really would have liked a little bit of tenderness
Maybe a word, maybe a smile, maybe some happiness, but Next! Next!
Oh, it was not so tragic
and heaven did not fall
But how much at that time
I hated being there at all, Next! Next!
I still recall the brothel trucks, the flying flags
The queer lieutenant slapped our arses
He's thinking we are fags. Next! Next! Next!

I swear on the wet head of my
First case of gonorrhea
It is his ugly voice that I forever fear, Next! Next!
A voice that stinks of whiskey, corpses and of mud
The voice of nations
The thick voice of blood, Next! Next!
Since then each woman I have taken into bed
They seem to lie in my arms
And they whisper in my head, Next! Next!

Oh, the naked and the dead
Could hold each others hands
As they watch me dream at night
In a dream that nobody understands
And though I am not dreaming in a voice grown dry 'n' hollow
I stand on endless naked lines of the following and the followed
The Next! Next!

One day I'll cut my legs off
I'll burn myself alive
I'll do anything to get out of life, to survive

Rodney Jerkins,"All day long I think of you 
I can't even think of things to do
Wishin' all of my daydreams come true
Now, baby, what am I to do?

I think about yesterday
Somebody was talkin' to me
But I couldn't understand a word they said
Not that I was tryin' to be rude
But conversation couldn't make it through
The thoughts of love I had for you

Baby your face takes up my time
Because I can jus' see your face with mine
I try to change my thoughts; it's a waste of time
You keep my mind occupied

Refrain.

Tell me what am I to do?
When I can only think of you
Even when I have simple things to do
Like talkin' on the telephone
Or watchin' TV when somethin's on
If it ain't about you then what's the use?

Refrain.

What's up girl? You all grown up now....

Doin' ya singin' thing the charts sewed up now
Well you know I do my rap thing, I'm holdin' it down
And I knew that me and you was gon' connect some how
Your people called for this track, it ain't no trouble to me
I dreamt that you and me got married on the WB
You on channel 11; I carry the M-11
RJ the reverened; it's a match made in heaven
Whatever have you I let you know
I'm from soundview
Down til I found you
I'm tryin' to be around you
I'm still comin' up
Chasin' the fame and wealth
I could spoil you with time; you got everything else

I'm still New York to the heart
But got love for all
When I first saw this girl
Thought I wanted to fall
Mean the hummer so stunnin'
That my bod was tense
And I wishin everyday that I was fresh like Prince
Then I came across my man RJ parlayin' in a 6
With Tatyana Ali playin'
I heard Steely Dan ""Black Cow"" and went wild
You tell me how can I get down
That's when they threw me on the redeye to LA
I dirtied my cash and peeps back
And hit Shaq on the cellay
Courtside seats so close that we could touch
Tatyana and Lord and Peter Gunz

Rodney Jones,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2005

12 years old and you dealin' crack
Your momma only 26, how she deal with that?
Got a deadbeat dad, but he far from dead
He never knew chocolate milk make you fart real bad (Naw!)
One thing that I wish I could change
Just to see my daddy wavin' at a football game
Just to see my daddy standin' when they say my name
Walk me to the locker room and say, ""Son, good game!"" (For real!)
You make a tackle, but nobody there to clap for em
So I'm writing down my feelings, never knew it was a rap
Our house burnt down, we livin' in motels
So no matters how it sound, let me give you the whole tale!
Goddamn! Now the tears won't stop!

Never flew on a plane 'til my LP drop
So I told her once week that her ears are gonna' pop!

Made me think back, when I was baggin' up a bong

'cause everlasting bass, sho' nuff moves a flower
Some people can't take it, they try to plead the case

I'm Rodney O and I'm back, on a track that's not wack
And my DJ, Joe Cooley's still on top of the stack
So you can say he's like wine, he's getting better with time
And General Jeff is by my side, to support my rhymes
We clock dollars, not dimes, we rock bells and chimes
And I'm a be	-boy 100%, like Moonshine
So listen up everybody 'cause you should not miss
""As we go a little something like this"" --> Slick Rick
Well I'm a true blue MC with plenty of pizzazz
Plantin and scratchin is Joe's favorite task
Is he the best? Well there's no need to ask
Take a look at him as he moves fast
As lightnin, and you know what's so damn frightenin?
You others are soft, and you still haven't ripened 
Yet, I'm not knockin you, I'm just rockin to
A funky beat that is just cold sockin you
I'n the face, we got pounds of bass
And check it out everybody, Joe Cooley's in the place

[Chorus 1]
(Rodney O)
I brought the microphone, Joe Cooley brought the mixer
I drink Coca-Cola, not hardcore liquor
'cause I'm playin it straight, the homies like the 8
""It's the power!"" that makes it taste so great
I'm kickin back in the hood, this beat is kickin real good
If you was kickin it like me, you wouldn't have to ask, would
This bass reflect, the maximum effect
This jam is for the homies, and it's comin direct
Straight from the heart, and I will do my part
This groove has been groovin straight from the start
This is for the homies, and the homegirls too
Joe Cooley, tell them what you want 'em to do

[Chorus 2:]
Say yeah, yeah, yeah(this is for the homies)(4x)

I'm gettin straight to the point
Hold a mic, not a joint
Like the end is lit up, so it's Joe and he cuts
Newmark is is brand, all gummies get canned
""This is for the homies!"" is the name of this jam
We rock it like an earthquake, we're conquerin states
Rodney O and Joe Cooley doing many tour dates
Dedicating this song, to the homies at home
This beat is on the street wherever you roam
We're household names, in the hip-hop game
So repeat after me, ""Joe, scratch that thang!""

And freedom for those who obey.
All those who seek it shall find it,
A pardon for all who believe.
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.
Forget not the hope
That's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost?",El Shaddai,1999
Rodney Redman,"This makin' a livin' is killin' me
I work like a dog in this hot factory
Can't even afford a vacation when I've got the time
But I've got road maps of Mexico
Brochures and pictures of places to go
Dreamin' in color. Livin' in black and white

I can drink margaritas with sweet senoritas
Work on my tropical tan
Dangle my feet in the crystal blue water
Lay in the snow white sand
I've never been down to Mexico
But I'm gonna go there tonight
I'm dreaming in color. Livin' in Black and white

I'd like to buy a new Cadillac
Build me a house with a pool out back
And eat at the country club every Saturday night
But there ain't much pay in my ol' paycheck
But I'll win the lotto one day I bet

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed

With the sun in my heart

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

The bass that's in your face, sho' nuff shrugs your face
Just like you got sprayed by a can of mace
You see your speaker is movin, everybody is groovin
My song moves along as it starts improvin
The highs will get no higher, the bass will go no lower
'cause everlasting bass, sho' nuff moves a flower
Some people can't take it, they try to plead the case
But you can't get enough of everlasting bass

Joe's as fast as Carl Lewis
He's black, not Jewish
And when he's on stage, he can (scratching) do it
And I'm good to go, yes Rodney O
Leader of the show, make the ladies say ""Oh!""
King of my castle, causin much pain
You dumb shrimp wimps, it's you I tame
So to the are, to the O, to the D-N-E-why
Now what's that spell? Rodney, that's right

Me and Joe are on the go, movin fast, not slow
Sportin Filas and Adidas and some are Kangols
We ride on 747's, not DC-10's
We'll take a 3-day vacation and we'll do it again
Check in the hotel the day of the show

I'm Rodney O and I'm back, on a track that's not wack
And my DJ, Joe Cooley's still on top of the stack
So you can say he's like wine, he's getting better with time
And General Jeff is by my side, to support my rhymes
We clock dollars, not dimes, we rock bells and chimes
And I'm a be	-boy 100%, like Moonshine
So listen up everybody 'cause you should not miss
""As we go a little something like this"" --> Slick Rick
Well I'm a true blue MC with plenty of pizzazz
Plantin and scratchin is Joe's favorite task
Is he the best? Well there's no need to ask
Take a look at him as he moves fast
As lightnin, and you know what's so damn frightenin?
You others are soft, and you still haven't ripened 
Yet, I'm not knockin you, I'm just rockin to
A funky beat that is just cold sockin you
I'n the face, we got pounds of bass
And check it out everybody, Joe Cooley's in the place

[Chorus 1]
(Rodney O)
I brought the microphone, Joe Cooley brought the mixer
I drink Coca-Cola, not hardcore liquor
'cause I'm playin it straight, the homies like the 8
""It's the power!"" that makes it taste so great
I'm kickin back in the hood, this beat is kickin real good
If you was kickin it like me, you wouldn't have to ask, would
This bass reflect, the maximum effect
This jam is for the homies, and it's comin direct
Straight from the heart, and I will do my part
This groove has been groovin straight from the start
This is for the homies, and the homegirls too
Joe Cooley, tell them what you want 'em to do

[Chorus 2:]
Say yeah, yeah, yeah(this is for the homies)(4x)

I'm gettin straight to the point
Hold a mic, not a joint
Like the end is lit up, so it's Joe and he cuts
Newmark is is brand, all gummies get canned
""This is for the homies!"" is the name of this jam
We rock it like an earthquake, we're conquerin states
Rodney O and Joe Cooley doing many tour dates
Dedicating this song, to the homies at home
This beat is on the street wherever you roam
We're household names, in the hip-hop game
So repeat after me, ""Joe, scratch that thang!""

Been in church all my life
Sometimes all I find is strife
Thought I'd have friends to the end
Sometimes alone is all I've been
Tears I cried night and day
But God has always made a way
Because He loves and I love Him too

I love you so and I'm never gonna let you go
Holdin' on to Your hand though sometimes I don't understand
Tears I cried night and day, but I'm gonna trust you anyway
Because You love me and I love you too.

Left my home, family and job
And my life was so very hard
Tried my best to stand the test
Then God came and gave me rest
Tears I cried night and day
But God has always made a way
Because He loves and I love Him too

I love you so and I'm never gonna let you go
Holdin' on to Your hand though sometimes I don't understand
Tears I cried night and day, but I'm gonna trust you anyway
Because You love me and I love you too.

I lost my job after 14 years
It left me living in fear
I didn't know how to pay my bills
But in His Word he said stand still
Tears I cried night and day
But God has always made a way]
Because He loves and I love Him too

I love you so and I'm never gonna let you go
Holdin' on to Your hand though sometimes I don't understand
