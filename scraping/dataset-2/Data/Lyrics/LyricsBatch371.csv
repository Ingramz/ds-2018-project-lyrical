Wham pop
When sweet lips kisses me

Ala a-pop
Don't stop
Just buzz me like a bee

A-flip a chip, top

I feel so quivery

It's like a trumpet man that bodes high sea

I want a hip, hop
Clap, clop

Hugo Winterhalter & His Orchestra,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1998
Hugo Winterhalter & His Orchestra,"Why this feeling? Why this glow?
Why the thrill when you say Hello?
It's a strange and tender magic you do
Mister Wonderful, that's you.

Why this trembling when you speak
Why this joy when you touch my cheek?
I must tell you what my heart knows is true
Mister Wonderful, that's you.

And why this longing to know your charms
To spend forever here in your arms

Oh there's much more I could say
But the words keep slipping away

Got a hitch as far as San Jose
Rode aboard a Greyhound till I run out of dough
Bid the bus good-bye at Monterrey...
But I see a lot of things along the way
And I did a lot of thinkin on the way.

Looking pretty as a Christmas tree
And I said to myself,
As I rode by myself
Everybody's got a home but me.

To be free in the way I wanna be.

That summer kind of weather
When people get together and sing

It's the time of year
The stars seem to dance with laughter
And the moon's so big and ripe
It can hardly climb

So, why don't you meander
To your best gal's veranda
And sorta, kinda, hand her the ring?

For it's the sweetheart kissin' season
And all the world's in rhyme
When it's watermelon sweet love tellin' time

This is the time to sing this kind of purdy little ditty
A walkin' along an' singin' a song and clinging to someone purdy
The type of a tune to go with the moon
That's sailin' along a way on high

After strollin' a while, for maybe a mile
Remember to stop and pop the question
If your timin' is right, your future is bright
As bright as a watermelon sky

And then when you found a bench for two
You found your cue to linger
The chance you sought to show what you bought
You happily thought to bring her

To cinch the thing, you give her the ring
You purchased from the five and dime

Take her in your arms and whisper
That you are mine all mine
And with that line to sell, I'm here to tell
That you'll do well in watermelon time

I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.

His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.

So you lost your gal, it's happened many times before,
So you sit and mope like a dope, what's that good for,
Get a hold of yourself, forget her, you lived long before you met her.
There're lots of other girls, so I say,
Don't cry, Joe, let her go, let her go, let her go.
Don't cry, Joe, let her go, let her go, let her go.

The changing light
And changing shade
Happiness that must die
Melodies that must fly
Memories that must fade
Dusty and forgotten by and by

I'll see you again
When ever spring breaks through again
Time may lie heavy, between
But what has been
is past forgetting
This sweet memory
Across the years
Will come to me
Though my world may go awry
In my heart will ever lie
Just an echo of a sigh

Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it

Hugo Winterhalter and His Orchestra And Chorus,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.

Hugo Winterhalter and His Orchestra And Chorus,"Darling, I'm so blue without you
I think about you the live-long day
When you ask me if I'm lonely
Then I only have this to say

You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
A million or more times?

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

You'll never know just how much I miss you

Until the dawn strolls in with the day

I'll get a ring when I choose to

I'll keep each wiley wolf in his place

Along the path that is primrose

I will kiss anybody will kiss me first

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost herd in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' flame an' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name

""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""

Elle était si jolie des jonquilles aux derniers lilas.
Dans la ferme endormie, chaque fois que j'allais la voir,
Son père avec un fusil m'attendait derrière l'abreuvoir.
Il me chassa aux premières jonquilles,
Me fusilla des jonquilles aux derniers lilas.

Un jour, dans la grange aux loups, aux premières jonquilles,
Elle sauta sur mes genoux des jonquilles aux derniers lilas.
Une fourche me piqua, je me relevai en hurlant.
J'eus beau fuir à travers bois, son pèr' me jeta dans l'étang.
Il me piqua aux premières jonquilles
Et me fourcha des jonquilles aux derniers lilas.

Dans le grenier, sur le foin, aux premières jonquilles,
Pris sa fille et bus son vin des jonquilles aux derniers lilas.
Son pèr' voyant le tableau, me fit connaître un peu plus tard
Les grenouilles et les crapauds au fond de la mare aux canards.
Il m'injuria aux premières jonquilles
Et me noya des jonquilles aux derniers lilas.

J'ai connu le sel et le plomb aux premières jonquilles.
J'ai connu l'auge à cochon des jonquilles aux derniers lilas.
J'ai laissé mes amours là, mille fois j'ai frôlé la mort.

Where the cold winds blow
Well the liquor tasted good
And the women were all fast
There she goes my friend
Oh she's rolling now at last

Here the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound
High above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time

It's no earthly good to me

Hugues Aufray,"Viens
Ce soir
Seule dans ma chambre
Viens
Mon âme
Viens t'étendre près de moi

Viens, c'est l'heure, rien qui nous gêne
Rien ne peut s'opposer à notre amour

Nous avions vingt ans et nos corps attirés l'un vers l'autre
Tremblaient de fièvre et nos désirs ne savaient comment s'exprimer

Nous avions vingt ans et chacun, nous vivions notre rêve
Et dans ce rêve, il n'y avait que nos deux corps mêlés

Un feu doré dansait de joie dans l'ombre
Une fourrure blanche était devant le feu
Et toi, vêtue de tes longs cheveux sombres
Tu venais me rejoindre et tu fermais les yeux

Nous avions vingt ans
Notre sang nous chantait des folies
Et nous chantions au rythme fou de notre sang qui nous brûlait
Nous avions vingt ans
Nous venions de découvrir la vie
Et nous voulions mourir d'amour ou vivre en nous aimant

Vois
Le feu
Rêve et soupire
Rêve et joue avec les charbons qu'il mord
Vois
Le feu
Dort sur la braise
Dors, mon cœur, l'amour se fout de la mort",Nous Avions Vingt Ans,2005
Hugues Aufray,"J'étais debout seul près de la pierre
O? repose en paix mon frère
Dans l'ombre bleue d'un grand cyprès?s
Le vent du soir me chantait.

Notre monde c'est une chaîne
Un même espoir nous unit
Que jamais, Dieu ne se brise
Le grand cercle de la vie.

Quand j'ai vu tomber notre vieux ch?ne
Sous les coups du bûcheron
J'ai dit pardon mon pauvre chaîne
C'était pour bâtir ma maison.

Toi qui cherches dans ton brouillard
D’où tu viens et où tu vas
Ne cherche plus, tu t’égares
Tu es un univers rien qu'à toi.

Je suis le sud, je suis le nord,
Je suis le diamant et l'or
Je suis la vie, je suis la mort,
Je suis l'espace et le temps.",Le Grand Cercle de la Vie,2006

Je vais chanter, histoire de vous distraire

Je vais vous chanter, histoire de vous distraire

Un gros bœuf marchait sur une route verglacée
Un gros bœuf marchait sur une route verglacée
Il faisait si froid, c'est vrai
Que les cailloux en tremblaient
Un gros bœuf marchait sur une route verglacée

Il aperçoit en chemin, un petit oiseau
Il aperçoit en chemin, un petit oiseau
L'oiseau presque mort de froid n'avait plus de voix, ma foi
Il aperçoit en chemin, un petit oiseau

Il fit sur l'oiseau gelé, ce que vous pensez
Il fit sur l'oiseau gelé, ce que vous pensez
M'avez bien entendu, il lui fit caca dessus
Il fit sur l'oiseau gelé, ce que vous pensez

Avec ça maintenant, dit-il, il aura tout
Avec ça maintenant, dit-il, il aura tout
Un coin pour passer l'hivers, un bon gît et le couver
Avec ça maintenant, dit-il, il aura tout

Passant par là, un pauvre loup affamé
Passant par là, un pauvre loup affamé
Aperçoit notre moineau et le croc tout de go
Puis il passe son chemin, le ventre plein

La morale de cette histoire est à noter
La morale de cette histoire est à noter
C'est pas toujours nos ennemis
Qui dans le caca vous ont mit
Ni vos amis qui viendront vous en tirer

Je te raconterai l'histoire de ce roi mort
De n'avoir pas pu te rencontrer

On a vu souvent 
Rejaillir le feu 
D'un ancien volcan 
Qu'on croyait trop vieux

C'est de port en port la fièvre de l'or
Et pire encore
A quoi sert encore de se taire

Hugues Aufray,"Après bien des années à courir l'univers
Trois savants cosmonautes revinrent sur la terre
Ils annoncèrent bientôt qu'ils avaient de leurs yeux 
Vu notre créateur, celui qu'on nomme Dieu 

Le monde chaviré attendait plein d'espoir 
La fusée des savants qui bouleversait l'histoire 
Des quatre coins du monde, les grands théologiens 
Vinrent se rassembler pour attendre en lieu saint 

On voulut conserver à cette réunion
Une vraie neutralité pour toutes les religion 
Et on choisit une île au bout du Pacifique 
Que l'on avait soustraite aux essais atomiques 

On pouvait voir le Pape, rêvant sous les palmiers 
Aux rythmes langoureux des douces vahinés 
Comme un simple touriste, un évêque anglican 
Se dorait au soleil sous son panama blanc 

Des juifs et des laïques qui faisaient les cents pas 
Au milieu des indiens, des russes et des chinois 
Et tout ce gentil monde dans un unique chœur 
Qui priait en secret que ce Dieu soit le leur 

Chaque seconde passait plus longue qu'une année 
Tous les peuples vibraient d'une même anxiété 
L'instant était venu où l'on saurait enfin 
Qui se cache là-haut derrière le mot divin 

Pour célébrer ce jour unique dans l'histoire
Y avait toutes les télés en couleur et en noir
À l'exception pourtant de notre ORTF 
Qui était tombée en panne le matin, enfin bref 

À 14h28, à l'instant annoncé
On vit du bout du ciel descendre la fusée 
Quelques instant plus tard, le saint hélicoptère 
Repérait la cabine ballottée par la mer 

On vit plonger bientôt les fameux hommes-grenouilles 
Qui évitent en principe que les savants se mouillent 
Je vous passe les détails de la cérémonie 
Et je reprends plus loin la suite de mon récit 

Dans un silence unique, le chef de la mission 
S'adressa en ces termes aux chefs de religions 
Messieurs, le monde est grand et l'erreur est humaine 
Ce que je vais dire va vous faire de la peine 

Car si un Dieu unique un jour nous a créé
Il n'est pas pour le moins comme vous l'imaginez 
Je me dois aujourd'hui de dire ce que j'ai vu 
À vous de décider si vous êtes déçus 

Car le Bon Dieu du ciel, maintenant, c'est certain
Est un être charmant de sexe féminin

Que c'est une jolie fille et qu'en plus, elle est Noire

Hugues Aufray,"Je me suis éveillé par un matin d'hiver 
Avec un mauvais rêve tout au fond de la tête 
Éveillé un matin, dans le froid solitaire 
Avec un vieux bourdon qui cognait dans ma tête 
Le soleil était mort et le plafond si bas 
J'ai dit, mon vieux, ça y est, mes batteries sont à plat

Je me suis fait du café, j'ai pris une douche glacée
J'avais pas très bonne mine avec mon teint fané
Tout nu devant la glace, j'étais pas fier à voir 
Les yeux cernés et une gueule de brouillard
J'ai ouvert la fenêtre pour respirer un coup 
Mais ça n'a pas raté, je ne valais pas un clou

J'ai fouillé dans la chambre pour trouver l'aspirine
J'avais, n'en doutons pas, le destin à l'envers
Car j'ai mis tout en l'air, y compris la cuisine
Mais y a rien eu à faire, pas un Alka-Seltzer
Je me suis dit, ça va, pas la peine d'insister
Tu vas resté couché, ton starter est bloqué

À cet instant précis, on sonne au téléphone
Je dis, tiens, c'est bizarre, je n'attends personne
Je décroche l'appareil, c'était les pTT
On vous reprend la ligne, vous n'avez pas payé
Je crie, non, attendez, je vous envoie un chèque
Mais la fille n'attend pas et raccroche d'un ton sec

Finalement, je décide de prendre un bon bain chaud
Et je plonge tout entier dans la douceur de l'eau
Je m'étire, je m'allonge, je m'étends, je relaxe
Je frotte au gant de crin les cuisses et le thorax
Je savonne le plexus, des pieds jusqu'à l'aorte
Lorsque j'entends, c'est net, quelqu'un frappe à ma porte

Dégoulinant d'eau, j'attrape une vieille serviette
Je cours jusqu'à ma porte, j'esquinte toute la moquette
Je demande, qui est là? Une belle voix me répond
Police, monsieur, ouvrez, pas d'histoire, mon garçon
Et j'me r'trouve nez à nez devant un mec charmant
Inspecteur Mamadou, brigade des stupéfiants

Habillez-vous vite fait et suivez-moi, jeune homme
Votre dossier est prêt, on n'attends plus que vous
Inconsciemment j'm'habille, puis j'obtempère en somme
Sans poser de questions, j'avais les genoux trop mous
Je descends l'escalier comme un vieil automate
Et je me r'trouve au panier comme une pauvre tomate 

Le fourgon prend d'assaut les rues encombrées
C'est vraiment Chicago, un film série-B
La sirène hurle à mort, on brûle tous les feux rouges
Et moi, sur la banquette avec le foie qui bouge
Au croisement des carrefours, ça, c'était à prévoir
Un mec débouche à droite et nous rentre dans l'cigare

J'me r'trouve le nez en l'air faisant le grand écart
Une ambulance arrive, j'ai pas le temps de dire ouf
Me v'là à l'hôpital à poil sur un brancard
Finalement, ça vaut mieux que de finir aux gnoufs
Un chirurgien s'amène et dit, ca va, mon vieux?
C'est une mauvaise fracture, mais je me sers de vous mieux

On m'file sur la figure un masque un caoutchouc
J'inspire, je prends mon pieds, je vais tomber dans les choux
Quand soudain tout s'éteint, plus un seul kilowatt
L'EDFf Est en grève et moi dans les patates
Le groupe électrogène n'a pas dû fonctionner
Et je me r'trouve dans le coaltar et complètement gelé

Les événements s'enchaînent, la grève est nationale
Ca fait déjà un mois que je crèche à l'hôpital
Les syndicats s'excitent, ils sont prêts à se battre
J'écoute mon transistor, ma guibolle dans le plâtre
La crise est dure, cette fois, faut pas s'faire d'illusion
On parle de guerre civile, oui, de révolution

Mais les choses se compliquent, ça devait arriver
Un matin de printemps, des chars viennent stationner
Sur les passages cloutés au trottoirs du lido
Ah non, ça, je vous jure, on n'a vraiment pas de pot
Devant la situation, les puissances interviennent
Vous devinez ce qui arrive, ou bien c'est pas la peine 

Cette fois, tout est fini, on va venir me chercher
Les trois-quarts de la terre, ils sont déjà passés 
Moi qui ne fumait plus, je m'accorde une cigarette
Ca y est, je vais craquer, la dernière allumette 
Et c'est l'instant fatal, l'explosion atomique
Qui me sort brutalement de mon rêve homérique

Voilà, j'avais rêvé, vous m'avez compris
Mamadou, pTT, rien qu'un cauchemar, pardi
Mais soyez pas naïf parce que ce n'est pas comique
Pas drôle l'inquisition, pas drôle l'ange atomique
Je veux crier tout haut et ça, vaille que vaille

Huh Hah Dschinghis Khan,"Jeder wollt sie zur Frau
Doch ihr Herz war nicht mehr frei
Denn sie hat nur einen geliebt
Doch der zog in den Krieg
Und er kehrte nicht mehr heim -
Es gab nichts mehr was ihr noch blieb.

Wo der Rhein am tiefsten war.
Und dort sang sie ihr Lied
Und wer hörte wie sie sang
Der vergaß dabei die Gefahr.

Und ihr Lied klang so süß
Wie ein längst vergeßner Traum
Schon von weitem hörte man sie.
Und die Fischer I'm Boot
Fuhrn vorbei I'm Morgengraun
Und ihr Bild vergaßen sie nie.
Und so manches Boot zerbrach am schroffen Stein
Weil die Männer sie nur sahn.
Doch sie schaute bloß weg
Wenn der Strudel sie verschlang -
Ihr hat keiner leid getan.

Und ein Prinz hörte auch
Von der schönen Loreley
Und er schwor sich
Sie wird bald mein.

Wer glaubt an Zauberei.

Huh Hah Dschinghis Khan,"The boy was asleep in his parents' cabana 
He woke to the thunder of guns in the night 
And there in the dark he saw three Mexicanos 
His father was shouting, ""Boy run for your life!"" 
He prayed and he wept at the sight that he saw 
His mama and papa lay dead on the floor 
They laughed as he ran and they rode on their way 
But how will it be if they see him today 

Oh, Pistolero 
Like an angel of death, you go 
Desperado from Mexico 
Never more will he run 
Oh, Pistolero 
Riding up through the wind and rain 
With revenge burning in your brain 
And your hand on your gun 

A quiet little village was just south of Reno 
Where someone had told him he might find the men 
And there in the stairway, they're guzzling the vino 
The three Mexicanos were laughing again 
He pushed his sombrero away from his face 
His cool cigarillo was pounding in place 
The Mexicans stared at the man they can see 
And wondered who this Pistolero could be 

Oh, Pistolero 
Like an angel of death, you go 
Desperado from Mexico 
Never more will he run 
Oh, Pistolero 
Riding up through the wind and rain 
With revenge burning in your brain

And the devil's what you see 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooohhh

Death will be your compaÃ±ero 
While you follow your dream 

He looked with contempt at the cowardly killers 
His eyes were as cold as the hate in his heart 
""Get ready to fire and viya con dios."" 
He lowered the hand that would blow them apart 
Then suddenly somewhere, the voice of his father 
Was shouting, ""Forgive them and put down your gun!"" 
He knew in his heart that the madness was over 
He climbed on his horse and rode into the sun 

Oh, Pistolero 
Like an angel of death, you go 
Desperado from Mexico 
Never more will he run

clearly we will have to turn and come home soon

with her loving face in the snow

Recognize the price they'll pay in their lifetime

Get what you deserve and maybe what you need

I can shatter my mind and hide what I feel
It's not the the right way to loose myself

Can't break my poor heart before it heals inside

That night the stars shot madly from
Their spheres and we're raging like a violent storm

Within moonshine we left to bury the dead
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve

The pestilence has taken our eyesight
And our graves are gaping wide
Everyone sets forth his dying sprite
And the church way paths to glide
Through dead bodies - nor rich or poor
Anymore with stolen pride

Under black age toil our sweat runs bold
Let the pestilence resolve our end
We won't leave our fathers land
We won't learn trial patience for a customary cross

A wicked day, indeed
'Cause sweat and blood abounded

See the daylight lay in ashes 
While the dead are still
Hear the armies roar for freedom 
On the blackened border hill

The Lion looks, looks across the plain 
And questions battles in avoidable pain
Heaves a wistful sigh 
And wishes the battle, the battle was a lie

Army of some thousand fighting 
Men climbed the frowning ridge
With their flaming swords all drawn free 
And their pennants at the knee

Their waving of their banners 
And the rattle of their spears
Risen to break the dominion 
And bring peace for years

Now at least I've come to see what my life is 
Nothing's ended, it only begun
And the brave victories that seemed so splendid 
They were never, never really won

There's not a single day that you fall from my mind
I keep the perfect facade 
Nobody knows how I burn deep inside 


I know 
I'm missing you 
I know it's true

Since you went away 
There's just nothing to compare

But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye.
Think about stepping on the town for a while
But money's low and my suit's out of style,

But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true.
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.

She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say,
I guess her folks brought her up that way,
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids.
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy,

No football hero or smooth Don Juan,
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son.
Can't give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never, never make my baby cry,

And it's all right, what I can't do,
Out of sight because my heart is true,
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, way out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, way out of sight.
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, way out of sight.
Baby, yeah, uptight,

Human Nature,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.

I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.

Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before

These are the places where I can feel torn from my body
My flesh, it peels during this ride we can cut upwhat we like
I'm about to break
Waiting alone, I cannot resist
Feeling this hate, I have never missed
Please, someone, give me a reason to rip off my face

Trying to run up in my life, and tell me what to do
You need to arrest your son, because he's selling pounds of weed
He's getting over on you, and you're stupid enough not to see

You ask, how much money have I spent buying weed?
Not at much as I spend on important legal fees
You wouldn't believe how much it costs to be free
A couple of G's every time they find a roach on me
Shit, I never learn, the lesson they teach
Do the robot (??) When they pull the gun and say ""freeze""
Get off these, you're the one being thieves
Take away my rights and detach my salaries

While it grows on a branch, holding a gun in yo' hand?

Smoking a plant? You're out your fuckin' mind

Humble Pie,"Thinking of the past I feel my life
Is slipping by at such a speed
Things I knew have gone and those I loved
I look for granted and deceived

Call me anything you will
I'll hide behind a purple pill
And though it seems I'm laughing still
I'm crying

Looking from my window I see winter
Almost too bare to believe
People change with seasons
And I wonder if it's my turn to receive

But they avoid the things I ask
Or quickly change their style of mask
The faith I had is fading fast
I'm dying

Seems to me the only way to be
Is like a businessman
And have bad colours round my head
Getting drunk to find some peace of mind and consolation
But there's still the problem of what happens when I'm dead",What You Will,1969

Oh, Buttermilk Boy better gain some pounds
Before she lets her knickers down
She wants a musclely man all gristle and bone
Makes no difference how you strive
She couldn't care if you were dead or alive
A burly, beefy, strong arm man
Is all she cares to meet

Yes, she spent her teens?

Oh, Buttermilk Boy better gain some pounds
Before she lets her knick, knick, knick, knickers down
She wants a musclely man all gristle and bone

Is all she cares to make

So let me put you straight, yeah

Yep, she weighs two hundred pounds its said

Farmer, farmer plough the field
Harvest, harvest all you can
A corn field smells so sweet
A pinprick makes no pain

But to follow the weaver of dreams
Behind the sun that knows, it seems that
I'm foresworn--a naked troubadour

I sit at court and I sing
To the Princess of Beauty and Light
She favours me though I'm merely
A minstrel of the night

There on my right
Sits the King with his clowns
He pays to laugh
While his queen lives on downs
And the smile on his brow is the crown

Morning bird sing, fill my ears
With the joy of our sorrow unmasked
Lend me your wings for the sunrays of dawn
Are here to last

He'd been itchin' just to bust for weeks

I try to find my black and tan
I looked on every corner
It was-a itchin' on another man

I reached into my pocket
I try to find myself some beer
""You can take my bread
Or sleep in my bed

Wears hairnets in her armpits and her breath is rank

Humble Pie,"Well, I was on my way home
From Woodgrain station
He stopped me in the middle of the road
He was a big black dog, whinin' along
He said, ""You better do what you told""

I jumped back, rather astounded
I never heard a dog could speak
But my mouth went dry
When he looked me in the eye
He'd been itchin' just to bust for weeks

I said, ""Hey, won't you scratch my back?
Hey babe, scratch my back""
Ooh I said, ""Hey, won't you scratch my back?""

Well we were standing alone on the eastside
When she give-a me a smile
She said, ""I like it here, watchin' what goes by""
And I don't doubt question why

I said, ""Hey, what's that comin'
Starin' with that evil eye?""
""Well, there's a sweet honey child
Comin' over here and she
Looks just about my size""

I said, ""Hey, won't you scratch my back?
Hey babe, scratch my back""
Ooh I said, ""Hey, won't you scratch my back?""

Through the streets of Memphis
I try to find my black and tan
I looked on every corner
It was-a itchin' on another man

I reached into my pocket
I try to find myself some beer
""You can take my bread
Or sleep in my bed
But darlin', please stay right here""

I said, ""Hey, won't you scratch my back?
Hey babe, scratch my back""

'Cause they'll never ever find me 'neath the coconut tree.

I left home because of my nagging wife
Man oh man it was a terrible life
She took all my money and she left me with none
So I packed my bags and decided to run.

Humildes de Rudy Flores,"Si alguno de los presentes
Tiene un impedimento para esta boda
Que lo diga hoy o que calle para siempre

La iglesia estaba toda iluminada
Mucha gente fue invitada yo también estaba
Hay nadie sabe la tristeza que sentía
Porque justo en ese día se casaba mi querer

Ella llego acompañada del padrino
La llevaba a su destino que nunca imagino
Por un momento tuve toda la ilusión
De que en aquel anillo yo le daba el corazón

A la salida de la iglesia engalanada
Ella estaba ya casada la mujer que yo adore
Entre vivas de parientes y de amigos
Me acerque para desearle fuese siempre muy feliz

Pero resulta que ella no se imaginaba
Encontrarme cara a cara y no supo que decir
Se fue llorando sin pensar que con su llanto
Su vestido iba mojando al llorar sólo por mí

Pero resulta que ella no se imaginaba
Encontrarme cara a cara y no supo que decir
Se fue llorando sin pensar que con su llanto
Su vestido iba mojando al llorar sólo por mí

Humpty Hump,"(Humpty Hump)

Good googily goo

Look what the cat dragged in

The mack's back in, we snap-crack in

We got the jokes for you

Uh, look who the Hump bumped into

The old one-two, rhyme sayer, the paper maker

Biz lay the vapours



(Biz Markie)

I'm the vapour sprayer for the himilayas

The M-iza A-ya are-iza K-aya

I'm the mayor

Leavin' emcees in a ditch



(Humpty Hump)
So get ready, we 'bout to start a fight in this bitch




(Biz Markie)

Humpty dumpty had a fight with his moms

He broke both her legs and both of her arms
Tidy Bowl Man tried to throw a fit


I told his punk ass he was full of Shhhh...



(Humpty Hump)

Shut your mouth biz


See you're allways trying to take it further
I heard you bit a burger, with a funky worm in it

well you had to play stupid 'cause you didn't clear the sample

and lordy lord, got you pushing hot dogs



(Biz Markie)

Tupac was the only one that was living large

And Humpty your nose is a two-car garage

I know you got sooooul

I heard you don't eat pussy you be eatin' booty hole




(Humpty Hump)
No my nose be in the booty, my tongue be in her vertical smile

I heard your sister had sex with Colin Powell



(Biz Markie)


Your moms don't brush her teeth
I heard her breath was strong



(Humpty Hump)

Yo you wrong



(Both)

Why can't we just get along?




Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends
Why can't we just get along?

Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends

The odd couple



(Biz Markie)

The city so nice, they had to name it twice

New York, New York, the land of lights

We got the fashion, the widget, the project ditches

The Apollo, the Broadway, The Garden, the Pictures



(Humpty Hump)

So? We got the palm trees, Gs being Hollywood swingin' large

Cars around the block with the stars on the sidewalk

Every stop lights a show case, not lexuses

Brothers in Hummers following other friends in Benzesus



(Biz Markie)

Ya, that's cool, y'all doin' your thing

But look what they did to that man Rodney King

They beat him, and stomped him, like a bunch of grapes



when I seen him he looked like the Planet of the Apes

(Humpty Hump)

Ya you right, police don't act tight but in the riots yo

California niggas wasn't scared to go

at poh poh




(Biz Markie)
So yo, I'll take you down like Mavis

Every Burrough is Thurough, don't forget Larry Davis


(Both, trading lines, Humpty is first)


We got Dre and Quincy Jones, homes



Primo and Puff, Hump



Easy E and Tupac nigga



Scott La Rock and Biggie nigga



Compton



Bronx



Oakland



Brooklyn Bridge



Golden Gate, plus Huey Newton



Malcom X




You got rats


Earth quakes




Well at least you'll never catch me wearing wigs in my videos


Oh, you don't have to go there, with your big, plastic nose



What about your big ass head?



What about your buck ass teeth?



Your moms so black, I looked at her and thought that I was asleep



Your nasty ass moms gave me ear infection over the phone



Come on man, why we can't get along?



Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends

Why can't we just get along?

Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends

To blow them out

Yesterday was your birthday
Happy birthday

200 candles, a liar, a scandal, a fire
through the roof, when I called you

Were you there? Were you there?
Were you ever alive?

Hundredth,"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real

The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair

Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way",Hurt,2011

Through the empty shell that we once called a home 
You weren't here but I traveled with you 
I wasn't there but I was always in your heart 
Now I find i'm still alone 

my love you can go 
My love into the light sweet alfred 

when I realized you weren't returning 
I grew so sad that I forgot about myself 
Fighting sickness to the point of dying 
Never realizing what I had become 
A faded thought that keeps on living 

my love you can go 
My love into the light sweet alfred 

my love you can go 
My love into the light sweet alfred 

when they sent me home they didn't listen 
To your cries for help to find me again 
Contemplating all the fright and terror 
Left behind but not forgotten in my mind 
Follow me and you'll find home

There's no release for the brand on your soul

You messed around with things
You don't understand

Her face is shining when you close your eyes

Won't hurt me for too long
I'll be fine on my own
It'll take some time, but I know that I
I can find where I belong
And I'll find it in a song

There's songs about freedom searching for new love
How ignorance is bliss
Yeah I know that I'm not the only fool
Who's been hurt just like this
Yeah songs about making honest mistakes
And heartaches I've gone through
Yeah, then I'll forgive
I won't have to forget  all the good things about you

It's alright,
Yeah it's goodbye
Won't hurt me for too long
I'll be fine on my own
It'll take some time, but I know that I
I can find where I belong and I'll find it in a song

Oh, oh

Though I'm sure if I had the chance to go back
I'd change more than I should
But knowing I can't is helping my chances
Of moving on for good
Now I'm not saying there won't be too many lonely nights
If the songs I choose getting over you
Help me make it out alive

Ey, it's alright
It's goodbye
It won't hurt me for too long
I can make it on my own
It'll take some time, but I know that I
I can find where I belong

My bags were packed from the day I was born
I knew there was something I was living for
I found my place in a runaway car and I never looked back
Never looked back
I never was much for falling in line
I had a long time fire in this heart of mine
I may look crazy in mama's eyes, but I don't mind

It could be a dead end road
And I could be chasing down a broken dream
But I don't even know
Just to where this thing is gonna lead
It's a mystery
Oh and ain't life a trip, no it don't get better than this
No it don't get better than this

Well I kinda like it when I walk out the door
Not knowing what the good Lord got in store
There's a freedom in believing, there's something more
And one more chance, one more day
To say what I need to say

Could be a dead end road
And I could be chasing down a broken dream
But I don't even know
Just to where this thing is gonna lead
It's a mystery
Oh and ain't life a trip, no it don't get better than this

Getting by and just a little sleep and coffee cups
Learning through the down, living for the ups
All I know is that I feel alive and it's a real good ride

Could be a dead end road
But it's the only life I've ever known

And no matter where this goes
You know I wouldn't change a single thing
But I don't even know
Just where this thing is gonna lead
It's a mystery oh and ain't life a trip

In an empty field
Where nobody goes
Had all the curtains drawn,
Sitting all alone
Feeling like a ghost

I was a broke down heartbreak, badly in need
Of a little of love's electricity

A busted carnival ride,
In the middle of the night,
Then you flipped the switch.
You turned on the show

You light me up
Like the fireworks flying on the 4th of July
Yeah you light me up,
Like the sunshine blazing in the summertime
Oh, every time you light me up
Baby you light me up

You were the missing piece,
To my broken dreams, you're bringing me back to life
You look like a movie star,
Just the way you are, makes me burn inside

Yeah, it's dynamite, finally finding a match

You light me up

She rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress hotter than the heat in July
With her wind blown hair it just wasn't fair the way she was blowing my mind

She's the cat fight kind keeps you up at night hanging on to the edge of a kiss
She's a beautiful mess, yeah the kind you love to love
But what happens next,
I got a feeling when the sun comes up

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up, little leap-way, little more time

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

Ain't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels somewhere between going and gone
You get so lost that you can't turn it off, you give in and you just turn it on

What a beautiful mess,
A one part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck

We wouldn't have to stare

The blood that runs inside of me

I know you understand
That there's no map for this, no plan

And the way we say goodbye
Is not that way that anyone would do

I guess you're free, if it's just me

If it's just me

If it's just me,
One shadow on the wall on a coffee cup
Then it's just me,
And a picture hanging I can't let go of
And if it was just me,
Why didn't I know you needed me to keep my big mouth shut?
Yeah, cause when it come down to it, you know

I'll take the blame, take the shame, walk away, no questions asked
Leave the best of me with you and you can leave me in your past
No battle cry, no battle scars
We're only down one broken heart

I've got no problem holding on
I've got no problem being wrong

Well, it's just me

I'll take a walk, clear my thoughts, move along, no questions asked
Take whatever's left of me and leave you in my past

If this is really it, this is starting over
There's no should've, could've, would've said this,
Done that, no turning back, no more I wonders
No harm done, no hard feelings,
Maybe some other time but gives me some peace of mind
If that was the end of the ride, I'm getting back in line

'Cause I'm telling you
There's nothing like starting over,
There's nothing like shedding a heartache,
Writing a new page to say what you wanna say
There's nothing like a heart wide open,
That bittersweet comfort of knowing
You can let go and take the weight off your shoulders
There's nothing like starting over,
There's nothing like starting over

Love's got a way of letting you know
When the time to hold on or time to let go, tells you so
It's the cold in the kiss, of looking away,
The say what you mean, well do you mean what you say?
I don't really know
It's time to reset, rethink, reposition,
There's nothing wrong with me, it's just a condition
It's the science of love, fly when we fall, through it all,
We turn with the tide, 'cause we're free on the other side

There's nothing like starting over,
There's nothing like shedding a heartache,
Writing a new page to say what you wanna say
There's nothing like a heart wide open,
That bittersweet comfort of knowing you
You can let go and take the weight off your shoulders
There's nothing like starting over,
There's nothing like starting over, starting over

Yeah

One is a lonely number,
It kind of makes you wonder
How starting back at zero can feel so nice,
But it feels just right

'Cause there just ain't nothing like,
There's nothing like starting over,
There's nothing like shedding a heartache,
Writing a new page to say what you wanna say

It’s the only time I’ve ever felt like this this

I still reach for your hand because I need it
And your kiss is still the spark that lights a fire

Man's clouded sun shall brightly rise
And songs be heard instead of sighs
