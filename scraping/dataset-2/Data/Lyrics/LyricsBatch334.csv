A store wants
Hits of fire
Dripping from your eyes

And looking for
The sorcerer's creation
And this door
Won't let you out
Won't let me in
And now where fast cars are gone
Along with the girls

But we all go to see them

Wisdom of voice
Of bridges

A blanket of seeds
An hour of wind
Sits in silence

The war postponed
Pesticides who kills
Knows the will of confusion
Shadows melt in the high temples

As those who fed by the luck of travelers
Knowing the halfway point
To the new millennium
Commanding wheels

Return vision
It's final decision
It's halfway there to the final millennium",Tenth Century,2017
Guided by Voices,"At the age of birth they learn to talk
At the age of death
They learn to listen

And they raise their eyes
And I know they turn to run

Man trembles and feels the vibrations
It's what they seek today

And they fall silent and say
Hello I've been here",They Fall Silent,2017

Side by side we dip bend and climb
Flying through the air so free
Feel them left behind below us
Flying through the air
Mad old you and me
We are going at just for kicks for kicks you'll see
That they'll wish they were you
Right along here with me
You and me.
Climbing through the sky
Leaving all our thoughts far away
CIimbing feel the stars up here
Touch your eyes and fall beside you
Side by side we soar
Me and you just glide
We are gaming in a fall a fall a fall we feel
But it's all in your mind
As we turn round and climb
Right back here.

Guido Basso,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots & Moonbeams,

This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams

One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally

Guido Basso,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true

Come questa sera
Mentre tu

Qualche coperta in più
Perché se no, se no avrò freddo
Senza averti sempre
Senza averti sempre addosso
E sarà triste lo so
Ma la tristezza però
Si può racchiudere 
Dentro una canzone
Che canterò
Ogni volta che avrò voglia
Di parlarti 
Di vederti
Di toccarti
Di sentirti ancora mia

È stato splendido però

E senza averti sempre addosso

Magari per la strada
Magari proprio sotto casa tua

Ma guarda il caso però
Guarda il destino splendido e crudele

Così importante""

È andata a casa con il negro, la troia
Mi son distratto un'attimo
Colpa di Alfredo 
Che con suoi discorsi seri e inopportuni 
Mi fa sciupare tutte le occasioni 
E prima o poi lo uccido, lo uccido
E lei invece non ha perso tempo 
Ha preso subito la palla al balzo 
L'ho vista uscire, mano nella mano, con quell'africano 
Che non parla neanche bene l'italiano, ma si vede che 
Si fa capire bene quando vuole
Tutte le sere ne accompagna a casa una diversa 
Chissà che cosa gli racconta 
Per me è la macchina che c'ha che conta

E quella stronza non si è neanche preoccupata 
Di dirmi almeno qualche cosa, che so, una scusa
E si era già dimenticata 
Di quello che mi aveva detto prima
""Mi puoi portare a casa questa sera? 
Abito fuori Modena, Modena park""
Ti porterei anche in America

E mi ero già montato la testa

Sempre diverso, sempre ogni mattina

Al mio fegato, fegato spappolato
Fegato, fegato, fegato spappolato 

Dice mia madre devi andare dal dottore 
A farti guardare, a farti visitare 
Hai una faccia che fa schifo, guarda come sei ridotto
Mi sa tanto che finisci male 
La guardo negli occhi, con un sorriso strano 
Eppure la vedo, forse ha ragione davvero 

Ma fuori c'è la festa del paese 
Vado a fare un giro
Non l'ho neanche detto
Che già mia madre che mi corre dietro con il vestito nuovo
La fuga è veloce mi metto le scarpe che sono già in strada
Che bella giornata, non bado alla gente che guarda sconvolta
Ormai ci sono abituato, sono vaccinato
Sono controllato
Si pensa ormai addirittura in giro
È chiaro che sono drogato

La festa ha sempre il solito sapore
Il gusto di campane, non è neanche male 
C'è chi va a messa e c'è chi pensa di fumare 
Come aperitivo prima di mangiare
Fini s'è alzato da poco, e non è ancora sveglio
Non è ancora sveglio, ed è talmente scazzato
Che non riesce a parlare nemmeno

La sera che arriva non è mai diversa dalla sera prima
La gente che affoga nell'unica sala, la discoteca
Ci vuol qualcosa per tenersi a galla sopra questa merda 
Sopra questa merda 
E non m'importa se domani 
Mi dovrò svegliare con quel gusto in bocca, gusto in bocca
Gusto in bocca
Gusto in bocca

Ascoltando qualcosa che non sai neanche tu

I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,

When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

Guillaume Depardieu,"Mon amour, ma bien-aimée, 
Me voici trop loin de toi
Comment survivre éloigné 
De ton cœur et de tes bras
De mon cœur et de mes bras 
Tiens, je l’avais oubliée 
Cette lettre et qui ma foi, 
Peut me l’avoir envoyée? 

Si tu savais quel ennui 
Loin de nos jeux amoureux 
Est-ce André ou est-ce Henri
Est-ce Paul aux si beaux yeux? 
Rien ne distrait la folie 
Qui m’entoure mais rien ne peut 
Détourner mon cœur épris 
Non ça ne peut être lui…

Mon amour, mon feu ma joie
Je reviendrai sois en sûre 
Vrai c’est la première fois 
Que je vois cette écriture
Ton portrait posé sur moi
Me protège et me rassure 
Cette lettre entre mes doigts 
Serait-elle une imposture? 

Oui l’enfer est de ce monde 
Mais le pire est de compter 
Ces heures ces jours ces secondes 
Qui nous tiennent séparés 
J´ai beau chercher dans la ronde 
De mes amoureux passés 
Dans quelle amnésie profonde 
Cet amant-là s’est noyé 

Mon amour ma toute belle
Je t’aime et je t’aime tant 
Il n’y a rien d’éternel
Rien qui ne résiste au Temps 
Un baiser sur ta prunelle
Sur ta bouche tout autant 
Rien qui ne résiste au Temps 
Et la mémoire est cruelle… 

Mais adieu ma vie mon cœur
Il faut bien que je m’en aille 
On m’appelle il est six heures 
A demain vaille que vaille
A moins que ton artilleur 
N’ait pour seules funérailles 
Que les tranchées et la peur
Le vacarme et la mitraille 

Sur ces pages abîmées 
Il manque l’ultime morsure
La certitude affirmée 
D´une simple signature
Mon amour si d’aventure 
Au front je devais tomber
Je voudrais que tu me jures 
De ne jamais m’oublier 

Je voudrais que tu me jures 
De ne jamais m’oublier",Une Lettre Oubliée,2005

And the stream never stopped, 'cause nobody lied

I lost my name in a war
I should have told you before

I saw my lines, fly’s on zebra’s backs

Oh, they're such pretty things they're so cute

I had resigned itself, tonight
So I threw it out a fishing line and said
""Catch your will and then catch mine""

You got me off the paper-round,
Just sprang out of the air.
The best things come from nowhere,
I love you I don't think you care.

I love you through sparks and shining dragons, I do,
And the symmetry in your northern grin.
I love you through sparks and shining dragons, I do,
I can see myself in the refill litterbin.

Guillemots,"This is where we fall from the trees
This is where the sky comes up
[Incomprehensible] joy
You made a man out of me

This is where the glass leaves the lens
Splinterin' a chemistry of friends
I'll treasure you always

You know, I love you
You know, I love you
You know, I love you

This is where we wake in the ditch
This is where our bodies sing no more
For the apples on the floor
Pecked down by Redwings

Pour another whiskey out for me
It'll be the last bottle we share
Because I drift outta nowhere

Know that I loved you
Know that I loved you
Know that I loved you

But love was not enough to hold my grip
Can't you just feel my fingers slip
Into those oceans and the sky where people swim

Ocean and the sky callin' me in
Oceans and the sky, I tell myself
No, I'm not kiddin' anybody else

They know I'm leavin', yes, they know I'm leavin'
They know, they know they know
Know that I'm leaving, leavin', leavin'
They know that I'm leaving, yes, I know

So I'm leaving my best friend
Just for the hell of it
Just for the sake of it
How much I loved you
",Redwings,2006
Guillemots,"Sit down, my love of open spaces
And breathe, my love, it's all been spent
I'm going to tell you both a story
About some memories that I dreamt

See, I've lost love in many places
Not least the streets of Sao Paulo
And friends especially, I didn't make them
A ten floor window to her home

Sometimes I could cry for miles
Sometimes I could cry for miles
Sometimes I could cry for miles
But I don't

So hush the shadows in the oak tree
Be still, curl you on the moor
My heart has fallen by the wayside
I cannot claim her anymore

So don your duffel coats quite slowly
And this start to reset, adjourn
While on the streets of old Sao Paulo
I watch my baby being burned

Sometimes I could cry for miles
Sometimes I could cry for miles
Sometimes I could cry for miles
But I don't

Sometimes I could cry, die inside
Drop my bags and run for miles
And sometimes I could live my life
But I wont, but I won't

Have you ever been thrown across the water?
Have you ever been thrown across the water?
Have you ever been thrown across the water

Thrown across water, thrown across water
Thrown across water like a stone
Thrown across water, thrown across water
Thrown across water like a stone

Thrown across water, thrown across water
Thrown across water like a stone
Thrown across water, thrown across water
Thrown across water like a stone

Get me a doctor, get me a doctor
Who will get rid of my bones
Or get me a lover, get me a lover
Who will leave my head alone

Get me a soldier, get me a soldier
Who will fight me pointless war
Get me an exit, I need an exit
I need a window or a door

Thrown across water, thrown across water
Thrown across water like a stone

Ay, get me a lawyer, get me a lawyer
Who will sue the world for me
Get me a person, get me a person
Get me a person who isn't me

'Cause I'm getting tired, I'm getting tired
Of my stupid little face
I don't belong here, don't belong here
Don't belong in this horse race

Thrown across water, thrown across water
Thrown across water like a stone
Thrown across water, thrown across water
Thrown across water like a stone

Should I head north or south?

Tripping up the high road, tearing down the low
And I saw life chanting out the mantra
If you want it, let it go if you want it, so

Words can't express what it means
And yes, I believe you

And I felt love coming through my windowpane
Tripping up the high road, tearing down the low

Busquemos la razón
Por lo qué hoy tan solo hay dudas
En lugar de nuestro amor
Tratemos de poner cada cosa en su lugar, ah, ah

Ves que bueno es conversar
Poder al fin descifrar
Una simple confusión

Sé que dando un paso hacia atrás
Podremos reencontrar
Aquello que hasta ayer unió
Mis ansias y tu pasión

Por qué no esperas un momento
Busquemos la razón
Por la qué hoy tan sólo hay dudas
En lugar de nuestro amor
Tratemos de poner cada cosa en su lugar, ah, ah

Por qué no esperas un momento
Busquemos la razón
Por la qué hoy tan sólo hay dudas
En lugar de nuestro amor
Tratemos de poner cada cosa en su lugar, ah, ah

Ah, ah, ah, tratemos de poner
Cada cosa en su lugar, ah, ah

",Cada Cosa en Su Lugar,1996
Guillermo Davila,"Los amigos hablan de tu piel morena
Que cuando caminas hasta el sol se quema
De tus ojos negros, de mirada seria
De tus fantasías y de tu belleza

Las amigas dicen que estas cambiada
Que se ve tristeza en tu mirada
Que te quedas callada cuando me nombran
Eres sólo una sombra y te digo

Que no voy a mover un dedo
Tú te lo buscaste y te equivocaste
Y te digo que no voy a mover
Un dedo por tu maldito orgullo
Yo no quiero nada tuyo ni tu amor

Los amigos dicen que estas tan bella
Que cuando apareces no hay estrellas
Que te pasas bailando la noche entera
Y te tratan todos como a una princesa

Las amigas cuentan que estas más delgada
Y a veces lloras por casi nada
Que te molestas si no te complacen
Eres caprichosa y te digo

Que no voy a mover un dedo
Tú te lo buscaste y te equivocaste
Y te digo que no voy a mover
Un dedo por tu maldito orgullo
Yo no quiero nada tuyo ni tu amor

",No Voy a Mover un Dedo,1996
Guillermo Davila,"Me pongo a pintarte y no lo consigo
Después de estudiarte lentamente termino pensando
Que faltan sobre mi paleta colores intensos
Que reflejen tu rara belleza

No puedo captar tu sonrisa
Plasmar tu mirada
Porque poco a poco

Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti

Tú sigues viniendo y sigues posando
Con mucha paciencia
Porque siempre mi lienzo está en blanco

Las horas se pasan volando
Dispongo el trabajo adelantado
Para tu retrato

Sospecho que no tienes prisa
Y que te complace ver que poco a poco

Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti

Sospecho que no tienes prisa
Y que te complace ver que poco a poco

Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti

Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso en ti

Guillermo Davila,"Puede que un día nos crucemos los dos
Y comprobemos que nada era cierto
No me entendiste bien, tal vez surgió el error al decirme
Que aceptabas juego abierto

Que quede claro ya lo debes saber
Que no sirvo para estar cautivo
Nuestro mayor compromiso, fue no tener compromiso
Y dejar todo por cuenta de los impulsos del corazón

Nos quemamos en la misma llama
Navegamos en el mismo barco
Compartimos la misma cama
Y ya no cabemos en el mismo cuarto

Nos quemamos en la misma llama
Navegamos en el mismo barco
Compartimos la misma cama
Y ya no cabemos en el mismo cuarto

Que quede claro tú lo debes saber
Que no sirvo para estar cautivo
Nuestro mayor compromiso, fue no tener compromiso
Y dejar todo por cuenta de los impulsos del corazón

Nos quemamos en la misma llama
Navegamos en el mismo barco
Compartimos la misma cama
Y ya no cabemos en el mismo cuarto

Guillermo Davila,"Porque después de hacernos el amor
Me dejas una extraña sensación
Te beso y tú finges dormir

Normalmente te rendías sobre mí
Antes tú te desnudabas frente a mí
Ahora te cuidas y te encierras al vestir

Tesoro mío, sólo mío
Tesoro mío si supieras lo que digo
Me provoca abrazarte como antes
Y amarte como nunca
Y sentir que aun eres mía

Prefiero callar y no decirte
Qué, que volví a ver al hombre que tanto ame
Porque tuvo que aparecer él otra vez
Si contigo yo había conseguido la paz al fin

Tesoro mío sólo mío
Tesoro mío si supieras lo que digo
Me provoca que me abrases como antes
Y que me ames como nunca
Porque quiero ser sólo tuya

Tesoro mío, sólo mío
Tesoro mío, sólo mío, mío, mío

Me provoca abrazarte como antes
Ámame como nunca
No has hecho en tu vida

Tesoro mío, sólo mío
Tesoro mío

",Tesoro Mio,1996
Guillermo Davila,"He tratado de no pensar en ti 
como si nunca hubieras pasado por mi vida 
siguiendo los consejos de mis amigos 
mujeres, tragos y otras cosas mas 

Regreso de madrugada todos los dias 
y desde que entro en el ascensor 
no importa si estoy solo o acompanado 
me aprieta algo en el pecho, es la misma herida 

El problema es que te amo 
como nunca a nadie ame 
yo que siempre he dejado 
es porque nunca habia amado con un amor asi tan bravo 

Yo necesito mas de ti 
que del agua para vivir 
yo necesito mas de ti 
que del aire para respirar 
tu eres la vida de mi vida 

Yo necesito mas de ti 
que del sueno para dormir 
yo necesito mas de ti 
que cualquier cosa para vivir 
vida de mi vida... 

He tratado de no pensar en ti 
pero es igual que cerrar los ojos frente al sol 
su luz es tan fuerte como este amor 
que me atormenta hasta en la oscuridad 

El problema es que te amo 
como nunca a nadie ame 
yo que siempre he dejado 
es porque nunca habia amado con un amor asi tan bravo

Guillermo Fernandez,"Hoy me dices que te vas
Que te marchas de mi vida
Que es la única salida
Y Que te tengo que olvidar
Que me voy a acostumbrar
Que de amor nadie se muere
Y que la verdad no hiere
Que la tengo que aceptar
Que fácil es hablar así 
Que fácil es pensar por mí
Que fácil para quien va a partir

[Chorus: ]
Con el corazón en la mano
Hoy vengo a tu despedida
Te pido que te lo lleves
O quítale aquí la vida
Con el corazón en la mano 
Hoy vengo a tu despedida
Te vas cuando mas te quiero 
Como una desconocida

Que no estas para el amor
Que ser libre es importante
Que hay un mundo por delante
Y es mejor para los dos
Que me voy a acostumbrar
Que de amor nadie se muere 
Y que la verdad no hiere

Que estoy tan cambiao!

Me mira sin comprender
Me ve perdiendo el cartel
De guapo que ayer
Brillaba en la acción
No ven que estoy embretao
Vencido y maniao
En tu corazón

Te vi pasar tangueando, altanera
Con un compás tan hondo y sensual
Que no fue más que verte y perder
La fe, el coraje, el ansia'e guapear
No me has dejado ni el pucho en la oreja
De aquel pasao malevo y feroz
Ya no me falta pa completar
Más que ir a misa e hincarme a rezar

Ayer, de miedo a matar
En vez de pelear
Me puse a correr
Me vi en la sombra o finao
Pensé en no verte y temblé
Si yo, que nunca aflojé

Me encierro a llorar

Guillermo Gregorio,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",Chu's Spectre (Ghost of a Chance),1999
Guillermo Gregorio,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1999

J'peux pas raisonner mes frères ils ont vu la même merde
Longtemps j'ai critiqué mon père et j'ai bu la même bière
On n'est pas pire ou mieux qu'un autre, même les gens pieux ont fait des fautes
Y a qu'devant Dieu qu'on jugera tous les pêchés sur tes épaules

J'ai vite compris qu'ça rime avec le mal de vivre, clean

J'connais les squats bizarres où ça tape des cuites disons vices bidons,
Weed chichon même quand y a les shtars qui passent
Des délits et des crimes, des récits et des histoires
Qui sont racontées parce qu'y a des teci et des riches qui
Vivent sans la compassion bicrave et sensation
D'être une homme libre quand les flics font des rotations
Ils tournent plus que Stromae oui couz' il faut mailler
Dans nos HLM mec, c'est piquouse et faux-papiers
T'as qu'à demander au déclan qui se font té-cla bêtement
À cause de quelques clopes et des vêtements
Merde, fais-moi fumer sur ton joint d'beuf
Tout va vite on devient deuss, j'ai qu'une bite mais quinze teuchs
Tout gentil sous drogue, j'crois que je suis baisé
À chaque fois que j'ai pêché il y a eu anguille sous roche
Et toutes ces envies nous forcent à faire des trucs illégaux
Oui, les gars illico sur le té-cô j'ai mis les go
Et j'parle pas de p'tites poufs de tass-pé big boule
Et Black B qui fouillent tes sages-mé
Et quand j'écris beat lourd et amné'
Guizou est damné, j'kicke pour des années
C'est pas fini il s'trouve que ça le fait
P'tites bouffes et face B j'm'y retrouve et ça m'plaît
Défoncé mais effronté à démonter des sons
Débloquez des fonds aux p'tits oufs des quartier
Arrêtez les promesses, aucune ne sont tenues
La pudeur est toute nue, à 16 ans arrêtez les grossesses
Ah ouais, j'ai les poches pleines?
C'est pas c'que dit le banquier
10 Ans qu'j'ai mes problèmes de fric et mon envie de chanter
92 Grave gravé dans ma teté ma cave
Et puis ma che-frai macabre avec les reufrés
Ça me fait penser qu'on sort pour danser
Comme s'ils demandaient une rançon
Les majors veulent te faire chanter
""Wesh Guizmo, t'as la vingtaine tu parles comme un vieux!
Dis-nous c'est quoi le bordel""
En fait c'est qu'on est que des pions admirés comme des dieux
Invités à des cocktails
Et ça assombrit ma vision qui est déjà foutue
Coup d'jus un peu comme la tombe et la prison
Fouille pas dans ma vie tu vas trouver beaucoup d'sale
J'ai grandi dans des villes où on est formé aux coups de schlass
On est fort, mais beaucoup clamsent ou finissent handicapés
Marre des porcs et de tout c'drame qui nous donne envie d'braquer
Nike Air à bas prix, sacoche de contrefaçon
Hardcore et drôles de boissons, ma gorge est pleine de poison
Alors dis moi qui va m'stopper?
Non c'est pas ton gang de pute
Maintenant qu'ils ont sucé tout le monde, ils vont s'laisser prendre le uc'
Y a qu'des louveteaux dans l'zoo hash dans le jean
Pas de balles dans le bide que des couteaux dans l'dos
Ouais, ça sent la putain de traîtrise ça fait longtemps qu'j'ai la maîtrise
De leur vice et de leur bêtise demande pas pourquoi j'les méprise
Faut qu'ça marche avant qu'ça me les brise, f'voir le cash enfoiré d'tes fils
Que j'mette les liasses dans mon Lévis, une biatch autour d'mon pénis
On est des banlieusards habitués aux palpations
Les rappeurs, c'est des bimbos, y'a les formes, mais y'a pas l'fond
Et j'peux t'en citer des centaines sans identité mais dans c'game
Y'a une quantité démentielle de p'tits gens friqués, c'est dans le zen
Merde, ils nous parlent de lance-roquette, z'ont jamais vu un neuf
A part pour faire une omelette et la ramener à leur meuf
J'ai que des images de salaud, balance des freestyles de paro
Le pe-ra, c'est comme chez moi donc même en slibard, je baraude
Toujours efficace quand j'arrose, j'suis venu pour tous les plier
Bah ouais, j'm'en branle de votre relève, j'suis avec les piliers
Faut une tisse-mé qui déchire, une sse-lia dans la poche
Un p'tit équipier vif qui fait pas le che-lâ quand ça s'cogne
Et les spliffs défilent dans ma gorge, hystérique sans ma drogue
Mystérieux, j'plisse mes yeux dans ma grotte
On met du temps à faire le tour de tous nos vices
On n'a pas eu d'papa poule, mais sache qu'on fera tout pour nos fils
On a l'mord, on n'est pas venu pour jacter
Mes concurrents sont forts seulement à la course à pied
Avoue qu'ça le fait quand j'la découpe
Aboule la fraîche, j'm'en bats les couilles
Parle sur ma tess et v'là les crouilles viendront danser sur ta dépouille
Et c'est garanti sur facture, attentif
Moi j'suis plus un apprenti, j'suis un affranchi des fractures
La vente libre de came pure, ça rend riche mais pas sûr
En une perquis', tu perds la penderie, les voitures
C'est véridique, j'te préviens, j'ai l'seum!
Et s'il m'annonce un cancer, y'a des chances que j'élimine le médecin
Des silhouettes de North Face se baladent dans le noir
Quand ça caille, sans tracas, ça bavarde dans le bat
Souvent dehors quand la Tour Eiffel s'met à briller
Soudain des rêves de billets nous parlent et nous font vriller
Problème d'identité quand tu sais pas, ton père, c'est qui
T'as l'impression qu'l'enfer c'est toi, qu'le monde entier te persécute
La solution, c'est d'mettre les voiles avant de connaître le Rest In Peace
Il faut pas qu'on enrichisse le 5 étoiles de Belzébuth
Faut pas qu'on flanche non!
Franchement, j'regarde le temps qui passe, et j'me dis qu'on a besoin d'changement
J'agis étrangement, j'voulais pas fauter, j'voulais m'élever
On a saboté ma rampe de lancement
Et on n'est pas flemmard, on a trop donné sans rien recevoir
Enfermé dans des halls où ça schlingue le zbar
Ils disent que Guiz abuse, est indécent
J'kick, j'm'amuse, fils t'as vu, y'a rien d'méchant
Mais j'crache des vérités, ça dérange les uns
Quand ça fait plaisir aux autres, bah ça représente les miens
Ceux qu'on a mis d'côté, qui comptent pour du beurre
Mais qui n'ont jamais chipoté pour travailler plus de 35 heures
C'est pour les p'tits frères déboussolés
J'les vois charbonner tout l'hiver pour aller prendre des coups d'soleil
C'est la crise, logiquement, il faut qu'tu creuses
Le premier billet qu'tu croises, passe dessus mais pas en deuz'
Après la tise, le rap est passé à la base
A commencé à faire la bise et à s'chamailler pour du buzz
À c'qui parait, ça fait du biz
Ça vend d'la beuh et puis des taz
Dans pas longtemps, t'auras des rides
J'espère que t'as coffré du cash

Pétage de câble elle crie, ""oh my god""
Ils m'voyaient perdant, alors j'suis parti

Faut qu'tu le saches, la vie n'est pas facile
Beaucoup d'épreuves et c'est c'qui nous façonne

Interdiction d'crier sur la daronne

J'me rappelle quand j'écrivais tu venais derrière mon épaule
Tu m'regardais comme un roi tu demandais une dédicace
J't'envoyais rouler ma beuh j'étais un peu indélicat
J'ai décollé j'attérris pas, j'en pense pas moins mais je le dis pas
À toutes les femmes du monde qui voulait être ma Bonnie

J'ai voulu sortir un calibre mais il l'a fait pour moi
Il m'a déposé chez ma femme il est resté courtois
Il est fidèle il est loyal
Descendant de Soundiata son sang est royal
Il a mis des mecs à genoux c'était incroyable
À quinze heures ou six du mat toujours joignable
Il m'a dit ""Guiz baise-les tous moi j'suis derrière""

J'ai voulu rassembler le peuple mais c'était peine perdu
J'ai regardé mes semblables j'avais d'la peine pour eux
Et puis mon homme de main avait d'la peine pour moi
Il m'a dit j'vais tout niquer à deux doigts d'foutre le feu
Il est impulsif il est relou, j'suis un renard c'est un vieux loup
Des coups d'schlass des coups d'genoux il a d'jà fait des trucs chelous

On m'tire dessus et j'suis essoufflé
Mon homme de main essaye d'les trouer
Mais c'est trop tard ils nous ont trouvé
Même armé il peut rien faire il est dégouté
Et là c'est mon sang qu'il voit couler
C'est la fin du dernier couplet

Même mon ombre est jalouse de lui
On va pas à la guerre avec un lance-pierre mon pote

J'suis dans un bât' avec mes potes
J'finis mon pète, j'allume une clope
Les flics enquêtent, ils cassent la porte
On n'est pas bête, on cache la drogue
Quartiers défavorisés, cherche pas d'la chaleur ici
Après le passage des huissiers, expulsion du domicile
C'est pas cool, dans le local, on a détaillé des kil'
Ferme ta gueule, j'veux décal', t'es en chien comme Boule & Bill
Un petit spliff, une bécane, j'suis OP dans toutes les villes
Mec sous tise, ça bédave, tout le monde ils s'en foutent des flics
Et j'ai travaillé mes rimes, mais j'suis né avec le talent
T'as du fric? Faut pas l'étaler, y a les jaloux et les balances
Et comme tous les Sénégalais, pour les sous j'arrive en avance
J'ai découpé, j'ai emballé, à m'en bousiller les phalanges
J'ai regardé les autres avoir le bac
Une feuille et un stylo bic, Alkaly qui fait du crack
J'ai traîné partout, j'ai fait des sales coups
J'ai trop bédave, j'ai la dalle, j'mange à Fast-Foot
Ma femme m'appelle, ""allô, qu'est-ce que tu fais? Musique""
""J'suis au studio ma belle, faut que je ramène du fric""
J'ai trop zoné, mes mains j'ai mis dans la saleté
Dans la rue j'ai fait des saltos et puis j'ai volé pour acheter
Ouais je sais que c'est pas le top, mais tu connais le genre de type
Qui veut s'tape pour du fric ou parce qu'on a trouvé la taupe
Les enfoirés, ils le savent qu'en pe-ra j'suis trop chaud
Pour me battre il faut tricher si tu veux on fait un morceau
Putain, j'ai déprimé et j'ai fini mort saoul
Quand j'pars en couille, y a plus personne qui peut m'désamorcer
J'marche avec des gros fêlés, on dirait qu'ils sont possédés
Tu connais pas nos procédés, par le pouvoir on est obsédé
Eh petite balance, viens pas t'asseoir à ma table
J'regrette l'époque où on mettait ces bâtards à la cave
Y a les guetteurs à l'affût, et puis les grandes sœurs à la CAF
Les frères qui percent les coffres, et ceux qu'ont choisi les go fast
Renard est trop rusé, demande à Fred Musa
Des freestyles de 30 minutes et mon équipe est propulsée

Fils de pute t'as rien trouvé, j'ai une fiche depuis deux ans, Igo
Écrire c'est bien, mais écrire bien c'est mieux

94 Valenton, pas d'fric aux alentours
Ça nique ma volonté, j'bicrave, j'vais pas en cours
J'me roule un spliff dès le matin me dis pas ""fais bédave""
Et j'marche avec dans la rue, comme si c'était légal
J'effrite sur le te-shi à 5 heures du matin
Y a en qui croient qu'j'suis marteau tellement qu'j'ai rappé mon chagrin
Première plaquette, y a personne qui me l'a poussé
J'ai des que-tru dans la tête qui feraient vomir un boucher
J'sors la weed de mon pochon, la re-biè j'vais la picher
On veut manger chez Fauchon mais on s'ruine chez l'épicier
Et j'veux pas finir clochard, mais j'suis victime des clichés

Pourquoi c'bâtard il regarde de vers-tra? Mais qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
Moi et mes potes on saute à 10 comme ça c'est sûr qu'on perd pas
Dans mon hall ça sent la beuh et la résine
Les choses qui nous font du mal, ces mêmes choses qu'on apprécie
Putain, j'ai l'impression qu'on finira jamais ce cycle
Que la rue nous met des tartes, un pocheton au fond du slip
Venez admirer le spectacle, on se bagarre avec les flics
J'ai les deux pieds dans la rue, toi t'as les deux yeux sur Netflix
On s'est bagarré pour rien, contre la cité d'en face
Une daronne qui pleure son fils, on tireur qui boit son flash
Et ça c'est trop commun, on a appris à bricoler

J'en dis pas trop, mais j'ai d'quoi vous faire reculer 
J'suis dans ma bulle, et ma musique me torture
Entouré d'ordures, ça fait bien longtemps que je ne dors plus
La nuit je réfléchis, les murs se rétrécissent
Et j'fume un paquet de cigarettes plus vite qu'un dépressif
J'aimais l'école, j'aimais lire, j'aimais tout savoir
Mais j'aime l'alcool, j'aime le shit et je veux tout avoir
Alors des fois, j'me remets en mode renard
Avec ma paire de runnings, capuché sur le Runner
High kick, middle, ça part en couilles dans le parking
Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé? Il a fumé tout mon joint de Paki
T'as vu la rue c'est paro, tu viens pas si t'es peureux
Des mois derrière les barreaux, tu sortiras pas heureux
Et puis t'auras pas un rond, tu bédaves pour t'aérer
Et tu repenses à tous tes potos qui t'ont même pas aidé
Faut qu'j'me remette au sport, mais dès le matin j'fume un sbire
J'tire une taffe devant les locaux des porcs
J'suis pas naïf, je sais très bien que ces bâtards enquêtent
Té-ma la prod', depuis 'taleur j'lui mets des manchettes
Et si t'attaques, j'te dis négro, vas-y viens 
Paf, c'est dégueulasse, comme le métro parisien
Imiter c'est impossible, j'ai un style de psychopathe
Quand tu vas en discothèque, Guizmo a les flics aux pattes
Passe un stylo et une feuille blanche
J'vais rapper mes démons avec une gueule d'ange
Bats les couilles de l'instit', on a des baraques aux States
Mais pour l'instant j'peux pas y aller, faut qu'j'm'arrange avec la SPIP
J'refais le tour de la ville, voir si j'peux gratter un bif
Mais j'finirais dans un grec, sauce Harissa sur les frites
Après ça il faut qu'j'effrite, un gros pilon dans la street
J'ai d'la frappe du Maroc, entre mes couilles et ma bite
Pas dans l'game, boy, j'suis trop vrai, boy 
Dans la rue, c'est criminel, c'est pas du paintball 
Ok ok, soyons sérieux si on parle affaires
Tu connais Chippeur le renard, tu peux pas m'la faire
J'envoie du Boom Bap, j'suis dans cette merde depuis la New Jack
J'ai beaucoup plus de flow que tous ces trous de balle
Pour ceux qui bougent, et pas pour ceux qui s'chient dessus

We should sing now you and I

We are big enough to know

We see with our own eyes but it's so hard to feel

They have one long evening star

To play their way to immortality

To make their mark and last eternally

And only the rich are really free
They tell you that the fact of life
Is that you have to fight
For every cold hard coin that you can see

Gumball,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

I say

Oh crazy you
What the hell's got air to you?
While you're trying to impress me
With your plastic fear injectors

Crazy you
I'm driving in my car
Every light I see is a star
And it makes me feel so happy, what's wrong?

I'm rebelled in sway in time
And the street light's calling my name
And the goldfish keep on singing King Kong

Oh crazy you
Where's the life that we once knew?
With your anger and your madness
All your laugh reveals your sadness
I say

Oh crazy you
Was it all a game to you?
All the friends you left behind you
They're all still there to remind you
Crazy you

Don't beg me 
I don't want to 
I don't want to

Oh crazy you
What am I supposed to do?
Heaven knows I tried to change you
But you just keep getting stranger
I say

Where's the life that we once knew?
While the world outside is madness
We can drive away the sadness
Crazy you

But now I see right through you

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky made off everything I deserved
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga

It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We ain't never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn
'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked

I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me
My future's so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle

May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine

There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas, lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle

I'm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
I'm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
Probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about

Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a bilion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, where it hurt you
Life in the power circle

Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?

Don't come in any closer
And no one will get hurt
'Cause I dunno how long I can hold my heart in two

A rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andre
Beef is on my entre, gin and juice that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday, fitness on a Monday
My new crib came with Feng Shui
And my closet is like a runway
Come be fiancée, she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge
Just a sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie ass bitch made wait to fuck for two days
Finally go the two day, swear to god my mood change
Top off like toupes, drop off, touche
Yeah my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy
Bounce, boy, Flacko tellem holla at a nigga G
Riding on my enemies, this my Ghetto Symphony

Whippin' Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and locking up my swishas
Once she blow my whistle
She know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official
Now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive
Forget it, war ready, already tested
Tears and blood invested
Till my cardiacs arrested and my 40 oz is empty
Show me watcha owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires only I
Rolling down the lonely mile phony smile, was
Police on me now, still touring
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain, in it's purest form
Don't complain I came to reign
From here forward, still noid
So crib got clear doors
Burning grains in my air force
And all I can see is clear ports

Since Rocky spit like Andre I'm gonna kill em' like Big Boi
These rappers is all my entrée
Eat em' like cookies, chips ahoy
Eat, enjoy, when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas that I’d kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Prolly get found by a lil' fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenegger, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a Roy
Smoke what make a nigga trip collide
What took me how fast, you could grip a 9
Damn, look at how that hollow tip hit his spine
And the motherfuckers come in to cry
You niggas have a sour dipped in wine
Guess that’s why the ground sip the wine
Pourin' liq so I soak in different shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul get cold, all my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath choose souls you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies
Tryina come with this for their freakin lives
How many time your eyes and a nigga died?
Never!

I be posted like I’m 7’4
Till the day I'm knocking at my heaven's door
Just like club LIV when that confetti fall
I fell in love with the game, damn it's a distant love
I let her see it just to tell her friends what she saw
200 mill how I get it, damn I can't be far
I keep my sneakers low cut
Heat fitted, G-5 with the nose up
Self made St. Regis with the toast up
Roomservice, Belaire time to toast up

Never seen a square nigga with a happy home
All the money generated, double M the greatest
Rest in peace to every genius that never made it

Happy face sticker on the brick, still feeling miserable
Scramble with the handle of the hammer still visible
Bail bonds wishing for my bonds to be municipal
Reminiscing on them rock chopping days
Made a few M's, still got them rock chopping ways
As I step into the fog where it's desolate and dark
All the odds is against you like you wrestling with God
From the bottom to starting right back where it started
Right back on the white plate, the razor, and product
Had a beam, a dream, a fiend, and a team
A hustler ambition and a box of ammunition
Until the end of time I'm defending every dime
With my life if I got to, splitting rice with my partners
From a sinner to a winner, bag of chips to a dinner
Ain't no way in hell my patience wearing any thinner

And I'm still 'bout that life boy, got that right boy

Numerous two-doors, but I ain't never knew those
Just coke and a cup of ramen noodles
Way before the name brands bet you I can name some shooters
I came from where ain't nuthin but straight rum and cake crumbs
Not enough birthdays and way too many graves dug
Now I'm running round with more chains than a slave's son
Been a H-U-S-T-L-E-R from age one
So close to just being another stat
Being another cat that got capped in his [???]
Or just another dealer with a nine millimeter
Can't blame me if I still sound a little bitter
Relying on firearms to take my corner back
Like I'm another [???], like this is my sidewalk
White wet cookies drying on the iron board
Listen closely, hear the hunger through the drywall

Hope you die
And all these co-defendants out here giving statements?

I'm a life sentence-beater, black Benz two-seater
Put both feet up right before I light the weed up
Thinking 'bout the days that was dark, all the snakes, all the
Sharks, all the fakes, all the frauds (you know who you are)
They all come and go, just like all my hoes
Thinking that a Swisher gon' get 'em through my door
Ain't no loyalty, ain't no lawyer fees
Ain't no commissary, niggas just want you buried
My co-defendant gave a statement to the state
It broke my heart, had me questioning my faith
Now I'm pressing pedals in Panameras and Wraiths
Tryna dodge devils and penitentiary gates

An everybody warms themselves
To a different fire
When sometimes we get burned

The one you love is the one
That should take you higher
You ain't got no one
You better go back out and find her

Just like children hidin' in a closet
Can't tell what's goin' on outside
Sometimes we're so far off the beaten track
We'll get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick or some words of wit
A hidden hand up a sleeve
To think the one you love
Could hurt you now
Is a little hard to believe
But everybody darlin' sometimes
Bites the hand that feeds

When I look around
Everybody always brings me down
Well is it them or me
Well I just can't see
But there ain't no peace to found
But if someone really cared
Well they'd take the time to spare
A moment to try and understand
Another one's despair

That no one said it's fair

But if I call you out of habit
I'm out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me
If I fit you needs

Two nasty nazi cars are close behind

The police cars are getting closer-closer
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile yeah baby!

he is called the Old White Norse God;
he is great and holy;

his horse is named Goldtop.
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides
Bifrost.
He needs less sleep than a bird;
he sees night as clear as day
one thousand miles away from where he is;
he also hear the grass grow from the soil,
or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard.

and they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.",Don't Cry [Alternate Lyrics],1997

Said you took everything from me

Hopin' that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you
Or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give
I bought me an illusion
An I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams
And I had to have them all

Me I'm just here hangin' on
It's my only place to stay at least
For now anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions
Just to throw them all away

I'm taking time quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy 
So why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts
Can sometimes be enraged

My body's calling

Won't you come back to this world again?

Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end, I've got the bones on the mast
Well, I've gone sailing
I've gone sailing

I could leave so easily
My friends are calling back to me, I said, they're
They're leavin' it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity, and
Someone to tell me what the fuck is going on
Goddamn it

Slipping farther and farther away

In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit

Come on, his airways someone's got to protect his airways I want two

Going out on us
Who's got the defibrillator?

Please understand me

I'm climbing through the wreckage of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation just can't stifle all my screams
And I'm waiting at the crossroads, waiting for you
Waiting for you
Where are you?

No one's going to bother me anymore
No one's going to mess with my head no more
I can't understand what all the fightin's for
But it's so nice here, down off the shore
I wish you could see this, 'cause there's nothing to see
It's peaceful here and it's fine with me
Not like the world where I used to live
I never really wanted to live

Okay, we're starting to lose this guy
I want that IV and his airway protected (let's get some people in here)
Get the crash cart please, we're losing this guy, he's going under (give me an airway please)

Zap him again
How about an IV, stat?

You got a one way ticket, on your last chance ride
Got a one way ticket to your suicide
Got a one way ticket, and there's no way out alive

An' all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is, then there's stories to be told
No, you don't need a doctor, no one else can heal your soul

Got your mind in submission, got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger, they just stepped aside
They be down by the water
While you watch 'em waving goodbye

They be calling in the morning, they be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer, but you know nobody's home
When the bell's stopped ringing
It was nobody's fault, but your own

There were always ample warnings
There were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it coming
But we gave you too much time
And when you said that no one's listening
Why'd your best friend drop a dime?
Sometimes, we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time

An' it's so easy to be social
It's so easy to be cool
Yeah, it's easy to be hungry, when you ain't got shit to lose
And I wish that I could help you with what you hope to find

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better.

The hardest part this troubled heart has never
Yet been through now.
We've healed the scars that got their start
Inside someone like you now.

Well had I known or I'd been shown back
When I longed you'd take me.
To break the charge that brought me home
And all that won't erase me.

I never would know that I could
No matter what you'd pay me.
Replay the part, you stole my heart
I should have known you're crazy.

If all I knew was that with you
I'd want someone to save me.
It'd be enough, but just my luck,
I fell in love and baby all that I wanted was

Now I know you better,
You know I'd know better,
Now I know you better!

So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution,
This melody inside of me still searches for solution,
A twist of fate, a change of heart,
Kills my infatuation,
A broken heart, provides the spark for my determination,

They just thought I'd know better, better.

If I had to deny your name?
Where would you go if I told you
""I love you""
And then walk away? Oh yeah!
N' who should I turn to
If not for the ones
That you would not save? Alright

I told you when I found you
If there were doubts you
Should be careful and unafraid

Are misunderstood

Fed up with life and the way things are going
He decides to rob a liquor store

But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
(Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this)

Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)

That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay

Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you

Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

Fuck that!  Do that shit!  Shoot that bitch!
Can you afford to blow this shit?  Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?  Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Yeah, and other fellahs they just wanna swing
But all I wanted all my life
Was a TV set and a truck and a wife
And a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

Yeah the TV and the truck I got on credit.
And I got that girl with a little old Woolworth ring
And life was warm and life was sweet
But still, it was kinda incomplete
Without a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

chorus:
Hey, John you walk the line,
Do ""Deelia"" one more time
And when you do them Cottonfields
You warm this heart of mine.

So, one day I thought, Hey, I'm gonna do it!
(That's what I said)
So, I mortgaged the farm and pawned her wedding ring.
I sold the gold tooth out of my mouth
And jumped in the pickup and headed South.
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

I hit Nashville cold and wet and hungry.
I said, ""I'm here, bring him on let him do his thing.""
But they told me down at the Old Pit Grill
I'd have to go all the way to Andersonville
For a front row seat to hear ole Jonny sing.

I found his house knocked on the door and it was opened
By a brown-haired girl and a baby with a teethin' ring.
I said ""I seen you somewhere before
But don't stand there and block the door
I want a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

(chorus)

She said I'd have to go down to The Opry
And the feller there said I'd have to wait till Spring.
He said, ""We've been sold out for months and months
And this poor insane fellah wants
A front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

Well, he said a couple more things, and I started cryin'
And then he laughed at me and that's when I started to swing.
Well I bust through the doors in a roaring rage,
Crawled over the crowd till I reached the stage
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

(chrous)

Then some crazy guard started shootin'
I shot back, and the next thing I know I was winged
And on the floor
When a guy in a voice kinda deep and low
Says, ""Boy that's a mighty long way to go
For a front row seat to hear ANYBODY sing.""

And I guess that judge, he weren't no music lover.
I got fifteen months but that don't mean a thing.
'cause' yesterday in the prison yard
A show come through and HAR! de HAR!

Günther Neefs,"Woke late this morning forgot to shave 
A hole in my jeans, got me a bad hair day 
Like it or not, she's walkin' my way 
Not a perfect setting, really wasn't ready 
But I can't let this moment slip away

Makin' hay while the sun is shining 
Leap of faith got to take that chance 
Miracles have their own sense of timing 
Got to be ready to make hay 
While the sun is shining 

Sweet country music on the radio 
No cloud cover on that lover's moon glow 
I kill the engine, she slides up close 
But it's times like this that you just can't miss 
So look out here I go for the kiss, I'm 

Two young lovers who can't slow down 
Great big dreams on the edge of a small, small town 
We could just go home, we could turn around 
Oh but I was thinking baby, I've never seen Vegas 
So let's get crazy and lay that hammer down.",Ik Voel Me Goed,2000
Gunther Schuller,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1990
Gunz,"When we first met I told myself you were the one
To lay up next to me
Late at night when work was done
You looked into me eyes
How could somethin' so right be wrong?
I gotta find a way to leave him for you

So I start a fight
To get him mad at me
Then we'll be breakin' up, temporarily
That's when I'm callin' you
To head over your house
Baby I love the way you take care of me when you see me down
I love it when you're tellin' me

Hurry up, come quick, I'm here for you
Don't cry baby, he ain't shit
I know what you goin' through
Hurry up, come quick, I'll be waitin' for you
I gotta find a way to leave him for you

Uh uh uh, uh, hurry up
Uh uh uh uh, hurry up

When I lay down at night
Why the hell are you on my mind?
When I'm up next to him?
Maybe ?'cause he don't treat me right
You could be lovin' me
I know he does his thing on the side
Gotta find me a good reason to leave

So I start another fight
To get him mad at me
Then we'll be breakin' up, a good excuse to leave

I'm ya remedy, ya dozier blunt, ya Don-P
When you met Gunz little man became a memory
I boost ya self-esteem he take ya energy, ma
You might as well hurry on up
Cause I'ma burn it on up like ya first time pushin' a clutch
You shake when you see me, shiver when you feel my touch
We both know it's real love but we indulgin' in lust
But for you I'll hurry on up
And run them ""8 Miles"" and ""Lose Myself""
Without you wouldn't know what I would do wit myself
When you with me you comfortable
We can start a family like the Huxtables
For that love from you I would switch like Jeckyl and Hyde
Just give me the word and my henchmen will ride
And I know you not feelin' that he dealin' you lies

And you stressin' out

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

[Guru] 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
(I'm walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 

Yo here goes some info on my flow and how I move 
to a def groove, I keep my rep smooth 
On the down-low, I travel with my mind to the street 
Concrete, like the gravel I'm in deep 
So I gotta hit ya from a real perspective 
Cause anyone who's talkin that crap, will surely get his 
I'm not the one to act flashy 
Cause man where I be at, we don't have to be classy 

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I'm walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(Walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 

Check it stupid 
While you're out there, on the main streets frontin 
Your game's week, so I'm huntin you down clown 
Cause you need to learn somethin 
All that bluffin, won't get you nothin but killed 
No mission fulfilled, because there's others who will 
get jealous, hell if they can take clout from you, they'll do it 
So that's what I'm about to do, I'll step to it 
and strip you of your pride (your pride) 
And then I'll stick and I'll rip you up from all sides 
or possibly I'll let you slide, slime 
Cause you'll set your own death in just a matter of time 
Yeah, and I'll be somewhere on the sidelines, y'know 

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(Walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 

So when you're lookin for me, here's where I'll be 
I'll be walkin down the backstreets in your vicinity 
Cause I been out here for a few 
So all that you're doin, ain't really nothin new (nothin new) 
I peeped the way you always perpetrate 
You're so phony, you make me wanna regurgitate 
Since you're ridin so high, you're bound to fall 
while I stand tall, and you don't get no props at all out here 

Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(I be walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(Walkin down the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(It's the backstreets) 
Down the backstreets, down the backstreets 
(In your backstreets) 

Down the backstreets, is a mind state 
Cause I don't have to be a pop star to rhyme great 
I've been out here observin things 
So now all fake gangsters and pranksters I'm servin 
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm the king 
Come down the backstreets where it's dark 
I'ma snatch your heart 
So get a handle on life and quit livin so trife 
Or else we're gonna have to run up, and SMACK all the weak 
Comin straight from the backstreets 
And I'm out, ninety-three, it's all me ",Down the Backstreets,1993

Hold on tight, so you don't slip or slide

You gotta stand on your tired feet
Where we goin don't worry, you'll be there in a hurry
But you better watch you pockets cause the thieves work quickly
This is a New York transit thing
Don't wear too much gold and hide your diamond rings

And if you don't have none, they may look at you strange

feelings I have, of you and me, it's like a bond 
A treasure, not to be corny but word 
I wanna give you all the joy that you deserve 
I know we argue, sometimes I start to annoy you 
But we should never ever, try to destroy two 
hearts joined, intertwined with a passion 
Give me a chance love, that's all I'm askin

every little thing you need, yes it's true 
I'm not desperate, but I'm the one for you

G TOP - GRU... - Guru Lyrics - Loungin Lyrics 

Yea I'm loungin' I got my man Donald Byrd 
I wanna give a big shout out to my little man Miko he's 2 years old 
He's away visiting his grandmom but I miss him dearly 

Check it out 
If I rhyme this you will find this situation shall advance 
You could take a glance or dance 
Elevator lyrics to arouse the crowd 
Now tell me who's the man to show you how 
Many legacies of brothers who get buzy 
And I do it fluid til the suckers get dizzy 
Saying peace to the blackbirds 125th street 
And check the flow that's unique 
For loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 

Can't refuse this, never lose this, it's the choice this 
'Cause my voice is the smoothest 
Dominating to your boys 'cause I've been around doing work 
And sold tons of others jerk 
Donald Byrd word on the track, quite exact 
Giving you the format, Jack 
See we gotta pave the way and display 
How to loungin', loungin' 
Mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 

Peace to the pioneers but I gotta try to clear 
My throat, check out what I wrote 
You can't tap into this unless you know the roots 
Word shoe like light absolute 
For real so now you gotta know the deal 
For loungin', just loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin' mellow out, check it ou and loungin' 

Loungin', loungin', mellow out and just loungin' 
Loungin', loungin', peace to Brooklyn where I live 

Realistic, kind of mystic when I kick this 
You should witness the slickness 
Of the hornplayer and the dope rhymesayer 
Quite emotional and inspirational 
Philisophical and yes very logical 
Teaching you the method for loungin' 

Everybody knows they have times when they wanna just lay back 
kick their feet up, y'know 
listen to some good music and just lounge 
That's right, I said lounge ",Loungin',1994
Guru,"[Chorus x 2] 
What's the question?  
Why are you flexin'?
Here's the answer; choice of weapons

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, The Remainz, kid, why you flexin like a bicep?
Heat on your hip just to get a rep; it ain't worth it 
Just because you pack a biscuit doesn't mean you can't 
Become another statistic; you figure it 
Life's a gamble even for vandalz; I handle mine with minds 
Only unless my chest is under pressure in a contest 
The fear of layin' in wreck causes the stress 
I have to adjust to this mess and pull when it's best

[Guru] 
Yo, little big man, feelin' your oats because you're strapped? 
Bustin' a cap at another kid who's black? 
It ain't all that when the shots are flyin' back 
You made a choice, and the choice you made was whack 
Kinda tipsy, with the liquid confidence 
Pullin' your pistol when it doesn't make sense 
To be the bigger man you figure 
But in the end, it don't pay when you're livin' by the trigger

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
Yeah, it's the master of the who, what, where, and the why 
But, still, I got a problem with seein' my brothers die 
I've been around and lived past the average age of us 
In every obituary, a full page of us 
The game is money, but what about inner wealth? 
The mental, the spiritual, and physical health 
But still, everyday, the city is a test 
That's why some people feel a gun is the best

[Stikken Moov 2] 
No doubt I pack protection, but every altercation 
Or situation doesn't deserve blastin'; I mastered precisions 
Choice of weapon - should I peel or peel out? 
My choice of routes may decide my whereabouts

[Chorus x 2]

[Stikken Moov 2] 
I pack no weapons then the seargeant bargin in 
Ready to bomb a rapper like Saddam, Stikken Moov swarm 
Ready to bust off, like Ron Jeremy, but I chill, G 
Relax and consider lucky to live to see a quarter past three

[Guru] 
That's why I wield the steel; yes, my microphone is crazy real 
I'm not the one sellin' out to get the mass appeal 
But jail cells are filled with my peeps 
While the rest are gettin' killed in these ill-ass streets 

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
So, pick your weapon - a mic or a gun 
I make a sucker run when my tongue stuns; check it 
Leavin' the spot, I seen some wild kids 
One stepped to me, asked me to freestyle, kid 
Meanwhile he flexed a burner on his side 
I looked him in the eye, smiled, and walked to my ride 
He was actin' kinda hard on the surface 
I said to myself that it really wasn't worth it

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, you think you're all that, 'cause you pack heat? 
Seein' your own brother play the concrete in defeat 
Tryin' to prove yourself while you put the next man down 
But what goes around, comes back, black; best believe that

[Chorus x 2]

You know what I'm sayin'? 
That's all the real heads all over the world 
That realize that this music is real 
That we keep it real like that 
Peace to all my brothers on the third 
And all the real brothers in hip-hop 
It's like a rap's new generation thing, baby 
Peace to Guru 
It's Panche, the wild comanche, suicide",Choice of Weapons,1995

I remember when I used to get depressed
Overwhelmed by the stress
Feeling my life was the illest mess
Always dwelling on the stuff that wasn't right
And staring at the four walls in my room all night
Searching for a way to cope
The situation shaky, like I'm walkin' on a tightrope
But now I see it's time to get a handle
And take control of things
So for me - I'm a light a candle
And other people got it worse
I get a lot of love, so I ought give my thanks first

Yeah, I know you dig what I'm relayin'
And now I find myself devoting more time to praying
I ain't saying that I don't do no wrong
I'm saying I ain't trying to sing no more sad songs
I got mad responsibilities
I'm building with my family; my loved ones depend on me
I've got no time for envy nor for hate
My inner power's too strong
To let such evil penetrate
The world around is in chaos
But I'd rather seek the truth to be found
Than to be lost
Experience is always the best teacher
Look at the signs, feel the vibes; I'm tryin' to reach ya
I see how much now that one should be grateful for
And we must help the others who can't find a open door

Now as we head into the year two thousand
And more and more people can't even get decent housing
Poor education in the schools
And poor employment structures, so some choose illegal tools
By all means, you know we must survive, but think
The energy we give always comes back to us in time
We must decide to make the proper choices
Or the only thing we'll hear is the cries and the screaming voices

To my moms and my pops: I'm glad you stayed together
I don't know too many people to demonstrate true love better
Nowadays kids don't have anyone
But you were there and determined to make me get plenty done
Yes, to achieve although a lot of times I hurt you
But I'm matured now; I'm showin' you my true virtue
As I deliver to you an oath of never-ending love
Admiration and respect, for there is nothing above
A mother's strength and a father's concern
There was guidance no matter which way I turned
Yo, pops, if I could be half the man you are, I'd be a star
Moms, thanks for pushin' me real far
As I proceed through the tundra and harsh winds
I think, reviewin' what you've instilled within
So I'm takin' time out to let you know
Once a boy, now a man; thanks for helpin' me grow

Fifty deep up in the party, gettin' crazy, stupid bent
Around the block, puffin' lye, cruisin' in the car
Whatever we was doin', I won't forget it, Baby Pah
When I had no dough, you were there
You hooked me with some ends to show me that you cared
You stood by me through the ups and downs
While the other fakin' clowns tried to start hangin' around
See, you were always genuine
That's why respect is due, and I got you on my mind
A lot of people might not understand the way we click
We're rollin' thick, hittin' harder than a ton of bricks
With all the drama and the phony personas
I'd rather check my man, so we can share some knowledge
If the streets were college, some emcees would flunk out
Sendin' shouts to my peeps, crazy love no doubt

A true friend, kid, is mad, mad rare
Trustin' others is a risk; a lot of things ain't fair
'Cause where I be at, a lot of strange things happen, Jack
You can know a kid for years, and still, he'll stab you in the back
But that's alright 'cause I'm a good judge of character
And me and my family - we maintain the balance to
Master the challenges of life
Like the chain and the star, we link up to shine mad bright
To all my boys way across the country
Dealin' with the struggle - the good, the bad, and the ugly
Yo, under pressure we're the best
No matter what the circumstance, no matter how much stress
Our force has the power to bring forth change
I'd rather see us succeed than feel shame or go insane
Dedicated to my fam that supported
You shall always, I said always, be applauded

 Like a jazz player I improvise wisely 
 Free with the style, I flow like the Nile 
 but remember, don't mistake the smile 
 Deep rooted is my rhymin 
 Like ancient African griots, precise is my timing 
 But let me get to the essence of what I'm sayin here 
 Too many blood red streets with bodies layin there 
 The systematic fanatics are at it again 
 Tryin to kill me and all of us my friend 
 But don't bend to the mental strain 
 Against all odds, we must strive for essential gains 
 Be true to the life the Lord gave ya 
 And that's a message from the lifesaver 
 The lifesaver.. 
 Chorus 
 [Baybe] 
 Oh I am, the life (I.. am the lifesaver) 
 I am, the life.. yeah 
 [Guru] 
 It takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight 
 than to set one off, knowledge I'll let some off 
 Cause nowadays, everybody's a killer 
 And as for me, no other MC is iller 
 but still a thorn scrapes my heart 
 when I see another life that's been torn apart 
 over nonsense, no law, no order, it's evidence 
 that the money only takes precedence 
 Cause everybody wants power 
 While the innocent are born or die, during every hour 
 I scowl as I look upon evil 
 but I must have the strength, to spark awareness in my people 
 And we will learn to respect our neighbors 
 Another message from the lifesaver 
 The lifesaver.. 
 Chorus 
 [Guru] 
 People talk about the Armaggedeon 
 And nowadays everyone you know is packin lead son 
 Each day's another test 
 Aiyyo I better do my best, cause a lot's ridin on my chest 
 So when I lead you to the water, you best know 
 how to swim across, so you can reach the border 
 It's international, the message and the flavor 
 So here's some more important words from the lifesaver 
 The lifesaver.. (I am the life) 
 The lifesaver..

What's happening...
Check it out 
It's critical; the situation is pitiful 
Bear in mind you gotta find somethin' spiritual 
We never gain 'cause we blame it on the system 
You oughta listen, whether Muslim or Christian 
Or any other type religion or creed 
'Cause what we need is less greed 
We can't continue to kill ourselves 
We gotta build and expand our wealth 
So one more time, I'll design a rhyme divine 
To educate and elevate your mind 
Nowadays we gotta fight to live 
Human means we got a right to live 
Without the homicide, without the genocide 
Don't tell me ""let it slide.""

In the land of the free, home of the brave 
Too many of us reach such early graves 
They tell us to behave, but they don't know 
About the neighborhood drug flow 
They don't know about the drama, or about the guns 
I ask how many politicians steal our funds 
And how many officers will turn up corrupt 
The governments don't care; they pass the buck 
I'm growin' tired of the trickery 
And the misery; it's makin me kinda sick, you see 
But now I meditate, so I can get it straight 
My thoughts penetrate, so I control my fate 
So be advised by the wise and conscious one 
We take the easy way out, too often, son 
We better get some kind of work ethic 
Realize it, and correct it

Victims of an unfair society 
But for those who are blessed 
We must correct this mess, or disappear into nothingness 
We're living in the age of doom 
How many teachers reach all the kids in the classroom? 
The beast is stalking us, but there's no stopping us 
As long as we maintain the strength within us 
'Cause we're winners, descendants of the kings 
They try to hinder us from doin' our thing 
So get the money, but spend it wisely 
I get ill when the beats hypnotize me 
Realize that the key 
Is for each to master his own destiny 
Deal with reality, and keep a tight focus 
'Cause there's a lot we got to cope with

Now, as I peer through the window of gloom, and everyday living 
And all the hardships one faces to make you give in 
I dig more intensely, finding greater strength 
A lot of heads is empty
I've got a greater rank 
Than emcees not aware of situations 
That'll force one to understand true stipulations 
Thou shalt not bite
Thou shalt not front 
Fake it if you want, but for the battles I've come, 'cause I'm...

[Guru] 
For me this rap life is real life
I don't have to create some false image to make the crowd get hyped 
Too many children get the wrong message from clowns that walk around 
Hopelessly lost, thinkin' that they're the boss 
They're in a daze, while dope emcees don't get the front page 
Me - I try to channel my rage
As I travel through the city regularly 
Turning the anger and frustration straight into energy 
Yes, you will remember me as the brother who cared 
To dare to step up, with his soul bared 
But never fearing 'cause I've got instructions 
From Him, to go and fight the corruption, so I'm...

My granddaddy always told me to keep the light shining 
So as my mic illuminates, you can feel the state that I'm in 
Thoroughly immersed in a verse; way more than hardcore 
I endure 'cause in myself I'm secure 
Delivering syllables and selections with profound perfection 
Comin' back like the resurrection 
In this session, I'm professin', that those who don't 
Hear and understand, never loved me, and so I planned 
To take a stand, as one who is firmly focused 
Plus I'm mad worthy with words 
I rock from East New York all the way to the suburbs 
The lightkeeper, knowledge seeker 
I switch the stress that's on my mind 
Into the voice that rocks your speaker 
And I get deeper than the ocean when I'm...

Then I look through the madness, finding sanity

Doing it in the house like this 
Going out to the lost souls 
Doing this for you and yours 
Comin' straight to you from the Guru and the crew

[Chorus]
To the lost souls 
I hope you find your way someday 
That's why I sit, and I pray 
For the lost souls 
I hope you find your way someday 
That's why I sit, and I pray

[Guru]
Sometimes I wonder why 
Some people can't see what's beyond the naked eye 
So therefore I must fortify 
Techniques of communication 
For beyond what is considered to be 
Normal conversation 
So I need some proper 'ticipation 
Am I giving what you need?
Yes, true indeed
As greed grows like weed 
Many bad seeds start to contaminate the crop
I think that needs to stop hops
Brothers are slain over respect and clout
While their mothers are trying to figure out
What's it all about
But when you give up on self, that's when you lost
'Cause you're playing with your life
Like it's a coin toss

[Chorus]

[Guru]
No doubt I release a form of speech 
Relative to urban outreach 
Transmitted messages to each true listener 
Rhymes divine but rough 
Like the skin on blisters 
'Cause the truth hurts 
Plus I got no time for runnin' around, chasin' skirts 
So, see, my sound is a corrector 
A profound lecture 
Quality texture 
That's because of what I see 
A lot of emcees are gassed like hellium 
Word up, G
A lot of people in general are straight up no good 
Makes me want to shoot 'em 
Aiyo, maybe I should 
But instead I parlay 
Maintain self control 
And say a prayer for the lost souls

[Chorus]

[Guru]
Get up, stand up 
Come on, stand up for your right 
One, two
I go to new heights with my insight 
Whipping my mic tight 
With the height of a scholar 
Equipped with the gift to make crazy dollars 
But that ain't the whole 
See my heart is in it 
That's the only way one could even attempt to win it 
Dj spin it while others critique 
But the science makes 'em weak 
Check the words that I speak 
See, it's ridiculous for us 
Not to discuss 
The real issues 
Like all you phonies 
And why I dis you 
Dismiss you as a lost soul

[Chorus]

[Jason Kay of Jamiroquai/Guru]
If you don't watch where you step 
You can become indirect 
And you know that you will lose your soul 
And if you truly want to lose 
Until there's nothing to choose 
Then you know that you will lose your soul 
To the lost soul 
I hope you find your way someday 
So I sit, and I pray 
For the lost soul 
I hope you find your way someday 
Lose it 
You can lose it 
You can lose it 
You can lose your soul 
To the lost soul 
Hope you find your way 
I hope you find your way someday",Lost Souls,1995

""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect as I begin to build.""

[Bahamadia] 
I'm mystical; don't be deceived by the visual 
Visible preference is pure; patent it back to metaphors 
Greetin' 'em Illa del style wild 
Analyze my memoirs, runnin' on eight, four poetic meter 
Soarin' way beyond 
Iambic pentameter or juvenile flam 
Unsyncopated soul, piercin' earlobes and egos 
My vocals read these thoughts - am I hardcore? 
To the grain

[Guru] 
Lame-game, plain-Jane emcees can't approach these 
I shake chumps like fleas; I hold the keys 
To drive you, guide you, provide you 
With the real joints; ahem, I clear my throat of phlegm 
The architect, selecting the blueprints 
To rid the game of nuisance 
Sucker reducin' with the fusion 
Rhymes solid like cement in my musical solution 
Stackin' concrete flows; look out below 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Rhymes get all up in your grill like freckles 
Most emcees couldn't see me with bifocal spectacles 
There's no protectin' you; with realness, I'm wreckin' you 
I'm beggin' you - take a look into the cipher 
You're dirt on my windshield, so I'm turnin' on my wipers 
And I can see clearly now 
No other rapper is near me 
And all you perpetrators shall fear me now

[Bahamadia] 
Never flip folklores, only realness 
Coincide with the rhythm like I did with Total Wreck 
Respect the architect in this division 
Rhymes written to be hittin' like anti-proton collisions 
Rap newest edition, bringin' the feminine in renditions 
In rare form, defined as optimal for my pedigrees 
In skill three like three-sixty degrees as in well-rounded 
Leavin' the competition dumb-founded 
For when I catch wreck, I astound 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Floor to ceiling, constantly building 
With power to construct towers of rap cream, kid; what? 
Dreamin' you're lyrical, physical, mystical? 
Your concept's mediocre, plus you're way too typical withcha 
Corny delivery and crazy, whack voice 
Mad corny image; that's why I give you jitters 
It figures I'd have to dust you off the scene 
Like a wiseguy, with my New York lean

[Bahamadia] 
Lines that I supply fortify the nuclei of mindstate 
From state to state, universal, be the orals that I create 
Top notch and on lock like Sentry; opponents could never tempt me 
Samplin' my style like an Akai S-950, and still can't get with me 
While I spread this verbal plague like bubonic 
Conductin' phonics like the Philharmonics 
I make in measured melody; kids praise me like the crucifix 
So place Bahamad' amongst your top ten of emcees 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

Guru,"I haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame 
We had the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain 
Now you got your man, I got my staff, and we laugh 
Then I realize it was something in the past 
Yo, you look good; how you been? 
How's my little man; how's he doing? 
And, umm, did you get the package that I sent? 
I hope that he knows that there's someone who loves him 
But I'm gettin vexed at you and I 
I can't front, baby; yeah, you still look fly 
And as I try to get my words together 
There's a lot of nice times that I start to remember 
The good shit always outweighed the bad 
I never wanted to make you sad 
So think of me, as one man 
Who has crazy respect for you, as a woman 
Although the plans didn't work out 
It doesn't mean I won't look out 
For you and yours; I wish you the best 
Because it's over, I guess 
I haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame

Then I realize it's something in the past 
Now I'm livin' the life of a true mack 
Devoted to my music, tryin' hard not to look back 
But on occasion I can see your face 
The memories, they got me driftin' a little taste 
But now you're doin' your thing; I'm takin' care of mine 
And so we're movin' on, leavin' the past behind 
I guess relationships - they ain't for me 
That's why I had to set you free

We had the joys and pain, sunshine and rain 
Now you got your man, I got my staff, and we laugh 
Then I realize it's something in the past 
My personality is magnanimous 
That's why the ladies always cause a fuss 
It's in the past - what we had 
Aiyyo, respect to your moms, and peace to your dad 
I'm glad that we've been through this 
Because you know what?  I've noticed 
A lot about myself; see, I want to gain wealth 
They say that chasin' women is bad for your health 
I haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame 
We have the joys and pain, the sunshine and rain 
Now you got your man, I got my staff, and we laugh 
Then I realize it's something in the past 
Haven't seen you in a while, since you sparked the flame

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come 

Warning, rappers be like boring 
They're sleeping, it's deep man 
So peep in closely when I'm speaking 
Weaklings, it's obvious you can't like up to 
Your petty pointless words, yet and still you love to 
Run off your jibs, now there come a time for judgement 
Punishment, what if we take away your ornaments 
And strip you down to the raw deal 
Then I'd reveal the evidence 
Cause you don't really represent 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said

I'm getting tired of you shooting lip 
You better tighten up 
Or you will really slip up 
And say something that you mean to do 
Turn around and it'll be on you 
To save yourself from your call and blunder 
And bury your ??? like the world it's under 
And like a fool you'll sit and wonder 
What, who do you want to know, wish 
No water, no magic spell 
Can save you from your self made hell 
You've made your bed and you know darn well 
You got a lay it in the ?
And there's no magic potion 
To save you from the wheels you've set in motion 
The stone is cut, the die is cast 
What were you thinking 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come 

I can't understand it, they should ban it, can it 
Too much weak talk and not enough real hip-hop 
I sense a purpose is filling me 
To display credibility and show responsibility, willingly 
I'll take on any Johnny Dangerous 
Pull his file, for he knows he cannot hang with this 
The illest king, I smack the jokers 
No hocus pocus, a real MC when I kick vocals

Guru,"Coming with the realness lyrics of life 
Some people need to watch what they say 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come 

Warning, rappers be like boring 
They're sleeping, it's deep man 
So peep in closely when I'm speaking 
Weaklings, it's obvious you can't like up to 
Your petty pointless words, yet and still you love to 
Run off your jibs, now there come a time for judgement 
Punishment, what if we take away your ornaments 
And strip you down to the raw deal 
Then I'd reveal the evidence 
Cause you don't really represent 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come 

Listen here 
I'm getting tired of you shooting lip 
You better tighten up 
Or you will really slip up 
And say something that you mean to do 
Turn around and it'll be on you 
To save yourself from your call and blunder 
And bury your ??? like the world it's under 
And like a fool you'll sit and wonder 
What, who do you want to know, wish 
No water, no magic spell 
Can save you from your self made hell 
You've made your bed and you know darn well 
You got a lay it in the ?
And there's no magic potion 
To save you from the wheels you've set in motion 
The stone is cut, the die is cast 
What were you thinking 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come 

I can't understand it, they should ban it, can it 
Too much weak talk and not enough real hip-hop 
I sense a purpose is filling me 
To display credibility and show responsibility, willingly 
I'll take on any Johnny Dangerous 
Pull his file, for he knows he cannot hang with this 
The illest king, I smack the jokers 
No hocus pocus, a real MC when I kick vocals 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said

You get caught up, like Ted Kennedy, in Chappaquidick.
You can't roll with my flavor or style.
I outlast MC's by miles, and I got
The hot style that pops.
I'm givin' hardrocks body shots when I rock.
You can't even test me, no matter how hard you try.
Fuck around, lay around, punk; do or die.
I'm back again, the roughneck nigga from Boston.
When I swing I got mad drama that I bring.

Lord have mercy
I got demons running through my sleep
They like to creep when my thoughts get deep
Scheming, trying to find a place to fit in
And manifest itself in the form of a sin
If I was Rin Tin Tin I'd rip the skin off of Lassie
The shit you talk is idle threatening to blast me
You high on gas like a rastaman bought it
Don't set it off kid and get me started
Cause you're highly regarded when you're dearly departed
But momma's still crying asking God why in 
The world could you take her only child
When you was fronting on the streets like you was buckwild
To keep it real kid you gots to stay humble
You can't fumble and if you gots to rumble
Then word to Bryant Gumble I'm a live for Today
And God bless the man that steps in my way
Cause if I said it somebody's getting wetted
So just keep your cool and everything's copasetic
Pull out your heater kid spit your razor
And mine'll still be the intellect that plays ya
Cause when the mike check I'm high tech skills are apparent
You can play the child kid I'll play the parent
Cause I'm a be responsible for your schooling
But I won't change your diapers or do your car pooling

Get up I'll break ya down a little something
I'm fed up it's time to go head hunting
Dead up too many crews be fronting
I'm fed up it's time to go head hunting
Get up I'll break ya down a little something

Whoa whoa

Now why everybody making shit that's unreal
Cause the a & r man he wants mass appeal
Forgetting all about how it's supposed to feel
Kids be going out for the record deal
So if you pull out the clap then bust your cap
Or I'm a make like the van and drop bombs on your gap
But don't snap cause this ain't HBO
Kid you got no Benz plus you got no dough
While you say that though you trying to gain that ho
Used to be you had to rhyme about stuff you know
I don't need MTV to make no bucks
I rock styles that make you say ""Ah who dat waz?""
Who that was is the man of all hours sending all star players straight
back to the showers
Fake hard rocks are really just cowards
I master dub plates like my name's Herb Powers
I getcha open like hunting season
I make papers don't front on the reason
Cause I'm seizing up every day
You say carpe diem I call em like I see em

Get up I'll break ya down a little something
I'm fed up it's time to go head hunting
Dead up too many crews be fronting

Guru,"There's a party in Harlem, come on

I like to reminisce about that night we kissed
It was somewhere one night in Harlem
The nights were hot and bright
You could treat your honey right
?Cause Sylvia's would burn all night

The people there were really something
(You know that's right)
The music always kept us jumping
And it used to knock me down
When Smokey came to town
(And the miracles, please)
My favorite song was ""Tears Of A Clown"", oh yeah

There ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem
They really shake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
And I'm gonna take my baby back
To the heart of Harlem

Big sister had a group 
And they'd sit out on the stoop
And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)
My cousin Joe could blow
Just like the radio
And he used to drove them ""B"" girls wild

But when grandma started happy dancing
(Oh, she gon' break somethin')
She really turned the mother out
I like the way they do it up in Harlem
When there's a party up in Harlem
That's what it's all about

Ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem
They never fake the funk up there
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem
And tonight I'm gonna take her back to the 'pollo

There's a party in Harlem
They say that all the stars will be there
Everyone is going to Harlem
Harlem is a party and everybody's going there

Follow me visually, ?cause I usually be all around
Originally everybody headed uptown
Finessing the fly way you ?cruisin in your car
On the West Side to the highway, East Side D-R
And yes, we are about to set it
Forget it, I thought you knew
The Apollo is where I had to go with my crew
From BMW's to my daddy's Cadillac
He had the sunroof top wit the diamond in the back
Check the ambiance, the place a renaissance
Who frontin' nonchalant up in the restaurant
What you really really want, we grabbin' by the clutch
Precise can flaunt with this and never too much
It's such a love flow, high but natural
The thug's a no-show, and drugs a no-no
The only thing that they was shootin' was pool
While Harlem nights was right, the party was cool

Nothing like them nights in Harlem
They really shake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
I'm gonna take my baby back to the heart of Harlem

Nights in Harlem
They never fake the funk up there
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem
Back to the Harlem Apollo

Nights in Harlem
They don't let you fake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
I'm gonna take my honey
Back to the Harlem Apollo

They really shake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem

Choclair, Kardinall hooked on my man Guru
And why look, bitch? The fuck

Yo, T dot rocks y'all
We smoke and mix up in your face, you're weeded
So you drop y'all, leaving y'all hired skills depleted
'Cause you locked y'all, Chocs and Guru begin
Can you believe this how we lock y'all

Niggas who be talking how they bigger, how you figure?
You can spark with or talk with this raw artist
You talk heartless but game straight harmless
Snatch your mic out your hand, leave your fingers harmless

We rottweilers, while y'all be the tyres 'cause you need to retire
Fucking with Toronto, get your pink slip, you're fired
Kicked out the Thompson Hall through Apollo doors
Guru be the brethren, bless the man
Slide like the doors on the Caravan

The ill format, the skills all that, twist enemies, Jack
Let's counteract, plus build and all that
In fact, take a flight to Toronto and back
Be over there with Choclair, Kardinall with the track

In the year born, born, suckers have been forewarned
Take you higher than hydro or Moet, Chandon
Word is bond, it's on, in this rap game
I slap mens, mack dames, yes, I'm a fly black king

Stacking paper now, packing flavor now
Hit you dead in the head now, my hunger gotta get fed now
My style's similar to a fierce knuckle hit
Or like hollow points to pierce your whole fucking frame

Ayo, witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact that you can't do shit

Witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?

Now it's the skinny man dropping this
Lock your brain, lock your lips
Talking shit? Bust your game
Career flops? I'm to blame

What's the name? Yeah
Guru and the Chocs will reign
Wild like the lion's mane, walking through the rain
Or walking through the pain of critic suffering

Got my eyes on the prize with the red dot locked
Gots to keep it hot
My hungry ass niggas be down for the figures
Green in the jean, cruise like some act figures

You fucking with some raw, suave, dog ass niggas
Look into the eyes of the man
That will be detrimental to career
If they touch the mics stand, nigga 'nuff said

Hear the battle cry
Niggas getting herded like cattle to die
Why? Why?
What the fuck you think? What the fuck you think?

You know they want our type of species to become extinct
Still we multiply, they can't really kill us
They're upset, we're a threat 'cause their kids really feel us
They think we're drug dealers and some of us maybe are

But I be the G you are you of the Gang to the Starr
I'm going far, baby par, pimping in a fly car
Getting eyes from the honeys, parking up at the bar
Always up to par when I spar

And yo, while your protecting your neck
I be like breaking your jaw
Yo Trizzack, your shit's wizzack

I took that shit thizzack
It shouldn't of even been up on the rizzack
Straight like thizzack, motherfuckers

Ayo, witness the fitness

Witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact, you catch
The shakes like a sickness

Ayo, witness the fitness

Rap so exact that you can't do shit

My attitude on the hoes
I wreck the mic like a pimp, pimps hoes
Like a pimp, pimps hoes, pimp, pimps hoes
Let's close

Yo, you see, I like to party
Just as much as the next man

",Bare Witness,1999
Guru,"Though the times are getting wicked I'm older
I got a chip on my shoulder
True players always maintaining, I'm different I told ya
Don't want to be just a commodity
I'm smarter G
This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me
It's the truest part of me
Fans now mobbing me
Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery
Back then I guess it was hard to see
The real paradox
What an artist see
It's like that saying
Be careful what you pray for you might get it 
Of course it's all about winning and money but how far will we let it
Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em
Rain one day sunshine the next
Haters try and stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed
What's next accounted by the press
Mad stress on my chest 
Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test
On ""Any Given Sunday"" I got to play my best

[Chorus]
Sacrifice don't give up the fight, 
everything will be all right on any given Sunday
The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall
Depends on you if you win or lose, 
you know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday
Strive to achieve and die for what you believe


On the battlefields left abandoned
One man standing
To me the ball was handed
Taken shots and left stranded,
No defensive they tackle me
Every blow brings back a memory
Learning lessons from my injury
It's killing me 
Cause at first they wasn't feeling me
Never given a chance to show my true ability
Too many pressures trying to play me out
Put me positions that's sure to lay me out
No doubt

[Chorus]

Playing on a field of hard times
These struggles are like the yardlines that I gain from
Nowhere is where I came from
From day one, I knew the game and how to play run
But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons
Now I learn from self when pain comes
And walk when they say run
Fame can be as painful as
Death of patron
Young black, gifted
But I'm rapped in myself
Broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself
See what happens with wealth
At times you can lose yourself
During the sunniest of days many superstars fell
From cotton to football fields
You know how they play brothers
As long as we play well they love us
I know that on Any Given Sunday
This can be taken from me
But it all comes down to is money
I know that on Any Given Sunday 
This can be taken from me 
But it all comes down to is money why'all

Yo my girl's heated
'Cause I told her I was busy workin and I couldn't talk
I told her I'd call her back later and she still got mad
That was all I said, word up

Why she buggin if I promised that I'd call her back
Of course I'm honest plus I'm keepin things all intact
I be stressed out baby, sometimes on my grind
And on my mind, is a paperchase with minimal time

She should know how it goes - I'm, still into her
I got feelings for her, I been caring for her
But really though; I mean she ought to know the deally-yo
Especially if I'm in a meeting or out shooting a video

I love her yo, but I'm just doin my job
Ain't no need for confusion what I'm doin is hard
I'm the type of man, with a serious type of plan
I'm calmer no drama, no need for gettin hyper

And upset with me, because I'm busy a lot
And if I could you know I would, bring her with me a lot
Ain't nuttin wrong word is bond, it's all in her head
I was handling some business, and that's all I said

I'll call you later is all, I said..

I'm confessin no question yeah I chill with my boys
Still she gotta keep it real, either build or destroy
This is deep right here, she completes my square
Without a doubt, if she needs, I'ma be right there

This world is crazy, she's supposed to help me stay sane
Supposed to help with the pain, supposed to help me maintain
And quote this, I'm focused on the dreams we share
I got her all up in my mix, so it means I care

This job of mine goes on and on, twenty-four hours a day
And with trust we can win, in a powerful way
When I get home, I'm gonna love her down
I'll be like Teddy, get some hot oils, and rub her down

I know she's bored, feels ignored, all by herself alone
And she hates it, when I turn off my cell phone
But it's alright don't want to fight, it's all in her head
I was takin care of business, and that's all I said

Always bring your game direct, cut out the middle man

Someone will bring you down
'Cause they ain't livin right
Be sure to use your mind, though

Be in command of whatever you encounter
Appreciate your blessings, son, you'll see what it amounts to

Never give up, always be ready to try
Walk your own walk, and keep your head to the sky

Pickpockets.. streetwalkers.. number runners.. hustlers
 

[Guru]
Lots of ladies, wanna, check me out
And lots of haters, wanna, X me out
I got more style than Gucci, Louis or Prada
Drop more jewels on you, than your uncle or father
Once this envious kid, was temptin me kid
to stoop down to his level and cold empty his wig
He was mad cause his girl wanted up in my world (hahahaha)
I looked the other way, and she was still, stuck in my world
Aiyyo; baby wants to run with me, come with me, have fun with me
I be the man when I'm dipped, or in a t-shirt, and dungarees
I overheard her man, that was screamin in her ear
while I nodded to my peeps, who was schemin in the rear
If he's gon' flip, he's gonna, find out quick
That I stroll with a click, and we roll mad thick
He shook my hand and laughed it off, that was his best decision
We keep it tight aight?  Hangin out, with that night vision

[Isaac Hayes]
I bust into this night club
I can see you perpetraters
Passin out your BID'ness cards
Wearin your knockoff gators
Pimps.. heartbreakers.. dumb-ass Johns..
You got to make a decision, to go witcha instincts
and rely on your night vision

Calm down man, can we talk like civilised people?
I can't take this no more

[Craig David]
I don't love you
No More
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
Cuz I don't love you no more

[Guru]
I'm out the door, I can't take it no more
Things have really changed, it's not like before
I mean the vibes between us nowadays are quite shaky
And lately, I ain't been feelin you baby
Somehow you left my interest wander
And now I'm fond of someone else who's diggin me for me 
It's what I longed for
About our current arrangement I ain't sure
Cuz I don't think I love you no more
And yo I had a major effect on you I know
But sure you be showin disrespect to me, so I gotta go
You never gonna see it how I do
And I don't like your attitude and I don't like being lied to
I'm not a door you can't push my buttons
We tried to make it work still we've come up with nothing
So now my patience is thin, the fighting is a bore
And I don't think I love you no more

[Craig David]
I don't love you
No More
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
Cuz I don't love you no more

Girlfriend I'm walking to the door
Ain't gonna see me no more
All you seem to do is bore
Me, since I came back off tour
See if I can take your ways
I'm walkin away from only bad days
 
I know there is no easy way
But there's nothing you can say
To change my mind, yeah

[Guru]
I wish I didn't feel this way, wish I was kidding
But another girl has stepped on the scene to put her bid in
I never would have looked in another direction
But you got a strange way of showing love and affection
So I told myself that I deserved better
You only came my way because you heard I had cheddar
And now you seem to me to be so immature
And I don't think I love you no more
And plus I know about that stuff you told your crew when we met
I gotta go somewhere so please let me jet
See you forget about my generous ways and my good heart
You never wanna admit you're wrong, but you should start
Let's put our differences away and end this peacefully
We haven't been getting along at all recently
I've been thinking about this since I came home from tour
And I'm sure, I don't love you no more

[Craig David]
Now I gotta explain that I'm loving and feeding you no more
Everything keeps sticking around since I came back off tour
So tell me why do I have to explain myself baby, ey
Cuz girl you gotta admit that there's nothing more for me to say
Ooh yeay

I don't love you
No More
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
Cuz I don't love you no more

When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
then she gets plenty more, uhh 

{repeat Chorus One} 
[Guru] 
Uhh 
Watchin her drivin by, in her new whip so fly 
Wish she could sing me a lullaby, to scoop her I've got to try 
In her eyes, there's a flame that burns right through my soul 
Can't pretend to be cool, about to lose my control 
Yeah I know she's got plenty; admirers, she's got many 
Like an exotic fantasy, into a frenzy she sends me 
Wow I have to sit down, and gather my wits now 
I want to caress those hips now, want to kiss those lips now 

[Badu] 
Hello? Hey babyyy 
I know you called and I didn't answer twice 
But baby that's oh-kay it's nice 
for you to call anyway see, okay, see uhh 
Hey babyyy 
You know it's okay if you don't call me 
anymore cause I got a-plenty 
truckload of niggaz like you at my door {*dial tone*} 

[Chorus One] 
[Guru] 
Yup 
And every day is her day, and every year is her year 
Anyone tried to violate, they could straight disappear 
She don't care if you play yourself, tryin to step to her 
The illest of gangsters, I show and respect to her 
Truly glamourous, she ain't impressed and it shows 
She don't like your new clothes, she don't care about your playa pose 
Do you suppose I could hook up and spend time with her? 
She's just how I dreamed - I'll bust my nine for her 

[Chorus Two: Erykah Badu] 
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty 
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
any damn thang she wants, uhh 

[Guru] 
Uhh 
Surgeon General - I provide vitamins and minerals 
The charge that she's got on me, should be federal 
I was told never put the two before the one son 
but always cultivate your Wisdom, to help you build your kingdom 
I want to be the answer to every question she has 
So when I wish to enter, she'll be lettin me pass 
I know she wants to be with G-O-D eventually, but still 
She got everything; yeah the girl's got plenty 

[Badu] 
Flowers in her bedroom 
Perfume on her neck 
Nectar from a mason jar 
Seven dollar dress; she's 
Super cute, and plenty bad 
Thirty twenty-two thirty-six and a half 
I, hope the dude will realize 
She got the silky(?) (?)sexy bedroom eyes 
Baby baby please don't break yo' neck 
Cause you gon' have a wreck {*tires squeal*} 
Cause when it comes to love I get plenty, degrees one-twenty 
My back slipped out my dress - OOPS! 

[Chorus Three: Erykah Badu] 
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty (she gets it all) 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (uhh) 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (c'mon) 
and she gets plenty more (plenty more) ahh 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (mm, she gets it all) 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty

That's right 
In this game of life it takes a lot to win 
Plenty more baby's what I got to give

Yeah yeah baby that's really nice 
But I'm tryin to read my book and you're in my light 

[Guru] 
Uhh - a woman like you could help me reach the top 
If I get a chance to love you, mm, I won't stop

Damn! Oh huh, what? Huh, whaaat? 
I didn't hear you I was thinkin bout some stuff

Baby you so fine I want to smack myself 
I don't need no support I'm gonna back myself

Hooo baby you so sweet 
Now can you get the lotion and rub my feets

In massage therapy I got a master degree

Ill grooves verbal lessons
Dominant, prominent, eternal blessings
Never underestimate the weight of the force
It's actual, classical, natural resource

I never slack I never lack cause I'm your highness

Enough to be diamond-like, despite dirty conditions

Been down and up, so I'm roundin up

Me and my right hand man Mr. Hancock make landmarks
In foreign terrortories true warriors, stand tough
Two livin legends with the gifts of seven
Grab your glass as we pour one more sip of heaven

And I could never approach you with the same old game
I know you don't want to hook up, with the same old lame

to see the pretty women with the sexy toes

Bring it on baby, let me peep the ass(?)tastics

I asked honey her name, she replied, ""Monique""

I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right - it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call

[Guru]
One of the first real niggaz, to ever rock a baldie
Slick Daddy; that's what my ladies like to call me
Trained in combat, still smooth in approach
Live from first class, while you snooze in coach

Coppin cruiser boats, so I can rule the coast
Any altercation, our peeps and do a toast
I go from rockin Timberlands, to wearin Gucci boots
Never chasin a silly bitch, even if the groupie's cute

I'm stakin my claim, breakin you lames
I'll choke you out into submission, you ain't takin a bang
Fuck it, I'm takin the blame for straight shakin you up
Wakin you up, that doo-rag",The Anthem,2001

Tell me what the fuck a hood do to make a young buck get dumbstruck
By the sight and the sound when the gun bust
Nigga tell me how to, fuck I know the smell of gunpowder
So well that when the shell spits sniffin it'll rouse ya

Why you send me like this to live a life with such malice
In the streets bound by the vows of marriage
To the game, I'm a hustler
Shellshocked from lettin the shells pop from the muffler

Get knocked, get bailed, with the bell heart just to touch ya
Fuck ya, I done paid all my dues in spades
and know the tools of the trade
Nigga fuck the police, I done spent life up in the streets

Ain't got plans for comin up in this piece
To give a nigga, every side of my struggle
To show why'all mothafuckas all the real ill shit they put a thug through
And they wonder why I let my pants hang, fuck with hoodrats
Cheap nigga and won't give up a God-damn thang

I sat by the door, but never call me a spoof
Go head and, call on ya troops, we'll have you callin a truce
I got here on pure guts, carve diamonds with pure cuts
Still the king of underground, you toilet tissue, pure butt

And just in case you want to spread rumors
Me and Tef'll give you lead to the head tumors

Once you step in the arena, cheater
YOu gon' see what the fuck *I said* Listen up, *I said*
A whole lot of things on the minds of most of my mens
But they shy, so may I
Say things that currently, common thugs wondering
Like If I made a hot beat, could I fuck Lil' Kim
Why did Ron Artest flip on the fans
But ain't do shit to Ben Wallace, knowledge
Do the one son, who is son
Ay yo Guru *Peace Wop* stop playing
There's a certain sucker, imposter, rocking your name
It's kind of lame, it's kind of strange
When they know GangStarr, go back far
Rap's throwback, splat, hold that dawg
Engineer that ass back to ass-cap dawg
So you could fine-tune your membership card

Got a whole lot of things on my mind I want to spit, I ain't shy
*I said*, so may I *I said*
Does this idiot here, have any fucking idea
How many mics I've touched in my illustrious career
Got mass appeal, to get a rep, I grab the steel
Code of the street, and not they have to kneel
Before the bling era, NYC had it locked
Have we forgot *I said*, I'll blow your spot *I said*
I'm from the days of when Big and Pac used to be tight
Known to get loose with a mic, I'm used to the fight
Listen, I ain't your average meat-rapper
I'm well acquanted with beats
So of course we keep clappers
Forget the politics and who's supposed to be nice
I represent what a MC's supposed to be like

[Doo Wop]
Hennessy was a popular drink and it still is
My name is Wop, considered one of the illest
Mixtape inovador, spit plus kill a fader

Born in east LA, but the Bronx raised me up
What you want *I said* *I said*
We could get it crunk, cracking or popping
This is Wop, and what, the hole locked

I could see clearly now, the rain is gone
Solar supplying tracks we getting famous on
Bodies got laid out once the bangers rung

Just remember that the world is runnin'

And awaken that what you slept to long
Cause twisted minds have lead you wrong

Or it's us that gotta deal with the cost of your reason
It's us that gotta deal with the 'cause of your treason
Which way you runnin', pack your bags you know we comin'

Ay y'all
You see that one man's pleasure can be the next man's sorrow
No such thing as loyalty, no good examples to follow
All we hearin' is time to fix the distortion
Nothin' but death and disease and epidemic proportions

Be the shit that strong rhymin, have you shook and amazed

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Gus,"Please don't get me wrong
I've known all along
It would come to this
Tongue tied to the sky
Blood by camera light
Just keep on drivin'


Goin' our way
Unconscious of the things I say
Through it all
Goin' our way
That's all we never talk about
Via satellite

Live like jealous dogs
All good cops have lost
Their tambourines
Long range cosmonaut
Looks like we've been caught
In this silence

Goin' our way
Unconscious of the things I say
Through it all
Goin' our way
And that's all we never talk about

You can't let your feelings show
You hold your friends up
They just hold you back
Isn't that the way
Loud screams underneath the hood
Payload ya did all you could
Just keep on drivin'

Goin' our way
Unconscious of the things I say
Through it all
Goin' our way
That's all we never talk about

Gus Arnheim,"You came to me from out of nowhere 
you took my heart and found it free
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
Made every hour sweet as a flower to me

And if you should go back to your nowhere 
Leaving me with a memory
I'll always wait for your return out of nowhere
Hoping you'll bring your love to me

When I least expected, kindly faith directed
You to make each dream of mine come true
And if it's clear or raining, there is no explaining
Things just happened and so did you

You came to me from out of nowhere
You took my heart and you found it free
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
Made every hour sweet as a flower to me

And if you should go back to your nowhere
Leaving me with, with my memory
I'll always wait for your return out of nowhere
Hoping you'll bring your love to me",Out of Nowhere,
Gus Arnheim,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say
 
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say
",Sweet and Lovely,1999
Gus Arnheim,"So rare 
 You're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
 Sweet of a breath of air 
 Fresh with the morning dew 
 So rare 
 You're like the sparkle of old champagne 
 Orchids in cellophane 
 Couldn't compare to you 
 You are perfection 
 You're my idea 
 Of angels singing the Ave Maria 
 For you're an angel 
 I breathe and live you 
 With every beat of the heart that I give you
 So rare 
 This is a heaven on earth we share 
 Caring the way we care 
 Ours is a love so rare",So Rare,2004
Gus Arnheim,"Was in a Paris cafe that first I found him
He was a Frenchman, a hero of the war
But war was over 
And here's how peace had crowned him
A few cheap medals to wear and nothing more
Now every night in the same cafe he shows up
And as he strolls by ladies hear him say
If you admire me, hire me
A gigolo who knew a better day

Just a gigolo, everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance
Selling each romance
Every night some heart betraying
There will come a day
Youth will pass away
Then what will they say about me
When the end comes I know 
They'll say just a gigolo
As life goes on without me

Gus Arnheim,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you if you're young at heart (young at heart)
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart (young at heart)

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on the way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart (young at heart)
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart (young at heart)

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

Gus Arnheim & His Conconut Grove Orchestra,"When the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to flicker in the sky
Through the mist of a memory you wander back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh
In the still of the night once again I hold you tight
Though you're gone, your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat, lover we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
Here in my deep purple dreams",Deep Purple,1999
Gus Arnheim & His Conconut Grove Orchestra,"Heaven, I'm in heaven,  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven, 
And the cares that hang around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek

Oh! I love to climb a mountain, 
And to reach the highest peak,
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh! I love to go out fishing 
In a river or a creek,
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through to heaven

I'm in heaven 
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak 
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek",Sweet and Lovely,1999
Gus Arnheim & His Conconut Grove Orchestra,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Gus Arnheim & His Conconut Grove Orchestra,"When skies are cloudy and gray
They're only gray for a day
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away
Until that sunshine peeps through
There's only one thing to do
Just wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away
Your castles may tumble
That's fate after all
Life's really funny that way
No use to grumble
Just smile as they fall
Weren't you king for a day?
Say!
Just remember that sunshine 
Always follows the rain
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away",Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams (And Dream Your Troubles Away),2008
Gus Arnheim & His Orchestra,"Great big houses with great big rooms
Were not fashioned for brides and grooms
A little place is where we should be
Great big troubles and great big cares
Come from houses with marble stairs
A little place for you and for me

Just a little room or two can more than do a little man and wife
That's if they're contented with the little things in life

Living on a larger scale would soon entail a lot of care and strife
We could be so happy with the little things in life

A little rain, a little sun, a little work, a little fun
A little time for loving when the day is done

And a little thing that cries for lullabies could make a man and wife
Tell the world how much they love the little things in life",The Little Things in Life,1987
