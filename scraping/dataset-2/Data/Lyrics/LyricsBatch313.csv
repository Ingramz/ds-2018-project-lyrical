Gladys Swarthout,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still","My Heart Stood Still, song (from ""A Connecticut Yankee"")",2006

Gladyss Patches,"Hear the noise
Feel the break
Near the edge 
Take the plunge

I'm broken
So we remain afloat at sea
I'm broken
Breathe and release

See me spin
Never look back

All the while 
Lost the day
Feel all hope 
Wither away

I'm broken
So we remain afloat at sea

Why can't you leave me alone?

It feels like I get fucked",Spin,2001

For I'm always so alone

But when the sun goes down
And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all.

I know that I can run to you.
Just like the rich man needs lots of money, 
Listen, woman, I need you.
Just like a hunter stalks the hunted
In a jungle of lust. It's true

I've got an animal heart when I see you.
(Animal heart.) I'll do anything you want me to.
I've got an animal heart.
This love for you never changes (no, no).
 
Pressure's rising. I see your eyes and
I know that the ""game"" is you.
You keep me running, but I'm still coming.
Oh, lover, do the things you do.
Oh, with a young heart, well, I'm never lonely, 
Oh, but listen, woman, I need you.
My heart is aching. My body's shaking.
Oh, but one thing that I know is true

My ears are burning
It's been a long, hard day
Telephone rings
I still got nothing to say
Considerations tossed
Out the window
I feel a little bit wired
The rules say anything goes
But I don't want to play
You said I could walk away
Take me back to where
My life burns
I'm still searching for something
I'm still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart
And a life on the run
Took a long walk
I went down through the backstreets
I heard the city scream
Reminds me of the time
I run wicked and free
Now, here I stand all alone
But I'm back to where

Fear disappears

And so I wait in silence
Wait for a star to fall
I'll fly with the angels
As they carry me home

So far from my shores

In my childhood days, we went our different ways
But you knew that we'd never part

You knew our love could never die
And though my roaming eyes always lead me astray
Well I'm coming back home

Glass Tiger,"I could never understand the meaning of our lives
Just at the moment when we let it slip away
Turning back the pages like a chapter
In a book filled with pain
Shadowed by a darkened sky - my eyes
Just let you pass me by forever
Lost forever all alone
Taken where the lonely go to places
They can never call their own
You're never home
I'm falling, falling, falling
But a light shines from above
I'm captured by the moment
Rescued by the arms of love
Darling, darling, darling
It's you I'm dreaming of
Take me where that light shines
I'll be rescued by the arms of love
Close your eyes; your mind will see
That life is still a mystery
A hidden game of cheating and pretend
Leave your heart with shallow friends
They'll turn around and hurt you in the end
It never mends
Why do I keep holding on forever?
A thousand tears I'm drowning in this river
I want this love
I need this love",Rescued (By the Arms of Love),1993

It will blow your mind

And you will come around anyway
The rhythm of your love will make you bleed
The rhythm of your love is what I need
The rhythm of your love is a golden crown
The rhythm of your love comes a tumbling down
So love takes its toll
A dream you never had
Now you're moving slow

See them smile it's so sad

It's a young man's time

Needs a helping hand well, well

Everyday has been an uphill climb

The many nights I sit home lonely
Come on and tell me boy 
Has it ever happened to you
Boy I'm gonna tell you something 
And believe me it ain't no joke
My love life is just like a sinking boat
I can understand a person being without money
But there sho' ain't no reason
For a person to be without love

No matter what kinds of hardships we've been through I wouldn't trade this for the world
You brought me life
I'm thanking you",Falling Apart,2003
Glasseater,"we are born then we start to experience...
with experience we begin to age
we grow old
we look back into our days growing up
then we die
i wonder what it would feel like to die with someone
or at least something other than yourself
when the light in your eyes burn out
and you are looking at your life expeditions in rewind...
how many times did you go out
on a limb to to try and prove
what you truly wanted to accomplish
(think about that and remember this)
we are born alone
and we leave this world alone
so grab hold of your life and run it dry
live life at your fullest capacity
leave no stone unturned
so when its your time to pass
the term regret will bear no consequence
risks will make it all work it
this will make it all worth it",From Cradle to Grave,2003
Glasseater,"This is me saying goodbye to you
From this day forward I won't think about you

Fate will decide the outcome
Goodbye to you goodbye to us
If somehow our lives intersect in the future

It has to be this way
A selfish way to act
But it's my only remedy, in dealing with you
So I'll use this pen and it's insides
To conjure the thought of you one more time
So I'll use this pen and it's insides
To conjure the thought of you one more time

So here I leave you with goodbye
And the memories of you will end
And be cast away
As the ink from this tool of my thoughts runs out
I'm saying goodbye
And the memories of you will end
And be cast away
As the ink from this tool of my thoughts runs out

You have these beautiful eyes
And the way you carried yourself
You made the impossible possible, you opened my heart
And shined light on the darkness, I fell for you
you can't just break me in two
So I'll use this pen and it's insides
To conjure the thought of you one more time

Glasseater,"let's take a break from this
so you can quickly start with that
if i could show you how i feel right now
maybe it's jealousy
maybe it's me knowing i couldn't be there for you
i've never felt that way
close your eyes and make a wish
so we can end this final chapter
this book has waited to long to close
please end this final chapter
maybe it's just me realizing i didn't know you
i just craved you
maybe i did know you but it was just time before you
realized no matter how much i would give you
you would always want more with me
tried to capture as much happiness

so much has changed since then

sometimes the smallest things bring me down
depression sometimes kills the best of them

Out to the sea

I guess I rely on Jesús to save us before I refer
The madness, my neighbors witness ski masks, the masses don't know
I'm packing this four and harassing your hoe
Antagonizing the business you love the most
See the difference to my approach is a 40 ounce at the store
If a forty bounce, to get low, I never learn, I'm hard-headed
The corporate world don't like it, but I said it

I'll be at your side to console
When your standing on the window ledge
I'll talk you back from the edge
I will turn your tide
Be your Shepard and your guide
When your lost in the deep and darkest place around
May my words walk you home safe and sound

When you say that I'm no good and you feel like walking
I need to make sure you know that's just the Prescription talking
When your feet decide to walk you on the wayward side
Up upon the stairs and down the downward slide
I will, I will turn your tide

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blacky
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
My life, my love that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never wanna to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule headset nine
Puttin' them pants shelves
Waitin' patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God ""Man why'd you had to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed and count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say ""Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
A and R's and their faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I was really makin' myself, they competition
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game

Just picture man, no snitchin' man
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man
Last 9.11 I was poor on the ave
'Til I pulled out my map
Not it's course 9.11 and I'm floorin' the gas
Gotta lotta problems, but at least one that Annette have no more

Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid
All my niggas about to have it made
This makes everything else sound played

Now hold up
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog
Now you say it (ain't nobody messin' with you at all)
I told dude ""You can't even rap on my interlude""
Now does that make me as rude as you?
(When the album comin' out?) Man the peoples is askin'
Why'all don't model Adidas, just stick with the fashion
Why'all already got do' so just spit for the passion

Did a few high crimes, almost got lifetime
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count
How could I mic out, just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'
When I copied hounds it was my best investment
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson
I'm stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard
Man look at your haircut
Mm hmm, mm hmm, no, your hair sucks

I done come up out the coma of livin life's dreams
When you wake up in the morning you join the flight team.

[Chorus]

I got my superman power, my superman cape 
These the last hours, but superman late 
The clock is ticking, damn can you wait? 
Man, will he come back and save the day? 
Fly across the earth, put things in reverse 
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse 
Certain things I can't doctor, and you say I'm the worst 
I ain't have enough patients, but I needed a nurse 
Got to come by my head let, see if my head ache 
Then get my head straight 
Then give my head great 
Every time I popped up like the VCR 
I took your breath away 
Then we performed CPR 
With all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats 
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats 
In the penthouse position, 
With penthouse bitches, 
See I pimped my crib, so I must exhibit 
Shit, these last years been a haze like Issac 
So I close my eyes 
Tighter than Asian eyes 
Get realized 
I got the same wings angels fly 
With Louie Vuitton feathers, now that some fly shit

My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been G, focus where you trying to go!
I swear the game make you cold like obonimal
Snow man old man when you trying to shine like gold
When its my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the mist getting dough I was here with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn't know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon' do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is tying to grow
Candy blocker when he knocked out ?
Empty chamber so I'm watching every angle
Under the moonlight with he devil I tangle
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, it's better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way I watch a stranger

Do it again (hey)
I'd never do it again (hey)
'Cause this is the end

Chilling rolling up something to change my feeling
Thinkin' about how I came up from nothing while I'm
Splitting this cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin' about really killin' them all
I say slow down, slow down
What the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I'll be there in 20 minutes but it only took fifteen
We wasn't that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
No knowing that this was all a set up
Secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They passes move was to slow for me
I pulled up, wasn't no ambulance, there wasn't no police
Something fishy going on, not even kept pressing on
Nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit
The nigga with something to lose almost lost it, won't trust him again

I'd never do it again
Do it again
I'd never do it again
'Cause this is the end
This is the end
This is the end
I'd never do it again (hey)
Do it again (hey)
I'd never do it again (hey)
'Cause this is the end

Cheese came through at 3
Salute at ease he supplied the weed
'Cause I've been that OD'ed
It's me with a black rockstar steez
Will rock tee's, 300 a pop for these
Please bum me, you don't owe you money
They ignite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heinie with my Jamie boo besides me
That's my fucking best friend
When I be tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that's the part I find intriguing
A little bit off I am, I am, I am
I see that I'm caught I am, I am, I am

I used to want to see the penitentiary
Way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge
In the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition has said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressing, my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour and second, ministers tried
To save me, how I'm gonna listen
When I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that killed with ya, squealed with ya
I deal with ya like my son
Stare at the sun and you'll be lookin'
In my eyes homie stand for something
Or fall for anything, and you working
With two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, 23 hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined
To blow, that you hear the music
I wrote, hope it get you off Death Row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the Pen is in
My view, I'mma get it right, just so you

Smoke good, eat good, live good

And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessey and my real
Niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gonna have
To come and get me

Holler if you hear me

You like to mistake a street nigga for a real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya, will squeal with ya
I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I’m 23 with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy
There's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
You think about it, and don't call me lyrical
Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words
To make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worry some individuals that live life critical
So won't you bare witness while I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break, eating in the parking lot
On 'Wanna Be Heard,' probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me, getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for
The world that minute
So the next time he roll up
And drop grams in it, he'll probably be
Out of work, laid back, while he

Smoke good, eat good, live good

Et tu sens qu’elle s’esclaffe
C’est insultant comme cette fille
Qui pendant le sexe laugh
Life’s a bitch
Mais pas le choix faut que tu roules avec
Gars quand tu tombes
Ta seule option c’est de te relever
Man c’est tout ce qui te reste
Un goût amer une cicatrice
Amorcer la remontée
En l’honneur de ceux qu’on trust
Ceux pour qu’il faut rester droit
Surtout quand le vent souffle
Pour qui tu irais au front
Seul contre l’immense foule
Tu peux me croire il y en a très peu
Qui cultivent l’art de l’être en paix
Le poids du monde sur mes épaules
J’ai pris la forme du trapus
Pour moi la frime
Est un signe de faiblesse
Pourquoi vouloir à tout prix
Que l’on t’estime si fabulous?
En vérité 
C’est se voir dans les yeux de l’autre
Negga j’en ai rien à foutre
C’est comme un arbre pour un cyclone
Côté gear
Tu sais très bien que je n’ai pas de style
Mais sur le sentier de la guerre
J’avance d’un pas stable

Oh Lord
Je rêve de comprendre de tout prendre
Sans oublier
Le rap je sais que c'était ma destinée
C'est profond
Ce rêve ce cauchemar
Mais on marche droit sur le chemin
Maintenant je sais j'avance les yeux fermés

Je fais un rap franc
Honnête et vrai sans artifice
C’est malade et ça tue
J’ai baptisé mon art : typhus
Et quand je kick
C’est comme un coup de Tony Jaa
Aiguisé imprévisible
C’est comme un couteau de ninja
Quand ça pénètre dans la tête
On dit que ça brûle tel un gunshot
Avec un flow qui vient d’en-haut
C’est le débit de la grande chute
Rafale de métaphores
Tu n’en catch que l’une sur quatre
Moi je crache des météores
Avec l’impact d’un lance-roquette
Man on spit fire
J’ai un arrière-goût de cendre
Rap des textes qui te flagellent
Comme 200 coups de sangles
J’ai fait le tour du sun
De janvier à décembre
J’ai entrevue la cime
Et j’en viens à redescendre
Sans même changer de cap
J’évolue dans l’espace-temps

J’te laisse mon adresse posthume
La Terre n’est qu’une étape
Dans l’immensité de la vie
Fils il y arrive c’qui arrive
Il s’agit d’aller de l’avant


Refrain

Et tant qu'il y a de l'espoir
Quoi qu'il arrive moi je fonce
J'arrête pas d'y croire
Je fais ma route et j'avance


Si le rap est dead
Il reste le corps pour qu'on l'embellisse
Le fil de ma pensée nous relie
Tel le cordon ombilic
Faut rester tight
car la jalousie s'accroît
Un Prince parmis les Voleurs
comme Jésus sur la croix
La New Jerusalem
est beaucoup plus près que tu ne le penses
Si c'est un lieu géographique
Elle se situe au-dessus de la panse
Si parfois t'as l'impression étrange
que la Vie te boude
C'est qu'il y a des gens qui rampent
et puis d'autre se tiennent debout
Plie comme le saule
ou bien brise comme la branche
Dépendamment de la force du vent
Modifie ton approche
Est le cœur généreux
et la tête dure comme le coude
Si jamais j'abandonnais
Alors que Dieu m'envoie la foudre
Et au final
Je parle deux fois mois que j'écoute
car c'est inscrit dans mon corps
J'ai deux oreilles mais une seule bouche
Everyday of my life
Je parle deux fois moins que j'écoute
car c'est écrit dans ma tête

Man made the trains to carry heavy loads
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
Man makes them happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can

Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by, you wish you could sex her
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter

Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served, and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much, you nearly split your pants

Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces

Is to become a monk and leave the situation

Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat

About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps

The daytime crap of the folksinger slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
I slap the turkey neck and it's hanging' from a pigeon wing

Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate

I'd write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high

For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend

And weak from strong that's a lot to learn

Would rather let me give you my heart

When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

And dreams were made and used and wasted

No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
(But the tigers come at night)
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
(As they tear your hope apart)
As they turn your dream to shame

And still I dreamed that she'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream [Version],2010

Count your blessings to find what you look for

But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry,
Oh I wanna' die

But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual it happens every day no matter what you say
You find it happens all the time

Love will never do what you want it to

Why can't this crazy love be-

Mine!

There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool

I smell like a mini bar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well!
It's a blacked out blur but I'm pretty sure
It ruled!
Damn!

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop, op (whoa, oh)
This Friday night, do it all again
This Friday night, do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor

Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale

You make it easier when life gets hard

Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you I promise you, I will

I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend

Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair

Though the breezes through trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

Change the voices in your head
Make them like you instead

Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same

Don't you ever, ever feel
Like your less than less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You are perfect to me

The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool in line and we try, try, try,
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
We change ourselves and we do it all the time

I just walked in to find you here, with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second, you'd be back to bother me

Oh now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now

Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames 'cause your greed sold me out in shame

After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that I hold resentment for you

Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter

Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game
I heard you're going 'round playing the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame 'cause you dug your own grave
After all of the fights and the lies 'cause you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore
No more, oh it's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down

And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.

We got nothing figured out

Two-thirty AM
When everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the ""Goodbye""
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

To cherish and to keep you, to honor you forever

My happily soon-to-be wife

Pardon me, is everybody here? Because if everybody's here, I
Want to thank you all for coming to the wedding, I'd appreciate
Your going even more, I mean you must have lots of better things
To do, and not a word of this to Will, remember Will, you know, 
The man I'm gonna marry, but I'm not, because I wouldn't ruin
Anyone as wonderful as he is

A wedding, what's a wedding, it's a prehistoric ritual
Where everybody promises fidelity forever, which is
Maybe the most horrifying word I ever heard of, which is
Followed by a honeymoon, where suddenly he'll realize he's
Saddled with a nut, and wanna kill me, which he should
Thanks a bunch, 
But I'm not getting married
Go have lunch, 
'Cause I'm not getting married
You've been grand, 
But I'm not getting married
Don't just stand there, 
I'm not getting married--
And don't tell Will, 
But I'm not getting married today.

Go, can't you go?
Why is no-
Body listening?
Goodbye
Go and cry
At another person's wake
If you're quick
For a kick
You could pick
Up a christening
But please
On my knees
There's a human life at stake! 

Listen everybody, I'm afraid you didn't hear, or do you want to
See a crazy lady fall apart in front of you, it isn't only Will
Who may be ruining his life, you know we'll both of us be losing
Our identities, I telephoned my analyst about it and he said to
See him Monday, but by Monday I'll be floating in the Hudson with
The other garbage
I'm not well, 
So I'm not getting married
You've been swell, 
But I'm not getting married
Clear the hall, 
'Cause I'm not getting married
Thank you all, 
But I'm not getting married
And don't tell Will, 
But I'm not getting married today.

Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong in spreading myself around

Their blood flows through my body, I need to taste the flesh exposing pulsing arteries
Removing vital organs
Not stopping till you've died
Puts from your eyes carnal ways indulge in the gore
Slaughtered you lie in a pile of warm guts

Constricted corpusles coagulating blood my drug a slave to its taste,
Reincarnated to human form, creating a race of immortal beings,
Rot away dead bodies, set a flame

Searing flesh, broken necks
You can't kill what already dead
De-evoulution, hunting for life
Cannibalism, immortality rip and slash

A society of mass murder
Bleeding slow
I take away your life, and leave you lying cold, decapitated body
Searching for its head

Anticipate apocalypse, rising dead dismembering
Hacking limbs bleeding, cracking ribs
Torture us

Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her

Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you

When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me

They're all moving so fast, trying hard to get past 
As I stand watching the world go by

And in the end when the day is over
When I ask myself just where the world is going
And what's been lost what's been gained 
Have our lives really changed
Then I laugh, but sometimes I want to cry 
Watching the world go by",Watching the World Go By,1996
Glen Buxton,"Please clean your plate dear
The Lord above can see you
Don't you know people are starving in Korea

Alcohol and razor blades and poison and needles
Kindergarten people, they use them, they need them

The over-indulgent machines were their children
There wasn't a way down on Earth here to cool them
'Cause they looked just like humans
At Kresge's and Woolworth's
But decadent brains were at work to destroy
Rats in batallions were ruling the street scene
Generation landslide
Closed the gap between 'em

And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies

Militant mothers hiding in their basements
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets

Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink high chairs
While Mother's Lib burned birth certificate papers
Dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer
Who's pubic to the world but involved in high finance

Sister's out till five doing banker's son's hours
But she owns a Maserati that's a gift from his father

Stopped at full speed at one hundred miles per hour

The Colgate invisible shield finally got 'em

But I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies

Glen Campbell,"Livin' in the city
Ain't never been my idea of gettin' it on
But the job demands that you make new plans
Before your big chance is gone
You get a house in the hills
You're payin' everyone's bills
And they tell you that you're gonna go far
But in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
""Is that who you really are?""

Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
But your mind's on Tennessee
Lookin' back, I can remember the time
When I sang my songs for free
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home

Talkin' on the telephone
Settin' up another day of people to meet
You've gotta do what's right
You've gotta spend the night
Stayin' in touch with the street
When you're surrounded by friends
They say the fun never ends
But I guess I'll never figure it out
'Cause in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
""Is this what it's all about?""

Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
But your mind's on Tennessee
Lookin' back, I can remember the time
When I sang my songs for free
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home

Glen Campbell,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Gentle on My Mind,
Glen Campbell,"Home is where I'm goin'
No matter how long it takes
And I've been livin' high 'n' free, love

So she can meet my plane
Well I don't know what I'll say to her
I've caused her so much pain

Houston, I'm-a comin' to see you
Houston, has it really been that lo-hong
I know I've been away

You know it's good to hear your voice again

Glen Campbell,"Come and listen you fellows, so young and so fine,
And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mines. 
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul, 
'Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal. 

[Chorus]
It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
It's a-many a man I have seen in my day, 
Who lived just to labor his whole life away. 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine, 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines. 

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll, 
My body will blacken and turn into coal. 
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, 
And pity the miner a-diggin' my bones.

[Chorus]",Dark as a Dungeon [*],1962
Glen Campbell,"I just bought me a great long ticket
I'm gonna use it at 4 P.M.

And break the news to him

Was on the strict Q.T.
So if you want your freedom P.D.Q.
Divorce me C.O.D.

I won't be around
To hear you cry

And by and by

Divorce me C.O.D.

There's gonna come a day, girl
When you'll be feelin' blue
You'll can't pay your little old bill
With a big old I.O.U.

May be T.N.T.

Down on your knees

Glen Campbell,"Now a lot of words have spelled the same with a different meanin' you see
But here's a brand new way to spell heaven and accordin' to me
You take a K and an E and an N and a T and you see K why
That spells Kentucky but it means paradise
You take a chicken and you kill it
And you throw it in the skillet and you fry up a golden brown
That's southern cookin' taste mighty nice
It don't cover a lot when you look on a map
But I once studied geography when I sat in my mama's lap
You take K E N T you see K why that spells Kentucky but it means paradise

It don't cover a lot...
Yes that spells Kentucky but it means paradise

Glen Campbell,"Tonight, I find out
Just what you're all about
-I'm the one that's come looking for you
I got the bottle, baby It's all you-
Showed up to the room about 3 or 4
Ladies running, running right out the door

We came here to party like
Its going out (oh shit)

We'll do this the whole night
This could be what we needed
-We can do what we want to-
A single melody to give this meaning
-This memory is making moves-

We came here to party like
Its going out of style

I'm ready to go
I got the bacardi
We got the bottle topped
Who's ready for more?
Let's start this party
We got everything you're looking for

We came here to party like
Its going out (oh shit)

We'll do this the whole night

I am a rambling man I just ramble this world around
I've always been a roubler boy since my girl turned me down

Glen Campbell,"Well, I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
Well, a little place called Hamburger Den
I heard that old jukebox start playin'
A tune called truck driving man

The waitress then brought me some coffee
I thanked her but called her again
I said that old song sure does hit me
'Cause I'm a truck driving man
Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I put a nickel in the jukebox
And played the truck driving man

I climbed back aboard my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck we used to roll in
Now I'm on my way to San Antone

When I get my call up to glory
They'll take me away from this land
I'll head this old truck up to heaven

Glen Campbell,"Once there were green fields kissed by the sun 
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run 
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above 
Once they were part of an everlasting love 
We were the lovers who strolled through green fields 

Green fields are gone now, parched by the sun 
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run 
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart 
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart 
Where are the green fields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away 
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see 

But I'll keep on waitin' 'til you return 
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy while your heart's on the roam 
You can't be happy until you bring it home
Home to the green fields and me once again",Green Fields,1963

And I don't give a damn about a greenback-a dollar
Spend it fast as I can
For a wailin' song and a good guitar
