Benny Goodman & His Orchestra,"When the moon hangs low in Napoli
There's a handsome gondolier
Every night he sings so happily
So his lady love can hear
In a manner oh gravissimo
He repeats his serenade,
And his heart beats so fortissimo
When she raises her Venetian shade

Ciribiribin, chiribiribin, ciribiribin

Ciribiribin, he waits for her each night beneath her balcony
Ciribiribin, he begs to hold her tight, but no, she won't agree
Ciribiribin, she throws a rose and blows a kiss from up above
Ciribiribin, ciribiribin, ciribiribin, they're so in love

(Orchestral Interlude)

Ciribiribin, ciribiribin, ciribiribin, they're so in love",Ciribiribin,
Benny Goodman & His Orchestra,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good",
Benny Goodman & His Orchestra,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;",The Sheik of Araby,
Benny Goodman & His Orchestra,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.",After You've Gone,
Benny Goodman & His Orchestra,"'Cause my hair is curly

That's the difference, maybe, why they call me

Why don't you shine?

Benny Goodman & His Orchestra,"There's an empty place inside that is hurting me
A place that keeps my heart out on it's own
A disconnected function of my wretchedness
That keeps me so hard pressed 
It's a place where words are spoken you
Will never hear
A broken bridge of lines that just won't come
An empty lung that won't give the wind
To speak at me
How far can it be from home

Why you gotta be so mean to me
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need
So why you gotta be so mean to me

Do you think that it got up and left
For good this time
A crowd of faceless strangers moving on
A feeling that you left it all behind you now
That it doesn't hurt somehow
To know

Why you gotta be so mean to me
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need
So why you gotta be so mean to me

So open up the book that you keep deep inside
Let the pages yellow in the sun
Show them that you're not afraid to let them see
How far you can be From home

Why you gotta be so mean to me
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need
So why you gotta be so fucking mean to me
Why you gotta be 
Why you gotta be
Why you gotta be 
Why you gotta be
Why you gotta be 
Why you gotta be
Why you gotta be so mean to me",Mean to Me,1958
Benny Goodman & His Orchestra,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance",A Fine Romance,1958

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

Benny Goodman & His Orchestra,"I jumped out of the fryin' pan
And right into the fire
When I lost me a cheatin' man

And right into the fire

How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

Of the day repeat

Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,

Were parted by only a slight thing.

Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,

Such pride inside me has woken,

By and by,
When the final farewells must be spoken.
I'll join the Legion,
That's what I'll do.
And in some far distant region,
Where human hearts are staunch and true,
I shall start my life anew.
Good-bye, it's time
I sought a foreign clime,
Where I may find
there are hearts more kind
Than I leave behind.
And so, I go,
To fight a savage foe,
Although I know that
I'll be sometimes missed by the girls I've kissed.
In some Abyssinian French Dominion
I shall do my bit,
And fall for the flag if I must.
Where the desert sand is nice and handy,

You won't see my heels for the dust.

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Benny Goodman & His Orchestra,"Mr. Irving Berlin
Often emphasizes sin
In a charming way.
Mr. Coward we know
Wrote a song or two to show
Sex was here to stay.
Richard Rodgers it's true
Took a more romantic view
Of this sly biological urge.
But it really was Cole
Who contrived to make the whole
Thing merge.

He said the Belgians and Greeks do it
Nice young men who sell antiques do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Monkeys whenever you look do it,
Aly Khan and King Farouk do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Louella Parsons can't quite do it,
For she's so highly strung,
Marlene might do it,
But she looks far too young.
Each man out there shooting crap does it,
Davy Crockett in that dreadful cap does it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Our famous writers in swarms do it,
Somerset and all the Maughams do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
The Brontes felt that they must do it,
Ernest Hemingway could-just-do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
E. Allan Poe-ho! ho! ho!-did it,
But he did it in verse.
H. Beecher Stowe did it,
But she had to rehearse.
Tennessee Williams self-taught does it,
Kinsey with a deafening report does it.
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

In the Spring of the year
Inhibitions disappear
And our hearts beat high,
We had better face facts
Every gland that overacts
Has an alibi
For each bird and each bee,
Each slap-happy sappy tree,
Each temptation that lures us along
Is just Nature elle-meme
Merely singing us the same
Old song.

In Texas some of the men do it
Others drill a hole-and then do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love
West Point cadets forming fours do it,
People say all those Gabors do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
My kith and kin, more or less, do it,
Every uncle and aunt,
But I confess to it
I've one cousin that can't.
Teenagers squeezed into jeans do it,
Probably we'll live to see machines do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Each baby bat after dark does it,
In the desert Wilbur Clark does it
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
We're told that every hormone does it,
Victor Borge all alone does it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Each tiny clam you consume does it,
Even Liberace-we assume-does it,

That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that so but I tried to go
And leave you behind, what did I find?

I took a trip on the train and I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane and I thought about you
Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream
At every stop that we made, oh, I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade, then I really felt blue

I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesí
A lovely señorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesí?

When you grow old, you don't last long
You're here today and then tomorrow you're gone
I loved a gal for many years gone by
I thought her love for me would never die
She made some changes that would never do
From now on I'm goin' to make some changes too

There's a change in the sea
So, from now on there'll be a change in me
My walk will be different, my talk and my name
Nothin' about me is goin' to be the same
I'm goin' to change my way of livin' if that ain't enough
Then I'll change the way that I strut my stuff
'Cause nobody wants you when you're old and gray
There'll be some change made

They say, 'the old time things are the best'
That may be very good for all the rest
But I'm goin' to let the old things be
'Cause they are certainly not suited for me
There was a time when I thought that way
That's why I'm all alone here, today
Since everyone of these days seeks something new
From now on I'm goin' to seek some new things too

For there's a change in the fashions
Ask the feminine folks
Even Jack Benny has been changing jokes
I must make some changes from old to the new
I must do things just the same as others do
I'm goin' to change my long, tall mama for a little short fat
Goin' to change the number where I live at
I must have some lovin', or I'll fade away

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Remain to love until they droop and die

No gal! I mean just what I say

Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part

Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps.
Once I was young,
But never was naive.
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve.

[Chorus:]
I didn't know what time it was,
Then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was,
You held my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was,
And I'll say it was grand.
Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.
I didn't know what time it was,
Life was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And I know what time it is now

Once I was old
Twenty years or so
Rather well preserved,
The wrinkles didn't show.
Once I ws old,
But not too old for fun.
I used to hunt for little girls
Up my imaginary gun.
But now I aim for only one!

Benny Green Quintet,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

Benny Green Trio,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

We may waken again to find
We've long been judged so blind, so deaf.

That I may leave a legacy of love for you

God will bring reality from a dream.

They're not what I am

Inmediatamente el aire me faltó
Si es verdad que tengo yo una alma gemela
Eres tú lo más cercano a ese rumor

Por que puedo ver en tus ojos 
Que en mi pasado y mi presente estas tú

Fue en la calle mientras mi vida tiraba 
El destino entre los dos se a travesó 
Fue un instante mientras me recuperaba 
Encontré valor y descubri el amor 

Por que puedo ver en tus ojos 
Que en mi pasado y mi presente estas tú 

Dame tu mano ¿por qué estas aqui? 
Y acércate a mi ¿y quien eres tú? 

No tengas miedo es el momento 
Abre tus alas y volemos 

Cruzando los mares
Pintando las nubes
Abriendo horizontes 
Haciendonos uno con el sol

Fue tan sólo ayer cuando te conocía 
Tu sonrisa desde entonces me embriagó 
Y los días no han pasado entre nosotros
Pues el tiempo ha sido aliado de los dos
Y es que puedo ver en tus ojos
Que en mi presente y mi futuro sigues tú

Dame tu mano

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free

What is a baby, without his favorite lul-a-bye?
What is leaving without a soft goodbye kiss?
It might be alright, but I want it all.

So, tell me what life is, without enjoying the ride.
What is winning, without, without the feeling of pride?
Tell me what love is, what love is, without you by my side.
It might be alright, but

I want it all, I want it now, 
I want the world to show me how,
I want to sing and dance, 
And make good love, and sweet romance,
I want a dream when it comes true,
I want to spend my nights with you
I want it all, but most of all
I want you

You know, I do.

What is forgiveness, without letting go?
What is an angel, without, without miracles to show?
Tell me what life is, what my life is, without you in my heart.

No I won't tell you a thing

Before I hit the ground
All I leave behind me
Is only what I found

If you can abide it
Let the hurdy gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here
Before they flew away

I will not condemn you
Nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you
But failing, will not die

It's only fractured
And a little nervous from the fall

I hate to see that evening sun go down

If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St Louis Blues,1995
Benny Waters,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

But my baby don't love nobody but me, nobody but me

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise

What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Sans faire un calembour
Il arrive encore qu'un prof
Me jette hors du cours

Peut-être parce que je suis gosse
Dans tous mes souvenirs

N'empêche que des larmes coulent
Des coins de chaque oeil
Quand la solitude vient faire
Ses griffes sur ma grande gueule
Seul à seul avec moi
J'ai un stylo au bout des doigts
J'écris et je voudrais
Que ça s'arrête jamais

Sous les saules pleureurs
Et contre les fenêtres

Benoît Dorémus,"Autour de lui on s’est dit qu'c’était pas une racaille
Apres tout on l’a pas flingué sur la rocaille
Ça va s’en dire mais il a fait un temps de chiotte
Le jour où j ai béni le cercueil de mon pote

On a été ennemis, j’y ai repensé sous la pluie
Mais qui l’a pas était parmi ceux autour de lui
Tôt ou tard? Déjà la veille partait Philippe Léotard
T’étais pareil: paumé, maudit, mais t’étais une star

En 5ème D y fumait des clopes aux cours de maths
Des spliffs à la récré, moi, j'crapotais deux lattes
A cet enterrement tout a refait surface
J’oublierai ni ta voix ni tes yeux ni ta face

Ça fait chialer quand à 20 ans quelqu’un s’en va
Mais il faut dire aussi qu’on est pas fait pour ça
Dieu, le vrai paradis c’est quand on était enfant
Ton paradis Christian on va foutre le boxon dedans

Attends-toi à de la baston, y en aura, pas de doute
Attends-toi à voir tous tes anges bourrés jouer au foot
Autour de lui, attends-toi à le voir tenter le diable
T’es prévenu, Christian, il est irrémédiable

Pourvu que t'aimes Bob Marley autant que la joie et la paix
Ce serait dommage qu'il est à imposer son respect
Autour de lui on fait sur soi quand on l’a contre soi
Par contre crois-moi t’es fier quand il est fier de toi

Il m’a appris à faire des bulles de salive qui volent
Y a longtemps, du temps d'nos blâmes de conduite à l’école
Y avait autour de lui dans les bulles qui s’envolaient
L’ art de vivre que j’interprète un peu maintenant qu’ il est...

Toujours avoir sur soi de quoi payer l’amende
Toujours avoir du feu quand on te le demande
Et s'il te vient parfois des phrases pas trop moches
Alors toujours avoir un stylo dans la poche

Et essayer pourquoi pas d’être un bon écrivain
Se foutre du sommet, se foutre du ravin
Etre seul au besoin, assumer, être digne
Lire la ligne a Léo puis aller à la ligne

Des points cardinaux, ne jamais perdre le sud
Etre insolent et promettre de perdre l’habitude
Etre un mauvais exemple, mais suivre une bonne étoile
S’amuser à faire chier l'araignée sur sa toile

Se sentir bien partout, nulle part, être déphasé
Noter des trucs partout, pour s’immortaliser
Pas se pointer aux exams, et être satisfait
Enfin quoi, me dis pas que tu l’as jamais fait

Bien sûr que je tiens plus que tout a la vie qui continue
Maintenant que je vois des trucs invisibles à l’œil nu
J’embrasse deux fois plus Léo, je donne un peu, j'écoute
J’ai tendance à rouler au milieu de la route

J’oubliais, soûler mais rendre heureuse la fille que t’aimes

Jusqu'à l'année dernière
Renaud qui déboule quand ma vie
Faut voir de quelle manière!
Renaud qui déroule un tapis
Sous ma petite carrière
Quand tu connais l'histoire
Y a de quoi tomber par terre

J'ai quand même eu la loose
Bien collée à la peau
Je me suis bien flanqué le blues
Collé à France Info
J'ai quand même eu le flouze
Bien planqué sous zéro
J'ai divisé par 12 mes bonnes blagues
Et mes conseils aux poteaux

""Vos chansons je dis bravo
Benito, ça m'a grave plu
Mais ça ressemble grave à Renaud...""
Tous les jours c'est ce qu'il a fallu
Que je me tape mot pour mot
C'est pas que j'voulais lâcher
Juste que j'allais crever
Ou mourir tout au plus

Dans le parcours, tout doucement,
J'ai perdu ma gonzesse
Le stress nous a trop longtemps
Bandé dans les fesses
La vie qu'on voulait rose
On l'a eue rose P.Q
On voulait vivre mille choses
On a à peine survécu

Un couple ça tient pas la misère
Et encore moins à Paname
Et face à mes mille colères
Ca tient pas, une bonne femme
S'en fout que je sois disque d'or
Mais pas disque noir
Faut que je vous dise que je dors
En boxant mes cauchemars

Un jour mon pote Sarclo
Me confie une vieille guitare
Sur le thème t'aimes bien Renaud?
Va lui refiler de ma part
Et refile-lui ton album
J'arrive face au bonhomme
Je lui remets l'objet rare
Et aussi la guitare

Mouais, il le soupèse un peu
Mon pe tit autoproduit
(Parenthèse, merci à tous ceux
Qui me connaissent pas d'aujourd'hui)
Le v'là qui lit les paroles
Rallume une cigarette
Benito surveille son idole
Comme une vieille chouette

Ca vaut tous les dollars
Ce que j'ai entendu dire
Par le mec au foulard
Par le maître à écrire
Se faire appeler Petit con
Parler de moi dans son bar
Paname m'a vu me pavaner
Ce jour-là tu peux me croire

Alors j'ai fréquenté un peu
L'absurdité suprême
Le matin à l'ANPE
Et avec toi l'aprèm
Ou encore pendant que je tombe
Sur le répondeur de mon ex
C'est sur le mien que tu laisses
Des messages de 10 plombes!

Trop content qu'on soit deux
Dans mon égotrip
Renaud comme producteur, mon Dieu
Mais comme c'est romantique!
Toi la star, moi le charclo
Réunis par Sarclo
J'allais me démerder sans
Mais c'est mieux avec toi!

Ceux qui m'ont pris pour un flingue
Vachement bien imité
Tous ceux qui m'ont rendu dingue
Je vais les laisser comparer

C'est eux qui disent plus rien!",Deux dans Mon Egotrip (Acte 3),2007
Benoît Dorémus,"J'ai enlevé mes pompes sous la table
J'ai mis ma tête entre mes bras
Je viens d'exploser mon portable
Je me mords la lèvre du bas
Je suis fatigué, je veux voir personne
Dehors j'entends des rires de connes
Je vais les tuer si je ferme pas la fenêtre
Ma mère pourrait pas me reconnaître
Je ressemble à moi-même dans 20 ans
Je traverse l'enfer, métaphoriquement

J'ai eu ce coup de fil d'un type que j'ai
Pas vu depuis des années, il est
Tout content d'avoir vu ma gueule
En tapant mon nom dans Google
Ce type qu'en plus j'aimais même pas
A pognon, maison et tout ça
Consultant, chef de projet de mes deux
Ça me fait mal de le sentir heureux
""Eh ! m'oublie pas quand tu seras une star!""
Je t'aurai oublié bien avant ça connard!

C'est quoi cette vocation maudite?
Je suis même pas un bon chanteur
J'ai dû être un sacré pauvre type
Dans une damnée vie antérieure
Avec ma paie je me gratte le cul
Choisir entre bouffe et loyer
Pas le quart de ce qu'il aurait fallu
Ouais c'est la merde qu'est-ce tu croyais!
L'écriture n'est plus mon amour
Mais une fleur puante que j'arrose tous les jours!

C'est dur de se dire qu'il y a autant de glands
Et que pourtant personne t'attend
C'est fou de se dire qu'en bossant dur
On devient fou tellement ça dure
Je me fous bien des malheurs du monde
Je veux une vie normale juste deux secondes
Il paraît que mes chansons réchauffent
Mais ce que ça me plairait une vie de beauf!
Que je pense à ceux qui dorment dehors?
Et puis quoi encore! Que je pense aux morts?

Je peux pas me projeter au-delà de demain
Concerts sur fond de papier peint
Sur fonds de poches, sur bruits de fond
Ceux qui font de la merde ont raison!
Moi aussi je veux qu'on m'aime, et d'une,
Et de deux je veux ma part de thunes
Alors j'essaye de me concentrer
Sur ceux qu'ont même pas à bouffer
Mais je n'arrive qu'à penser à ceux
Qui se prélassent

Je vis de quoi voter socialiste
Jusqu'à ma mort, et je porte ma croix
Mon existence est belle et triste
Comme de la neige qui tient pas
C'est sûr on nage en plein délire
Si faut être malheureux pour écrire
J'aimais autant rester lecteur...
Tiens, j'ai qu'à penser aux acteurs
Il paraît qu'ils en bavent autant
Que sur l'enfer ils en savent autant

Benito a mal à la tête
Il voudrait dormir juste six mois
Se réveiller sans aucune dette
Et qu'on lui rende ce qu'on lui doit
Je voudrais faire plaisir à voir
Quand je rends visite à mes potes
Je suis pas sûr de pas me mettre à boire
Et pourtant je n'aime que la flotte
Je vais chourer un portable au magasin du coin

Dire que tout finira par me sembler si loin",L' Enfer (Acte 2),2007
Benoît Dorémus,"Excusez-moi j’ai dû sortir
Pour aller gerber
J’ai eu une vision d’avenir
Et ça m'a plombé
Me suis vu, comment dire...
Merdeux et salarié
J’ai vu à quoi ma vie
Pourrait bien ressembler
J’ai vu le bureau d’un chef
La machine à café
Les réunions, les bénefs
Et l’air climatisé
Une vie sans relief
Directement reliée
A la mort, enfin bref
Une vie à gerber

Y avait plus le héros
De mes rêves de gamin
""Adesias Benito
Le chanteur écrivain""
Y avait plus qu’un blaireau
Sage au milieu des siens
Les collègues de bureau
J'ai gerbé comme un chien
Je vais cramer mon C.V.
Et garder que mes textes
Je vais signer d’un B
Avec accent circonflexe
Des mots exacerbés
Pour Léo, pour Alex,
Le reste me fait gerber
Je veux garder ce réflexe

J'ai franchement pas dans l'idée d'me rendre malade à crever, de m'r'trouver à faire comme le padre un métier que j'peux pas encadrer!
J'envisage avec l'âge d'ouvrir la cage au passage au petit con pas sage qu'en fait j'ai toujours été!
Et sur lequel j'ai jamais eu le contrôle
Rien qu'à voir le boxon dans ma piaule...

Dis Léo, je me demande
Si tu prends pas un risque
A m’aimer, à me défendre
Avant mon premier disque
Toi tu me vois légende
C est un peu optimiste
Chérie si je me viande
J'ai peur que tu sois triste
Il se peut ma Léo
Que j’arrive à que dalle
Que je tombe K.O.
Sous les premières balles
Que tu tombes de haut
Sur ma pierre tombale
""Adesias Benito
Mort trop tôt."" L'idéal

Ce serait, tu t’en doutes,
Que mes mots touchent quelqu’un
A part toi qui m’écoutes
Et deux ou trois copains
Ce serait qu'on me goûte
Et puis qu'on m’aime bien
Rien que ça, et j'ajoute
Qu’on me trouve beau! Hein?
Je rêve un peu? Faut pas?
Et j'fais quoi à la place?
Je fais comme eux, c’est ça?
Une petite vie sans trace?
Mais je pourrais plus marcher droit
Ni te sourire en face
Léo, écoute-moi
Je sais ce qu il faut que je fasse...

J'ai franchement pas dans l'idée de me rendre malade à crever, de me retrouver à faire comme le padre un métier que je peux pas encadrer!
J'envisage avec l'âge d'ouvrir la cage au passage au petit con pas sage qu'en fait j'ai toujours été!
Y a dix mille kilos de pression sur mes petites épaules
Mais rien qu'un en moins, rien qu'un, et ce serait pas drôle...

Il m’a fallu du temps
Pour expliquer aux vieux
Qu'ils m’ont mis dans le sang
De l’encre, et c’est tant mieux
Je peux plus vivre sans
Ou alors malheureux
Ils ont compris, maintenant
Faut que j’y arrive, nom de Dieu!
Regardez bien, je deviens
Un putain de chanteur
Une saloperie d’écrivain
Et mon propre employeur
En baver? Faudra bien
Mais ça me fait même pas peur
Moins que le quotidien
Qu'on me propose ailleurs
J'emmerde comme il se doit
Les donneurs de conseils
Du style ""Petit, crois-moi
Je suis un vieux de la vieille
Il faut faire ci, dire ça
Si tu veux que ça paye!""
Et je lève bien haut mon doigt
A tous ceux qui essayent
Et à ceux qu’essayeront
De faire dévier ma route
J'écoute ni les cons
Ni les autres, dans le doute
Tout seul, c’est peut-être plus long
Mais je sais ce que ça coûte
Je sais ce que ça me coûte
Et c’est un chèque à mon nom!

J'ai franchement pas dans l'idée de me rendre malade à crever, de me retrouver à faire comme le padre un métier que je peux pas encadrer

On est pas si nombreux à avoir la gaule
On peut baiser la vie à tour de rôle...

Rapport à tous les mots qui sortent et qui se jettent

Je prends deux minutes pour insister sur ce point
C'est pas pour faire le coq, mais je voudrais faire taire
Ceux qui voudraient déjà me faire des commentaires

Ce que j'écris ça r'garde que moi
J'aime trop les taches que ça laisse sur les doigts

Je me réfugie sur une feuille de papier
D'autres jours où il est un peu trop grand pour moi

Ou à l'inverse quand il ne tient plus en place

C'est MOI qui paye, c'est MOI qui ai les yeux cernés

Et je suis déjà au courant que j'ai des influences
Et je suis certain que vous saisissez la nuance
Moi je ne suis nulle part dans l'ordre alphabétique

Benoît Dorémus,"J'aime pas apprendre j'aime savoir, je suis pas un mec qui retient les leçons, j'apprends rien je suis un con, je vis sur mes acquis et mes acquis c'est pas les bons. Mon cerveau coince par endroits, quelque chose a dû cramer dans l'hemisphère droit. Comme la jeter par la fenêtre cent fois mentalement, quand elle cause à des gens et que des gens lui causent, je chronomètre, j'implose, j'attends, c'est pas ce que je sais faire de plus intelligent, j'ai l'hémisphère gauche au courant. Mais elle trouve qu'on peut frôler la main d'un type par accident, ça signifie rien pour autant, trois fois de suite non plus bien sûr, y a rien de louche, ça arrive tout le temps, tout le temps, tu m'enlèves les mots de la bouche c'est troublant. Ils ont les yeux sur ton cul mais tu vois pas le rapport, nan? Rien que moi je le mate à mort et je le connais pourtant. Je veux plus entendre parler de ça, je veux plus parler de ça, je veux plus de ça. Mais je suis hônnete au moins tu peux pas m'enlever ça. Soulève n'importe quel mot, coucou, la jalousie est planquée dessous, la petite salope me saute au cou, elle serre fort et je vois flou. J'essaie de fuir mais je te jure que c'est pas facile à genoux. Elle demande mine de rien: avant moi y en a eu combien? Est-ce qu'on peut compter ces gens sur les doigts d'une seule main? T'en penses quoi t'y penses quand? Pourquoi tu t'en souviens? Les questions, les réponses, la petite prend tout en main, au besoin la petite salope est aussi plutôt douée en dessin. Et elle a de la mémoire. Elle voudrait savoir, c'était quoi l'autre soir cet air que t'avais en partant, en rentrant, j'ai comme senti flotter un truc qui flotte pas normalement. Comme je te le demande pas c'est elle qui m'en fait voir. J'ai les images en mouvement, le son, tout, les gros plans, derrière, devant, mon orgueil champ/contrechamp. Je sens que tout le monde me voit, j'essaye de pas trop penser à la caméra.En société je fais ce que je peux pour cacher mon profil droit. Jaloux, moi? Vous plaisantez ou quoi? Tu rentres tard? On te raccompagnera? Est-ce qu'y a bien une capote dans ton sac à main? Fais-toi les ongles, j'ai fini les miens, je vais commencer à me bouffer les doigts. Tout va bien, n'est-ce pas?

Elle me dit et elle a raison
La jalousie est un poison
Qui rend con

Un poison lent qui flingue les nerfs
Tout ceux qui pensent que j'exagère
Je baise leur mère

Elle me dit pendant que je dégueule
La jalousie ne rend tout seul
Que ceux qui le veulent

J'm'étouffe en beuglant ""c'est pas vrai""
Je suis né avec et j'en crèverai
Si ce n'est fait...

Paraît que c'est la façon que j'ai de me dire à moi-même que je m'aime pas, mais j'y crois pas, je me passerais bien d'un détail ou deux quoi, ça s'arrête là. Quel merdier. Je m'endors le dernier, les mâchoires serrées comme un cadavre froid. Arrête! Arrête? Comment veux-tu que j'arrête! Est-ce qu'on pourrait parler d'autre chose? Comment veux-tu qu'on parle d'autre chose? Le mal est fait, le mot est faible, chérie. J'ai déjà bien tapé dans mon espérance de vie. Les prénoms du passé mettent du plomb dans tout ce que je bouffe, les coups de fil qui font chier, presque tous, du sang dans ce que je tousse, c'est tes histoires, ça me regarde pas c'est ça? Faut que je le respecte, c'est précieux? Jardin secret de mes deux! Mais c'est la vie, bah oui, t'as ton jardin aussi, bah oui, un rien plus petit, mais la tolérance, je suis à peine en train d'apprendre comment ça se danse et je retiens pas les pas alors je balance à bout portant des propos talibans. Vite, vite, trouve-moi un truc pour taper dedans. Mais téléphone pas en t'éloignant, t'éloigne pas en téléphonant, te marre pas ils sont pas marrants. Nan j'ai pas été humilié quand j'étais gosse, pas d'épisode atroce pour expliquer le raisonnement. Tu vas chialer? Nan! Mais si, en me parlant de confiance. Je vais m'excuser ""ça va me passer tu sais"", un peu de patience, quelques réglages, c'est encore de mon âge, ""ça va me passer tu sais, c'est juste que je m'y ferai jamais"". Cette certitude me fout une chiasse d'enfer. Elle me manque l'époque où je savais faire celui que ton passé intéresse, y m'intéressait même beaucoup, je savais pas qu'il me rendrait fou, le stress que ce serait mon Dieu si j'étais pas un bon coup! Tout ce que t'as dit je l'ai enregistré et je l'utilise contre toi. T'as rien dit de mal y paraît mais la petite salope démord pas, elle m'dit ouais, qui te dit qu'elle est où elle a dit qu'elle allait, peut-être bien qu'elle est en train de baiser à l'heure qu'il est...

Elle me dit et je dis non, sans déc'
La jalousie me rend infect
Et tout sec

J'ai un sourire qui signifie
Passe une jourée dans ma folie
J'te défie

Elle me dit et je fais le sourd
La jalousie c'est pas de l'amour
Je me goure

Benoît Dorémus,"Vous trouvez pas qu’on étouffe, ici ? Non ? Alors ça vient d’moi ? On dirait qu’y fait cent degrés mais vous avez raison, ça s’peut même pas. C’est la faute aux pensées qui montent et à mon p’tit cœur qui suit pas. 

Y m’fout la honte à battre la samba, ça m’prend comme ça, paf, putain crise d’angoisse, le sismographe en panique, douze litres de sueur qui poisse, sauf si ça non plus ça s’peut même pas ? Malaise vagal mental 

J’trimballe dans ma poche partout et par tous les temps un Xanax anti-pétoche, rose et rassurant. J’croque dedans, tac, discrétos dans les dents, j’attends qu’son goût dégueulasse fasse l’effet que j’en attends.

Quand j’peux plus faire face, quand j’sais plus c’qui s’passe, à la ramasse à la fois brûlant et tout blanc, un p’tit tour de chimie, un p’tit tour de magie, des molécules se battent à notre place, comment y f’saient avant ?

Ben quoi les gars on va quand même pas s’priver d’la science non ? Flippés ok mais pas trop cons. Passés du Néolithique aux anxiolytiques, on fait plus la chasse, non, mais on prend des cach’tons. 

Et je m’dis que j’m’inquiète pour rien
Et j’gobe 20 mg tous les matins 
Et je m’dis que j’m’inquiète pour rien
Dans mon immeuble à faire pareil, on est combien ?

« Qu’est-ce que la crainte de la misère, sinon la misère elle-même ? ». Voilà une saine pensée comme je les aime, mais moi j’ai pas la sagesse de Khalil Gibran, je stresse, j’ai c’putain de p’tit vélo dans l’crâne.

Rien à faire quand t’es dans cet état, t’es en enfer et j’me ramasse tous les matins à la p’tite cuillère, les gars j’ai pu d’nerfs et moins d’appétit qu’un barracuda, vas-y Bouddha, essaye de n’avoir pas souffert. 

Des nœuds dans l’cerveau, la tête entre les coudes, j’porte le monde sur mes épaules comme dans Hey Jude ! On klaxonne, je sursaute. Allez, démarrage en côte. Qu’est-ce qu’on va faire de moi quand tout sera devenu ma faute ? 

Y en a, ça s’voit, j’vous jure, ils ont pas même pas peur. Mon Dieu, j’donnerais une couille pour être des leurs, débouler dans la vie, tel un kéké sur un jetski, badaboum, peu d’abus, pas d’habits, tout dans l’regard… j’me vois d’ici. 

Moi si jamais on m’dit qu’on m’aime, pourquoi tout c’que j’entends c’est « T’es qu’une merde ! » Mais j’avance en séance avec mon psy, j’suis pas tout seul à être tout seul, je l’ai enfin compris. 

REFRAIN

Si y avait moins d’connards, si y avait moins d’horreurs, j’suis tout bouffé d’complexes mais le contexte m’écœure. J’vis dans un téléphone plus intelligent qu’moi, quand il est sur vibreur, putain je suis sur marteau-piqueur. 

J’essaie de mettre des beignes à mon désespoir. J’démêle le vrai du faux, même le contradictoire, j’ai ma vie cognitive, ma psychanalyse, « Tenez bon, lâchez prise », j’aime bien qu’on m’le dise. 
 
Docteur, grosse prime si on m’bute ma déprime, si on m’la renvoie – bim ! - au fond des abîmes. J’veux plus retrouver un ch’veu d’cette pute sur mes futs. Jusqu’ici j’ai préféré être un enfant qu’un adulte.

C’était bien plus fastoche, les mains sur mon bicross, j’le vois maintenant qu’j’avance dans la crasse à coups d’pioche, maintenant que l’angoisse a pénétré mes méninges, oui tout à fait, un peu comme Ariel au cœur du linge.

J’déteste qu’on m’demande « Ouh la ! ça va, toi ? », et j’déteste qu’on s’inquiète pour moi. Qui qu’a tout bousillé mon plexus solaire ? Qui qu’a mis « Peut mieux faire » sur mes bulletins scolaires ?

Y'avait peu de monde et plus de bagnoles 
Que des braves gens sur leurs guibolles 
Alors j'ai mis ma tête sous mon bonnet 
Et j'suis descendu voir ça de plus près 
C'était bon de laisser mes empruntes avec mes petites pinces 
Pas bien profondes parce que j'suis tout mince 
J'ai patiné de ma porte devant 
Jusqu'au parc Georges Brassens 
Putain de Georges 
Je pensais à elle 
Est-ce qui y'avait autant de neige dans le dix-septième 
Est-ce que là-bas on batifole 
Est-ce qu'elle m'aimait encore 
Est-ce qu'elle était aux Batignolles 
Dans mes oreilles 
Eminem en boucle comme tous les jours de doute 
Marshall vas y prête moi ta haine 
Ta détresse c'est la mienne 
Putain de Georges 
J'soufflais ma buée dans les allées 
Quand à vingt mètres 
J'ai aperçu la statut du maître illustre 
Enfin son buste 
Avec sa moustache de marbre 
Auprès de son arbre 
Des gamins faisaient une bataille 
Et la neige collait bien 
J'me suis dit tu vas voir 
Je vais m'faire le Brassens en pleine poire 
Putain de Georges 
J'pensais l'avoir du premier coup 

Tous mes hivers mis bout à bout 
J'en ai lancé un bon paquet à mon neveu 
Je l'imaginais taper des gants 
Avec un petit rire amoureux 
Elle est partie ma boule de rage 
Dans le décor 
J'y avais mis tout mon cœur 
L'été d'avant au même endroit 
On s'était couché sur les fleurs 
Les boules suivantes pas tellement mieux 
J'me suis dit oh j'deviens bigleux 
Brassens gueulé olé olé 
Puis y'en a une qui la frôlé 
Alors il faisait le malin mais moins 
Les gosses rigolaient 
Elle en voulait plus mais moi j'en voulais 
Et avec ses yeux s'il vous plaît 
Putain de Georges 
Crevant d'orgueil j'ai canardé 
Zing zong en fermant un œil 
Et sans tricher sans m'approcher 
Donc digne face à l'échec 
Est ce qu'un peu elle pensait à moi 
Est ce qu'heureuse elle faisait avec 
Est ce qu'elle allait faire un bonhomme 
Avec son nouveau mec 
Putain de Georges 
Putain de Georges 
Putain de Georges 
Et puis paf le tire parfait 
Et le parc entier qui m'acclamait 
L’apothéose 
Ose me dire que tu m'aimes plus 
Ose 
J'ai pris mes quinze secondes de gloire 
Puis j'avais froid j'en ai eu marre 
Pars 
T'as tout gâché toute notre histoire 
Et moi j'l'ai eu Brassens

Benoît Dorémus,"Elle m’a occupé
La moitié d’la tête
Et même l’autre moitié
Une année complète

Moi je suis du genre
À aimer si fort
Que même quand je dors
J’ai tout qui s’inquiète

L’amour, j’ai jamais pigé
C’est fait pour s’sentir léger
Moi c’est lourd que je le ressens
Mais c’est bien pire sans

Les regrets me montent
Quand je le raconte
Et puis la colère

J’vous entends déjà 
Me dire : y faut pas !
Je peux rien y faire

Elle a piraté
La moitié d’mon lit
M’a manipulé
Le corps et l’esprit






Moi je suis du genre
À m’avouer vaincu 
D’avoir tant vécu
En Tachycardie 

L’amour, la flèche dans la cible
C’est fait pour rendre invincible
Moi je fais que perdre mon sang
Mais c’est bien pire sans

On s’faisait trop d’peine
Pour nos p’tites trentaines
J’voulais d’la douceur

J’expliquais l’idée
La simplicité
Ça prenait des heures

On a bataillé
Pour l’histoire du verre
Rempli à moitié
Vide, si tu préfères

Moi je suis du genre
À faire un scandale
À la fin du bal
Quand tout dégénère

Non mais qu'est-ce que tu crois

On explique un peu on sort le blabla 
Il est là pour ça 
On disparaît pas

Puisqu'on s'en remettra

Me voilà planté comme un mauvais choix 
J'ai un vieux message ou j’entends ta voix 
Je l'écoute encore mais bientôt basta 
T'es qu'une petit caillera de 24 carats 
Je sais pas ce que j'ai fait mais ça m'apprendra 
Je sais pas ce que je croyais mais bon débarras 
J'ai fait deux petites croix dans mon agenda 
Une rouge et une bleu 
Souvenir d'un chaud froid 
Encore une semaine deux maximum trois 
Et je t'emportais partout avec moi 
J'allais presque croire à ma baraqua

Benoît Dorémus,"Dernièrement… Chlac !  Y a eu porte qui claque avec moi derrière, deux sacs dans les mains. Y a eu belle histoire qu’a eu sa fin moche, deux voix dans les poches, des larmes dans les coins. Dernièrement, dégoûté d’tout, j’ai douté d’tout, j’ai r’gardé partout, aimé presque rien, j’sentais mon cerveau paumer des p’tits bouts, c’était flippant comme le Néant dans « L’histoire sans fin ». 

Voilà les nouvelles
Quelques vains efforts, quelques victoires sur moi-même
Je secoue la tête et tout recommence alors
Avec mes défauts, avec des défaites
J’avance. Je crois qu’j’ai une petite chance 

Dernièrement, blême, j’ai fini deuxième aux Championnats du Monde de Cauchemars (à Kiev, en Ukraine). Battu d’une paupière par un slovène bizarre qui rêvait lui-même qu’y f’sait mes cauchemars. Dernièrement… Vlan ! J’ai foutu l’camp en m’abrutissant de questions profondes, j’ai fait l’tour du monde. J’ai changé d’gens, de vent, de rang, de gang, d’angle, de langue longtemps, pour semer mon ombre. J’ai couiné « Ben oui !» quand Souchon m’a dit « Tu la voyais grande et c’est une toute petite vie ». C’était même du sport de l’aimer encore, j’aurais voulu naître y’a cent ans pour être déjà mort !

REFRAIN

Dernièrement… Check mec ! J’ai serré la louche à des types honnêtes, j’ai fait des courbettes à des têtes nouvelles. J’ai connu des riches avec des problèmes de cons, j’ai connu des quiches avec des problèmes de ronds. 
J’ai changé d’lit mais pas d’amis, d’avis, mais pas d’utopie, j’ai maudit la main qui m’avait nourri. J’ai dit calmos à mes idées fausses, j’ai dit vamos, j’ai meilleur moral qu’à l’écrit. 
Dernièrement j’me suis dit « Benito, franchement, t’es barge, t’as d’la marge, t’es large finalement. Va puiser des forces dans la médiocrité, je t’assure, tu sais, t’as l’droit d’respirer. »

Juste pour la gloire 
J't’aurais fait croire 
Que je pourrais me tailler les veines 
J't’aurais surtout fait marrer 
Dans les couloirs 
Juste pour t'avoir 
Ça aurait valu la peine 
La peine la peine 

J'aurais appris ton prénom 
Par ta copine 
Un peu rouquine 
Qui te lâche pas d'une semelle 
Et puis ma déclaration

Au lieu de flipper pour un rien 
Un rien un rien 
Je voulais me poser moins de question 
Ou moins souvent 
Pourquoi comment

J'aurais trouvé ça si bon 
D’être au présent 
Moins oppressant 
De juste attendre que ça vienne

Que j’ai découvert les plus grands
J’ai la chance que dans ma famille
Des bouquins y en avait tell’ment
 
J’en prenais un puis sur le trône
Je me posais deux heures de suite
Avant d’expédier dans le Rhône
Disons… l’objet de ma visite
 
Moi, les fourmis dans l’arrière-train
C’est un peu ma madeleine de Proust :
Moi, bienheureux au petit coin
Avec ma flûte à six schtroumpfs
 
Tintin et Johann et Pirlouit
Benoît Brisefer et Lucky Luke  
Et Quick et Flüpke et Astrapi
Y m’en auront appris des trucs

Que j’ai dévoré des romans
Que j’ai rencontré Ugolin
Et tiré la chasse en pleurant
 
Comme j’avais une sœur et plein d’frères
Desfois ça gueulait pour qu’je sorte
Pourtant j’me proposais d’leur faire
La lecture de derrière la porte
 

Y avait Céline et Maupassant
Pour m’éblouir et me distraire
Et quand vous êtes adolescent
Djian vous laisse le cul par terre

C’est avec le froc descendu
Que j’ai dû réviser mon bac
À la recherche du temps perdu
Mais bon, valait mieux pas qu’j’le rate
 
À force de lire aux chiottes…

C’est avec le froc aux orteils
Dans mes chiottes alphabétisés
Qu’aujourd’hui je fais tout pareil
Tout est hyper organisé
 
Y a entre autres ici, sur ma gauche
Mes précieux recueils de poèmes
Et les meilleures blagues de Carlos
Je vais pas le jeter, quand même
 
J’ai pour les fois où j’suis pressé
Une anthologie de haïkus
Bien sûr mes passages préférés
Ont un marque-page en PQ
 
Mon froc est toujours au même stade
Et je termine ma chanson

J’ai repoussé au maximum
Le réel
Moi, le petit amant perdu 
Et toi, le cœur entre deux hommes
Qui s’emmêle

D’accord, ça n’a rien résolu
N’empêche que t’étais rien qu’à moi
Open bar
Dans mon rêve, on se cachait plus
J’adorais ça et à la fois 
C’était bizarre

Je suis ta folie passagère
Ton grand secret, ton autre histoire
Je suis ton petit adultère
J’attends, planqué dans le noir

D’un œil, j’entrouvre les deux yeux
Et l’atmosphère a des relents 
D’injustice
J’interroge les volets bleus
C’est du gris qui se trahit dans
L’interstice

À trop compter sur la lumière
La journée ne passera pas
Il me semble
J’étais mieux derrière mes paupières
Et le silence ici et là
Te ressemble

Tant bien que mal mais pour de bon
Je suis debout alors que tombent
Quelques gouttes
Ni lui ni moi ni oui ni non
Aujourd’hui je ne suis que l’ombre
D’un doute

Je demande à chaque heure qui sonne
Est-ce que j’aurai un peu de toi
Seulement ?
Ton absence ne trompe personne
Je surveille du bout des doigts
Mes écrans

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
