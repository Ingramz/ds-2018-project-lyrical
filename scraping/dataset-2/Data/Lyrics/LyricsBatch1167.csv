About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

But I just had to look

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

The Paul McKenna Band,"John Riley came from Galway town in the years of the Irish hunger
And he sailed away to America when the country was much younger
Now the place was strange and work was scarce
And all he knew was farming
So he followed his other Irish friends to a job in the US Army

Adventure calls and some men run, and this is their sad story
How some get drunk on demon rum and some get drunk on glory

Now they marched down Texas way to the banks of the Rio Grande
They built a fort on the banks above to taunt old Santa Anna
They were treated bad and paid worse, and then the fighting started
And the more they fought the less they thought of the damned old US Army

Adventure calls and some men run, and this is their sad story
How some get drunk on demon rum and some get drunk on glory

Now when the church bells rang on Sunday morn, it set his soul a shiver
He saw the Senoritas washing their hair on the far side of the river
Then John Riley and two hundred more Irish mercenaries
And they cast their lot, right or not, south of the Rio Grande

Adventure calls and some men run, and this is their sad story
How some get drunk on demon rum and some get drunk on glory

How they fought bravely under the flag of the San Patricios
Till the Yankees soldiers beat them down at the battle of Churubusco
Then fifteen men were whipped like mules
On the cheeks they were hot iron branded
Made to dig the graves of fifty more, who a hanging fate had handed

Adventure calls and some men run, and this is their sad story
How some get drunk on demon rum and some get drunk on glory

She was the only daughter of the engineer
My sweetheart loved the brakeman and that ain't no joke
Its a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.

I never can go because you know

And I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And I and girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (though you're far away)

We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing

How unfortunate, it wasn't what you thought it kid, in basic training
They taught you how to slay man as a start-up kit
And you showed up with a gun to load up
Hopin' a college education's waitin', maybe a steady occupation
Now you're weighing many lives against yours
President orders, got you on course, with holocaust, Sargent is lost
General's boss, plans cross, now you in the crosshair
Of a sniper's shaky scared, shot off your ear
All fucked up down, one round just hit him in his from some young yet expendable citizen
He's from the other side of the line, fightin' for time
Time to see his kids walk, time to talk with his pop
Time to have a rational thought without the thought of bein' shot
(Damn) his gun jammed now you gotta bombart
It's a soldier's suicide slide know you tried hard to stay alive
When you're catching fire from both sides
And we miss you at home, it's time the government truly left you alone
Dropped you off and popped one in your dome

That I'd be dodging bullets, seekin' weapons that never even existed

Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways

Still it holds a goodly share of bliss,

Here is the point you should never miss.

They bring the flowers that bloom in May.
So if it's raining, have no regrets,
Because it isn't raining rain, you know, (It's raining violets,)
And where you see clouds upon the hills,
You soon will see crowds of daffodils,
So keep on looking for a blue bird, And list'ning for his song,
Whenever April showers come along.

The Phantom Surfers,"Old Mister Johnson had troubles of his own
He had a yellow cat which wouldn't leave its home;
He tried and he tried to give the cat away,
He gave it to a man goin' far, far away.

But the cat came back the very next day,
The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

The man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight,
He loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamite;
He waited and he waited for the cat to come around,
Ninety seven pieces of the man is all they found.

But the cat came back the very next day,
The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

He gave it to a little boy with a dollar note,
Told him for to take it up the river in a boat;
They tied a rope around its neck, it must have weighed a pound
Now they drag the river for a little boy that's drowned.

But the cat came back the very next day,
The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

He gave it to a man going up in a balloon,
He told him for to take it to the man in the moon;
The balloon came down about ninety miles away,
Where he is now, well I dare not say.

But the cat came back the very next day,
The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

He gave it to a man going way out West,
Told him for to take it to the one he loved the best;
First the train hit the curve, then it jumped the rail,
Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tale.

But the cat came back the very next day,
The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

The cat it had some company one night out in the yard,
Someone threw a boot-jack, and they threw it mighty hard;
It caught the cat behind the ear, she thought it rather slight,
When along came a brick-bat and knocked the cat out of sight

But the cat came back the very next day,
The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

Away across the ocean they did send the cat at last,
Vessel only out a day and making water fast;
People all began to pray, the boat began to toss,
A great big gust of wind came by and every soul was lost.

But the cat came back the very next day,
The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

On a telegraph wire, sparrows sitting in a bunch,
The cat was feeling hungry, thought she'd like 'em for a lunch;
Climbing softly up the pole, and when she reached the top,
Put her foot upon the electric wire, which tied her in a knot.

But the cat came back the very next day,
The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

The cat was a possessor of a family of its own,
With seven little kittens till there came a cyclone;
Blew the houses all apart and tossed the cat around,
The air was full of kittens, and not a one was ever found.

But the cat came back the very next day,
The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

The atom bomb fell just the other day,
The H-Bomb fell in the very same way;
Russia went, England went, and then the U.S.A.
The human race was finished without a chance to pray.

But the cat came back the very next day,
The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.
Away, away, yea, yea, yea

I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school sayin ""ooh"" and I'm busted for real
(He came and went at the same time)

Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit

What to say the least
I'm so slick that they need to call me grease
'Cause I slips and I slides when I rides on the beast

Yo, first comes the tongue
And then come the she my homey's m-o-m what (m-i-e)
Yo, and to think from day one in my eyes I show fear 'cause
I stepped into his house, his mom's grinnin' ear to ear
Gigglin' and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin' me up for the kill
Oh what the hell is what I said to myself so that I wouldn't worry
I'm sittin' on the couch and wish Greg would please hurry up
She offered me a cup of ripple, broke out the titty
Squeezed her nipple, said, ""Suck it if you like but please don't bite it""
I had an urge to say fuck it but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say alakazam par dick ma wah
Flipped this old bitch in a doggie style
Greg walked in the room that nigga cold had a fit
But all this numbskull could say was, ""Oh shit!""

One fine summertime Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin' in a purple samurai Suzuki dookie braids was an aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope, man, real dope on the real
Well anyway I went toot toot she said hey beep beep
The next day rolled down to the beach, deuce deep
Me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin' on my booty
Suck suck suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (Why?)
'Cause everytime I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like quit b
Bitch was frontin' but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden as if someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me, oh please God no
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John Doe
He pulled a fast one on me, yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go, shit

The Pharcyde,"So here it is, fuck it, friends or no friends I had enough bullshit
To last me clear to the ends of my term
I hate worms, so I'mma bring in the fish
And induce my backhand to refrain from my fist
Yeah I wish that I change then I could shed all the mains
You trippin' on my ego but all my shit is sustained
Order order, I cross the border for a spot in the sun
I'm so down with myself, bitch I could chill as a bum (ho hum)
Drum, I'm so burnt that I'm beat
I got my peers on my nuts, and the crowd on my feet
The only one who has my back is me, in reality, see
I'm constantly fighting heavy when we journey through the sea
Oui, oui monsieur, I'm true to the game, I believe my friends you slip me
I might have the ego but you'll tell me who're tripping

I woke up in the mornin' to a girl who's butt's soft
Gotta brush my teeth, clean my nuts off
Put on the gear that I'mma wear throughout my day
But before I take a shower I ain't ashamed to say
When I think of the night before, and the heat of passion
Your big brown booty, my mind starts flashin'
I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
Should I pursue to do you or just stroke my knot
While my girl is asleep I'm caught in a jam
Went to the bathroom with cocoa-butter in my hand
Closed the door behind me, locked it very tight
Thinkin' of all the naughty things we did last night
Slipped out my underoos sat on the toilet bowl
And let the hand I hold the mic with take control
Closed my eyes tight so it would seem more real
I'm thinkin' about the crazy ways you made me feel
As my thoughts get deeper and a little more intense
If you don't know what comes next, well you're just too dense

What dug, look under the rug and I got it
Hit him in the heart with my night struck a slug, but no, this nigga had to go
Peep this, I was asleep, he climbed in my window
Grabbed me around the neck said scream and you're dead
I thought it was the devil 'cause his face was glowin' red
He was a brother but this brother had the devil in his eye
He was out to get I-m-a-n-i
First I took my trigger finger with a wiggle
The devil jumps into my eyes and then I giggle
In the back of my head you know Imani feels no shame
I grabbed my nine I said, ""watch my millimeter go bang""
I got him, he's crippled so he crawls across the floor
He's bleeding everywhere and now he's reachin' for the door
Bang bang bang, yep I got him again
His story's soundin' sad like the movie Ben
But um anyway I'm just protectin' my shit
'Cause if it wasn't me he's killin' then my moms mighta got it

Alright, bro

It took a second to register up in my branium
My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium
My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talking
I had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalking
This slimmy caught me peeping, this means she wasn't sleeping
On who I was, so she crept in like a hawk
In a minute's time, we adjourned to the floor
Ooh! I hit a high note 'cause of the way that she was walking
We got into the groove, I didn't bust no, uh, hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know, we got together, word, I thought we'd be forever
Didn't have an um-ber-ella, now I'm soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
Never symping, and leave your love life limp
There'll be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid

For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend

But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den be	
Macho, but I hancho like Pancho will give in
Family oriented, but not Oriental
A dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a Pinto
A hero is a sandwich, and a Manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper, are they faking or for real?
What's the deal dabbers?  Will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this
Bitch licking drip drip from a niggas benefits
He doesn't even suit ya and he's surely not ya size
I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
And when ya open up ya eyes, babe, my mate, I really wish
That ya don't bruise a limb, as ya swim with otha fish in the sea

Why ain't you climbing up?
My hand has been extended every since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya, but I didn't even know ya
Bro, you're stupid, 'cause ya thought you'd catch a Cupid
And you found that love ain't two wiffs of shit
So I resign or quit
It ain't even about the hips, or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussy whip, Elizabeth, this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
I'd charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy, they stepping with my lady
They working on a baby, I'm pushing up the daisies, but
Hey diddle diddle, I won't play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss

The Pharcyde,"Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps on passing me by

When I dream of fairy tales I think of me and Shelly
See shes my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasing and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her
All I can do is stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now shes more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all over-rated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her boots and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although shes crazy stepping, I'll try to stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by

Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Strung like a chicken, chasin' my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Dude, she looked good, down side, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdies gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man

She keeps on passing me by

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me be get's moving in slow motion
Whenever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try, or make some sort of attempt, I symp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you
Then I signed sincerely the one who loves you dearly, PS love me tender
The letter came back three days later, return to sender
Damn

And see people wavin' at her
Your mother got an Ouija board on her back
Sidney with EQ and everything what he be sayin'
His mother be hooked, fishin' with a hook and reel at the frozen food section
Tre's mama got Playdough teeth
Your mother be eatin' Daytons like Now and Laters and shit
Your mama's an extra on the Simpsons and shit
Your mama's so fat you can't even see her legs
It just looks like she's just gliding across the floor",Ya Mama,1992
The Pharcyde,"Eee ah ooh ah ah (many times)
People hint and wonder and they want to know how and why
but let me first introduce myself I'm tagging name Romye
I'm 20 years of age I ran across some bullshit
People promise you bowl of cherries but don't forget there are pits
No hints, it's quicks, it's like the water and grits
They got another boy who can rhyme and do the fly flips
And that's I high I better get by because my ally
about to flip that crazy shit while I go look for some thai

I need some zig-zag, zig-zag (3x)
I need some zig-zag, zig-zag
how I need those zig-zag
[I need some] zig-zag, zig-zag
how I love to get high

Eee ah ooh ah ah (many times)
What the?
Oh what the heck
Niggas just want to get wrecked to the track
It's brand new and heavy as a Chevy and in fact
The Pharcyde is coming and I hope we're not wack
But at this point there's no turning back
But to be exact, I've got more flavors than a bucket full of fruit
In 92 we take cash 93 we take loot
Because the vinyl is delicious=20
I'm the nigga who's got bitches
Michael Ross is the genie he's giving our wishes
One I want to just jam with your band
Two two two...=20
You gotta play it all across the land
Three three three...
The plan is grab the ducats and say fuck it to the critics hey now
I was walkin' down the street balin'(?) to the beat
Phat beats in my head tennis shoes on my feet
Nigga tried to flex but he had to be smoked
So I shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
What?
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke
Yep
Shot him in the ass on the downstroke (5x)
Shot-him-in-the-ass-on-the-downstroke

Souped on the beat like a bowl of chicken noodles
I love Spanish dishes but no I'm not Menudo
I can dig Kung-Fu I flip hoes like Judo
Never date a chick who has a mom named Bruno
A anna bonanna(?) bananafanafuno
Yet you know Shafino=20
Met her in a trio
Souped up my (glass) jet flew her at the wheel
I'm somewhat Creole=20
Don't like the man of steel
I'm not your carbon copy but your first rap (jalopy) for real
I used to deal but the fuzz popped me
I had the hydros but they repo'd my crops and steel
I chills like scotch on the rocks=20
'Cause I just gets paid for them hard-core props
You know?

How long can you freak the funk? (2x)
I separate the good stuff from the junk
How long can you freak the funk
Yeah, freak the funk
All right, freak the funk
Freak the funk (4x)

I want the farmer man. Farmer man.
I want the farmer man. You want the farmer man?
Yeah, I want the farmer man. You don't want no farmer man.
Give me the farmer man. Once again it's the farmer man.

I go from skip-skop(?) to hip-hop to be-bop to P-funk
Cutting enough bullshit to turn a tree into a tree trunk
'Cause we've sunk ships from the Pacific to the Atlantic
I dig dips who've got the hips that are gigantic 'cause I'm frantic
Take you in a frenzy=20
Takin' you out is easier than pullin' a pull-out out of a Benzie
Box well I rocks the orthodox styles to make you squirm
Yes I come from Callie no I do not have a perm
I stand firm on the mic device when I gets nice
Don't roll the dice if you can't pay the price
I got more flavor than 7-11 Slurpees
If Magic can admit he got AIDS, fuck it--I got herpes

Ah shit.

Sounds like NS to me!

Wasn't a black prophet wasn't in it for the profit
Had a talk with Charlie Brown, he was like ""yo man get off it""
It's a business
The record companies are quick to end the fantasy
Your trapped in and he tapped in my frequency
Now I'm frequently going
Over such and such ends that such and such owes
It's later for the fly girls and hoes
Cause in this capitalistic society money is all

Against the devil in the
Heart of round meadows either
Verbally or with the silhouettes
Eyes cold as dark parks or
Steel metal the world is never
Settle cause it rotates like
Ho cakes under glass, it's all
About ya future yet it's all
About ya past like how many
Faces did ya mold in ya mask
Before your free at last

And everything I say be either fat or fly
You best believe I put in time to conceive
Deep concentration from sunrise to eve
And even in my sleep sometimes
Rhymes formulate
Free form, lyrical storms falling
From a cloudy brain
In my dream like state
Then I awake
To make these silly saps collapse
As I dilapidate the wack
When it comes to rhymes I'm kind of like a mack
I got these flows strolling up and down the track
So the dough I stack up in piles and piles
For my lyrical creation
Travel miles and miles
To reach my destination
Been through so many trials
And many tribulations
But I do this shit, I do this shit, I do this shit
For the people of my nation

The Pharcyde,"[Chorus]
This ain't nothin' but the end 
So follow me into the sun and let your soul be free 
The E N D The E N D The E N The E N The E N D 

Now everyday I wake up I take out time 
To give thanks that I'm still existing 
Still insisting 
That my people open up their eyes up 

And wise up so we all can rise up 
WAY ABOVE the rim of the muck 
But we can't if we're stuck 
And I don't give a fuck 

And lost in a daze Lost in a maze 
Trapped in amazement 
And hard as cement is the head 
And that why soon everything'll be dead 

And red is the color of the blood that's spilling 
And hell of amounts is the totals of the killing 
I'm tellin' ya is the sky is falling 
But all you're worried about is sky bailing 

You're failing way outta control 
And you ain't doing nothing but losing ya soul 

[Chorus]
Well I suppose that time is coming to a close 
I got no need for jewels cars and clothes 
Need to slow my roll but can't grab control 
It's unpredictable when we will go 

I don't really know but it seems it's coming soon 
The way that niggaz actin we headed 
For our doom but we assume that we immune 
To death while niggaz 

Drippin sweat tryin to hold their breath 
But aah! they slept while the time just crept 
Now they tryin to awake but it ain't much left 
Sometimes I think we blind either 

No hope or faith my people can't wake up 
We sleepin through the day 
Think it's all great but to me it really ain't 
When its time to face reality we turn to a drank 

Or some dank then we can't think straight lets 
Try to make a change for its gets too late 'cause 

[Chorus]

Now everyday I wake up, I be rolling down the street 
Bumping my beat but they try to defeat, My cause, but I'm a rebel 
So I can't pause, But all these laws (All these laws) 
Why, up is where I try to keep, But shit still gets deep (deep) 

How deep?, Deeper than a 6ft grave 
And it's about that time I be more than a slave 

[Chorus]",The E.N.D.,1995
The Pharcyde,"[Bootie Brown]
I was standing one of the cast of many 
I would give anything to swing hand in hand 
With her but it was just a blur 
I couldn't blame her  why give up fortune and the fame 
For a nigga who can barely afford his name 
So the dame kept aim at the stars 
I'm often thinking about her 
When I'm waiting on calls across the border 
Made sure my rhymes in order cause 
That moment could be near and it was 
Now my attorney is tellin' me to sign here 
So I appear and perform international 
The time came she stepped to me I thought rational 
But she knew I wanted it 
She walked around and flaunted it like a peacock 
I knocked the Reebok Now she jock 
Blowin up the Pactel and the doorbell 
Had to check myself as well love boat won't sail 
Cause I'm not captain let them know from the start 
I let you break me off but I won't let you 
Break my heart 

[Slim Kid3]
So I'm surrounded by bitchery now this is 
The most incredible shit in Slim Kid history 
So watch if you will the moment some good 
Shit pops and they be fogging up ya grill 
Overly thrilled to get you in ya ass like Massin Gil 
Still burning shit now and I'm still learning how not to fuck 
With ya baby or make ya my old lady 
You just overcasting ya ass is shady trying to block 
The sunlight with all of that hype and now I'm discontinue 'nd 
All of this pipe that I've been laying as long as you keep 
Swaying to another crew's tempo I gotta let you go and that's 
Simple so get it through ya two temples because I'm 
Tryin' to live fatter than a blimp ho 
And you're exempt and I won't symp on a write off 
So step out my world and turn the light off 

[Fat Lip]
She was my high school sweetheart down from start 
When all I had was high hopes my health and my art 
But when I got fame she became unsure 
If I could still feel the same when I came off tour 
I said ""for sure"" 'cause what God gave us, girl, I'm grateful 
No need to be insecure baby your nigga's faithful 
So now I'm off doin' dates in a gang of states 
And as my status elevates I see the baddest eights 
At the backstage gate lookin' great straight 
Waiting for a nigga so now I figure 
""Hey I only live once I'm goin' all out today"" 
Made a call out to L.A. to say what had to say,
Now I get back the very next week only to learn 
The tables turned like a technique twelve hundred 
Last thing in the world that I wanted was my girl goin' out every 
Night getting blunted 
And zooted with a clique of well known 
Reputed groupie hos from all the hip hop shows 
Backstage with her little backpack trying to get chose 
By another nigga with talent wealth and fame 
Oh I suppose I guess I got myself to blame for turning 
Her out into a hip hop freak Now I seek counseling 
From a therapist twice a week 

[Imani]
So let me speak about the freak So let me speak about the freak 
Instantly she made another selection 
Because he was in the lime plus had 
The money connection ""correction"" 
""way more paid"" is why she laid and played 
A charade in the game of deception 
This Miss-mysterious mistress is just an actress 
Of the mattress 'cause she's a want to be mack-tress 
Well built-but equipped with the tackiest of tactics 
And I hate it why this is dedicated to all of them 
Type of women who still be swimming Lost and confused 
In the lake of illusion with no values is why they're 
Constantly losin'",Groupie Therapy,1995

I guess everybody needs somebody to love you can't
Leave love lonely cause being naive to it you can just
Lose it like that See kisses for bruises don't make it
Heal back it be's the sex appeal that's from the next
And not necessarily the sex and one might appeal to
The intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breaking down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind
These fantasies with no action searching for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type
Of chemistry that flairs when her desires on fire quick
Is the fuse another loves for hire

And she said,
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

I was high like the vocal tone of my nigga Bootie Brown
Decided to take a ride to see what's really goin' down up on
The northside of town Of course I bought a quarter pound
Of bomb hemp feelin' a-ight like Johnny Kemp on a Friday
Night Lookin' right cause my shit is tight blazin' blunts to city
Lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights Bounce to the House
Of Blues then I slid in free wit tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans
And no ID. Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the

Wipe the sweat from my brow
And each and every true will stick, or fall from the sky of my cloud nine

The Pharcyde,"Yo, inhale, exhale
Been a long time coming, still a long way to go
Evolution of manhood
Evolution, revolution

Born with sight but became sightless
Rehabilitated visions from being frightened
In the dark, just bits of light when
Lightning sparks, thunder rumbled 

Chasing courage from the heart
Searching for solitude without a solitary card
Knees bleeding but proceeding to pray to God
Forever humble but before a man boys stumble

Before there was peace vast lands had crumbled
Apart, from the truth a great distance
Met with many guides to provide assistance
To shorten that distance with me and the Maker

The mind was overthrown by the Undertaker
The Devil's a faker, see he lied to me
Singing sweet sad songs to mesmerize
But my eyes have seen four dimensions

Now gather your strength for all these bad intentions

That you seem to get when you get a little older
Days a lot colder, used to cry upon my mama's shoulder
Til pop finalized it, I analyzed it, can fantasize
With your manhood, make your plan good
With the back up, unfortunately niggas act up
Seems to be no solution, too many facing execution
Then I know many ready to leave the revolution
On their evolution to manhood, manhood

[Repeat: x2]
When a boy becomes a man
Takes time to understand
The ways of the world today

Step by step, day by day
Don't let the negative vibes lead the 'Cyde astray
We keep the positive vibes till everything is okay
On the evolution to manhood, to manhood

We realized it then re-devised it then exercised it
Got connected and we checked and it's correct
That the soul extends far beyond this fleshy existence
The rest is still trapped in ignorance, giving resistance
From a distance, interference from far away
But neither Tim nor Anfernee had a harder way
On getting here, I'm spitting clear
Connecting with the energies from near and far away
Karma, karma come back like a ricochet
To hit ya so I'm coming with the scripture
For the fixture, get the picture?

When a boy becomes a man
Takes time to understand
The ways of the world today

When a boy becomes a man
Takes time to understand

[Slimkid3]
Who could believe in you if what you say isn't true
If he's deceiving me then what's he see for you
When they raise the flag who do I pledge allegiance to
Life in paper bags, sometimes they fall through
Best love I ever had was this world when it was new
Back in nineteen-seventy all the way to eighty-two
Things were heavenly around the town where I grew
Family love was the sound that I knew, or ran home to
Don't it make your brown eyes blue?
When somebody loves you just for you
With no competition testing you
What's the proposition of our disposition unable
You said that I'm a finish, my style won't replenish
You reckon I'll diminish, fuck a demolition
I'm steady on a mission with no intermission
Cramped up in rough conditions like a Cessna in a hurricane
I get my best nuts standing on virgin stages
Feeling timeless and ageless
Seen those like embryos in our invasion
It's universal, God is amazing

[ImaniCitizen Strange]
They mad cause my rhymes even sound fresh a capella
Hella fellas is hella jealous, had me feeling uncomfortable
Cause they're unacceptable while we're the exceptional
Here to let you know they're influenced by the phenomenal
While you're unable cause you're too unstable
All of your progress is minimal and that's the inescapable fact
Verbal rhyme visionaries equipped with stacks of wax
Rhythm that varies and carries like the wind
Travelling and elevating towards unattainable heights
Exercising my rights and just trying to do what I feel is right

[Chorus x2]

Well accustomed to being unwelcome.
Exclamation, no comma, 
More drama from your common
Or regrets that keeps coming back like 
Shadows at sunset.

They try to blackmail this black male
With weak stories and frail ass tales.

So don? do it, 
Your envy is hungry like the wolf and duran duran 
And your plan is see through like seranne, 
Dried in the Sudan,

Your loneliness was the cause of all of this behold 
It was no real reason for all that to be told
Your brain is twitching, stop bitching, 
Intertwining mine like stitchin

Cover your ears, your clothes, your eyes then look alive

What gets your adrenaline pumping? Overtaking

And acquire that state of being all desires seen
Some get theirs nostril schemes
Old men chasing nothing over nineteen
The rush is good but not the right thing
Too long or too fast, gotta spend lots of cash
Break fast, brakes then mash, gotta make it on time

Rush, through my veins I can feel the blood gush
Gushing, adrenaline rushing, increased heart beating
Pulsating, no time for debating, no waiting, rush
Like getting busted, butt-naked fucking
Rushing to have sex, rushing death, that's suicide
Pharcyde give you a rush like holding a gun on nitrous oxide
Or like rolling up on me, man, looking right in my eyes
How women feel when the tongue slides up and down her thigh
Ever tried bungee jumping? I had a real surprise
Try flying high in the skies then jumping out and parachuting
The way a man feels prior to an execution, rush
Eyes bulge, face flushed, scared of heights?
Try being stuck in an elevator falling a thousand flights

Look out for the, rush
Everybody's in a, rush

Under pressure we hold it steady
Nothing will be delivered before it's ready
(Rush) If so? It's okay, later they'll pay
Rushing to do nothing, rushing trapped in traffic
Gridlocked, speeding up corners
Stay stressed but they cannot rush
Rushing to flush the rest of the evidence
A pure rush like turbulence
They want to hurry me, they try to worry me
But they can't hurry me unless it's an emergency
And if it ain't, huh, then please stand by
Imani needs to take time to plan mine
But if I gotta do it on the fly I'll do it on the fly
But why, why? Rush, rush, rush, rush..

Smoking blunts, driving ninety racing on the Pasadena 110
First drop on the colossus, it settles in over shadows
Engraved in the eyes when a real emcee battles
With his opponent, I use it as one component
Linked to the drive when the beat is dropped
I wanted the force to move but rush turns your brain to mush
Stimulation lush, with danger we brush
Sometimes it's the only thing sustaining us

Cause shit was turbulent and terminal just like an illness
How to be real with myself to even feel this
In grip with my controls to wheel and deal this
Chinks upon my jugular vein
Tryin' to kill this immaculate state of harmony

He gave me the impression that he was making real strides
Thinkin' of real progression
But only spoke on worthless earthly possessions
Brainless, dealing with the strainless
Needin' a correction for this infection
A Brand Nubian direction that left me in true shock
Like when 2Pac got shot
The whammy
I drop my secrete scripts of the uncanny
Broadcastin' live and direct throughout the galaxy

See I don't think you value what you got
See look in your hands
I'm just tryin' to be I hate to spoil your plains
We from separate destinies and separate trails in the sand
Even when we walk together side by side, hand in hand
You need a ride? Hey, are (are) you going my way?
Now we can kick it for while don't know how long I'll stay
But the key is to love you for that day
Can't control what we found or what's around the way

[Repeat: x4]
And I, I don't know what it is, but
Somethin's got to give

Runnin' low on the resources
Heinie missions, future conditions
Don't look bright for the next generation
Temperature's rising
So are the prices
You strung out on the vices
$2 million dollar ad to entice us
We live to want sometimes forgetting what we need
Overwhelmed with greed
The creed is so misleadin'
The plan seems to work and we're right on time
Got us like crabs in a bucket, all tryin' to climb

We lookin' for those critical signs in these pivotal times
Where it is not time for at-ease
The mission is the collection of G's
So please understand
If you remain man, take a real stand like a man
And don't follow the masses caravan

No turning back, leave you fall prey
On the attack, a contact with the sack to ease the pain
Completely fall victim to a game
In debt to retain
Balance always ricochet to regain

When you was expectant it the crew and I connected
Keep it collective from first to last
Is it banging is the question that they ask

Impressed with the wrong impression
About this rap shit, it's more than my profession
It's heartfelt, this life dealt a deadly hand
Life's lessons, hard times made a deadly man
Out of the soft, stressing, I fall down to my knees
For my blessings, push my wants aside for a minute
Cause greed had me testing my own fate
My own self-worth and how it goes to waste
All these things that I'm supposed to face
It gets scary on my planet sometimes
My intuition in the back of my mind
Tells me right from wrong

I might not be here long

Of course I brought the quarter pound
Of bomb hemp, feeling alright like Johnny Kemp
On a Friday night
Looking right 'cause my shit is tight
Blazing blunts to city lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights
Bounce to the House of Blues then I slid in free
With tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans, and no ID
Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the fizace
Of an epp with an iz-ass more amazing than grace
So I waste no time to kick my line
I say, ""How ya doing?"" She say, ""Hey. I'm doin' fine""
So I commence to macking to baby to see what's cracking
So maybe I get her back at the cabin and start attacking
Threw back a shot of yack and started jabbering
Jibbing, fibbin', and ad libbing just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed, bumping some Isley
Thought I was about to spread the thighs but she surprised me
When she said, ""Oh like that? You know I don't get down.""
I know my homies gonna clown 'cause I let her stick around when

Now Daddy's home
But she's been waitin all night so we could be all alone
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone
Trying to build something real, working fingertips to the bone
Too much love's gone astray that it won't be coming home
No time soon
So I dance with the silhouette beneath the moon
And she said, if satisfaction's guaranteed
Nothing else could come between the flight of a new love baby

And she said
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

And she said
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight

Hella fellas is hella jealous, had me feeling uncomfortable
Cause they're unacceptable while we're the exceptional
Here to let you know they're influenced by the phenomenal
While you're unable cause you're too unstable
All of your progress is minimal and that's the inescapable fact
Verbal rhyme visionaries equipped with stacks of wax
Rhythm that varies and carries like the wind
Travelling and elevating towards unattainable heights
Exercising my rights and just trying to do what I feel is right

[Chorus x2]
[Bootie Brown/Frank Fiction]
There's a lot of players in the game
And they seem they can't remember why, forgot their goals
Lost then stole like skipper in the minnow
Now they got a long face like Leno
Stressed, feeling gray, nervous
Asking what they did to deserve this
Maybe it's not what you did but what you did not
You're like snot, uncomfortable, agitated
We inter raining what was said in the past
Nigga could buy a Benz and can't afford gas
Getting nowhere fast in a hurry
My visions not blurry, to quote Mr Flave:
Don't Believe the Hype unless his last name is Williams
Then it's guaranteed play, am I lying?
If you ask me how I'm doing, I'm trying
To stay above six feet outside of the bars and the concrete
Love pumping grass making a bomb beat
This is for my niggas on the late night creep
Watch where you sleep, watch where you sleep

I must admit on some occasions I went out like a punk 
And a chump or a sucka or something to that effect

When niggas use to be like 'What's up fool!' and tried 
To seat a nigga like the Lip for no reason at all I can 
Recall crip niggas throwin' see in my face down the hall 
I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eatin' chicken at 
Three, wonderin' why is everybody always pickin' on me 
I tried to talk and tell tham chill I did nothing to deserve 
This But when it didn't work I wasn't scared just real 
Nervous and unprepared to deal with scrappin' no doubt 
'cause my pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out 
But now in 95 I must survive as a man on my own Fuck 
Around with Fatlip yes ya get blown I'm not tryin to show 
No macho is shown but when it's on, if it's on, then it's on! 

There comes a time in every mans life when he's gotta 
Handle up on his own Can't depend on friends to 
Help you in a sqeeze, please they got problems of their 
Own Down for the count on seven chickens shits don't 
Get to heaven til they faced these fears in these fear 
Zones Used to get jacked back in high school I played 
It cool just so some real shit won't get full blown Being 
Where I'm from they let the smoke come quicker than an 
Evil red-neck could lynch a helpless colored figure And 
As a victim I invented low-key til the keyhole itself got 
Lower than me So I stood up and let my free form form 
Free I don't sweat it I let the bullshit blow in the breeze 
In other words just freeze 

It's 1995 now that I'm older stress weighs on my shoulders 
Heavy as boulders but I told ya 
Till the day that I die I still will be a soldier and that's all I told 
Ya and that's all I showed ya 
And all this calamity is rippin' my sanity 
Can it be I'm a celebrity 
Whose on the brink of insanity 
Now don't be wishin's of switchin' any positions with me 
'cause when you in my position, it ain't never easy

As I invade their masquerade

They have no key, or no clue
To the game at all, now they washed up
Hung out to dry

All missions impossible are possible, cause I'm
Heading for a new sector 365 days from now, I'll
Wipe the sweat from my brow
And each and every true will stick, or fall from the sky of my cloud nine
From homies all the way to chics, no matter how fine
Controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
Every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance

Can tell when she went to sleep, she's still weak
About a big bro, overdid it one day
Decide to hit her, no boos, no drugs, no playas
No thugs, no love no hugs
When she caught me, found the stash in the coffee?
Call me from the payphone speaking real softly
That I've broken the seal of trust
On her way to her momma's house
On the bus, it was old for us, don't make a fuss
She said, as the tears shed, explained that she felt
Mislead, she couldn't take the pain if I was jailed
Or found dead, or if I'd went onside her head
I tried to convince her, only happens to a few
How could I question, after all she'd been through
She said she felt bad, but there was nothin' I could do
I thought I knew, I thought I knew

Yeah, me and my man's go back way before the music
I'd never thought that he would lose it and do that
All year he used to be in my house, but now I can't wait to
Smack the taste out of his mouth
They say that money is the root of all evil, but not having money
Is the root of all evil, chilling, talking, walking with my people
Talking the walk about how shit goin' be, we gonna rock under
Any circumstances, when I'm on the microphone
You know we advancin', with or without you, can't fuck with you
We try to forget you, cause we're trying to get richer

I'm sittin' on the couch and wish Greg would please hurry up
She offered me a cup of ripple, broke out the titty
Squeezed her nipple, said, ""Suck it if you like but please don't bite it""

Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin' in a purple samurai Suzuki dookie braids was an aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope, man, real dope on the real
Well anyway I went toot toot she said hey beep beep
The next day rolled down to the beach, deuce deep
Me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin' on my booty

I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
Should I pursue to do you or just stroke my knot
While my girl is asleep I'm caught in a jam
Went to the bathroom with cocoa-butter in my hand
Closed the door behind me, locked it very tight
Thinkin' of all the naughty things we did last night
Slipped out my underoos sat on the toilet bowl
And let the hand I hold the mic with take control
Closed my eyes tight so it would seem more real

Grabbed me around the neck said scream and you're dead
I thought it was the devil 'cause his face was glowin' red
He was a brother but this brother had the devil in his eye
He was out to get I-m-a-n-i
First I took my trigger finger with a wiggle
The devil jumps into my eyes and then I giggle
In the back of my head you know Imani feels no shame
I grabbed my nine I said, ""watch my millimeter go bang""
I got him, he's crippled so he crawls across the floor
He's bleeding everywhere and now he's reachin' for the door
Bang bang bang, yep I got him again

The Pharcyde,"Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was lee, he drove a z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First Id write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps on passing me by

When I dream of fairy tales I think of me and Shelly
See shes my type of hype and I cant stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasing and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her 
But, all I can do is stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now shes more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all over-rated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her boots and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although shes crazy stepping, Ill try to stop her stride
Cause I wont have no more of this passing me by

And I must voice my opinion of not even pretending she didn't have me
Strung like a chicken, chase my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Dude, she looked good, down side, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdies gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man

She keeps on passing me by 

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me be gets moving in slow motion
When-ever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try? 
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try, or make some sort of attempt, I symp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp!

And if I was your man then I would be true

A strange kind of feeling
Swims through your eyes
And like the doors
To a wide vast dominion
They open to your prize

This is no terror ground
Or place for the rage
No broken hearts
White wash lies
Just a taste for the truth
Perfect taste, choice and meaning
A look into your eyes

Blind to the gemstone alone
A smile from a frown circles round
Should he stay or should he go?
Let him shout a rage so strong
A rage that knows no right or wrong
And take a little piece of you

There is no middle ground
Or that's how it seems
For us to walk or to take
Instead we tumble down
Either side left or right

Is from my guitar that's named Lucille
I'm very crazy about Lucille
Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say brought me fame

I don't think I can just talk enough about Lucille
Sometimes when I'm blue it's seems like Lucille
Tryin' to help me callin' my name

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another, when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille, started singin' blues

Well, now when I'm payin' my dues
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say payin' my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always you, you know, like depend on Lucille

Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess, I'll let Lucille say
All of a few words and then

You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through
Like, well, for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she's misusin' me
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely
Well, not maybe, I am lonely

I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me, you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I can't even say nothin'
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin'

You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.
I don't think I still could do it
Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothin' but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille, sing Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings

A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar, Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two, three times
No kidding, really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin' over, it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me, really, it held it up off of me
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way, I, uh, I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night, the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin', you know what I mean

And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin' for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin' to save Lucille

Uh, oh, I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me

Seemed to reach just this man

Words I couldn't understand

And a I turned out the station
Swear she spoke to me alone
She said 'please, ain't it time you
Come home'

Light headed and heavyhearted

I just can't get my mind around you

Torn through shattered muscle to
Put the ginger in my blood

I try to turn it down, but I can't quite drown it out

All anybody would tell me, is all that bad news how it's gonna fall through

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.

Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.

Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Your folks got high at a quarter to five
Don't you feel your growing up undone

Nothing but the local DJ
He said he had some songs to play
What went down from his fooling around
Gave hope and a brand new day

Imagine all the girls

Nothing was the same again
All about where and when
Blowing our minds in our life unkind
Gotta love the BPM
When the smoke was all baton

We wore his love like a hand in a glove

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.

They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it

They were goin' backwards

They called intermission

And they heard the referee say

Ain't exactly nothin'

And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""

And down the field, pell mell.

The Pied Pipers,"Some time ago
I wandered down into old mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenes meant ""please love me
And I could say frenes
A lovely seorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenes
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenes?
Bsame tu a m
Bsame igual que mi boca te bes
Dame el frenes
Qui mi locura te di
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo ensearte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para m
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bsame con frenes
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Y la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir y amar
Que es mas que amor frenes
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazn
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para m
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti

Haunts my reverie

But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

You are you are the missing part
The only living boy left in the world

What’s the city done to you?
You’re walking down Fifth Avenue
You’re looking for salvation in a girl.

If you get what you receive,
It comes down to what you believe
Do you believe you’re someone she can love?

Life is like a loaded gun,
Point it at the lonely ones
Will the final bullet be enough?

You’re the creation
You’re the reason
You’re the rising sun and the colors in my mind

You’re the changing of the seasons
You’re the growing old and the passing of the time

You live
You learn
You laugh
You cry
And you can never get enough

You drink
You dance
You fight
You die
And maybe you believe in love

(Maybe you believe in love)

I know who you want to be
You want to be good company
But everything you say gets turned around

So you decide to be alone
You disconnect your telephone
And run off to some place you can’t be found

Everybody needs a friend
Who will love you in the end
Can you be somebody they can trust?

Change your mind and change your life
Find yourself a pretty wife
And be a man
Until you turn to dust

You’re the creation,
You’re the reason
You’re the rising sun and the colors in my mind

If you really cared for me
If you really cared for me

I remember when we were young
Things were easy, we had such fun
And I know what we talked about
Lets hope that they don't find out

Because everybody wants me
Everybody wants me
Everybody wants me now

'Cause everybody wants me
Everybody wants me
Everybody wants me now

But I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you

It's over, oh so over
Draw the curtain and turn me over
Go back to the beginning again

It's over, oh so over
Draw the curtain and turn me over
Go back to the beginning again

I know you won't believe me
But I swear to God it's true
I know you won't believe me
Well, what am I supposed to do?

It's over, oh so over
Draw the curtain and turn me over
Go back to the beginning again",She Wants Me,2011
The Pilfers,"Open up my heart to you for I cared for you the most
And you did to me what I fear the worst
Tears fell on pillow then as I contemplated death,
I refuse to make this my last breath

Why? You suddenly calling me
Why? You want to come back to me
Why? You want to make love to me

Mi say mi exgal she take off
And then she come back like she want to get choose
She taking big man for a baby
Gal you must be crazy
Ah you roll the dice & you loose
She see upstairs pon di balcony
VIP section surrounded by raving beauties
Her pretty face couldn't carry her to get pass my manager
Neither mi securities

Why? You suddenly calling me
Why? You want to come back to me
Why? You want to make love to me

Keep walking keep on walking cause I ain’t talking to you
No! No! No! Way you use the power of persuasion girl
If you see me on the main don't bother to call out my name
You voice brings me too much shame
You're always doing stupid shit
You never calculate the risk
You always want your own way

Why? You suddenly calling me
Why? You want to come back to me
Why? You want to make love to me

She's out there!
Standing up under the marquee
She's out there!
Standing with her sexy body
She's out there!
Her very presence is haunting me
She's out there!
Why di gal she never leave already?

Why? You suddenly calling me
Why? You want to back to me
Why? You want to make love to me",Why,1999
