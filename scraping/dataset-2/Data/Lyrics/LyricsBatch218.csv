Erich Kunzel,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish upon a Star [From Pinocchio],1988
Erich Kunzel,"Climb every mountain
Search high and low
Follow every byway
Every path you know

Climb every mountain
Ford every stream
Follow every rainbow
Till you find your dream

A dream that will need
All the love you can give
Every day of your life
For as long as you live

Climb every mountain
Ford every stream
Follow every rainbow
Till you find your dream

A dream that will need
All the love you can give

Ray-a drop of golden sun

You can sing a million different tones by mixing them up
Like this, so do la fa mi do re
Can you do that

Every morning you greet me

Erich Kunzel,"No little shack do you share with me,
We do not flee from the mortgagee,
Nary a care in the world have we,
How can love survive?

You're fond of bonds and you own a lot.
I have a plane and a diesel yacht,
Plenty of nothing you haven't got
How can love survive?

No rides for us on the top of a bus 
In the face of the freezing breezes.
You reach your goals in your comfy old Rolls
Or in one of your Mercedes!

Far, very far off the beam are we,
Quaint and bizarre as a team are we,
Two millionaires with a dream are we,
We're keeping romance alive.
Two millionaires with a dream are we,
We'll make our love survive

No little cold water flat have we,
Warmed by a glow of insolvency,
Up to your necks in security.
How can love survive?
How can I show what I feel for you?
I cannot go out and steal for you,
I cannot die like Camille for you.

How can love survive?
You millionaires with financial affairs 
Are too busy for simple pleasure.
When you are poor it is toujours l'amour,
For l'amour all the poor have leisure!

Caught in our gold plated chains are we,
Lost in our wealthy domains are we,
Trapped by our capital gains are we,
But we'll keep romance alive.
Trapped by your capital gains are we,
We'll (You'll) make our (your) love survive!",How Can Love Survive?,1988

Erich Kunzel,"She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee
Her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair
I even heard her singing in the abbey

She's always late for chapel
But her penitence is real
She's always late for everything
Except for every meal
I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

I'd like to say a word in her behalf
Maria makes me laugh

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find a word that means Maria?
A flibbertijibbet! 
A will-o'-the wisp! 
A clown!

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather
She's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!

She'd out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle! She is wild!
She's a riddle! She's a child!
She's a headache! She's an angel!
She's a girl!

Erich Kunzel,"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into Springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad.

Erich Kunzel,"You dear attractive dewy-eyed idealist,
Today you have to learn to be a realist.

You may be bent on doing deed of daring due,
But up against a shark, what can a herring do?

Be wise, compromise.
Compromise, and be wise!
Let them think you're on their side, be noncommittal.
I will not bow my head to the men I despise!
You won't have to bow your head to stoop a little.
Why not learn to put your faith and your reliance,
On an obvious and simple fact of science?

A crazy planet full of crazy people,
Is somersaulting all around the sky.
And every time it turns another somersault,
Another day goes by.
And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it.
No, you can't stop it even if you tried.
So, I'm not going to worry,
No, I'm not going to worry,
Every time I see another day go by.

While somersaulting at a cockeyed angle,
We make a cockeyed circle 'round the sun.
And when we circle back to where we started from,
Another year has run.

And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it,
If the earth wants to roll around the sun.
You're a fool if you worry.
You're a fool if you worry,
Over anything but little number one.

That's you!
That's I!
And I!
And me!
That all absorbing character.
That fascinating creature.
That super special feature,
Me!

So every star on every whirling planet,
And every constellation in the sky,
Revolves around the center of the universe,
That lovely thing called, I.

And there's no way to stop it.
No, there's no way to stop it,
And I know, though I cannot tell you why (sigh).
Just as long as I'm living,
Just as long as I'm living,
There'll be nothing else as wonderful as I.
I! I! I! Nothing else as wonderful as I!",No Way To Stop It,1988
Erich Kunzel,"An ordinary couple
Is all we'll ever be,
For all I want of living
Is to keep you close to me,
To laugh and weep together
While time goes on its flight,
To kiss you ev'ry morning
An to kiss you ev'ry night.

We'll meet our daily problems
And rest when day is done,
Our arms around each other 
In the fading sun.

An ordinary couple,
Across the years we'll ride, 
Our arms around each other
Our children by our side,
Our arms around each other.",An  Ordinary Couple,1988

With the sound of music,
With songs they have sung,
For a thousand years.
The hills fill my heart,
With the sound of music.
My heart wants to sing every song it hears.

My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise from the lake
To the trees.

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze,
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night,
Like a lark who is learning to pray.

I go to the hills

What I heard before.

Nothing much

It brings back a night of tropical splendor,

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Vowed it would be my life or his'n

Erick Mora Mota,"Maquillaje a granel usaba a diario 
Y vendía la piel a precio caro 
De las ocho a las diez en una esquina 
Era joven y fiel, era rosa y espina
Y se llamaba, no sé, nunca lo supe 
Nunca le pregunté, nunca dispuse 
De su tiempo y su piel, era un mocoso 
Y tan solo le miré de pozo en pozo

Y era un pajarillo de blancas alas 
De balcón en balcón, de plaza en plaza
Vendedora de amor, ofrecedora 
Para el mejor postor de su tonada

Cinco inviernos pasaron y ahí seguía 
La misma hora de ayer, la misma esquina
Era joven y fiel, y aún tenía 
La rosa de su piel y más grande la espina
Y sonreía al pasar de los mirones 
Bajo de aquel farol, noche tras noche 
Veinte veces se la llevaron presa 
Y cantó su canción tras de las rejas

Y era un pajarillo de blancas alas 
De balcón en balcón, de plaza en plaza
Vendedora de amor, ofrecedora 
Para el mejor postor de su tonada

Se le arrugó la piel y el maquillaje 
Suficiente no fue para taparle 
La huella que dejó el sexto invierno 
Se le acabo el color y hasta el aliento
Y de las ocho a las diez sólo en la esquina 
Se quedó aquel farol y aquella espina 
La rosa no sé yo donde se iría 
Se llamaba no sé y sonreía

De balcón en balcón, de plaza en plaza
Vendedora de amor, ofrecedora

Fly past the cops, they like he's speeding

I'm in a two triple zero MB
Flaunt it, 'til the gas tank's empty
Yo, me and Redman take a detour
Uptown, park in front of Branson's store

I see a couple of chickens upon the scene
I roll down the window and I flash the greens
I got my hand upon the steering wheel, with the gangsta lean
Watch and rings, doin' my thing, bling, bling

Word, the rappin dynamite, quick to blow like Mike
Who am I?  (E.D.)  Right, right
Can you believe it, even Stevie Wonder couldn't see it
I'm catchin wreck so beat it
Yo I contour my lines, to freak a funky rhyme
to fit you like a pair of Calvin Kleins
Mad brother with distinction, keep the girls blinkin
and have the homeboys thinkin
I'm the man of hour, of the hour
I found He-Man, jacked him for his power (gimme that)
Now I carry a sword, attached by a live cord
Oh my lord!

Mics I spark it, with the funky target
You must trust me, and stop tryin to bug me
with the one-two, before I rush you and crush you
I'm on a mission, like a church group called Commission
Word-gifted, keep the crowd uplifted (yea yea)

from the K.D. Posse, two of my homegirls
When I rock the mic and get freaky and nasty
People in the industry seldom ask me
Whassup, whassup, whassup
wit you E, ask Eddie Murphy (yea yea)

Versatile, crazy wild with my profile
Dominatin the microphone, on my own
Freakin it, with the ill vocal tone
Outspoken, here's a token of my appreciation
I bring drama like Jason
Who can see me?  You better ask Superman
for his super vision, cause I'm on a fuckin mission
Test my skills, and I rearrange your fuckin grill
Will kill if I have to get ill
Get away, carry on, and step
like the S1's, cause my crew carry big guns
to blow up, anybody in the range

I make it blacken yo, and make things happen
Why?  I'm like the Michael Jackson of rap
I'm bad, plus I moonwalk over tracks

I flex, punk and get funky for the occasion
Superstitious, so I kill black cats and all that
and buck em down with the gat
E Double in the house don't you know me
What's up homey loc, step and you get smoked
I have a dream like Martin Luther King
that one day, yo, I can do away
with the pitiful, and the critical wack MC's
separate the ocean, and throw em in between
Grab my nuts, hold em, becaues they're golden
with more wins than Hulk Hogan

so I can fly high like Mike and ""Just Do It""
And get freaky-deaky on the real, grab the steel

The most beautifulest thing in this world
is my notion, for murderous poetry in motion
And the illiotic shit I come across
form a leash you're trapped in with explosive force
I push your head through the cracks of sanity
and leave your brain doin a bid in purgatory
It's ninety-six degrees in the shade
before I catch blood on my blade
I take my frustration to the stage
and gets open dope and stupid bumblin rumblin tracks
When I rap my jams be packed like a laundromat
My context'll wreck your whole concept
Cause my delivery is so complex
And I'm inter-galactic on plastic
with the super distinguish that I kick
I'm high strung at the top of my lung

Sat beside me, like Little Miss Tuffet (hello)
Talkin bullshit, knowin I want to fuck it
Basically, I figured she was widdit
So I pulled out my ink pen and exchanged the phone digits
Gimme a call when you get to your crib
So I can get directions, right to where you live
She smiled, and left, the girl was wide open
I'm no jokin, when the E blows the smoke in
Check the Rolex, asked for my check
The waitress came over in a pair of black spandex (whoo!)
Gave me a look like, ""Aren't you Erick Sermon?""
""Yes, and who is it concernin?""  Me, that's the hype

It's the hype

I asked her, ""What time you get off?""  ""Oh, in 15 minutes""
So I stormed the bitch like a blizzard
""Umm, can I take you home?""  ""Sure meet me in the parking lot
I'll flash my high beams, so you can find my spot""
She came out - MAN, she was all that
Cool like that, and stacked like that
She jumped in with a wide open grin
Before I went to her crib, I dropped off my best friend
Got to his house, and gave him dap
He knew what time it was, so he passed me a jim hat
Got to her house, then parked the Jeep
I asked her who was home she said her sister but she sleep
Walked upstairs, right into the room
with one skylight lookin straight at the moon (yep yep)
She wasted no time, man she was on it
Grabbed for the bozack, and her hands was packed
Took off our clothes, went to work, man trust me
I heard someone knockin, somebody tried to bust me
It was her sister, man I must be buggin (ahh shit!)
It's the same girl, I met from the night clubbers
""That's your sister?  Oh I didn't know -- I'll go""
and they both screamed, ""Hell no!""
They smiled, with a devilish grin
and the other sister jumped in

That's the hype
It's the hype yo
That's the hype
Word em up, one two it's the hype, check it out yo yo
It's the hype yo
It's the hype, yo it's the hype, word em up it's the hype

Erick Sermon,"[Erick Sermon]
Aooowwwwwwwwwwwww!
Part one, the mastermind begins upon a quest
Gettin stupid -- shootin rhymes like arrows shot by Cupid
Ahh, you so crazy, is what somebody told me
You can't hold me, so why you actin bold G?
Come correct when you steppin dude, don't get rude
or I might blast you durin my interlude
But for real though, I'm doper than chronic
A million dollar man, but I'm not bionic
Erick Sermon, a name you know so don't front kid
E.D., rock the mic and roll the blunt, ya dig?
Goal is to get Naughty by Nature
And blow up like when girls blow up my SkyPager
Make loot by the stacks - so when I come back 
through my neighborhood, they see I'm doin good
I got my hat to the back, my hands down below
So act like you know

Chorus: Erick Sermon (repeat 2X)

Imma gitz mine, you go and get yours (3X)
Imma gitz mine, you got it!

[Erick Sermon]
Part two, show the way I flip the funk lyric
and get ghost - with the magical form of spirit
I do my thing, I don't dare front or flake
I commence to earthquake, dominate, and cremate
Abuse and use a funky form of dialect
when I mic check, I freak the ill concept like
skip to my loo my darling, I hear someone calling
Hey, Erick Sermon, yes yes y'alling
I got funk by the ounce to make you bounce
to the bus stop, and flash back to the wop
Now I got the +Vibeology+, in a funky way
Somethin Paula Abdul would say
My style Development, should be Arrested
Arrested Development, _Everyday People_
from my heritage kickin, E's on a mission
It's a black thing kid, and not the Blonde Ambition
Mackaframa, fly mack-dose
Got props from North South, East and the West coast
Like Michael Jackson boy, just _Leave Me Alone_
Cause once again it's on

Chorus

[Erick Sermon]
(Worrrd) One two, as I speak upon the funk
Why is that when the ?, the people told the junk
Man, we can't have anything
Why can't we all just get along like my man Rodney King
I'm a young man, doin what I have to
Who asked you?  I'm doin what I gotta do
I'm guaranteed to have my own show, like Arsenio
if I maintain to be a desperado
Stayin wicked when I kick it through your speaker
You might think I'm a alien, but that's a corny ?
Because my ways are, ""Strange -- and I like it""
and got power like a psychic
I'm +Cool Like Dat+ when I react with the rap
but if you ain't down with it then get the bozack

And ""Humpin' Around"" like Bobby Brown across town
I ain't with that, so don't cramp my style
Step off me, I'm hyped like I had a pound of coffee
Yo how could you ask what I'm doin'
When I'm pursuin', gettin' funky with my crew and
My input brings vibes unknown like E.T.
Makes me phone home to my family
Cling, hello mom, I'm doin' it, freakin' more fame
Than Batman played by Michael Keaton
I crossed over, let me name someone that's black
With fame, and pockets that are fat
Hey, Erick Sermon, he's one
Packs a gun, that's bigger than Malcolm's
Out the window, I look for a punk to get stupid
So I can shoot his ass like Cupid

Took the sucker out, cause he clowned me on a payday
The funk is flowin' to the maximum
From the E Double, while I kick the facts to them
Check a chill brother with class, rough enough
To run up and snatch the spine out a niggas ass
Grip the steel when caps peeled, here to chill on the real
And don't give a motherfuck how you feel
Thinkin' you're steppin' to this, I kinda doubt it

Droppin that mellow but mad mackadocious
Melodious metaphorical music with mo' shit
That you used to, and stylin that you ain't
What else I got to do but draw the pictures with paints?
Oh no, there's my mic squeakin'
A soundman's body turnin' up every weekend
Some think I done the killin', you know I can't remember
I can't recall a full week since this past December
And mics catchin' fire 'fore I get the chance to touch em

Nineteen ninety three  ninety four 
Word em up 

Here we go Joe Sinistr representin' from the joint 

Yo yo  I pause for the cause 
I seen niggaz heads busted  someone pass the gauze 
This rhyme may affect the skull to a point 
And crash the membrane, so you should spark a joint 
There I go and now it's Showtime without 
KiKi Shepherd, now the bitch feels neglected 
Check the memo, remember you listened to my demo; 
Yeah the one about the fuckin limo? 
Rewind because I'm pushed for time right now 
What where when how, my sound's out there like Moscow 
I hear nuttin but the music, raw fusion 
No mass confusion or illusion 
Blink blink, blink so what you sayin? I'm not playin 
Hey man, yo I caught you playin 
So don't be conspicous, cause you can't get with this 
Hardcore scientifical, far from typical 
My rap style, is dy-no-might 
It make you want to be like the E Double, and not like Mike 
Yo, bust my acoustics, SWING! 
Deranged, when I rock the mic I feel strange 
Now back to our program, fuck Batman, bang bang 
Sound from the gat-man 
Let me quit it, cause I feel I have shitted 
And got mad niggaz widdit 
Joe Sinistr follows 
So y'all get my dick, until tomorrow 

It's the second payback, payback part II 
Yeah, it's the second payback, the payback part II 
Uh-huh, yeah, it's the second payback, the payback part II 
Uh-huh, yeah, it's the second payback, payback part II 
It's part II, uh 

And while niggaz still arrested virgins, I rips it ill 
As Erick Sermon's, we's the ones usin the method slurrin 
So Joe Sinistr came through the armed recruit to blank crews 
My six will fix another one greedy 
For real, let's peel they hats back for deal slow 
And we'll catch clown, with they pants down real low
The screwball better work a RuPaul and switch fast 
Or we'll be in the cornfield, killin your bitch ass 
And Timb's roam through bad bad odor but it is home 
Wild flex and more sex than Mad Cobra 
So take it easy ?just to mash a kraut? mine's the cheesiest 
And I'm sworn to keep their eyes on more than CBS 
I make the Funk Doobie turn to a process 
I mob just any nigga, I don't care who he 
I still get doughs, takin off bitches Girbauds 
And lamp with Erick, a champ merit cause I flip foes 
See these screws loose, I repeat, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice 
But stop there goes the third time with the cock-a-roach 
And I get more flows than Vic Tayback 
So kids, here come the second big payback 

It's the second payback, payback part II 
Yeah, it's the second payback, the payback part II 
Uh-huh, yeah, it's the second payback, the payback part II 
Uh-huh, yeah, it's the second payback, payback part II 
It's part II, uhh

The funkster from the boonies 
I love Muhammad Ali, so fuck Gerry Cooney 
Oops, can't forget, under a roof from One Nation 
Crowd participation 
Shit, I'm so upset, I feel like snappin niggaz neck 
But I'ma chill and let Joe get wreck 

My secret recipe put Pepsi on Diet's, uh-huh 
The funk dog as I come low to piss on hydrants 
And howl at half moons and White Owls and mad tunes 
Live quite fowl, leavin Lifestyles in bitches bathrooms 
I crack granite, and pack a mass transit it's so weird 
My style is more Fear-ed than Black Planets 
And I fuck your shit, suck my dick for explicit 
I let clips at your name, pay rent in your brain 
And I gets wicked, wick-wick-wicked 
And keeps a full clip in case the bullets get evicted 
And now to twirl up the fat nigga, seek psychiatric 
I devour worlds and Galactus 
I gets mean troop, grabbin Christine around the block 
At sixteen, spittin the green pea soup 
And cock nines, when niggaz got slime, the only men

have some sex
safe sex
word 'em up

okay, it's time for some action
a little passion, some booty waxin'
for the bozac, make sure he's strapped
and if baby got back, then yo, we with that
call up a few people on the phone
yo we're havin' a party, at my private home
some bring some chronic, plus some brew
call up your girl and invite her too
come active and bring purple lactives
'cause we're gonna get more busy than gymnastics
and do the humpty hump all night
so when you come with the boy, make sure you're right
it's nine o'clock, party starts at ten
so enough for now, I'll talk to you then
later, huh, I'll see you when you get here
and make it quick, ah yeah
time for some safe sex

safe sex
safe sex
safe sex
we all need (safe sex)


ding dong, there goes the bell
I opened up the door and oh, what the hell
it was a buncha niggas standin' by my door
I said come in, but respect my floor
that means take off your shoes and englands
'cause I'm a gentleman, some say distinguished
all of y'all put your things up in the kitchen
and the rest of y'all sit down and listen
be free and relax in what you're wearin'
let's all be happy like Bobby McFerrin
and get loose and produce the funky juice
and let's swing this shit like they swing a forty deuce
they want some reggae, like some flex
time to have sex
and it's all night, so turn off the light
and let's get high as a kite
and have safe sex

somebody say sex (sex)
say safe sex (safe sex)
I love it (I love it)
I need it (I need it)

but for real, when you're havin' sex
no matter what type, make sure you wear the latex
to all of the cons out there sexin'
stop and look, boy, you're stressed out protection
cause aids is real and something to believe
or not make-believe and fake like hair weave
a death wish like Charles Bronson

about the sex

It's on breaker 1, 2 mike checkin' 
flexin no half steppin 
when I release the funky weapon 
like Ricochet ping ping ping. 
I make fans fell it even when I sing. 
The green eyed bandit coming funky with the tune yes 
I'm blowing up like Tom Berringer in Platoon. 
I'm playing kinda ruff like Zapp 
whapp and E-Double smack to all the crossover raps black 
who ain't down with the format 
when you should be wearing khakis and not dress slacks 
that's wack 
you trippin you better wake up and smell the coffee 
and then back up off me 
I serious I can't believe some people letting frontiers in 
and then compare them equal boy you must be buggin 
you lucky you don't catch a slug in the chest in 
from the Smith and Wessons. 
Change the out look 
change the cover of the book 
you hip hop crook and give back what you took. 
It's the Funk coming at cha 
so don't let the crossover catch ya. 
Boy stay real. 

II.

It's on again yeah about the fake hip hop trends 
for those who can't comprehend just ask your friends 
they know the real deal of rap music no frontin 
you can't be talking loud and saying nothing 
you must be true to the game you understand 
and if not I could kill you man 
for being false plus extra fake on the tape 
talking hardcore when you soft like a piece of cake. 
You can't put nothing pass me that horrendous cause 
I've been here since strictly business 
the era of Eric and Rakim, Biz, Public Enemy, Run-DMC, 
Houdini, The Beasties, Stetsa, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, LL 
when he was rockin bells. 
Sucker which fake emcee is rearranging the structure band
the motherf--ker. And don't let this happen again 
cause rap could be gone the wind. 
So stay real.

Yes I'm back Black for those who might be confused 
and lost and don't want to pay the cost 
of me hardcore style type a human being 
on the microphone when I be emceeing.

how do I know cause MTV shows it. 
Clowns that should be beat down on the spot
and catching nothing but speed knots the bumbadots 
I insist we veto all fake emcees and want to be's 
that's worst than the AIDS disease. 
So wake up Spike Lee Joint 
and don't be a knucklehead and get to the point

You could say, I got my thinking cap on backwards 
I'll demolish the retarded smartest rap artists

I fuck your head up like amphetamines with L.O.D. 
Then bend you out of shape like a master Yogi 
I put my head through your chest, just to see 
Who's next in line, just to get wrecked

I got mad expertise, for all you duck MC's
I'm funky like G Thing my nigga
I want to know who's up in here, before I pull the trigger

[Is New York up in here? HELL YEAH
 Is Def Squad up in here? HELL YEAH
 Is NJ up in here? HELL YEAH
 The Green Beret's up in here! HELL YEAH]

Verbally, I sew the brains up like Trapper
John M.D. got nine millis made of lacquer
Count Dracula, back with the, tow-truck with the
Get Biz like Mark fuel-injected like Maximus
My style sicker than an AIDS victim drinkin forty-five malt liquors
I roll the spliff up
The underground, slam, shock like Shazam
Check my Jams get Def when I kick Methods like Man
Computerized Robocop sounds I drop in sequence
Funky to death so ask that old bitch where the beef went
When I do em, I glue em, stick em like Patrick Ewing
My shit bumps like Puerto Rican people moved in
next door, I get raw with the grrrahhhh!
Call four-one-one cause I'm Ghetto Red Hot
Bo bo bo! Funk Doctor Spock catch a bruisin
My style gets respect fifty Muslims

Watch yo nugget bitch, I get busy with mines

Heckuva foe, heard a gun and settled for a metaphor
I'm naive between the sleeves of the sheets
Murderin, who should ever try to fuck with me
Murray word is bond gets it on
And ready to blow any nigga out the cypher of the sniper hype at dawn
Long live Def to the Squad
And we smokin everybody out there, shit it ain't that hard
I brings classic drama microphone enbalmer
Have your momma beg behind bars for your kidneys tomorrow
My murderous apprentice E Dub
Makes hard funk beats that I become part of
When I be like A-E-I-O-you or battle
Niggaz be like who who who who who like night owls

Xross Breeds in the house representin' Queens. I'm gonna send this out to
um, those fake so-called keepin' it real, ha ha, check it out

Verse 1:
I gets the urge to let loose on shit, bringin' the vibe like Phife Dog and
Q-TIp
Midnight black darkness, it's the area or place that's destincive enought to
trace
The bass, my tune throughout the room, and if you want it, it's here to
consume
Now let's warm things up for instance a witness, as I break it down up in
this sentence
He, who shall not follow the funk shall fall, on they face
Not able to dip di in the place, my style is vintage, doper than any wine
on the market
Mics I spark it, flying tracks is my target, (def squad) I handles my
situation
Without Lyrics form Jason's, I still get's ill, beeotch
Even from the jealosy I receive, you can't hold me back I won't retreat
I'm determined to be the nicest creation since devices
Or Italian ices, no matter what the problem is, I still, ah 1-2, in your
face like I'm Biz

Hook:
Boy meets world ""I want to know of you, I want to know of you.""
I want to know if you feel me though (X8)

Verse 2:
I believe in the power of the conscience mind
And if you think something then it becomes something like
If I had to battle a whole crew, if I couldn't beat them
Then my conscience would defeat them, yeah
I wouldn't put my career in jeopardy, but I will let something off if these
people keep stressing me
This is madness, I wish I was around when that midnight train to Georgia
picked up Gladis
Listen close life is just what you make of it, if you want to Be Happy like
Mary J.
Then hey,  then get rid of negativity in your circumference
Or outside your realm in mass abundance 
Knowing that the industry is fulling up with drama got some hype (fakness
from people of all types)
Even the so-called keepin' it real type stars are frauds, get the sword

Outro:
And the question is asked. Who is the fake nigga? Who is the fake brother
that is always fuckin' up your shit. You want to know how a niggas fake?
Check it out. Sit back and you focus your shit from a general perspective,
and if your shit ain't lookin' tight, there's a fake nigga in your

In this century I uphold the crown, for bringin' Flavor In Ya Ear
Plus I'm Gettin' Down, I manuver techniques for species of all kinds
The third, yours and mine, introduction is in full effect

[Erick Sermon, Verse 1]
Respect my views on this day and era
Keep your eyes upon me, and not the sparrow of berettas
I'm fly, than any bird of this earth
For what it be, my style is butter like Worth
I freak the beat like I'm lost in the twilight
a zone with no phone, looking over parasites
I pack the house like Woodstock when I rock
A three day event of me dropping the illest shit
From here to New Jerz, back to Brooklyn and Queens
The Uptown to Bronx River, I still deliver
The off the wall for y'all
Rearranged cameo-type strange pumping through your veins
What your mommy do, if you're not ready to die like Biggie
I'ma keep jamming like Ziggy
I got the arrows wiped down like Funkmaster Flex
Sway and Tech, and Premier, and we in here

It's on like that! And everybody's welcome!
You are welcome

[Verse 2]
Now, it's on like that once again, it's getting hot
Now it's time to blow up the spot
For my niggaz out there on the block getting money
Playas whose hustling, doing their thing
But me, I've lounged without the stone
Do it for my peeps, take it to the streets
All day, everyday, I sets the mood
Pile a bell of ""Aye"", with new attitudes
I change not for the words, but for the better
And be a trend-setter, and bring the best ever
Yeah, teach me for the president
So I can bring the vibes through your residence Double!
The ghetto blast, the green eyed rapper slash producer
And O.J. with the juice, uh!
Y'all know me, it's the E-R-I-C-K
So enjoy the day, and peace to Marvin Gaye

[hook]

[Verse 3]
Let's groove back and forth like Aaliyah
If you don't got the vibe, then I wouldn't want to be ya
I threw it like a rap attack from New York to Hackensack
Kiss myself and jump back, surprise like a Crackerjack
The eye can bring the smiles without Chanice
And make enemies call truce, or even peace
(?)Funk Lord(?) fights back
again without the Force or blue sky Chewbacca, R2D2 and the crew
The miracle worker, God praise him, praise him!
All of them ready for the funk, you feel like you want like (blaaah!)
Whatever you requested, and you suggested
that I bring the pain like Method
It's nothing nice, cause I'm down for whatever
Me and my beretta, me and my beretta
Goddammit, don't leave your dog stranded
Who? Yeah, the Green Eyed Bandit

I'll just sway...
This's the way it goes down 
Def Squad
Nine-pound
Check this here

Verse One:

The E gets wicked, no need for the biscuit
The green-eyed funkdafied brother coming wicked
I sets the party off just like Tanqueray
The Funk Lord, nobody else could swing this way
I put the loc to the motion, drop the funk coast to coast and
I Buck like Shot, 'cause I know I Got Cha Opin
Check the soup, I Dogg the mic like Snoop
I get swift like H-Town, when I Knock Da Boots (daaat's right)
I'm dynamite with this mic
I Show like Doug E. and I rock the mic lovely
The afrodesiac, bringin the do-wah-diddy
to your city, on the Zapp side with the vibe
I'm Stone Cold like Bobby and Ralph T
I come with the Game of Death, without Bruce Lee
The irregular speakin, for those MC's who be tweakin
Catch me at the Beacon just freakin

Chorus:

Brothers can't see me                                \
'cause my style's the bom-digi-bom-uh-dang-a-dang-digi  / repeat 2X
...
Brothers can't see me

Verse Two:

It goes one for the trouble, two for the show
Aiyyo, I'm gettin airplay like The Most Beautiful
I'm the mack, I made Goldy turn chrome
When I induce my styles upon the microphone (yeah)
I goes down for y'all in broad daylight
Weeded, rockin the mic like ta-dow and psych
Today is a Green Day, so it's blazin
to specify it, I get big-up from Jamaicans
Hey, the E-are-I-see-K gets down for the public
More doper than Janet Jackson's stomach
Ask anybody, who's the dopest producer?
I think of cruise, I'm never too much like I'm Luther
My style is the craziest
No crew is fadin us
You got beef with my squad you better dare that
The shit I kick make rappers say, ""I shoulda snared that""

Chorus

Verse Three:

Complete this puzzle, what Squad beat up like Russell Simmons
And more flyer than Robin Givens
Cosmic Slop, from the darkside
Basically, I Can't Wait, songs from the Redman tape
(and make much sense when he's kickin fool) cause I constantly keep shitting
and y'all constantly keep listening
Yeah, who can it be now, watch out
Flying through the air with wings E Double doing my thing

Chorus",Bomdigi,1996
Erick Sermon,"This goes out to my people on lockdown

1-2 jazz vocab I daze 'em 
Like south dummies I come with the ""all you get"" uppercuts
So don't get stuck
Becareful where you're steppin', sho nuff I'm ruff
I kick back like a weapon, an automatic systematic
Michael Jackson Screamin' on you and your crew for not believin'

Comes the dopest angel to bless my single 
Yeah I come out correct every month like the Source
Cock Deis like I'm Full Force
I bob and weave on tracks I'm Sugar Ray all day
Some say I'm the Chronic like Dre
I watch my back and look for the bloops and the blunders
I'm Supersticious ask Stevie Wonder

[Keith Sweat] 

In the morning when the sunlight hits my eyes 

I just lay there thinkin' how your lovin' keeps me in a jive 

Ain't no question, you can love me baby 

Like nobody can 

What you do to me, my baby girl 

I just don't understand 

Now we can go on 



Repeat 1 



I would never ever, baby do you wrong (ha) 

In the midnight hour I will always keep this lovin' strong 

Just surrender your love, baby girl, and I'll surrender mine 

All I want to do right now, my girl, is baby, take my time 

(Huh, nah-mean, word up) 

So we can go on 



Repeat 1 



[Too Short] 

Hey, yo baby 

Ain't got no tatoos 

But when I walk in the room they pose like statues 

I size 'em all up, I used to take my pick 

But now I'm on some high powered new improved shit 

Deep down inside, it never goes away 

I just might knock a few hoes today 

It's ok, I really get pay makin' phone calls 

Told you once before, I'm in it for the long haul 

The last in the business, make the transition 

Do I have what it takes 

Or do you have the right intentions to git with a playa 

Even if it means you gotta play the back ground so you can see some green 

No video's or groupies, who ever got the talent 

Rush her to the house and let her pose for the camera 

Don't let the freak in you keep you up all night 

Get your money on girl, don't waste your life

Def Squad
Yo real
Let's make it happen
I hear voices saying that's Erick Sermon

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
I'm in the 500, sitting on twenties
Pumping Junior M.A.F.I.A., and B.I.G. getting money
I'm Hollywood swinging
It feels good sometimes so I zoned out and freak the funk and start singing
No Diggity, if it ain't def it ain't shit
I'm like kerosene I keep the place lit
Yo will fix the beat up
No beef read put the heat up
Yo Dave you the man now speak up

[Verse 2: Dave Hollister]
Friday, 5 o'clock time to close shop
Bounce through the hood, she was moving on the block
Cause my peeps already blowing up the box
With the 411 on the party hot spot
Hit the rest shake the 9 to 5 stress
Till about 10 and it's time to get dressed
Gonna be a whole lot of woo-haa!
Know how we do on and on
Till the early morn
Always want to kick it not now I got move on
Beats pumping gotta get my groove on
Everybody's on the floor getting down
Players on the wild trying to spread the mack around
Red alert cause the bar's on fire
Serving drinks faster than you can blink an eye
Ain't gotta worry bout working next day
The weekend's here and it's time to play

[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
This is how we roll on the weekend
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, this is how we roll
This is how we roll on the weekend [Repeat: x2]

Verse 3: Dave Hollister]
Saturday, bounce back upon the set
Shorties rolling deep looking right
Reminding me of the f I just swung her last night
Oh my god shining, talking on the phone
Check out baby in the beamer on the cell phone
Gotta put my thing down
Lock down the next round knock down for the next round
There's a run for the full-court press
Up and down bringing on the opposition stress
But it's all love this is how we do
Til the next Saturday keep it all true
Next stop speed down to the mall
Gotta get prop for the night the next player's ball
Same time different place
Parlay on Sunday for the weekend

[Chorus]

I drop it right here
Reggie!

[Verse 4: Redman]
My persona strictly don't be caring like I'm Donna
the Jerse bomber, go 10 rounds with anaconda
I blow the 9 x to order me some pussy
The Bernie Mack'll get the party bumping like burdussy
Yo, yo I'm fucking your audio
Hardcore reservoir material video
And when you arguing me and my Dave Hollister and E walking
While the valet parking shit

Ride wit me (Def Squad) 
Roll down your windows and ride wit me (uptown) 

Ride wit us 
Bitch ride wit us 
Ride wit us 
Roll up your windows and ride wit us 

Lets smoke this Oakland indoe 
Don't roll down the window 
Start the car 
We ain't going too far 

You know that big 'bootied' girl you always fuckin' wit 
She got a sister I really wanna get 
Some Georgia girls from college park 
You already fucked when we get that started off 

Park in the driveway, it won't take long 
Do it like that, it goes on and on 
You know this the kind of shit, I know you want
E made the beat let me show you somethin' 
Quite a few haters want to see us played out
 
But we got the formula to get payed now 
You can't stand in the way of success 
We got the same job but you make much less 
I remember how it used to be, before we had crack 
If you had a few hundred in your pocket that was fat

[Chorus]
If you feel like smokin' then ride wit us 
Hop the train with no token then ride wit us 
And if you don't give a fuck then ride wit us 
Roll down your windows and ride wit us 
And if you got five on it then ride wit us 
And if you ain't fake niggas then ride wit us 
And if your crew pull trigges then ride wit us 
Roll up your windows and ride wit us 

Ah-yo, I lick two shots that's heard all around the world 
Check how a forty and a blunt can take a nigga girl 
Like E.F. hunting, don't say nothin', I'm haunting 
On the microphone, its the eve of destruction
 
As the world goes around like Passion 
You get flattened in an orderly fashion 
You was warned like a coming attraction 
I got playa hated, felt liberated 
Put him on the burner cause the nigga violated 

We scamper like guard dogs through the fog 
If you feel like you wanna hop, leap like a frog 
The sergeant general get busy chief 
The fastest way to spell rhyme relief is Keith 

I leave you assed out like a cocaine drought 
Hey yo can I get a witness like Andre Krouch 
Niggas need to stop frontin' 
Bitches need to stop stuntin' 
Cause they know fuck well they can't stop my production 

[Chorus] 

I got the forty acres without the fuckin' mule 
Doc Ike Turner givin' mics audio abuse 
I smack a big mouth bitch, and her babysitter 
And her lesbian friend, and that nigga wit her
 
I don't give a fuck, I smack blood out a midget 
My tactics make evil D say come on kick it 
A black five wit rims, what you can spot me in 
Wanna die, I snatch you like Doc Kevorkian
 
So turn the beat up 
While NARCs got me on sweep up 
I'm lucky, I usually tote more Guns than Peter 
I fuck you up to where your forehead will cut meat up 
You wanna box, I square more than Matt Asenerina 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this) 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this0

Let 'em know who they fuckin' with yo, a rhyme wrangler
Tri-angular push-up the hillside strangler
Dangle a, nigga by the ankle off the balcony
Now let his punk ass go, look out below (Below)
It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down
We officially not fuckin' around
Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box

Cause we need a bag of weed (Can you smell it)
Now we need ten dimes, to blow on deez like wind chimes
Time to close the blinds cause you all in mines

I slap bitches on the ass I slap tits up out the muzzle
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent

Brooklyn can start cappin, Uptown can start robbin
Bronx can tell the tale, and start back mobbin

I'm the KING - psych, that's Run and D

My Squad ruled after me, mo' better
Then the game locked me down like Nelson Mandela
Now I'm back with a vengeance like who killed my father

Blast him loud as hell, he'll bang witcha

Yo, I am that monumental
The rap superstar with mad credentials
Yo, I rip over instrumentals
to make you squint your eyes like orientals
A, high school diploma, mastered the art of music
It's my title, doma
That's spanish for ""gimme that"" for those wondering
When I speak, lightning and thundering, uh
Me and Redman be up in Hell's Kitchen daily
I see a few rap cats around there barely
Scared to get out the car

Turn my mic up some.. turn my mic up some..
Turn my mic, check check, check, turn my mic up some
Almighty, uhh..

[Verse One]
Lord forgive me now
This be the best way I know how, to get this out
I can't sing so I have to bounce
Even though, that's not what my style's about
I hate this world, sometimes it gets me
when family and friends are not friendly
I just don't get it - so I sit home
in the bassment lights low on the mic and spit it
They plot, to get my scratch
Not knowin the time to get where I'm at now
In my face, like I owe 'em somethin
Handout from me, and never did nuttin (word up)
They're mad at me, like I changed
It's hard on me Lord, it's wreckin my brain
Is it me? I know it can't be
So I ask you, please help me, now

[Chorus: R. Kelly - *sampled*]
Sometimes I laugh, tryin to keep from cryin
If I was plain out of luck, then tell me who could I trust
See I work so hard, just to get ahead
If it wasn't for God, I'd probably be dead

[Verse Two]
Uhh, I laugh when ain't nuttin funny
Meanwhile cats want to count my money
Plan on me, to get jumped or somethin
Plot-ting like E's punk or somethin
Feels so strange, how I maintain
to last in the game, throughout my fame
I'm focused man, the E stay the same
Hate when folks call me out my name
Damn Lord, heal my body
Cause I'm mad enough to kill somebody
Even hard to trust my lady
Did she lock me down to have my baby?
I know she love me - damn it's nuttin
The world's so corrupt, it got me buggin
Uhh, I want to move away like (?)
why'all feel me - yo, R. Kelly

[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Huh, yo, huh
The game changed, damn I should quit
Can't get respect, without havin a hit
Someone somewhere talkin shit
Got fake cats in my clique
But I deal with the cards that's dealt
Try to make music that's heartfelt
Still doin eighty on the Belt'
In the Escalade, with Dolce shades
I've been paid, now what's left?
I guess, should I stress life or death (huh?)
Sometimes I want to end it all
Live at peace, with 'Pac and Smalls
Can't do that, got fam at the crib
My moms, my pops, my girl and my kids (uh-huh)
.. open my eyes
So I ask you, please help me, now

Uhh, uhh.. yeah
See I know how to get down, word up

It's so hot it's, LL's version of the East coast chronic
Smoke 'til your lungs collapse
You supposed to be the nigga, where all the drama at?
So ironic, L came back
Flooded the market - got your mens on the wall
holdin his blunt, too fucked up to spark it
Show me a nigga who can do like I do
Then gas your mans up so I can rip that nigga too
Braggin you goin platinum like that shit brand new
I was platinum in eighty-five, what THE FUCK wrong with you, huh?
Come (?) L - what you call rocks to me is minerals
Tried to throw salt on my name, shit's political
The baddest man on the planet
So ill when I'm spittin niggaz take it for granted
Cram to understand it, I'll switch and write it lefthanded
Heat my pinky ring up and leave your bitch branded
Got a voice like a cannon - nigga shoot
I don't think she really hot, your career is a fluke
I'm the best MC to ever touch the pen
Take a look at what I'm doin it will not be done again
As sure I am the descendant of former slaves
I'ma resurrect brothers from they mental graves
Make 'em confess - LL's the most rugged
God, and no man's above it, gotta love it

DO - get this bread, use ya infrared
RE - fuck the industry, it's all about

E said - SO, puffin on the - LA (.. TI DO)

[Erick Sermon]
Uhh, E Dub on the microphone
Droppin bombs - spots get blown
So why would you assume my style wouldn't bloom
When I rap, wack MC's vacate the room
Cause they suck, and that's how I feel
I'ma smack down the A&R who signed the deal
Then wrap 'round his neck yo' reel to reel
So next time he know, how the real feel
Get loose and wrap hand 'round the steel
Leave you in the truck, wrapped 'round ya wheel
(I ain't playin) But why'all front like I ain't it
And every rapper why'all like, sample my shit
(Name one) I'm nice, and there's no mistakin
I threw a bomb rhyme in the hands of Troy Aikman
My track record is out there, gone
E.T. like maybe I should phone home (hello?)
I'm known for the dome bangers
Drop any song of mine right now in the club and it's DANGER

Your records ain't sellin no more
And damn - you done spent your money galore
Buyin all the stupid shit that your money can't afford (uh-oh)
Tryin to keep up with the trendy
Got your bitch minked out in all Fendi
Bought your homeboy a brand new Bentley
And the well that wouldn't run dry is now empty
It's simply, cause you wasn't focused on the next day
and your next tape you can't give it away, but hey
I send these to these niggaz tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Everything you see me I owns it
I've been quietly sellin tapes for thirteen years
So let's get, that, clear
You might have sold a few more tapes, but
realistically, are you that great? (nah)

We the hecklers in the front, checkin ya texture
Ya teflon don't protect, waist down and neck up
I trailer park and just trash ya rap up
Ya want some more? fuck it, wait until the next cut
",It's Nuttin',2001
Erick Sermon,"Yo, now when you hear the name Keith Murray, don't think violence
That's nonsense, me and Meth put that to silence
I'm a product of the streets, master of the breaks and beats
Lyrically headstrong and can't be beat

Triple minded, mentally combineded underground pirate
Microphone tyrant, always comin' sideways
And Topsy turvy, lyrical crash-up derby
Come, Filthy McNasty, pretty gritty dirty

Lyrical sayin' MC slayin', 'Hip Hop Quotable'
Unquotable, sociable thirty-eight caliber style swayin'
Open your mind to visualize what I'm sayin'
The products of the streets don't be playin'

It's a bloody ambush like a dirty douche in ya tush
When I push, push up in ya bush
Superstar status, break off beats, the baddest
Style's the baddest, bring extra clips to stop the madness

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
What the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Aiyyo we ain't playin' fair no more, there's somethin' new in store
A Hot Boy but not from the 504
New technique to rock the mic
Lyrical 'Blade' sharp like Wesley and N'Bushe Wright

Soundbombin' could be a catastrophe
When NASA blast off, Flex blast off me
E-vincible, rap round your left ventricle
So let's be sensible

E temperamental, quick to dismember you
Wyclef that 'November' you
They wish they can do what I can do
If you could switch brains, you would, wouldn't you?

My style is Mike, Vince, Earvin
Jordan, Carter, Julius, servin'
MC's at will, I'm trickery, Lou ain't stickin' me
A curve ball, Mark ain't hittin' me

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
Yo, what the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Yo, rapid gunfire destroy ya boys and unemploy some
Put the headphones on your kid like Castor Troy's son
Darts'll damage ya dogs where the you-Haul in my truck
The camera installed, hand upon my balls

Call the morgue, I'm killin' 'em, even Kyle is not feelin' 'em
When I drill 'em with skills of ten Eminems
You feminine, don't even call my name
I stay locked down walkin' with a ball and chain

Put the mac where you tongue at, I done that
These young cats'll get thumbtacked and sent where Big Pun at
Smoke so much, the doc asked where my lung at
I took it out to stash my gun, son run that

Pop mega shit, I pop mega clips
Fuck a system, I keep the heat where your Sega sit
Then I bang the controller 'til the game say, ""Over""
In the Bricks, we'll stick ya when ya plane lays over

Yo, we in the place
(Now whut's up?)
DJ, pick up the pace
(Now whut's up?)
Gyrate, feel the bass
(Now whut's up?)
What the deal, huh?
(Now whut's up?)

Yo, y'all know me, maniacs and addicts add it, at it
Venomous addict snake biter, I the, at it
'Cause I'm a little odder at it
In the Ac' with the aircraft and then leave inactive

My alter-ego make niggaz alter their egos
I flow and turn the East coast to one big creep show
South premisy, Filthy-delphia pistol bangers
Pistol changin', pistol bangin'

I lift metal like Lithuanians
Two thousand nail me Sy Scott rap's new insanian
It's humane, punish ya mayn
'Til no skeletal remains remain remain mainly main

To bitten man made disease that's made by man
Crackin' the DNA code to see how God made man
I storm the mainland, scare MC's like slave hands
Put microchips in they wristbands and make 'em rain dance

Lay hands like Mike Strahand
Puttin' ya face and hands in Ace bands
Tryin' to lift more than ya waistband

I travel every shinin' sea, sea and land to finally see
When niggaz land in the error era wherever, forever no error
Easily cut niggaz careers down like ever
Ever forever and ever, don't you ever
Fuck with Sy, Khi and Erick when we come together, what?

A mega producer, more drugs than Ringo
""A Star is Born,"" Erick Streisand, the E I'm nice man
A rock star while youse a mic stand
So everybody gather round by the speaker
To hear things clear, the blood comin out the ear
I'm a daywalker, the rap be the serum
My Squad still Def and you still can't hear 'em
If you was a shadow, you couldn't get near 'em
Even if there's ""Thirteen Ghosts,"" you couldn't fear 'em
Look outside, there's 24's on my Cadd' (huh?)

Impressive reasons fill the caverns of my mind
No celebration for the people that I didn't know
Connected even though there's nothing left to find

There's more than I can see and there's a deeper part of me
Won't you be my insperiation help me end my desperation now

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do
I've fallen to my knees
I've shed away my tears
And lost my destiny
I sit beneat the sun
My hands held to the sky
I cannot ask a question
But still I wonder why

Poetic justice never seems to make the world feel right
Chaotic voices in the darkenss call your name
You turn away from me whenever I remind you
Of the day the sun saw through the lies exposing all the pain

There's more than I can see and there's a deeper part of me
Won't you be my insperiation help me end my desperation now

Won't you come and take me to another day
Take me far away

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do

Yeah, I want a girl to prefer an independent
To do somethin different with her, cash I'll spend it
Chicks that got, they proud cause they made it
They can't find a man cause dudes intimidated
Intimidate me?  Show me the money and the crib
and the car, that's yo' new Jaguar?
A workin woman, attracts to E
Don't mind doin for dem, they don't need me so

You got highway miles on you girl, so why would I spend there
You want champagne to sip then you buy it
See how it feels sometimes, homegirl try it
Don't stop there, for real
Do it again next time when you out, pay for the meal
Uhh, already been there, uh, so I'm tellin you
It's a ""Scary Movie,"" Tori Spelling move
Ain't nuttin changed, same song as ""Golddigger""
Same rules apply for the same-ass nigga, what?

[Chorus]

[Erick Sermon]
Yeah, aiyyo here's a few rules, don't approach me
in any fashion chick, without the proper tools
Yeah tools meaning school, a job, things
A place that's yours, so you can slam doors
Cause without that, talkin to me, no need
You're grown and I already got kids to feed
So unless you my baby momma
I don't want the Dave Hollister drama cause that's bad karma, trick

Hey yo, I'm immaculate, come through masculine
Wide-body frame, E-Dub's the name, whoa
In the field of rap, I'm supurb, I'm fly
I should be in the sky with birds
I ride 20 inch rims when I lean, yo

Scoop up an Arabic chick before she close
She goes, those my people
Yeah, them broads from Puerto Rico, them Keith's folks
Yeah, watch how the ""E"" locs 64
Black rags, black interior, shift on the floor

I leave your eye like a 9-9 Benz-buggy, puffy
Brick niggas get real ugly
Trust me, keep your four if you feel lucky
Mug me, I ain't got nothin' but four figures
And weed and hash chopped in the coffee blender
My shots like squeegy men on your window
Usual suspect, I'm the crippled member
Get away when I sat down in the office
Heat in my lap keep me walkin' awkward
While y'all talk it, the doc reinforce it
The mic, it's hard to keep my paws off it
Yo' bitch is my bitch when it's over
No Cristal, I pulled up with King Cobra
Out in the Nova, don't bother
My Nino Brown bust, it'll shut down the corridor

When the pen hit the pad, the evil in me come out
Total recall for people to breathe

I got dogs in the backyard shittin' their lawns
We got chickens ain't leaving 'till six in the morning
Round and round we go, circle the area
Leave the party, go straight to the Marriott
Dozy-doe with cowboys where they saddle at

How long, until it's time to go? Baby doll

Oh see, we gotta do this again like this, check it out

You keep on knockin' but you can't come in-ah
My way of rhymin, 'cause you're a beginner
You know with my flow, I bring the ill freak funker
I'm so unforgettable like Archie Bunker
I be catchin' wreck like my name was Randy Moss
And always be flossin', my funky diamonds costin'
My, my my repertoire
Is so bizarre you go hardy har har

My jingle bell-ah always Roc-a-fella
Even if I go acapella it will still be a best seller
I got super sperm, eat wheat germ
Never had a cameo, never had a perm
I'm not Billy Dee, or R. Kelly
Or, Markie Dee or B.I.G.
I'm a, little somethin' like Heavy D
'Cause girls, ah girls they love me

You that one year scream bling rapper
Dapper than Dapper Dan, my interior's Gucci
Overdosing, call me John Belushi
Never liked Lucy and I beat Little Ricky
Made him ""Cry a River"" like his name was Britney
I rock gold chains, I never wore the platinum
Unless records was jewelry and it come from rapping

(Wow)
Like the Diabolical Biz
I'm followin' his style, how are you kids?
This here is real, Mob Deep underground
Take me to funky town, and drive around
I hop out the Hummer, the same color as the truck
Fake cats lookin' Biz like Hey whassup?
I'm a vet, and never wore a green suit
The only army is Def Squad, believe troop

Work your mind, put your body in-to it
I rock the microphone, most definitely
I got mo' rhymes than Muhammad Ali
I got mo' toys than Mr. Spock
I put the party people in a state of shock
Listen listen listen to the Emmezah-A
Rrazah-K, always makin' your day
Without further adieux for you and yours
Luckier than a gambler throwin' 3's and 4's

Just like pageantry
That I could turn the party out, make the ladies scream
With the with the whoa quick unpredictable
Like Daffy Duck, I'm diss-pic-a-ble
This is the end, and I'm lettin' you know
I love it party people, but I got to go

The most anticipated chick of the year, cheaugh

I came to flip and reverse game
Every dude that I touch get whipped like my first name
And although I'm prissy, don't get it confused
I don't need to mess with you, I've got plenty of dudes

Got the caramel skin, on the parallel twin
Heads keep turnin' like a carousel spins
I know for a fact, these women are sick
'Cause these hoes can't mess with this Dominican chick

Got the flag on my arm, it proves I am the bomb
All I do is speak Spanish and it works like a charm
I been ready, 'cause I payed my dues
Yo, this goes out to my Brooklyn crew

I don't care

You might catch me on the train, okay, I'm just, chillin'

Y'all non-rappin' chicks can keep chillin'
Talk if you want 'cause

Ayo, E is chillin', Kwe is chillin'
Whip in the house, Brooklyn in the buildin'
Blood on the dance floor, sweat on the ceilin'
When you get that feelin' that gun concealin' is a hobby

Nobody stealin' shows like Kweli
Workin' on a new project while you chillin' in the lobby
Keep it thorough, ain't real, guns don't kill
People kill people but the Sun don't chill

But still, I stand cooler than a Minnesota winter
Nigga, hotter than the blocks where guns bust over dinners
Plus, all the sinners got dreams they runnin' after
Workin' a 9 to 5 now, is like you hustlin' backwards

That's why all these young girls in love with the rappers
Basketball players and up-and-comin' actors
Swimmin' with the sharks and flirtin' with disaster
When the things you own start ownin' you, they your master

Yeah
I don't care

I got the yak in the back of the club, I'm just chillin'
With Whip and my nigga E Dub, we just chillin'
Nobody give a fuck about you, we chillin'

To go against the industry, without plan B
And don't count those that made it
Even those one hundred million bucks still don't equal up

I bet you got some brand Timbs, car got brand new rims

But you frontin' like E's not happenin
Like Run told me, ""I'm the reason why you rappin'

Erick Sermon,"The Surgeon General of Chilltown, New York
Has determined, that the sounds you're about to hear
can be devestating, to your ear..

[Erick Sermon]
Yeah, uh-huh, huh, Long Island
Queens.. Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan
Staten.. Y.O., uhh

Yo, E-Dub, I come from the gutter
The Ving Rhames of rap, it's guns or butter
I make things happen, rappin
The game don't want to act right, we kidnap it
(Get on the floor!) Rob it like Napster
There's gonna be slow-singin and flower bringin so call the pastor
The Roger Moore of the rap game
He's 007, I'm E-Double the veteran, the name
(Erick!) The way I do it is Mean Joe
Green Eyed Bandit, nigga check the pamphlet
On my CD, you won't hear the same
It's two special guests, and the rest is my name
You won't hear the bling, or the champagne - nuttin
You won't hear a nigga on the microphone frontin
And no love songs, I'm not serenadin
I'm just narratin the streets on my beats
I'm a New York nigga, and Strawberry's home
That's a New York nigga, and it gets no bigger
Go figure; ch-ch-check out, check out, check out ""My Melody""
Bittin niggaz' style that's a Jayo Felony
I'm a rap pioneer what you tellin me?
This ain't hot in the street, so what you sellin me?
That's a bootleg rap, shake dance Duke
You a fluke, got proof and that's that

[Chorus: Erick Sermon]
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan (uh-huh)
Chilltown, my nigga what's happenin?
""Chilltown, New York"" (chill.. chill.. chill..)
It was all good just a week ago
Suffolk, Nausau, Yonkers, Staten
Chilltown, my nigga what's happenin?
""Chilltown, New York"" (chill.. chill.. chill..)

[Erick Sermon]
Yeah, why didn't you make your own music?
You thought Down South records'd do it - nope!
You're you, and that's them
Look in the mirror, that's you, and that's them - find yourself
If 'Pac came back he'd be a mad muh'fucker
Now all y'all proceeds should be goin to his mother
{?} get your money, your career was cute
But y'all hoes will soon be exposed, open the doors
The Don King of the rap ring, I bring the mic
Promote the hype, be in Vegas that night, let's fight!
Ding, there's nuttin more to it
I'm takin back the city and that key you got to it - yep
I'm the first one to bounce Down South
A-T-L in ninety-two, I took that route - uh-huh
Real recognize real
Def Squad regime, the rap supreme, that's my team, yeah

Rag-top with rims, that was me stupid!

[Chorus 2X: Erick Sermon]
{I'M NOT HIM} I'm not him
(It's E-Dub, it's not who you thought he was)
(He's flyer than you thought he was)
So I'm back to reclaim my name because

[Erick Sermon]
{I'M NOT HIM} I'm a 15 year vet
Type of rapper, 15 year stretch
The one who made it happen rappin
Got it crackin rappin, keep the paper stackin, yeah
{I'M NOT HIM} I'm hip-hop elite
The one who signed Redman, the one who signed Keith
The one who made the beat that locked down the corner
Hardcore, that's my persona, geah
{I'M NOT HIM} Nope, I'm the E
The other half of the group of EPMD
And my track record so mean
This here underground bounce so hood, fuck mainstream
{I'M NOT HIM} You can't get with me
I rock spots and leave a TLC ""Unpretty""
And now it's ""Ugly,"" Bubba Sparxxx scene
Real dirty and grimy with the Squad behind me

[Chorus]

[Erick Sermon]
{I'M NOT HIM} Nope, I'm the master
I'm the man's man, the rapper's favorite rapper
The ultimate, none get close to it
I'm Erick, I'm the one you supposed to pick
{I'M NOT HIM} I keep it gutter on tracks
""Regulate"" like Doc Dre's brother
I'm Warren in rap, I drop bombs to-day
You lay like you-day and Qu-say, yeah
{I'M NOT HIM} The MC Grand Royal
on the microphone, and New York's my home
Long Island zone, where I roam
like phones in Buffalo, geah - you know!
{I'M NOT HIM} Go 'head, talk about me
I don't care since my label dropped me
And I returned like Makaveli
In a new stretch Caddy, watchin ""Belly""
I'm not him

Listen, ain't playin' no games man
Yeah, whattup

Give or receive and give or take, I'm an Indian giver
I take back what's given to the getter from the giver
Nigga give way, give up, you never get a glimpse
Of the glimmer man, glimmer glitter when I trek your body shiver

Rhythm I'm rippin' whatever I can get a grip of
Just to get a giggle, this literature's ishkabibble
And damn, dun-uh, dun-uh, dun-uh, the shark is in the water
Dun-uh, dun-uh, dun-uh got him right where I want him

Now I'ma get him, Scott crack leg bones like a wishbone
Snap your nose bone witcha chin bone
Break your legs and snap your shinbone
Put your skull bone, jawbone right next to your gall stones
'Til y'all all know

I got the hypothalamus of a hippopotamus
Squashin' the retardapuss when [Incomprehensible] rush
Too good to be true like fairy tales come true again
You wish you was me but woke up and you was you again

Sy Scott, you can't rap like me
You can't murder a rhyme or kill a track like me
You can't bust aim or hold a gat like me
Flow hundred percent perfect, you can't rap like me, no

This here's somethin' stupid for the eardrum
You wanna hear somethin' slick, son, here it come
You can ask Dr. Phil, I'm ill
I'ma kill you, then kill them, then 'Kill Bill'

Yeah, word to Vivica, I hemorrhage a pile
Drop the temperature, 'til the coroner start zippin' ya
Be-ball player, I shoot from the perimeter
Two shot, three shot, all into ya

On mics I does my thing
Agua, I flow like Poland Spring
Not from Maine, I'm from New York, mayne
I'm the bandit, in the black Maybach in transit

300 pound nigga, hold weight, stop, hold, wait
E-Dub the great there's no mistake, yeah
The untakeable, unshakable, you uncapable
I'm Bruce Willis, I'm 'Unbreakable'

You can't replace the unplaceable
You can't face off, with the unfaceable
Even the matador can't face the bull
I'm the raging bull, you wanna shoot, pull

M E, you can't rap like me
The boy with the slow flow you can't rap like me
Bang, bang, you can't shoot a gat like me
My Squad is Def and you can't rap like Khari

I throw three like Bobby Jackson at 'em
I'm O.G. like Bobby Johnson stomp 'em
Hold G like Bumpy Jonson on 'em
Read flip and beat kids like Joe Jackson

My flow jackin', clack, clack, I'm sharp like the claws
Of Hugh Jack, hands packin', make you an 'X-man'
Time for some action and matter of fact
Go exercise or be ordained to explore pain

And explain, why you puttin' extras on
In this excess I throw a hex through your headset
Settle down 'fore I set it off on your set
Let's say Santiago is the best you heard yet

I know, my flow, oh my God, get so heated
That MC's stay away like I gotta heebie jeebies
Ask G's if I G, hit the G spot on your queen
Kings get they heart or crown ripped apart now

Yeah, you can't rap like me
You snap back, get back, smack a wack MC
Santiago, you ain't got the stats like me

I snatch baguettes, you get what you get, guess what
Guess what, you get it and forget it like guess what
Guess what get done to special guests that can't guess what
He goin on when Sy be goin off
In the cross my Squad run tracks like motocross
I write words I read and then re-word 'em
Same word, rework 'em without re-wordin 'em
Word perfect for workin with 'em
Workmen do homework, men at work in the network workin system
Yeah, I overwork, work the middle
Work and turn your homework workbook against you
In the range of a roundabout ratio
I merry-go-round around around the radio
Around around and away we go
Everytime Sy bust down then it's up up away you go

Now what do you niggaz think about this
A jam for the streets that you can't resist
So hustle to this, bang to this
Get your money to this, yeah listen to this
Now what do you bitches think about this
A jam for the clubs that you can't resist
So shake to this, freak to this

E-Dub, I'm known like the Rucker
Fucker, comin through like a redneck trucker
Nother, man down, call 9-1-1
I stash that so they can't find my gun
I'm in the woods like hikers, bikers, campers
Antlers, bears snakes and long-leg tarantulas
Uh, E-Dub I got balls
If I get chased pon' de river like Sean Paul, believe it
I'm on the fish neck, like jet-skis
I killed Romeo, along with Jet Li
And messin with the E be incomparable
Get romped like Romper Room, a one man platoon
Oh I say, I'm Andrew Dice Clay
Filthy mouth and also fuck why'all
You want to get physical we touch why'all
Haters we appreciate the love so - thank you very much why'all

Last but not least, Keith wreck shop comfortably
When I flow, I fuck up your street credibility
Def Squad get busy often
When it comes to chicks we got more tricks than a dolphin
You see the new E-Dub spin when I pull up
Ecko sweatsuit with the hood up
This shit is so hot you could cook an egg on it
So I sunny-side up, buttered toast my opponents
I take the drama to the middle of the street
Or any nigga that's feelin himself like Tweet
Kid you sonned out, let me speak to your father
Matter of fact, hold these here, and don't even bother
We come through with the nines poppin
Niggaz get so quiet, you can hear rats pissin on cotton
So you see there's nothin furthermore to say

[Erick Sermon]
Yeah, all day yeah, uh
Turn me up, uh-huh...it's serious
Headphones turn me up
{Recordings indistinct)

This is somethin that you need to hear
It's cool and capture
I feel like Blondie caught in the rapture
Rappers and those who try to offend me
From false accusations they had heard from Wendy (Hello Erick)
I'm in the game to play
For those cats on the sideline callin me gay, huntin
Don't be the broads cause niggaz
Mad cause I'm baggin chicks that look as bad as Jigga's (tell 'em)
And make seven figures, a rap icon
I'm the one kid in the biz to keep your eyes on
Me, Superman, I fell from the window
If I fly high, then why drive a benzo
In drive a 'lac, in drive a hummer
In drive is something brand-new this summer (tell 'em)
The operator, I got your number
Don't act like I don't flow like water, call the plumber (uh-huh)
Something tryna stop the E from gettin large
I feel like the Beastie Boys in Sabotage
In all five boroughs, I pissed on trees
I'm a dog (arroo), ask Rockwilder please
There's some fake cats, they talk behind me
A few A&R's sayin they won't sign me (uh-huh)
Cause they see my face and think I'm done
Meanwhile, I'm the black Neo, yes the one (one)
While they sign they brother or friend or they man
That's supposed to blow, he's a no-show
And that's why the game is shutdown
Every major player that's in it, been changed around (tell 'em)
But I'm still standin and got something to say
The boy is still here like LL and Dre
I sat down with Russell and Def Jam team
I sat down with Suge and Jimmy Ivine
I sat down with Sylvia, sat down with Tommy
Sat down with Clive Davis and no favors
I got booked at dark
And this might be my last huh-rah
I'ma rock now until tomorrow
Some ask about EPMD's prognosis
But it won't happen til P get focused
I won't be compared to Nas or Jada
But I'ma punish the game for it's foul behavior
And y'all got it backwards
Those ain't real MC's, those is actors
Cast of Fear Factor (tell 'em)
I agree with Missy
No creativity in the game no more
It's the same old bore
A few people in the biz know what's happenin
The fans don't know, they think I'm platinum
Cause they hear the record gettin played 4,000 times on every station
But at the same time hate...disc jockeys
If I'm over, explain how I do it
In 2001 I shut it down with ""Music"" (hmmm)
If I'm whack, why in 2002, yes it's true, I made cats react (uh-huh)
Source might not quote this here
It might not be nothin but I wrote this here

We capered in your hood with dirty machetes and bloody aprons
I'll acquire a tec, quiet your rep
Stay quiet as deaf, or Kanye's choir rep (uh-huh)
As I make another left, quiet I crept, quiet you slept
I'm back with the tec, like I never left (surprise niggaz!)
See frivolous beef'll get you curiously shot (uh-huh)
You fuckin with Keith, I think seriously not (hell no)
I ATTACK like a blue-nose pit off gunpowder (yeah)
And love to soup the beef up just like clam chowder
With my Squad in the house, we misbehave
Get drunk and tongue-kiss bitches like Flavor Flav

You get the thumbs up, your raw footage is uncut
Fronting like them goodies is untouched
We both knew this money's is young bucks
Ma, you ever take a trip to Shang-a-lot
Too many hard shames, the hardest one is saying goodbye
Look here, time is money, let me save you some time
And in your spare time, fully understand I'm a rare find
You know, so pick a day and pick a place and we there for sure
Slow up the pace, this ain't no race, and there you go
I'm dope money, girl, that mean I got cash to blow
She love it though, she so international
Not around the way, around the world
And you be stunting when you around your girls
But you classy, though, I'm feeling your vibe, you feeling the high

Try to sneak past me like you ain't balling
You look sweet like Tweet, baby, see-see-call me
Matter of fact, wasn't you on Maury?
I'm just playing, hey miss thang
Hey, hey, miss thang, how you gon' miss me?
I got tickets, let's roll to the Knicks game
You Teena Marie, and baby, I'm Rick James
Excuse me, where you going, mama?
I wanna change, I voted for Obama
Bring in the new, kick out the old timers
Let's talk while we go and meet your mama

Rock the mic, roll a Philly uptight, you know
I like it though, she so international}

Seems to me, me, you a queen to be
You mean girl, but you don't mean to be
Got your crown and your throne, little castle you can rest your dome
And we can smoke a little greenery, you know?
You getting that dough, let's get it and go on this cruise
I'm taking it slow, you painting your toes, and it's cool
Fuck with your dude, I'm fucking with you
Like an overnight celebrity, Miss Nothing to Lose

Yo, hey, hey, miss lady, my boricua
I heard your Applebum like Bonita
Your accent telling me you from the eastside
Take off your shoes, you bout five feet high
I get high, what about you?
A jungle brother, and baby I house you
Your feet looking real good in them house shoes

I come rollin in when I see that low flow
Heckuva foe, heard a gun and settled for a metaphor
I'm naive between the sleeves of the sheets
Murderin, who should ever try to fuck with me
Murray word is bond gets it on
And ready to blow any nigga out the cypher of the sniper hype at dawn
Long live Def to the Squad
And we smokin everybody out there, shit it ain't that hard
I brings classic drama microphone enbalmer
Have your momma beg behind bars for your kidneys tomorrow
My murderous apprentice E Dub
Makes hard funk beats that I become part of

What are you doing outside 
Are you giving all my ass up 
You're a dime so niggas won't pass up

[Ericka:] 
Wait a minute nigga you better back up 
I told you a long time ago I'd always have your back 
I'm still coming off with half of them cheques, so why are you trippin'? 
Ain't got to worry 'bout nobody getting up in your stuff 
Soon as the jury said guilty I closed it up 
Bought you a new Bible with a blunt in it already rolled up 
Numbers and Dueteronomy is where you'll find me

Don't mind me, I'm fiendin' baby 
I want some ass real bad 
Locked up wit' all these hard legs, scrappin' daily

The sweating, the bumpin', the grinding right through these bars and 
If I ever thought it would help you make it, just picture me naked 
Can't feel your body and I hate it, I'm going crazy 
Gotta get my mind off this, 'bout to go up to the mall and buy an outfit

Lived out of car, still didn't have no doubt in me

She wore the same clothes, even rocked the same shoes (same shoes)
She sold her earrings man to get ya boy back in the booth
She sold my mixtapes to help me get our s*** straight

At TSU homecoming at the ma** co (cash real)
She on the grind with Shine, trying to come up on these figures

I'm a keep it trill man, she realer than most of y'all n****z
Taught her stay down (down) and you'll come up (up)

I know you got my back, regardless of the situation

Yet you got so much patience dealing with me and this dream I'm chasing
I'm constantly on the road (road) I'm constantly on the move (move)
You calmly handle the duties, things you thought you'd never do (do)
Like living out hotels and messing up your credit (credit)

It would of broke a weaker gal but you ain't let it (ain't let it)

Don't sweat the Technique

Let see who bit to detect the style

At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass,'till MC's get weak.
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep,
'Cause when I speak, they freak
To sweat the technique

Wit a melody and a president's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits

They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
 
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens, are swords
Letters put together form a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, born with structure
Because of my culture, I'm a rip and destruct the
Difficult styles that'll be for the technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique

But don't sweat the Technique

I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep and the weak then complete their
Pull with a seat, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old techniques become antiques
Better then something  brand new 'cause it's radiant
And the wild style'll have much more volume
Classical too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never  irrelevant: mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
They fought, and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2002
Erik Berglund,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Erik Berglund,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme

Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

But still I wanted more
A drink or two got me started
And now I just can't get over you
The grass is so green on the other side
At least it felt so at the time
All I got was a troubled mind
And now I just can't get over you

So it comes a bitter end
Guess I blew it once again
Still I haven't learned my lesson well
I can't get over you
Could you spit me in the face
Could I starve a houndred days
Whatever it takes to break this spell
I can't get over you
Could you please give me forgivnes
And wash my sin away
Cuz' without love my life is pretty pointless
I just can't get over you

So it comes a bitter end

Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring, The Continental
A way of dancing that's really ""entre nous""

It's very subtle, The Continental
Because it does what you want it to do
It has a passion, The Continental
An invitation to moonlight and romance

It's quite the fashion, The Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance
Your lips whisper so tenderly
Her eyes answer your song

Two bodies swaying, The Continental
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of
So keep on dancing, The Continental
For it's a song of romance and of love

You kiss while you're dancing
Not a bad idea
The Continental, hm, it's continental
You sing while you're dancing

Your voice is gentle and sentimental
You stroll together arm in arm
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm
You will find while you're dancing

A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do

And a hum drum ways 
Hey kids, let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the Senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free 
Hey Sis, one kiss, and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed Milton's paradise lost could be found
But in the eyes of the Dean, his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's gotta do
What a man's gotta do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The Dean, his daughter and me 
They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered ""I love you -
Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol, awol, awol, awol""
And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses 
Now, the paint is peeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, and when the chips are down
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, you kinda lose all feeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, your head goes round and round
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Round and round and round and round and round
I'm throwing myself off this train 
Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways 
Hum drum days, he's got
Hum drum ways, oh boy

Erik Westerhof,"You want to go out Friday
And you want to go forever.
You know that it sounds childish
That you've dreamt of alligators.
You hope that we are with you
And you hope you're recognized
You want to go forever
You see it in my eyes.
I'm lost in the confusion
And it doesn't seem to matter
You really can't believe it
And you hope it's getting better

You want to trust the doctors
Their procedure is the best
But the last try was a failure
And the intern was a mess.
And they did the same to Matthew
And he bled 'til Sunday night
They're saying don't be frightened
But you're weakened by the sight of it
You lock into a pattern
And you know that it's the last ditch
You're trying to see through it
And it doesn't make sense
But they're saying don't be frightened
And they're killing alligators
And they're hog-tied
And accepting of the struggle

You want to trust religion
And you know it's allegory
But the people who are followers
Have written their own story.
So you look up to the heavens
And you hope that it's a spaceship
And it's something from your childhood
You're thinking don't be frightened

You want to climb the ladder
You want to see forever
You want to go out Friday
And you want to go forever.
And you want to cross your DNA
To cross your DNA with something reptile.
And you're questioning the sciences
And questioning religion
You're looking like an idiot
And you no longer care.
And you want bridge the schism,
A built-in mechanism to protect you.
And you're looking for salvation
And you're looking for deliverance
You're looking for deliverance
You're looking like an idiot
And you no longer care.
You want to climb the ladder
You want to see forever.
You want to go out Friday
You want to go forever",Hope,1999
Erik Wohlgemuth,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2008

"Erika ""Kane"" Yancey","Cuantas noches en mi cama pronuncie tu nombre 
Entre estas cuatro paredes de mi habitación 
Cuantas horas he esperado tu llamada ausente 
O tu voz arrepentida en el contestador 

Cuantas palabras calladas 
Cuando entre tus labios, 
Los míos regalaron besos sin contemplación 

Cuantas tardes nos comíamos a besos, cuantas 
Tantas como días hace que te fuiste amor 

No hay que mirar atrás 
Pues estoy luchando 

Yo sin ti no se como tenerme 
Con el alma en pie 
Sin ti me cuesta respirar 
Se muy bien que tu 
A mi no volverás 
Que sepas tu que como yo 
Ningún amor se entregara 
Yo sentí no se como tenerme 
Con el alma en pie 
Sin ti me cuesta respirar 
El tren pasa una vez 
A ti no volverá 
Que sepas tu que como yo 
Ningún amor se entregara 

Es tanta la lejanía que se siente cuando 
Has querido a alguien con toda tu pasión 
Y de buenas a primeras en quien confiabas 
Se va llevándose los muebles de tu corazón 

No hay que mirar atrás 
Pues estoy luchando 

Yo sin ti no se como tenerme 
Con el alma en pie 
Sin ti me cuesta respirar

And keep him company.
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper
And live by the side of the sea.
I'll polish his lamp by the light of day,
So ships at night can find their way.

Won't that be okay?

We'll take walks along the moonlit bay,
Maybe find a treasure, too.
I'd love living in a lighthouse:
How about you?

I dream of living in a lighthouse, baby,
Every single day.
I dream of living in a lighthouse,
A white one by the bay.
So if you want to make my dreams come true,
Go be a lighthouse keeper, do!

A white one by the bay-ay-hay.

Erika Jo,"Woke up today, the alarm clock ringing
Face to the wall, you were still sleeping
Rolled out of bed, turned on the light
Brushed my hair with my eyes closed

Stumbled downstairs, 
poured myself a cup of coffee 
Breakfast with the TV
that's the way it always is these days
We're stuck in our ways
And nothing seems to ever change

But the sun is shining
Seems like perfect timing
To take a drive with the music loud
Laugh and sing til the road runs out
But the sun is shining
And there's no denying
That you and I could give it one more try
But it sure feels like a good day for goodbye

We swore if we tried we could make it to the weekend
But saturday night we started sinking
Who's gonna bail us out this time 
When the water gets too high
And not enough talk
And not enough action
We could fill our days with yet
another distraction
But my hands are getting numb these days
from barely hanging on

But the sun is shining
Seems like perfect timing
To take a drive with the music loud
Laugh and sing til the road runs out
But the sun is shining
And there's no denying
That you and I could give it one more try
But it sure feels like a good day for goodbye

To pack my bags, collect my things
Take back what's mine
Cut these strings, baby baby
Do you really maybe think its time?

But the sun is shining
Seems like perfect timing
To take a drive with the music loud
Laugh and sing til the road runs out
But the sun is shining
And there's no denying
That you and I could give it one more try
But it sure feels like a good day for goodbye",Good Day for Goodbye,2005
Erika Jo,"I broke most of Mama's dishes
She banned me from the kitchen when I was a kid
And I tore Daddy's truck to pieces
Left it in a heap that no mechanic could fix

You don't believe me - I can see you laughin'
But trust me, I'm an accident 
A'waitin' here to happen

And all I can do is watch it wash away
And sometimes, I'm the lighthouse standing on the shore line
Guiding all the sailors through the rain

Yeah, you shattered my heart
Yeah, I should really fall apart

But I'm strong tonight
I'm the stones that keep the river wide
A straight and steady light that shines
You can't cover me up, you can't keep me down

I'm strong tonight
I can hold my head up high
Tomorrow tears will take their flight
But I'm strong, I'm strong tonight

Sometimes I feel like I'm the girl out at the party
Too afraid to look up from her drink
But right now, I'm the dancer moving with the music
So free I don't even have to think

I'm taking it out on the town
Turning it up before I come down

Erika Jo,"I used to talk about coincidence
And how true love is only found by chance
Now I look at you and I'm convinced
There are no accidents

I can see that every time I chose
What I thought to be just some wrong road
Lead me here holdin' you this close
There are no accidents

One kiss and I knew for certain
Love so absolutely perfect
Can't be anything but meant to be
There's just no other way to explain you with me

The sun goes down and the moon comes up
The tide rolls in the stars appear above
And you and I fallin' so in love
There are no accidents

One kiss and I knew for certain
Love so absolutely perfect
Can't be anything but meant to be
There's just no other way to explain you with me

And how true love is only found by chance
An' now I look at you and I'm convinced
There are no accidents, there are no accidents

Erika Jo,"A little book store on a side street
I thought sure that I'd be safe
But there you were, there with her
Buying books on some romantic place

What you see in her is such a mystery to me
I hid behind my coffee cup and prayed that you would leave
I thought that I would die when I saw her kissin' you
They say, love is blind, I wish I were too

It's a small town an' word gets around
I wish you knew what everybody knows
And I keep hopin', some day you'll open
Up your eyes and let her go

She don't love you, you're just her flavor of the week
She plays with hearts but she don't play for keeps
It hurts me to watch her make a fool of you
They say, love is blind, I wish I were too

Every time I see an old Dodge truck
Or an old photograph of us
Every time I drive down by the lake
I fall into yesterday

I wish somehow that I could have you back in my life
And at the same time, I just wish that you would stay out of my sight
Cause I can see it's over, oh but I can't face the truth

Too much time for me to think things over
Thoughts of losing you just linger on and on and on

I'm sitting here with my luck unchanging
Knowing I'm the one you're blaming
Words that keep repeating say
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
But I pray that they are wrong

I wish I may, I wish I might have
Loved you a little bit more in spite of
Who I was and how much I loved
That girl I used to be

I live my life somewhere between them
I'm everything that you don't need
And more and more and more

If I'm not the girl you once defended
Where's that knight with good intentions
Cause you swore, you swore

Being with you get's me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you

Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch

Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be

For flames live such a little while

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Risin' in the mornin' just to have some fun
Workin' real hard and givin' it all
If people don't like it

Just to make you sweat
Then they tell you where to go

Their advice is ""Don't bother""

What used to be good
Is now misunderstood

And jog to the gym
They could knock you off the track
So shake them off your back

Would it hurt to crack a smile and squeak out a cheer?

Walking along trails under falling snow
Brushing off the snowflakes from the tip of your nose
There's nowhere else I would rather be
Than Spending The Holidays With You

When shoppers push and hustle
And the traffic takes it's toll
I'd rather spend my holidays close to you and in your hold
There's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Than Spending The Holidays With You

Who needs the pressure of another frantic season
It doesn't seem to make much sense
Without friendship and cheer the holidays have little reason

See the glowing embers spark into growing flames

It's Clarinet Claire

Claire can really play that licorice stick
She can really move the crowd
She can play it like the hush of a whisper
She can play it like laughing out loud

When it came time for summer break
Claire wasn't ready to quit
So she asked her band teacher at school
If she could take home her licorice stick

Summer went by so very fast
As summers often do
Claire learned a few more hip jazzy licks
While her toes wiggled in the sand

So she gathered her books and her clarinet
And all of her new music tools

Words & Music by Erika Paul
From the cd entitled, ""Scat's My Bag""

Wake up!
Get up!
And Clean Your Room
To The Trumpet Tune
Here comes brother with a broom
To The Trumpet Tune

Dirty socks here, wrinkled shirts there
Here a sock, there a shirt
Everywhere there's backyard dirt
It's a big mess with more to confess
Stale broccoli, crumbs, and old banana peel

Wake up!
Get up!
And Clean Your Room
To The Trumpet Tune

Dirty trousers and smelly shirts
A shoe full of goo
Paper cups and last week's juice
Crusty old pizza too

Walked the pet dog, fed the pet cat
Now there's slobbery kibbles in my new backpack
Here an old towel and there a wrinkled coat
It's gotten so bad, should we sink this boat?

Wake up!
Get up!
And Clean Your Room
To The Trumpet Tune

Wake up!
Get up!
Clean Your Room!
It's almost noon!
To this swingin' tune
Waaaahhh!

Words & Music by Erika Paul
From the cd entitled, ""Scat's My Bag""

Have you heard Dynamic Dan?
He's a drummin' man
His sticks can bring down the house
He makes all kinds of sounds
He brushes like a breeze in the trees
His rhythm brings you to your knees

He's Dynamic Dan The Drummer Man
From sticks to brushes, he never rushes
From latin to funk, from hip hop to swing
He's out there doin', doin' his thing

He can play a rhythmic melody
And back an afro-cuban band
And lay down a bossa nova
In any dynamic range
His solo tells a special story
And shows off all his skill and his chops

He's Dynamic Dan The Drummer Man
From mallets to brushes, he never rushes
From reggae to pop, from waltz to foxtrot
He's out there doin', doin' his thing

He can play percussion instruments
And dances with a conga beat
Jammin' on clave' sticks and guiro
His vibe work sounds so cool
He knows how to play the tambourin
Now check out his funk-style groove

He's Dynamic Dan The Drummer Man

Red Light, Green Light, Yellow Light, Stop!
By day he installs the traffic lights
Left Turn, Right Turn, Flashers and Walk
He's scattin' a song to help the time pass along

But when his work day is over
And time to pack up his tools
Guitar Dwight grabs his Gibson
And puts on his cool jazz shoes

He's the traffic light guy by day
And Guitar Dwight by night
In the light, his song is happy
In the dark, his song is sad

But when his work day is over

Words & Music by Erika Paul
From the cd entitled, ""Scat's My Bag""

Does anybody REALLY like spiders?
Not me, or at least I never ever thought I could
Then I met a little spider that I named Sammy
So I gave him a chance like I felt I should

Sammy
How does he walk upside down?
Sammy
The ceiling is just like the ground to him
Sammy, with toes so unbelievably strong
Where ever he is, he can never go wrong

How does he do THAT? How does he defy gravity?
How does he spin his web? To me, it' a true mystery

Sammy
How does he walk upside down?
Sammy
The ceiling is just like the ground to him
Sammy, with toes so unbelievably strong
Where ever he is, he can never go wrong

Like Tarzan swinging on a grapevine
Sammy swings even farther on a shiny silky line
Just as long as he stays in his own space
I'll let him live another day

Sammy
How does he walk upside down?
Sammy
The ceiling is just like the ground to him
Sammy, with toes so unbelievably strong
Where ever he is, he can never go wrong

Sammy, I was afraid of you then
Sammy, the name that I gave you makes you a friend
Sammy, your toes are unbelievably strong
And now you're a friend at the end of this song
Sammy, with toes so unbelievably strong
Where ever you are, you can never go wrong. Sammy...

I'm a dedicated jazz vocalist
I really do love my art
And I really
Know what I'm doing

I took a simple melody and changed it just like that

Then I started to wait behind the beat
Then I started changing the melody
Then I changed the rhythm
Then I came in early, then I came in late

Slap That Bass! Pluck those strings
Bow it with your bow
And Make It Sing, Boy!

Is called the stand up bass
It makes many sounds
At any volume, at any pace

Slap That Bass! Pluck those strings
Bow it with your bow
And Make It Sing, Boy!

It can sound like a dinosaur singing
Or a huge corn kernal when it pops!
And even more surprising than this
Is when you hear it play double stops

Slap That Bass! Pluck those strings
Bow it with your bow
And Make It Sing, Boy!

Sometimes it lays down the harmony
Sometimes it grooves on the beat
Sometimes it sings like a bird
A bird with REALLY big feet!

Slap That Bass! Pluck those strings
Bow it with your bow
And Make It Sing, Boy!

A bass can really swing

What's that big belled instrument?
That sounds like an african elephant
Trombone Bob says with a big grin,
""That's me, I'm the elephant that came and went!""

From the farm to the big city
Over every bump in the road
Trombone Bob sits back on the open tailgate
To get a good slide on his long trombone

When the band tours from town to town
Trombone Bob sits back on the tailgate
So his slide has lots of room
To play his elephant tune

Basslines, melodies and improv
While the band holds down the changes
Did you know that the slide trombone
Could make so many different sounds?

In a classical symphony
Or in a brass quartet
In a swingin' jazz big band
The ""bone"" has a sound you won't forget

And when Bob sits on the tailgate
With only the best of luck
He'll keep playin' that slide trombone
And not fall off the back of the truck!

When the band tours from town to town
Trombone Bob sits back on the tailgate
Then his slide has lots of room
To play another tune

Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
All good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime it only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain
He used to say so strong and unafraid
""I'm not afraid to die
I'm not afraid to die""
Now I stare at his picture
And I realize that no one cried the way Tracy cried
No one cried the way Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
But all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven
I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
And maybe one day I'll see Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
But all good things, they say, never last
All good things, they say, never last
And love, isn't love until it's past",Sometimes It Snows in April,2005

Erimha,"Granted with a burden
An untameable force at times
A thousand nights of darkness
Have led me to emptiness
As my heart is frozen
I am pacing into the cold
To the chant of my blood 
Boiling for war

Infused with hatred 
The ideal must seep in
Possessed with her ghost
And a hundred other demons
Clearing my mind of their melodies
Will sing me to sleep

Dreaming of the past
I embrace this moment of peace
Seasons have perished through conflict

The storm has shaded my visions
Tarnished at times, the will to be I

The moon sets in her eyes
Rising the sun to a mist of dead illusions
We are fire burning under the stars
As we are clothed in flames
Let the ashes paint our unhealthy romance",Battle for the Concealed Star,2015
Erimha,"Incarnated Red
Empty spaces where time ceased to exist
Scales of color have no meaning
And no shapes take form

Only shadows know the way
A voyage through consciousness
A kingdom beyond beliefs
My soul is cornered 
And sometimes it controls me

My eyes can see where most are blind
Leaving a bitter understanding of mankind
Its will, the lost values throughout centuries 
Resonates in me

Opening my veins for fire to flow
Not only is myself to destroy
But all form of ignorance realign
The reigns of the wolves 

Leave no place for the sheeps to dance
I welcome the altar of death
Through which I shall be reborn
For I was never dead",Ethereal Optic,2015
Erimha,"The misunderstood law of connection
A fusion taken for granted

The process of creation 
Led by destruction
Destroying to conquer 
A must to survive

Abide the purest form 
A balanced state
The manipulation 
Distorts the equilibrium 

The martyr have scavenged their predators
The beasts of prey have left no legacy
Depraved, it manifests its power
Still the parasites 
Continue to devour

Raging against this symmetry 
Unworthy of its power
To overpower at will
Is the undemanding take

To affinity lost through treason
Even through the ruins, forgiving is this ally
Knowing we have already 
Poisoned ourselves to extinction
Irrational is this madness
Futile is our determination
Omnipresent self-consumption",The First Law,2015
Erimha,"Beyond borders, chaos lies
In peace, within 
Soothing melodies whispered
Like entwining battle songs

I wish I can bear on and tell my sons
About the elders legends

War is upon us and we 
Are shedding our own tales
The rotting tree of life has bribed 
The fruits of the gods
Leaving us with a fragment 
Of divine creation

Erimha,"The nest of mankind, is resting between
I am straddling both spheres
An existence linked through this vessel
One lived through limitations
The beginning, the imagination

The comprehension of senses
The boundaries of emotions 
A way led by fear, the distress to be
Unfulfilling in this tomb to me
An unconceivable existence

The other, unknown, misunderstood
Envisioned as a plague, a land of no return

Entwine with time, la bête noire vaincra
So the fear of being the rotting essence of the earth
The instinct differs from the limited path
The learning process of realization
A misconceived cycle of a new beginning 
The search has begun
Where the door has always been",Imperative Circles,2015
Erimha,"Divergence sparks at the crossroad
Challenging intuition into conflict 
Inconsistent current, conveys the way of the path divided
The flame burning through the flesh

Convictions forge the culmination into greater ideals
The decisive moment way beyond recognition
A journey through the endless doors
I do not resent time but understand the reason behind

But the choices have branded my memoirs
This has to be, for the need has exceeded
Forth the path, death I shall not fear
My will reborn from the pain I have suffered 

I am the none seeker of exemption 
I shall bear the mark of liberation",The Mark of Liberation,2015
Erimha,"The temple chants, led from within
In an unspoken tongue
The pain is screaming through the doors

I am yearning for a souvenir
Walls are fallen revealing the will of a new beginning
I’ve been constantly looking for a way out of this world
There is no freedom walking the path of men

Only a restricted line far from the stars we should be
So I flew beyond boundaries
And met the everlasting fire

I am the none seeker of exemption
I shall bear the mark of liberation

Nothing has been real 
For I was blind
No eyes can see
Where the heart need to feel

I am yearning for a souvenir
Walls are fallen revealing the will of a new beginning
I’ve been constantly looking for a way out of this world
There is no freedom walking the path of men

I am the none seeker of exemption

Erimha,"I concede to the power of my will
To look beyond the known
For far too long we’ve stood 
In inexistent shadows
Worthless pieces of divine creation
I need to see the great seas
The gateways of my own ascension

My soul is seething for something pure
The untouched landscapes of my mind
A virgin road pasted through the black holes
Where no barrier lies between a formless phantom 

I vanquish with distortion 
And walked with the dead 
I am the seed of a destructive core
Condemned and blessed I can see beyond and fall below

Through the circles
Unpaid my contained essence
The trinity of fermentation 
Avulsing with gigantic waves
I am sailing with no destination
The everlasting sea of creation",Transcendental Inception,2015
Erimha,"The lost children of the earth
Swimming the amniotic seas
So young, but already 
Carrying a heavy fantasy
Of war and massacre

Our mother cries upon what we’ve become
We are conquering the art of killing

Ignoring any signs ov an upcoming blowback
All breathing at the same time but

Completely unaware of any synchronization
The stars still sing at night

Giving the sun the rhythm to rise to 
Ages have passed

But what is time anyway
In this everlasting womb
Through the moonlight
We’ve always learned the way

Gaining inspiration from 
Every form of life expansion
Embracing every part 
Of this experience

And we shall meet at the end",War Within,2015

What if I told you I lied but didn't mean it
What if my one mistake
Had the potential to break
Up our happy home
Would you want to know
What if I confessed it and though she didn't mean nothing since it happened
You're thinking about leaving
What if I suppressed it
And made a vow to never mess with another

Is it cool for me to cover my tracks
If you'd never know
Or would me not being honest hurt you more

Or would you want to know instead

Are there some wars not worth fighting
Some tears not worth crying

What if I said 4 years ago when we were arguing
He came to comfort me and I wound up pregnant
And I just can't say for sure
If the baby's yours
What if I confessed it and it turns out not to be your baby after you get tested
And it destroys what we've been blessed with
What if I suppress it 'cause technically you're the baby's daddy anyway
Is it wrong for me to want you to stay
Would you rather have me tear you away
From the only family you know
Or is this just too big a secret to keep it on the low

Are there some things better left unsaid
Or would you want to know instead
Hypothetically of course

Erin Boheme,"If I had a chance to go back in time
A dream that I could make come true
I'd go to a place where I'd see his face
And he'd say I've been waiting for you

He could just fly me to the moon
We would be on our honey moon

That'd be something if I had one night with Frank
He would be singing at the sand
Swinging with Bassey and the band
What could be better than to have one night with Frank?

Anything goes when the summer winds blows
I can see why they say old blue eyes
Through night and day, his old black magic ways
Would keep my hypnotized

He could be loving all of me
And we'd be dancing cheek to cheek
I would have my way if I had one night with Frank

Come fly with me from here to eternity
A fine romance that would be
As time goes by, come rain or come shine
They can't take that away from me

For once in my life I could be
On the sunny side of the street

Just making whoppy
If I had one for my baby
If I had luck, be a lady
If I had one night with Frank
One more time

Just making whoppy
If I had one for my baby
If I had luck, be a lady

Elevation to be
