Chiclete Com Banana,"Faço tudo para ser o xodó dessa menina
Sei que a gente se combina
Pode acreditar
Faço festa se ela chega eu não me importo
Se ela não gostar eu gosto
Só quero agradar
Me faz um cafuné
Eu sei que vai dar pé
Não tenha medo, pois a vida ensina
Já sinto cheiro do café
Vem ser minha mulher
Vem me dar na boca essa comida
Tempera esse chamego amor
Que eu quero ser teu nego
Uh oh oh careci de dengo

Mão na mão

É um cricri de galocha
Me tira o astral

E ela negou.

Oh just as you walked in
My eyes were on you watching
Just incase you felt the same feeling
To speak your mind like I'm revealing

Oh you looked at me and honestly

And personally this must be destiny
You have an interest that brought out,
The best things in me

Chico,"Got a one room apartment to a little tiny space
Isn't much, but keeps the rain drops off my pretty baby's face
I'm just gettin' by and the moneys spent
Don't even know how I'm gonna pay the monthly rent

But I know exactly what I wanna do
I wanna make this work with you

I know your wandering what I mean
Nothing in life is guaranteed
I never know just were I'm going lady
I need direction in my life

Nah, nah, nah
No guarantee
Nah, nah, nah
No guarantee

While I was out window gazin'
I put your coat on layaway
You know I wanna buy you diamonds
Soon as they increase my pay

Startin' from down, it's hard to kept your head
Makin' love every night on a squeaky bed
That's right that the way it is, there's no guarantee

I know your wandering what I mean
Nothing in life is guaranteed
I never know just were I'm going lady
I need direction in my life

Then anything you wanna do baby
You know I'll be down for you lady
So let's just keep it strong

I know your wandering what I mean
Nothing in life is guaranteed
I never know just were I'm going lady
I need direction in my life

Keep it strong
We gotta keep pushin' on
Keep it strong
We gotta keep pushin' on and on

When we step in the spot, performin' or not
You know what went down, man we shut shit down
From the cars outside you can tell we there
When the bar's sold out and ain't no Belvedere

No crowd control and the cops is scared
You know, the, the Roc, the Roc was here
Catch Mac V.I.P., section of the place
With the weapon on his waist, weight, two steppin' to the base

I don't dance, I just move the crowd
And keep a big ass tool that's loud, that'll move the crowd
Only play the club dog if the music loud
Just boots, strictly airs, no shoes allowed, what

Everytime I hit the club people rush the door
Buck 50 cuts and more, sluts and whores
Niggas ice grillin like they want to touch the floor

*Who The Fuck Want What*, man they buck when that come on
Bitches givin up butt when Mac perform
Everybody hands up when that track come on

Roll up nigga let's get on
You know how we do, bitches in them see through dresses on
Double shots of Henny rock, all night lemon drops

All night menagie trois, who came to get ride, who came to get high

You think I'm playin when I'm sayin shit'll drip in the club?
Man I come to turn out the show, turn out a hoe
Before I bounce, burn an ounce of 'dro

I can hardly wait, to pick you up at eight
For this rendezvous, candlelight and you
It took ma a long time, to see it clear
That love will last, for many years
Dreams can come true

Then I gots to get you even if we ain't trippin
Fuck that nigga who ain't Wadda try to certify
Got love for Chico anybody else we do not vibe
I think niggas try to flip the old school shit too much
I think I put there like Mcnabb with a nice touch
I think emcees with no flavor should stop rappin
I think some sampling is cool if fools ain't yappin
Man that's it about it, I don't wanna hear shit about it
Plus I think when this shit drops niggas gon' get about it
Hip Hop is too crowded
And I'm on in the tip of the stage slappin hands in the front row tight
Hittin blunt rolled tight, y'all swing 'em left to right
If ya feelin it
Don't even talk about this verse, just say I'm killin it
Whatchou think about that? It's just a thought, thought
I think flava to this whole shit is what we brought

See I've been thinkin all these bitch niggas need to quit it
And quick to speak on it niggas ain't never get it
Rhyme reported Chico the Chipper put it in order
What the fuck they run? Nuttin but they bath water
Last quarter, less than ten ticks
Standin at the line can't you feel this shit and bricks
Brickin like a busta
Cus you sour like lemon custard, don't trust ya
Nigga shoulda been rushed off the stage
Feelin nutty then bust a gauge
Cut like spades, blowin back out like hand grenades
Ya patna's over there bleeding
Now you in church, four days later obituary reading
Test me, lets see am I hard like I claim to be
Stomach scarred from the gang activity
Just a memory he did and I won't get caught
Let it be known fuck em that's my thought

The average man fragile, handle with care
On the contraire me, I'm a golden state bear
Dump a flare in the air
Two shot from the glocks
Style I got, karate chop through a concrete block
Chop the tree in the amount for the blunt
Doja, what niggas smoke out of where I come from
Hit hard blinds eye blitz, you Bret Favre
RIP Derrick Thomas promised to work hard
And hold it down like a big hog
Cool cats run with big dogs
Blacks fall victims to the White man's laws
Ain't nuttin new under the sun
But you never heard Defari's version of how the West was won
Two smoking mikes instead of guns
My tongue way a ton
They all want advice, you I got some
So many rap critics think they can spit it
Don't touch a mic if you ain't tight and that's on Likwit

I feel great hookin up the ill state in killa Cali
I'm about to make these muthafuckas feel a valley
Parallel Kurupt and Defari live
Without a deal, you should see the type of car I drive
With mista Chico the Chipper and Juice on the Glove beat
See this where the hip hoppers and the thugs meat
For you to drop a dope 16 joints
I'd have to lower my IQ a whole 15 points

Chico & the Gypsies,"At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

Did you think I'd lay down and die?

And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
I will survive, hey, hey

Oh, leave the Lord to give me strength not to fall apart
Though I tried hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh-so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high and you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you

É como não provar o néctar de um lindo amor

Troquei essa pessoa que eu morava
Por essa criatura que eu julgava
Pudesse compreender todo o meu eu

Fiquei na mesma coisa em que estava
Porque a criatura que eu sonhava
Não faz aquilo que me prometeu
Não sei se é meu destino
Não sei se é meu azar

Encontram seu par
Por que só eu vivo 
Trocando?

É pra matar
Eu fiquei até doente
Eu fiquei até doente, menina
Se eu não mato a saudade
É, deixa estar
A saudade mata a gente
A saudade mata a gente

Quis saber o que é o desejo
De onde ele vem
Fui até o centro da terra
E é mais além
Procurei uma saída
O amor não tem
Estava ficando louco
Louco, louco de querer bem
Quis chegar até o limite
De uma paixão
Baldear o oceano
Com a minha mão
Encontrar o sal da vida
E a solidão
Esgotar o apetite
Todo o apetite do coração

Mas voltou a saudade
É, pra ficar
Ai, eu encarei de frente
Ai, eu encarei de frente, menina 
Se eu ficar na saudade
É, deixa estar
A saudade engole a gente
A saudade engole a gente, menina

Ai amor, miragem minha
Minha linha do horizonte
É monte atrás de monte, é monte
A fonte nunca mais que seca
Ai, saudade, inda sou moço
Aquele poço não tem fundo
É um mundo e dentro um mundo
E dentro um mundo e dentro um mundo
E dentro é o mundo que me leva

A nossa escada, a escada, a escada, a escada
Meu amor, eu vou partir
De novo e sempre, feito viciada
Eu vou voltar

Pode ser
Que a nossa história
Seja mais uma quimera
E pode o nosso teto, a Lapa, o Rio desabar
Pode ser
Que passe o nosso tempo
Como qualquer primavera.
Espera
Me espera
Eu vou voltar",Palavra de Mulher,1991
Chico Buarque,"Se a guerra for declarada
Em pleno domingo de carnaval
Verás que um filho não foge à luta
Brasil, recruta
O teu pessoal

Se a terra anda ameaçada
De se acabar numa explosão de sal
Se aliste, meu camarada
A gente vai salvar o nosso carnaval

Vai ter batalha de bombardino
A colombina na Cruz Vermelha
Vai ter centelha na batucada
Rajada de tamborim
A melindrosa mandando bala
O mestre-sala curvando a Europa
A tropa do general da banda
Dançando o samba em Berlim

Se a guerra for declarada
A rapaziada ganha na moral
Se aliste, meu camarada
A gente vai salvar o nosso carnaval",Rio 42,1991
Chico Buarque,"Vai meu irmão
Pega esse avião
Você tem razão
De correr assim
Desse frio
Mas beija
O meu Rio de Janeiro
Antes que um aventureiro
Lance mão

Pede perdão
Pela duração (Pela omissão)*
Dessa temporada (Um tanto forçada)*
Mas não diga nada
Que me viu chorando
E pros da pesada
Diz que eu vou levando
Vê como é que anda
Aquela vida à toa
E se puder me manda
Uma notícia boa

Chico Buarque,"Tinha cá pra mim
Que agora sim
Eu vivia enfim o grande amor
Mentira
Me atirei assim
De trampolim
Fui até o fim um amador
Passava um verão
A água e pão
Dava o meu quinhão pro grande amor
Mentira
Eu botava a mão
No fogo então
Com meu coração de fiador

Hoje eu tenho apenas uma pedra no meu peito
Exijo respeito, não sou mais um sonhador
Chego a mudar de calçada
Quando aparece uma flor
E dou risada do grande amor
Mentira

Fui muito fiel
Comprei anel
Botei no papel o grande amor
Mentira
Reservei hotel
Sarapatel
E lua-de-mel em Salvador
Fui rezar na Sé
Pra São José
Que eu levava fé no grande amor
Mentira
Fiz promessa até
Pra Oxumaré
De subir a pé o Redentor

Hoje eu tenho apenas uma pedra no meu peito
Exijo respeito, não sou mais um sonhador
Chego a mudar de calçada
Quando aparece uma flor
E dou risada do grande amor
Mentira",Samba Do Grande Amor,1991
Chico Buarque,"Preciso não dormir
Até se consumar
O tempo
Da gente
Preciso conduzir
Um tempo de te amar
Te amando devagar
E urgentemente
Pretendo descobrir
No último momento
Um tempo que refaz o que desfez
Que recolhe todo o sentimento
E bota no corpo uma outra vez

Prometo te querer
Até o amor cair
Doente
Doente
Prefiro então partir
A tempo de poder
A gente se desvencilhar da gente
Depois de te perder
Te encontro, com certeza
Talvez num tempo da delicadeza
Onde não diremos nada
Nada aconteceu
Apenas seguirei, como encantado
Ao lado teu",Todo O Sentimento,1991
Chico Buarque,"Vai passar
Nessa avenida um samba
popular
Cada paralelepípedo
Da velha cidade
Essa noite vai
Se arrepiar
Ao lembrar
Que aqui passaram
sambas imortais
Que aqui sangraram pelos
nossos pés
Que aqui sambaram
nossos ancestrais

Num tempo
Página infeliz da nossa
história
Passagem desbotada na
memória
Das nossas novas
gerações
Dormia
A nossa pátria mãe tão
distraída
Sem perceber que era
subtraída
Em tenebrosas
transações

Seus filhos
Erravam cegos pelo
continente
Levavam pedras feito
penitentes
Erguendo estranhas
catedrais
E um dia, afinal
Tinham direito a uma
alegria fugaz
Uma ofegante epidemia
Que se chamava carnaval
O carnaval, o carnaval
(Vai passar)

Palmas pra ala dos
barões famintos
O bloco dos napoleões
retintos
E os pigmeus do bulevar

Vem ver de perto uma
cidade a cantar
A evolução da liberdade
Até o dia clarear

Chico Buarque,"Eis o malandro na praça outra vez
Caminhando na ponta dos pés
Como quem pisa nos corações
Que rolaram dos cabarés

Entre deusas e bofetões
Entre dados e coronéis
Entre parangolés e patrões
O malandro anda assim de viés

Deixa balançar a maré
E a poeira assentar no chão
Deixa a praça virar um salão
Que o malandro é o barão da ralé",A Volta Do Malandro,1991
Chico Buarque,"Vou voltar
Sei que ainda vou voltar
Para o meu lugar
Foi lá e é ainda lá
Que eu hei de ouvir cantar
Uma sabiá
Cantar
Uma sabiá

Vou voltar
Sei que ainda vou voltar
Vou deitar à sombra
De um palmeira
Que já não há
Colher a flor
Que já não dá
E algum amor 
Talvez possa espantar
As noites que eu não queira
E anunciar o dia

Vou voltar
Sei que ainda vou voltar
Não vai ser em vão
Que fiz tantos planos
De me enganar
Como fiz enganos
De me encontrar
Como fiz estradas
De me perder
Fiz de tudo e nada
De te esquecer",Sabiá,1991
Chico Buarque,"Mesmo que os cantores sejam falsos como eu
Serão bonitas, não importa
São bonitas as canções
Mesmo miseráveis os poetas
Os seus versos serão bons
Mesmo porque as notas eram surdas
Quando um deus sonso e ladrão
Fez das tripas a primeira lira
Que animou todos os sons
E daí nasceram as baladas
E os arroubos de bandidos como eu
Cantando assim:
Você nasceu para mim
Você nasceu para mim

Mesmo que você feche os ouvidos
E as janelas do vestido
Minha musa vai cair em tentação
Mesmo porque estou falando grego
Com sua imaginação
Mesmo que você fuja de mim
Por labirintos e alçapões
Saiba que os poetas como os cegos
Podem ver na escuridão
E eis que, menos sábios do que antes
Os seus lábios ofegantes
Hão de se entregar assim
Me leve até o fim
Me leve até o fim

Mesmo que os romances sejam falsos como o nosso
São bonitas, não importa
São bonitas as canções
Mesmo sendo errados os amantes
Seus amores serão bons",Choro Bandido,1996
Chico Buarque,"Como num romance
O homem dos meus sonhos
Me apareceu no dancing
Era mais um
Só que num relance
Os seus olhos me chuparam
Feito um zoom

Ele me comia
Com aqueles olhos
De comer fotografia
Eu disse cheese
E de close em close
Fui perdendo a pose
E até sorri, feliz

E voltou
Me ofereceu um drinque
Me chamou de anjo azul
Minha visão
Foi desde então ficando flou

Como no cinema
Me mandava às vezes
Uma rosa e um poema
Foco de luz
Eu, feito uma gema
Me desmilingüindo toda
Ao som do blues

Abusou do scotch
Disse que meu corpo
Era só dele aquela noite
Eu disse please
Xale no decote
Disparei com as faces
Rubras e febris

E voltou
No derradeiro show
Com dez poemas e um buquê
Eu disse adeus
Já vou com os meus
Numa turnê

Como amar esposa
Disse ele que agora
Só me amava como esposa
Não como star
Me amassou as rosas
Me queimou as fotos
Me beijou no altar

Nunca mais cinema
Nunca mais drinque no dancing
Nunca mais cheese
Nunca uma espelunca
Uma rosa nunca
Nunca mais feliz",A História de Lily Braun,1997
Chico Buarque,"E se, de repente
A gente não sentisse
A dor que a gente finge
E sente
Se, de repente
A gente distraísse

Ao som de uma canção
Então, eu te convidaria
Pra uma fantasia
Do meu violão

Canta, canta uma esperança
Canta, canta uma alegria
Canta mais
Revirando a noite
Revelando o dia
Noite e dia, noite e dia
Canta a canção do homem
Canta a canção da vida
Canta mais
Trabalhando a terra
Entornando o vinho
Canta, canta, canta, canta
Canta a canção do gozo
Canta a canção da graça
Canta mais
Preparando a tinta
Enfeitando a praça
Canta, canta, canta, canta

Canta a santa melodia

Não dá pra falar muito não
Espera passar o avião
Assim que o inverno passar
Eu acho que vou te buscar
Aqui tá fazendo calor
Deu pane no ventilador
Já tem fliperama em Macau
Tomei a costeira em Belém do Pará
Puseram uma usina no mar
Talvez fique ruim pra pescar
Meu amor

No Tocantins
O chefe dos parintintins
Vidrou na minha calça Lee
Eu vi uns patins pra você
Eu vi um Brasil na tevê
Capaz de cair um toró
Estou me sentindo tão só
Oh, tenha dó de mim
Pintou uma chance legal
Um lance lá na capital
Nem tem que ter ginasial
Meu amor

No Tabariz
O som é que nem os Bee Gees
Dancei com uma dona infeliz
Que tem um tufão nos quadris
Tem um japonês trás de mim
Eu vou dar um pulo em Manaus
Aqui tá quarenta e dois graus
O sol nunca mais vai se pôr
Eu tenho saudades da nossa canção
Saudades de roça e sertão
Bom mesmo é ter um caminhão

Baby, bye bye
Abraços na mãe e no pai
Eu acho que vou desligar
As fichas já vão terminar
Eu vou me mandar de trenó
Pra Rua do Sol, Maceió
Peguei uma doença em Ilhéus
Mas já tô quase bom
Em março vou pro Ceará
Com a benção do meu orixá
Eu acho bauxita por lá
Meu amor

Bye bye, Brasil
A última ficha caiu
Eu penso em vocês night and day
Explica que tá tudo okay
Eu só ando dentro da lei
Eu quero voltar, podes crer
Eu vi um Brasil na tevê
Peguei uma doença em Belém
Agora já tá tudo bem
Mas a ligação tá no fim
Tem um japonês trás de mim
Aquela aquarela mudou
Na estrada peguei uma cor
Capaz de cair um toró
Estou me sentindo um jiló
Eu tenho tesão é no mar

Bateu uma saudade de ti
Tô a fim de encarar um siri

Sem amor
É tudo sofrimento

E à solidão
Nada existe
E o tempo é triste

Chico Buarque,"Sambando na lama de sapato branco, glorioso
Um grande artista tem que dar o tom
Quase rodando, caindo de boca
A voz é rouca mas o mote é bom
Sambando na lama e causando frisson

Mas olha só
Um samba de cócoras em terra de sapo
Sapateando no toró

Cantando e sambando na lama de sapato branco, glorioso
Um grande artista tem que dar lição
Quase rodando, caindo de boca
Mas com um pouco de imaginação
Sambando na lama sem tocar o chão

E o tal ditado, como é?
Festa acabada, músicos a pé
Músicos a pé, músicos a pé
Músicos a pé

Sambando na lama de sapato branco, glorioso
Um grande artista tem fazer fé
Quase rodando, caindo de boca
Aba de touca, jura de mulher
Sambando na lama e passando o boné

Mas olha só
Por fora filó, filó
Por dentro, molambo
Cambaleando no toró

Cantando e sambando na lama de sapato branco, glorioso
Um grande artista tem que dar o que tem e o que não tem
Tocando a bola no segundo tempo
Atrás de tempo, sempre tempo vem
Sambando na lama, amigo, e tudo bem

E o tal ditado, como é?
Festa acabada, músicos a pé
Músicos a pé, músicos a pé
Músicos a pé

Sambando na lama de sapato branco, glorioso
Um grande artista tem que estar feliz
Sambando na lama de salvando o verniz

Mas olha só
Em terra de sapo, sambando de cócoras
Sapateando no toró

Cantando e sambando na lama de sapato branco, glorioso
Um grande artista tem que estar tranchã
Sambando na lama, amigo, até amanhã

E o tal ditado, como é?
Festa acabada, músicos a pé
Músicos a pé, músicos a pé
Músicos a pé

Chico Buarque,"Pai, afasta de mim esse cálice
Pai, afasta de mim esse cálice
Pai, afasta de mim esse cálice
De vinho tinto de sangue

Como beber dessa bebida amarga
Tragar a dor, engolir a labuta
Mesmo calada a boca, resta o peito
Silêncio na cidade não se escuta
De que me vale ser filho da santa
Melhor seria ser filho da outra
Outra realidade menos morta
Tanta mentira, tanta força bruta

Como é difícil acordar calado
Se na calada da noite eu me dano
Quero lançar um grito desumano
Que é uma maneira de ser escutado
Esse silêncio todo me atordoa
Atordoado eu permaneço atento
Na arquibancada pra a qualquer momento
Ver emergir o monstro da lagoa

De muito gorda a porca já não anda
De muito usada a faca já não corta
Como é difícil, pai, abrir a porta
Essa palavra presa na garganta
Esse pileque homérico no mundo
De que adianta ter boa vontade
Mesmo calado o peito, resta a cuca
Dos bêbados do centro da cidade

Talvez o mundo não seja pequeno
Nem seja a vida um fato consumado
Quero inventar o meu próprio pecado
Quero morrer do meu próprio veneno
Quero perder de vez tua cabeça
Minha cabeça perder teu juízo
Quero cheirar fumaça de óleo diesel
Me embriagar até que alguém me esqueça",Cálice,1999
Chico Buarque,"Ah, se já perdemos a noção da hora
Se juntos já jogamos tudo fora
Me conta agora como hei de partir
Se, ao te conhecer, dei pra sonhar, fiz tantos desvarios
Rompi com o mundo, queimei meus navios
Me diz pra onde é que inda posso ir
Se nós, nas travessuras das noites eternas
Já confundimos tanto as nossas pernas
Diz com que pernas eu devo seguir
Se entornaste a nossa sorte pelo chão
Se na bagunça do teu coração
Meu sangue errou de veia e se perdeu
Como, se na desordem do armário embutido
Meu paletó enlaça o teu vestido
E o meu sapato inda pisa no teu
Como, se nos amamos feito dois pagãos
Teus seios inda estão nas minhas mãos
Me explica com que cara eu vou sair
Não, acho que estás te fazendo de tonta
Te dei meus olhos pra tomares conta
Agora conta como hei de partir

Diz que está me esperando pro jantar

Todo dia eu só penso em poder parar
Meio dia eu só penso em dizer não
Depois penso na vida pra levar
E me calo com a boca de feijão

Seis da tarde como era de se esperar
Ela pega e me espera no portão
Diz que está muito louca pra beijar
E me beija com a boca de paixão

Toda noite ela diz pra eu não me afastar
Meia-noite ela jura eterno amor
E me aperta pra eu quase sufocar
E me morde com a boca de pavor

Me sacode às seis horas da manhã
Me sorri um sorriso pontual

Há sempre uma mulher feliz

Ou mereça a moça que você tem

Chico Buarque,"Rato de rua
Irrequieta criatura
Tribo em frenética proliferação
Lúbrico, libidinoso transeunte
Boca de estômago
Atrás do seu quinhão

Vão aos magotes
A dar com um pau
Levando o terror
Do parking ao living
Do shopping center ao léu
Do cano de esgoto
Pro topo do arranha-céu

Rato de rua
Aborígene do lodo
Fuça gelada
Couraça de sabão
Quase risonho
Profanador de tumba
Sobrevivente
À chacina e à lei do cão

Saqueador da metrópole
Tenaz roedor
De toda esperança
Estuporador da ilusão
Ó meu semelhante
Filho de Deus, meu irmão

Rato
Rato que rói a roupa
Que rói a rapa do rei do morro
Que rói a roda do carro
Que rói o carro, que rói o ferro
Que rói o barro, rói o morro
Rato que rói o rato
Ra-rato, ra-rato
Roto que ri do roto
Que rói o farrapo
Do esfarra-rapado
Que mete a ripa, arranca rabo
Rato ruim
Rato que rói a rosa
Rói o riso da moça
E ruma rua arriba
Em sua rota de rato

Saqueador da metrópole
Tenaz roedor
De toda esperança
Estuporador da ilusão
Ó meu semelhante

Não vou a Ipanema 
Não gosto de chuva 
Nem gosto de sol

Desliguei, foi engano 
O seu nome eu não sei 
Esqueci no piano
As bobagens de amor 
Que eu iria dizer 
Não, Ligia, Ligia 

Eu nunca quis tê-la ao meu lado 
Num fim de semana 
Um chope gelado 
Em Copacabana
Andar pela praia até o Leblon 
E quando eu me apaixonei 
Não passou de ilusão 
O seu nome rasguei 
Fiz um samba-canção
Das mentiras de amor 
Que aprendi com você

Tem dias que a gente se sente
Como quem partiu ou morreu
A gente estancou de repente
Ou foi o mundo então que cresceu
A gente quer ter voz ativa
No nosso destino mandar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega o destino pra lá
Roda mundo, roda-gigante
Roda moinho, roda pião
O tempo rodou num instante
Nas voltas do meu coração
A gente vai contra a corrente
Até não poder resistir
Na volta do barco é que sente
O quanto deixou de cumprir
Faz tempo que a gente cultiva
A mais linda roseira que há
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a roseira pra lá
Roda mundo (etc.)
A roda da saia, a mulata
Não quer mais rodar, não senhor
Não posso fazer serenata
A roda de samba acabou
A gente toma a iniciativa
Viola na rua, a cantar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a viola pra lá
Roda mundo (etc.)
O samba, a viola, a roseira
Um dia a fogueira queimou
Foi tudo ilusão passageira
Que a brisa primeira levou
No peito a saudade cativa
Faz força pro tempo parar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a saudade pra lá
Roda mundo (etc.)

Pela janela, ói que lindo

Me abres el pecho siempre que me colmas
De amores
De amores
Eternamente de amores
Si alguna vez me siento derrotado
Renuncio a ver el sol cada mañana
Rezando el credo que me has enseñado
Miro tu cara why digo en la ventana

Chico Buarque,"Vai, meu irmão,
Pega esse avião.
Você tem razão 
De correr assim 
Desse frio, mas veja
O meu Rio de Janeiro, 
Antes que um aventureiro lance mão.

Pede perdão 
Pela duração (Pela omissão) 
Dessa temporada (Um tanto forçada) 
Mas não diga nada 
Que me viu chorando, 
E pros da pesada 
Diz que vou levando.
Vê como é que anda 
Aquela vida à toa
E se puder me manda
Uma notícia boa.",Samba de Orly (Samba de Fiumicino),2002
Chico Buarque,"É o pau, é a pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um caco de vidro, é a vida, é o sol
É a noite, é a morte, é um laço, é o anzol
É peroba no campo, é o nó da madeira
Caingá candeia, é o matita-pereira

É madeira de vento, tombo da ribanceira
É o mistério profundo, é o queira ou não queira
É o vento vetando, é o fim da ladeira
É a viga, é o vão, festa da ciumeira
É a chuva chovendo, é conversa ribeira
Das águas de março, é o fim da canseira
É o pé, é o chão, é a marcha estradeira
Passarinho na mão, pedra de a tiradeira

É uma ave no céu, é uma ave no chão
É um regato, é uma fonte, é um pedaço de pão
É o fundo do poço, é o fim do caminho
No rosto um desgosto, é um pouco sozinho

É um estepe, é um prego, é uma conta, é um conto
É um pingo pingando, é uma conta, é um ponto
É um peixe, é um gesto, é uma prata brilhando
É a luz da manha, é o tijolo chegando
É a lenha, é o dia, é o fim da picada
É a garrafa de cana, o estilhaço na estrada
É o projeto da casa, é o corpo na cama
É o carro enguiçado, é a lama, é a lama

É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um resto de mato na luz da manhã
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração

É uma cobra, é um pau, é João, é José
É um espinho na mão, é um corte no pé
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração
É pau, é pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um belo horizonte, é uma febre terça
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração",Águas de Março,2004

Me leve à toa pela última vez
A um quiosque, ao planetário
Ao cais do porto, ao paço

Meu coração parece que perde um pedaço, mas não
Me leve a sério
Passou este verão
Outros passarão
Eu passo

Não se atire do terraço, não arranque minha cabeça
Da sua cortiça
Não beba muita cachaça, não se esqueça depressa de mim, sim?
Pense que eu cheguei de leve
Machuquei você de leve
E me retirei com pés de lã
Sei que o seu caminho amanhã
Será um caminho bom
Mas não me leve

Não me leve a mal
Me leve apenas para andar por aí
Na lagoa, no cemitério
Na areia, no mormaço

Cristo, montanhas, florestas, acácias, ipês  
Pranchas coladas na crista das ondas, 
 as ondas suspensas no are
 pássaros cristalizados no branco do céu
 e eu, atolado na areia, perdia meus pés
  Músicas imaginei , mas o assombro gelou 
Na minha boca-as palavras que-eu ia falar
 nem uma brisa soprou
 enquanto Renata Maria saía do mar

  Dia após dia na praia com olhos vazados de já não a ver 
Quieto como um pescador a juntar seus anzóis
 ou como algum salva-vidas no banco dos réus
  Noite na praia deserta deserta deserta, daquela mulher
 praia repleta de rastros em mil direções
 penso que todos os passos perdidos são meus
  Eu já sabia, meu Deus , tão fulgurante visão 
 não se produz duas vezes num mesmo lugar 
Mas que danado fui eu

Esse amor, essa alegria 
Eu te juro, te daria 
Se pudesse esse amor todo dia 

Chega perto, vem sem medo 
Chega mais meu coração 
Vem ouvir esse segredo 
Escondido num choro canção 

Se soubesses como eu gosto 
Do teu cheiro, teu jeito de flor 
Não negavas um beijinho 
A quem anda perdido de amor 

Chora flauta, chora pinho 

Choro eu o teu cantor 
Chora manso, bem baixinho 
Nesse choro falando de amor 

Quando passas, tão bonita 
Nessa rua banhada de sol 
Minha alma segue aflita 
E eu me esqueço até do futebol

Chico Buarque de Hollanda,"E do amor gritou-se o escândalo
Do medo criou-se o trágico
No rosto pintou-se o pálido
E não rolou uma lágrima
Nem uma lástima
Pra socorrer

E na gente deu o hábito
De caminhar pelas trevas
De murmurar entre as pregas
De tirar leite das pedras
De ver o tempo correr

Mas, sob o sono dos séculos
Amanheceu o espetáculo
Como uma chuva de pétalas
Como se o céu vendo as penas
Morresse de pena
E chovesse o perdão

E a prudência dos sábios
Nem ousou conter nos lábios
O sorriso e a paixão

Pois transbordando de flores
A calma dos lagos zangou-se
A rosa-dos-ventos danou-se
O leito dos rios fartou-se
E inundou de água doce
A amargura do mar

Numa enchente amazônica
Numa explosão atlântica
E a multidão vendo em pânico
E a multidão vendo atônita
Ainda que tarde

Chico Buarque de Hollanda,"(Chico Buarque, 1967)
Tem dias que a gente se sente
Como quem partiu ou morreu
A gente estancou de repente
Ou foi o mundo então que cresceu
A gente quer ter voz ativa
No nosso destino mandar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega o destino pra lá
Roda mundo, roda-gigante
Roda moinho, roda pião
O tempo rodou num instante
Nas voltas do meu coração
A gente vai contra a corrente
Até não poder resistir
Na volta do barco é que sente
O quanto deixou de cumprir
Faz tempo que a gente cultiva
A mais linda roseira que há
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a roseira pra lá
Roda mundo (etc.)
A roda da saia, a mulata
Não quer mais rodar, não senhor
Não posso fazer serenata
A roda de samba acabou
A gente toma a iniciativa
Viola na rua, a cantar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a viola pra lá
Roda mundo (etc.)
O samba, a viola, a roseira
Um dia a fogueira queimou
Foi tudo ilusão passageira
Que a brisa primeira levou
No peito a saudade cativa
Faz força pro tempo parar
Mas eis que chega a roda viva
E carrega a saudade pra lá

I swear it'll be alright - alright 
We spend time together talking 'bout your problems 
Girl that's cool with me 
You need a flavor I'm the one you always call on 
You depend on me

You got me up out my sleep 
But when I try to touch your body and caress you 
You walk out on me

That you're just no ready for love right now 
But I say, I say 
I'm not letting you go no way no how 
Repeat 1 
You're doing everything to make me really want you 
Wearing clothes so tight 
But every time I try to reach out and hold you 
You put on your red light 
Like some crazy ritual you try and dance for me 
To turn me on 
I'm aroused the way you carry on 
But then you're gone 
I'm not that strong 
Repeat 2 
Repeat 1 
You like to talk about getting down 
But when it's time to get to it

I can only sit and think of yesterday. 
Baby, that look upon your face 
Never a tear that I have shed. 
We're so far beyond the point of no return

I have nothing left to give. 
I can only sit and think of yesterday. 
So how can I mend a broken heart? 

Tell me, baby. 
And how do I make a brand new start, baby? 
How do I learn to love again, 
when all I do is think of all we planned, 

and imagine we could someday make it right? 
I dreamed you called my name 
And a rose to see that everything had changed. 
Yesterday we said goodbye 

And yesterday we gave it one more try 
And I know we said we wouldn't let it come to this.

I wanna make this work with you

I never know just were I'm going lady
I need direction in my life

Nah, nah, nah
No guarantee

I put your coat on layaway

Step into my life now, share my world 
That's what I like about you, you got faith in me

When you friends kept saying not to get with me 
But you couldn't help it, I know the both of us felt it 
The both us melt it, the both of us dealt with 
The rumors and the lies, your eyes on dies 
Is enough for a brother to cut off ties

Then you will find in me

I was shocked, y'all know how tough pop is (f'real)

So much of life, with a touch of yo' light
And I'm doin' my best, to make sure they alright

Came home and told y'all and had it back that night
When I was older you started smokin' and you sold my bike
I remember cause I cried all night; I wasn't mad
I was sad cause the crack had control of your life
And you couldn't even put up a fight
You told me Dwight, I promise lil' brother, I'ma make it alright
You left home, and you died that night - damn I miss you

Walked inside the crib, the mood was wrong (damn)
I heard my moms in the background screamin' on the phone (dad what's goin on?)
I rushed to get closer like yo mom, what's wrong?
She said your brother's buggin' out, hurry up, take a look
I grabbed my brother Floyd and we started to book (run run)
It wouldn't take long, he lived right around the block
I tried to stay strong, but I was shakin' a lot (I'm scared)
Got there, ran up the stairs, he was stretched out in the lobby
A 7-year jail bid physique graced his body
I fell to my knees, like no Jerry please
I was frightened, he was fightin' to breathe
Mumblin' somethin' ""Heav' don't let 'em take me I ain't ready to leave""
I felt his clutch on the cuff of my sleeve, then it eased
He felt calm, as he died in my arms
OD's off of heron, and just like that, he was gone

Want to play you close and jump in the pool wit' you.

And in the hood, they all like to knock your career,
And turn right around when you hot a gear.
I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear;
That the man upstairs, he control this here
And it's funny how, soon as the money piles,
Everybody want to play with that brother now,
Run me down, but when the doe gets low, only a few friends roll, you know.
And Mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife,
Said ""Lynisse, please do something with your life.""
And how it's gon' play out, I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

And I remember when, I used to feen for calls,
When I hit number one I had to scream out calls.
Used to see my Mama strugglin', worn from work,
Told her when I made it big, she never gonna work.
I used to wish at night that my brothers in the street,
Hustlin', s***, they would live to the light,
And see another day somehow, find another way I vow.
To all my soldiers, I hold you down.
From standin' in the rain, to the rovers now.
I'm screamin your name, to warn you that the rollers is around,
To on-stage throwin' it down.
No matter where you at, represent your hood.
No matter where I'm at, I'm representing my hood.
And how it's gon' all play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

I've opened up my eyes to a brighter day,
Nobody in the block gave their life away.
We all tryin' to take it easily,
And everybody want to make it seems is free.
Today it's all good and it seemes so strange,
Since you look up in the hood now things done changed.
Kids they used to be wheelies for blocks,
Is out ridin' their bikes, doin' wheelies for blocks.
And b****es on the bench, still gossipin', who's she slidin' in,
Who's she slidin' with, outside partyin'.
Old timers in the back playin' dominoes.
Kids freestyling, all kinds of flows.
Girls flow through with designer clothes.
It's day now, but you know how night time goes.
And how it's gon' play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

Look at this world from my latest ride
We knock 'em all if you let this slide
This how you ball if you a major guy
With alcohol and a hazy high

The city lights in the jaded sky
I had this girl, wanna make her mine
I can't lie, I was interested in her
We shared a bed in the club and even crept to dinner

It's such a funny situation
'Cause I knew she had a man in the ave by reputation
I get around I'm just a product of my occupation
I asked her number and she contemplated
I'm losin' patience and it's startin' to get flagrant

Seize the moment or forever regret it
Three in the mornin' and I'm stressin' to catch her
Creepin' up on her and applyin' the pressure
Me and my homey A don't think I can get her, uh but

It's crazy, smooth ghetto angel so amazin'
Smokin' gettin' high with the daisy
Thinkin' 'bout makin' you my lady, maybe
You're a bad girl, she say I only want her for my pleasure
Slow hit it from the back, I do it better
She left me with a kiss and I let her, never sweat her

You seekin' love is watchin' movies on and off the stations
Those commercials was our intermissions
For the [Incomprehensible] and the tongue-kissin' and one instance
Turns some heated touchin' to some freaky fuckin'

My situation is a bit of trouble
See this affair is a bit of struggle
And my persona and my thuggish morals
That was enough to start a lover's quarrel

Since she had a man but he wasn't loyal
Got loose enough just to open up
It be the mornin 'fore he sober up
I call the shit like Punky Brewster
And she never met a thug loser
Star nigga party with the snub shooter

My thug True is probably posted in back
We party hard, get so crazy
And we smoke and drink 'gnac
I'm tryin' to slide in the night on some smutty sex
Niggaz beepin' my phone to ask me did I get her yet

It's crazy, smooth ghetto angel so amazin'
Smokin' gettin' high with the daisy
Thinkin' 'bout makin' you my lady, maybe
You're a bad girl, she say I only want her for my pleasure
Slow hit it from the back, I do it better
She left me with a kiss and I let her, never sweat her

It's gettin' nervous now 'cause the word in town
Is that your man got the word that we done flirtin' 'round
In your Beemer merkin' 'round foreplay in the hallways
So now we hit the house and pull the curtains down

We laugh and we joke, we drink and I pass you the smoke
Smack your ass when you walk, when fuckin' I grab and you joke
Have sex at night as we lay and we chill
Your crib, nice apartment, who's payin' the bills

This type of shit'll get you sprayed and you killed
That's that Harlem shit like Mitch shot in 'Paid in Full'
This is not a movie script, some of my truest shit
Selfish premonition, out of sight I'm out of mind
When this nigga gone and missin'

Wishin' she mine, I'm knowin' that she'll never be
This'll be fine, the closest that I'll ever be
I see a chick and she mine, new Goldie of the ghetto be
Niggaz beepin' my phone to ask me did I get her yet

It's crazy, smooth ghetto angel so amazin'
Smokin' gettin' high with the daisy
Thinkin' 'bout makin' you my lady, maybe
You're a bad girl, she say I only want her for my pleasure
Slow hit it from the back, I do it better
She left me with a kiss and I let her

Chico DeBarge,"No one will win the war
See, families only die
And birds won't soar the sky
And there'll be no sun to shine
No country wins a war
The grass won't grow the same
The moon won't shine at night
And there's a losing fight
Nobody wins a war

If you heard a bomb was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?
Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a rocket was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring?

No soldier wins a war
See, soldiers only die
And mamas only cry
Just for a conscious flag to fly, that's why
Nobody wins a war
No war is worth your life
See, that's a priceless pride
No war is worth your blood
Nobody wins a war

We the people speak, speak
We want to be free of this sick bureaucracy
No more death tolls with our morning coffee
Oh, government, you have lost your feeling for life
It is war that you reap
But the loss is too great and the pain is too deep
The scars do not heal
Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak
Your actions are hurtful
You never find what you seek
You make the sky a storm
You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak
Your lies are your destruction
Your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal
You are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow
Your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage
It rots and it reeks of death in the wind
The foul stench of men basking in their cruelty
Rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride
You risk all of humanity
You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know
People they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace
But there is always a possibility for peace
As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach deep
Deep down in our beings
Oh, this wicked, wicked system of things
As our grandmothers say
Will soon be no more
Will soon be no more
Because nobody no one ever wins a war",Nobody Wins a War,2010

And our hearts they beat as one

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight

While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Will it fade way out of sight

Chico Hamilton,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1958

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

You're the tear that comes after June-time's laughter
You see so many dreams that don't come true
Dreams we fashioned when summertime was new

By a word that somebody left unspoken

You're the ghost of a romance in June going astray
Fading too soon, that's why I say
""Farewell to you, Indian summer""

Chico Hamilton,"It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view,
But us two
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
In the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trout stop leaping up stream
As we dream
A fat pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a hazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me",Lazy Afternoon,2007
Chico Hamilton,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru,2012
Chico Hamilton,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you

That brings this sensation, oh no

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2012

Chico Hamilton Quintet,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Levanta poeira, mas volta num pé de vento

Beira de mato é bom
Mas é mió de bom
É quando a lua cheia
Do céu incendeia nossos corações
Que se percebe a lira, que ao caboclo inspira
Numa vidinha bem simples
Ter sempre esperança de colher o pão

Recorta a viola que eu quero cantar
Bate um catira caboclo
Mostrando a beleza desse lugar

Mas é mió de bom

Água de nascente, fulô de alecrim
Um jeito caipira de levar a vida
Sem se assustar com onça, com
Seca, geada e nem pererê

E a lua cheia que não queria
Por ele se apaixonou
Certa vez a lua branca
Com ele se enrabichou
Ficou prenha de cantiga

Da viola do cantor
E a lua cheia, mãe sertaneja
Gerou filhos desse amor
Ai, ai
Sua prole virou mata
Virou bicho, assombração
Com o choro da viola

Da viola do cantor
E a lua cheia, mãe sertaneja
Gerou filhos desse amor
Ai, ai

O parto se fez canção
E a lua cheia
Vem com as estrelas
Pra festejar a criação
Ai, ai",Criação,2005
Chico Lobo,"Hora a água apaga o fogo
Hora o fogo seca a alma
Essa vida é um jogo
Cada qual com sua mágoa
Duas margens prendem um rio
O curral cerca a boiada
Vem o vento e traz o frio
Feito ave em revoada

Hora a chuva faz enchente
Hora a seca mata o pasto
Vem o tempo e leva a gente
A vereda é um mundo vasto
No roçado do meu peito
Semeei uma paixão
Pra colher amor de longe
Que domasse a solidão

O destino é um vento bravo
Que destrói nossa ilusão
Faz com a morte um conchavo
Muda a sorte num clarão
Na poeira do caminho
Nenhum rastro sobrevive
Palmeira não tem espinho
E um amor eu nunca tive",Palmeira Seca,2005
Chico Lobo,"Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Tropa boiadeira sem eira nem beira
Estrada de chão
Num lombo de um cavalo um laço amarrado
Ee um bom gibão
Um céu de estrelas me guia na noite que já se vai
E eu vou cortando estradas levando boiada para Goiás

Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Sob um sol forte que esquenta as veias do coração
Destino estradeiro traçado nas linhas das minhas mãos
Em cada parada um sonho possível de realizar
Encontrar a morena que esteja a espera da tropa chegar

Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Êh chão brasileiro tanto tempo faz
Que eu sai pro mundo levando boiada
E não paro mais

Danço chamamé, polca paraguaia, canto cateretê
Na lida estradeira sou violeiro nos entardecer
Quando a tropa descansa ao redor do fogo
Pensamento vai
Vai buscar a morena que outro dia deixei pra trás",Tropa,2005
Chico Marx,"Sweet one, fairer than the flowers,
Never will I meet one sweeter than you.
Would you turn away or could you
Really every care, 
If I'd ever dare to say, 
""I Love you.""

[Chorus]
If the nightingales could sing like you,
They'd sing much sweeter than they do,
For you brought a new kind of love to me.

If the Sandman brought me dreams of you,
I'd want to sleep my whole life through,
For you brought a new kind of love to me.

I know that you're the queen, and I'm the slave,
And yet you will understand
That underneath it all 
You're a maid, and I am only a man.

I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you;
For you brought a new kind of love to me.",You Brought A New Kind Of Love To Me (for the film Monkey Business),2000
Chico Mdee,"Tutto può succedere
Mai dire mai
Storie da non credere
Mai dire mai

Di fisso già so, già sai
Qua sto, qua stai
Già da mo' strani viaggi che 

Fai, tutto può succedere
Mai dire mai
Qui non sempre è facile
Mai dire 

Mai, di fisso già so, già sai, qua sto
Qua stai già da mo' strani viaggi 

Rimane qualche souvenir dalla mente 
O dai dintorni vanno via così strane storie 
Strani giorni episodi in parallelo 
Viste da qua panoramiche tra cielo 
Stress sulle città
Ai tavoli di un bar sulla noia dei paesi 
Giorni sospesi sui sorrisi e sopra I volti tesi
Il tempo non da resi ma lo sai è così che 
Va ricorda quello che verrà
Per un chico che si è perso uno ritornerà 
Per ogni stop uno start un disegno apparirà
Tessere che siano parti di un mosaico in orbita 
Dentro alle case dello zodiaco
Segnando questi anni lunghi istanti
Qui niente è per sempre ùn tranne 
I diamanti e quando il peggior giorno 
Sembra eterno so che 
Tornerà primavera dopo quest'inverno 

Stagioni cambiano I giorni 
Sono simili rimangono vari epiloghi 
Possibili sogni invisibili strade inconoscibili 
Notti che sono imprevedibili ma bella li
Vai così se è così buona la prima ognuno 
In un film ma quando è rima deve andare in cima
Nina io stavo in giro a testa bassa zero 
Quiete o cash in cassa, non passa mai 
Ma era inevitabile schiodarmi da laggiù 
Chico vai, già so già sai
Inoltre oggetto di trash soggetto di stress
Nord sud ovest est
Ambress'ambress' già da mo' un viaggio nel viaggio 
Divido con mio amigo fido dido
Quindi vada come vada sicuro è per la vita 
Sta partita da giocare fino a che è finita 

Ognuno segue la sua via nel destino
Ma è così che va
Immaginando il suo cammino
E quello che sarà
Nelle strade, nelle case
Notti d'estate
Finestre ancora illuminate cercando gli attimi nascosti 
In più qualsiasi cosa che non basti conti 
In sospeso con la sorte a volte storie 
Vanno storte a volte sono solo porte dietro porte
Ma tutto resta uguale tutto cambierà 
E un altro giorno per vedere che ci porterà
Tutto resta uguale tutto cambierà 
E un altro giorno per scoprire cosa resterà
Forse domani sarà meglio
Domani sarà peggio, na domani 
Sarà come oggi solo di passaggio
E se domani sarà meglio 
E se domani sarà peggio domani sarà solo di passaggio",Tutto Puo' Succedere,2001
Chico Mendoza,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.
Say you really love me baby,
Say you really love me, darlin';
'Cause I really love you, baby.
Oh, I really love you, darlin.

Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it!
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time, baby, don't you worry
And if we're still playin' around, boy, that's just fine

Chico O'Farrill,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream,

Chico O'Farrill,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye",Carioca,1996

I know you raise Cain
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
You mixed with some dame
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you and what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter, and I know you cheat
But right and wrong don't matter when you're with me sleep

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours love
Don't explain",Ill Wind,1996
Chico O'Farrill & Cuban All Star Band,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Antes de entrar na roda, meu irmão?

A responsabilidade de tocar o seu pandeiro
É a responsabilidade de você manter-se inteiro
É de você manter-se inteiro

Por isso chegou a hora
Dessa roda começar
Samba Makossa da pesada
Vamos todos celebrar

Cerebral
É assim que tem que ser
Maioral
Mas é assim que é
Bom da cabeça,foguete no pé
Samba Makossa sem hora marcada
É da pesada
(Samba, Samba, Samba, Samba, Samba) 
(Samba, Samba, Samba, Samba, Samba)
(Samba, Samba, Samba, Samba, Samba)
Samba Samba!



Modernizar o passado
É uma evolução musical
Cadê as notas que estavam aqui?
Não preciso delas
Basta soar bem aos ouvidos
Viva Sapata! ,Viva Santido! ,Viva Zumbi!

As pedras evoluídas
Que cresceram com a força
De pedreiros suicidas
Cavaleiros circulam
Vigiando as pessoas
Não importa se são ruins
Nem importa se são boas

E a cidade se apresenta
Centro das ambições
Para mendigos ou ricos
E outras armações
Coletivos, automóveis,
Motos e metrôs
Trabalhadores, patrões,
Policiais, camelôs

A cidade só cresce
O de cima sobe
E o de baixo desce
A cidade não pára
A cidade só cresce
O de cima sobe
E o de baixo desce

A cidade se encontra
Prostituída
Por aqueles que a usaram
Em busca de uma saída
Ilusora de pessoas
De outros lugares,
A cidade e sua fama
Vai além dos mares

E no meio da esperteza
Internacional
A cidade até que não está tão mal
E a situação sempre mais ou menos
Sempre uns com mais e outros com menos

A cidade não pára
A cidade só cresce
O de cima sobe
E o de baixo desce
A cidade não pára
A cidade só cresce
O de cima sobe

Eu vou fazer uma embolada,
Um samba, um maracatu

Pra gente sair da lama e enfrentar os urubus

Com a mesma fedentina do dia anterior",A Cidade,1995

Much too scared to give me the eye

Leave your fat old mamma home, she never will say yes
If mama don't know now, she can guess  
My, my, yes
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When she walks along the shore, people pause to greet
White birds fly around her; little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love but I'm the only mortal man 
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne 
Don't rush me
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When we marry we will have a time you never saw
I will be so happy I will kiss my mother inlaw
Children by the dozen in and out the bamboo hut 
One for every palm tree and coconut  
Hurry up now
 
All day, all night, Marianne

Chicory Tip,"Every human being has a weakness of kind or he ain't no human at all
Every man or woman has some habit you just cannot stall
Lots of people gamble, and a lot of people swear, and a lot of others live for TV
When it comes to habits I'm the man who will always succeed.

Cigarettes, women, and wine, are the only three vices of mine
And each one is a must that I just can't give up, oh
Cigarettes, women, and wine
Cigarettes, women, and wine are the only three habits of mine.
With a girl and some wine, and a smoke I feel fine, oh
Cigarettes, women, and wine

Father said be careful, and my mother said beware there's lots of freaky stuff you don't need.
Stay away from habits that could bring you down on your knees

Put me on an island in the middle of an ocean
With only three wishes to choose
I can count them in a second cause there's only three things I can use

Cigarettes, women, and wine, are the only three vices of mine
And each one is a must that I just can't give up, oh
Cigarettes, women, and wine (that's right I said)
Cigarettes, women, and wine are the only three habits of mine.
With a girl and some wine, and a smoke I feel fine, oh

Con tus ojos tan llenos despiertos
Con tu corazon lleno y radiante
Alucinante, lleno de amor

En tratar de entenderla, se nos va la propia vida
Tan simple y tan fuerte, tan llana mente suerte

No es tan profundo, dormir soñando

Tal vez es correcta, sueña a la par del presente y no del futuro
Porque de esto no estas tan seguro

Acá, tus enojos, existes y eres libre, afuera tus despojos
Llena tus maletas de responsabilidad
Deja para mañana tu personalidad
Mas si tu te sientes una contradicción
Que al dormir te despiertas, y al despertar te duermes
Tal vez si lo dices no eres tan inteligente

La gente solo observa la ropa y los hechos
Mas no existe entre ellos una real conexión
Pues siempre cree tener la razón
La razón justa y procesadora
De lo correcto que se hace cada hora

Pero en este sueño tu estas sumergido
Mas nunca te sientas nunca afligido
Porque en este sueño tu estas protegido
Y aunque te sientas un poco distante

I was writin' all day 'til my hands would hurt
Professors didn't appreciate it, called me a jerk
New boy needed to learn, but I never would
Pay attention in school is something that I never could, uh
And know with a beat, gotta be steaming
And we could work wonders over logic and reason
We on the hype now, they call it a buzz
And how we get the party popping, Baltimore club, uh
MySpace they could replay next
And you gotta have Xaph for the D.J. set
No matter how they ever play us, they can never replace us

This that brand new spontaneous
Dope flow, intraveneous
Miscellaneous grinding
Better late than never, I'm calling it perfect timing
But we goin' have a little bit of fun
'Cause when it's all done
You throw your sneaks up and call it a good run
I admit, that I would never rather them burn me
I don't know where I'm headed, but I know it's a journey
And my bags is packed, so can you hand me my itinerary?
I get attention like a soldier in the military

That's right, uh

We used to be so strong
Back then we was right, now we so wrong
She was Beyonce, I could've got my Hov on
And when she hang up on me, I tell her hold on
Quit that shit, I don't use force
Today is a bad day, we've been divorced
When I think about stress, I don't really need it
But this is plagiarism, cause my shorty just cheated
And shorty conceited
(She out of her mind, I wish she had Louis and a card in decline)
She had school with no aid, no H.I.V.
Hope you don't get in the club with that fake I.D.
Why would you hurt somebody that you called your man for?
And I hope you get evicted by your landlord
But, she be messin' with me
And I'm hoping she lose my number indefinitely

Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

Your emotions on a roller coaster, no fun fair
You had me on the phone, but hate me when I come there
Xaphoon, let's cut it down to a drum snare
Yeah, yeah, just like that
I hope I hope you go deaf so you can't hear shit
Yeah, I hope I hope you go blind
Cause you look me in the face and you laugh when I cry

Maybe you should wonder why your apartment is always so empty
(Maybe you should wonder that)
Well I hope you get locked out of that apartment and have to call Jenny
(Oh, I hope you get locked out)

Cause everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

She's way too complex
When we argue, she takin' shit out of context
And, I know I could have did more
But I'm never home, I was always on tour
I could be anywhere in the world, had one wish
To be with you until you gave that dude a tongue kiss
And this is hard for me to say like a tongue twist
My heart don't beat for you so let the drum hit
And, you know I just got promoted
Now I be the boss and I hope you get demoted
Happiness is a warm gun, live it fully loaded
And shit got worse when I exploded
Boom, I wrote it soon, I hope you brought a cab pay
And I hope you get detention on a half day
I wish I could use your blouse for an ashtray
Cause for you, everyday should be a bad day

Just another number, they rather you be a zero

The kids need a hero, let us get bread

Custodian clean, get Banks, bring Cody in
And I bet that you probably into that Nickelodeon
They gon' watch it on the T.V. screen
And when you sleep remember it and retrieve these dreams
We livin' the good life we don't need these fiends
And when we focus it's easier than the free throw seems
Cousins without clothes, tell them keep those jeans
Buzzin' they top rows, now we beat those teams
Victorious, and can we bring this to the chor-e-us

And we had to change up our ways, cause success brings

While they litterin', snakes in the grass, they try to slither in
The rose that grew from concrete, not witherin'
And it's life so fast, the lights keep flickerin'
What goes around comes back, and that's the karma truth
I log onto my closet, that shit is Karmaloop
So I get a little fresh
My teachers used to hate me, but now I could pass the test
Got confidence, subconsciousness
Makes me overlook all of my many accomplishments
But, see I get it like nobody else did
I found a deeper meaning, know what sense of self is
And I'm a die of old age
And stay true I reverted back to my old ways

You always think I'm wrong, I think I'm right a lot
And when you see me don't I always make your day
You from BK, but you can't always have it your way
She wanna hit the city, ripping the mall
I always seem to be busy, she expecting my call
The fast life could make us happiest, upsettin' us all
Cause all the anniversaries, forgettin' 'em all
But don't be mad, love, I know where it's at love
She Jolie but it's pitiful, that's that Brad love
What happens when it all goes wrong, we was nice, generosity
And impossibly enough, it's animosity
I think I gotta just change up my game plan
Cause she and gone fall back in love with the same man

In the end I'm coming back for the same thing

She disappeared and yet I do not have no damage on me
Some times I feel she's a burden I can't manage on me
She say I'm cocky cause I got all of the cameras on me
But is it my fault, or is it your self-esteem?
And got you feelin like you're a prisoner to my dream
Parents just don't understand, and neither do y'all
You wanna hype me up and leave me there but I don't blue ball
And I say blue ball, cause let me tell you what them guys will teach you any day
And then you left but fuck it I don't need you anyways
The mentality of love gone wrong, yeah
To work it out but we just don't get along, yeah
I know it's messed up, we all, affected
Tryin to get through, and the call, rejected

You couldn't find me even if you had a radar
And I spit rapidly AKAR
I make the music with the soul of a blind man
They be amazed how I get them ladies that cry, ""yeah""
And they try to do it, but they're blind to the fact
That they're stuck in a trap and stayin' right where they at
But I'm Ray Charles, Miss A calls
Talkin' to my dime and I miss 8 calls
And I spit tough, bet you I'mma last Great Wall
I'm goin' ape y'all, I'm the new Ray Charles

Yeah uh, we used to get it into college
I ain’t learn shit, forgot a lot of knowledge
The snow bunnies had the odds, boots would love swoops
You fall in love with them business majors that love suits
But shorties great right? This how we play live
Sent her a message like insomnia in on the late night
I know there’s sharks in the water, but fuck a great white
My girl won’t know you said you go Penn State right?
We playing baby roulette
So I delete all the messages I ain’t save in the text
Next, they can’t wait to hear a player confess
But shortie, you bullshit and remove that layer of dress
Yes, and this is that crazy shit
I think that it is that ""I’m gonna have a baby"" shit
But you're someone I cannot have a baby with
Just pass the blunt cause baby I ain’t gonna babysit

And I’m still a part of some Pretty Much Amazing shit
So roll a window up, baby we finna take this hit
We on the top floor, that’s what the game bring
My love is Super Sized, and I’mma let Train sing
And could we chill what we do is what you assume
Late night I just hit, but her roommate was in the room
Like damn, could we do this every weekend?
The baddest chicks on campus, I need them
And I don’t hate the women, so I’m prepared for love
But if we make it then of course I’m gonna wear a glove
I’m your savior, I’mma text you when I can
She falling for me, so I’m gonna catch her when I can
And when I call you we back on, loving you with the strap on
A bald head in the winter, I keeps my hat on

You always think I'm wrong, I think I'm right a lot
And when you see me don't I always make your day
You from BK, but you can't always have it your way

Cause all the anniversaries, forgettin' 'em all

What happens when it all goes wrong, we was nice, generosity
And impossibly enough, it's animosity

But is it my fault, or is it your self-esteem?
And got you feelin like you're a prisoner to my dream

To work it out but we just don't get along, yeah

Critical phrases
Gathering around the smiles
Why didn't you said so?
You've already loved the last

As you spit
At the sounds of bitter
You become to be something

I wish I could bleed out
All of my ineradicably mellow
But I can't 
Calculate what you'ld do

Who's gonna play now?
Ask me to lay 'round?
There's no reason to wait any longer
I ain't getting any colder

Who's gonna play now?
Ask me to lay 'round?

I came
I give
I my eyes for you",España,2011
Chikita Violenta,"Someday
We know it's too late now
You stood on top,

There's no messing with my head tonight
You want to show them that you got it right
You want to stole their red hearts
Oh I know you're on the outside now

Something
Slips into nothing
When all the hype that broke the rules
It's hunted.

There's no messing with my head tonight
You want to show them that you got it right
You want to stole their red hearts

Of my head? 
How long? 

These walls are so thin, I keep my secrets in
But when I took the walls apart, I didn't mean to break 
Your heart

You said you've tried everything to get in my head
And you said, how long, when you open up your eyes to 
The sun, will rain come? 

Don't leave me on my own in this gossip ridden town
Don't leave me all alone spinning endlessly around

You wish I would let you in, well let me let you in
I let you under my skin, just let me let you in
You wish I would let you in, well let me let you in 
I let you under my skin, just let me let you in

You said that you're scared of every step that you 
Tread 
And you said, like me everything is not what it may seem

How long until you leave me all alone, with my fences 
Fallin' down? 
I'll be screaming on my own in this gossip ridden town 

You wish I would let you in, well let me let you in
I let you under my skin, just let me let you in

Chikuzen Sato,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin' PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over Es
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like nigga with hard R
Fly like the logo on my cousin's four forty
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like toe jam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
Cause I'm a beast, bitch, Gir, Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
They told me I was awful man, that shit did not phase me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
""You're my favorite rapper, now"" Yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin' kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
""Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?""

You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an arch-villain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit ""first of all, you talk white!
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet""
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shout out to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shout out to Gambino, girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me cause your little cousin play me
I like black girls who nerdy, but when they dance they be sayin' ""owww""
Sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipino, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' ""What the fuck is up?"" like I ain't seen the sky
And shit I'm doin' this year, Insanity

Childish Gambino,"What the fuck do y'all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude's for real or not
I'm not trying to come hard, I'm trying to come me
That's why these older songs that I used to make I'd release free
What's the point of rap if you can't be yourself, huh?
That's why I come first like my cell phone
I'm a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it's dumb, that's the fucking reason I'm doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
'Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend's baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
(See, that's not even right)
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she's sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That's not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
'Cause I ain't Mumford, I ain't tryin' to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain't the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion

I said, ""Baby, I'm okay,"" she said, ""Why you gotta act so strange?""

Am I serious? I don't even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain't trying, I'm doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R's a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short-shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, ""I'd get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man""
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain't Curren$y, but if there ain't money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loved to text me Psalm verses
She don't look at me like I'm the same person
I used to be the sweet one, things change
And I don't want them missing a son like Bon's last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I'm grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with no I.D. and No I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be

I wanna do right and it doesn't matter

Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin' on me makes them distinguished

I hate that fucking faggot, man he think that we feel that?""

So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about""

Clash of the titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin' to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
Super Bass, super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me

Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
""He don't give back,"" how the fuck can niggas say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that paint back, comin' on that mace took

He lookin’ at me now, like
""Why you so fuckin' lucky? I had a father too
But he ain’t around so I'mma take it out on you""

This is on a bus back from camp. I'm thirteen and so are you. Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble. It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That's you. And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us. We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles. I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you, but I don't know if you do or don't more-than-like me. You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer, content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on. A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh, is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh, but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be. A girl who reads books that no one's assigned to her, whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet

Back in the real world we don't go to the same school, and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood, we won't go to the same high school. So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something. And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something. The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep. We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know. And then I'm like, “Can I tell you something?” And all of a sudden I'm telling you. And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway. And there's no expression on it. And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven't said “yes” or “no” yet. And regrettably I end up using the word “destiny.” I don't remember in what context. Doesn't really matter. Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay.” I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive and I would leave in order not to spoil the moment, but there's nowhere to go because we're are on a bus. So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am.

I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore. The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on. I turn and you're not there. Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore. We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church. The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now, your bags and things piled high in the trunk. The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus, just as one of them reaches my row. It used to be our row, on our way off. It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head. Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise. She stops and looks down at me. And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face, but I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny.” Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus. I didn't know you were friends with them.

I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over. So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts. This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad, this is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not, I'm just saying it's what I learned. I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody. So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always. Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them. But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you. Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose. I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit. But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus. I still haven't.",That Power,2011

We're in a whole lot of trouble",Trouble [*],2012
Childish Gambino,"Ordinary days but these ain't ordinary times
I lost to making waves, I know there's something on our minds
We need something so beautiful when you feel your losing ground
Someone to keep you straight up tall, 'cuz no one wants to fall, Fall

We all wanna be giants, but our heads are too heavy from the mess that we're in
We all wanna have patience and we want it right now gettin' tired of waitin'
We all wanna make progress, and we sufferin' runnin' in circles again
The only reason that I stand to make it through
Is that I'm twice the man I am when I'm with you

Tryna make a change, going down a different avenue
If anytime I stop, at least I know where I am heading to
So won't ya, join the revolution cuz I been missing you
'Till we all know where this story goes, we're climbing up these walls, Walls

We all wanna be giants, but our heads are too heavy from the mess that we're in
We all wanna have patience and we want it right now gettin' tired of waitin'
We all wanna make progress, and we sufferin' runnin' in circles again
The only reason that I stand to make it through
Is that I'm twice the man I am when I'm with you

Money left to burn, we can do whatever
Ain't you know that I'm a boss? Check my Kelsey Grammer
Stank attitude but she smilin' when we kiss
But I love my baby mama, cuz she do not exist
Do not mess with Bino, Egon with ego
Haters missed the goal like Shaq did with free-throws
Yo time un poquito, no habla un gringo
Do not knock on the door unless necessito
I’m chilling at the Waldorf, eating on some grapefruit
When everybody likes you, everybody hates you
That’s just the territory
I got to be honest, it’s very boring without a hater there to make a story
They want to tell you what’s in your heart, don’t start
Getting Salieri on my Mozart
I'mma play some Go-Kart with my little brother
Cause life is only living when we livin' for each other

We all wanna be giants, but our heads are too heavy from the mess that we're in
We all wanna have patience and we want it right now gettin' tired of waitin'
We all wanna make progress, and we sufferin' runnin' in circles again
The only reason that I stand to make it through

We didn't care about that
Remember the time I said I rapped?
Then the niggas came after
Even the hoes was full of laughter
Flew back to the booth, went harder
Now node your heads to the product
Suck a nigga dick like he hotter
Slinky on the booty like your father

They ain't smoking with me, though, cause they didn't put in

Saluting Stunna on the way to the stage and way back

Tired of that old shit, swag is on some Bentley truck
Tired of these zeroes, ain't nobody near, though
Cause ain't nobody ready, throw the paper like confetti
Man, I get jobs, a hundred stack
Ya'll miss Jobs, like Wozniak
I make y'all insomniac?
No more sleeping, nigga
What you thinking, nigga?
I got your girl and need that E like we the Weeknd, nigga

I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think
It's Lloyd called ""Oakland"" on Power 106

I was making Japanese
And she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5
And she waits till I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me ""turn around,"" then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland

Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay
Babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, no

I don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland

Everything, that I needed
Now I finally got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So retreating
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute

Foot on the gas
I'm just tryna pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
But I'm really not ready girl
That's a problem
'Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know that you choose to stay, no

All the girlfriends saying ""here we go again""
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And you're saying it's because of the Internet
Try once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have better
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at her
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try

Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me (just hit me)
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone
It's iffy, you miss me

And even when you were sad you were really happy
Because you were here

And we all kissed

We became the same

Drive slow cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop
When I heard shots
Watchin' dude drop from a Glock at a
Let me flash on 'em
We all big brother now
Lil' sis, let her run around
Money talkin', you know the sound
Brrrr, money counting
Brrrr, AK
Brrrr, cell phone

Yo, bro man, check out that video I just sent you, man

Ass out to the whole world

Stepping outside for a light
No coke, and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know about photos

How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
That's why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a grove with no kids
Can't hold his goose
I'ma walk out, wanna walk too?
What about dude?
Fuck 'em, I just wanna feel something

I'm 5 foot 8, 390
And I am a freaky bitch

It's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict
Crafmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Crying cause I'm stressed. TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga's preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost god never pray, forgotten us
Lost love, never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a Watchtower
Any anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait until I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and I finish it

He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re up
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed
The sauce was so malo then she said ""you need to grow up

No one's ever been this lost
I just get the information retweeted or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember

I don't know who I am anymore

Still in the game, but he moves with a cheat code

First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces are shit with breakfast
Funny the day you born that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
And plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talking to eat, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas taking props like a musical live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her ""I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help""
She text me ""how you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?""
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass, ""you see what these labels do to me""
Texts said ""I'm Wet"", I said ""hold up, wait up a minute""

I'm ready to go

Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, no

I don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old

And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot

Can we just roll for a minute?

And we can do the same thing if you wanna have better
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at her

Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try

But you still don't have the time to kiss me (just hit me)

She done got intoxicated, girlfriend is furious
Just in case, I pack the paper in the briefcase
Rain water, roof taste, Pistol Pete
White Louis suitcase, with the singin' hook like Frankie Lymon
Shout to the Baywatch, David Hasselhoff hair
Or the Allen Iverson braids, zig zags on designer
Softened beautiful face with the puzzle piece lineup
Edge up, I done got fed up
Ate the pork chop sandwich with the tartar sauce
In the packet that I found in my purple Prada pocket protector
I could say anything about luck, you need to shut the, fuck up
Like an addict threw up, I done poured a four in a codeine
Sonic the Hedgehog club versus Knuckles in my mailbox cup

You ain’t supposed to be here, yeah your name wasn’t on that list
We even checked the email that was sent from up above, or rather all around us
Screams in my dreams like a One Direction concert, so
We’re on our own, so alone in the universe
We sent people to the moon and now we know just the two of us
By heart, my art, I don’t wanna explain it
I knew it, he bullshit, he up his own anus
Instagrams with his fans, man, he wish he was famous
Stop talking about your heart, we give a fuck, entertain us
Why this nigga the lamest, why his clothes so the plainest?
And I know the ones who hate us, be the sames to say we made it
Man fuck the vindicated, and the faded, at least they influence
How do we become the God? Language we learned in fluent
Understand who you are, they told us to be patient
But it’s pointless like the use of emojis in conversation
Question mark face
What does it mean?
It means stay up on your life, focus on them sixteens
But they want that fifteen like Sharkeisha and Terio
Yeah, you getting your shine, but nigga, are you eating, though?

If you're welcome, are you fine?
You will
Want to love yourself, free your mind
We are
Turnin' into the God we know
I will
Never give up hope, we'll be fine

Do what you want with me
Hate me and laugh at me
Darken my daytime
And torture my night

Would ask will I live or die
But I know the answers lie
Far from this world

Close every door to me
Keep those I love from me

Are never alone
For I know I shall find
My own peace of mind
For I have been promised
A land of my own

Close every door to me
Hide all the world from me
Bar all the windows
And shut out the light

Just give me a number
Instead of my name
Forget all about me
And let me decay
I do not matter
I'm only one person
Destroy me completely
Then throw me away

If my life were important I
Would ask will I live or die
But I know the answers lie

Could you use a slave,
You hairy bunch of Ishmaelites?
Young, strong, well-behaved,
Going cheap and he reads and writes
Narrator

In a trice the dirty deal was done
Silver coins for Jacob's favourite son
Then the Ishmaelites
Galloped off with the slave in tow
Off to Egypt where Joseph was not keen to go
It wouldn't be a picnic he could tell

And I don't speak Egyptian very well

His precious multi-coloured coat

Children,"Well I was wandering along by the banks of the river when seven fat cows
came out of the Nile
And right behind them fine healthy animals came seven other cows,
skinny and vile
Well the thin cows ate the fat cows which I thought would do them good
But it didn't make them fatter like I thought a monster supper should
Because the thin ones were as thin as they had ever ever been
This dream has got me baffled, hey Joseph, tell me what it means

C'mon you know that kings ain't stupid
But I don't have a clue
So don't be cruel Joseph
You gotta help me now I beg of you

I was standing doing nothing in a field out of town I saw seven
beautiful ears of corn
They were ripe they were golden but you guessed it right
behind them were seven other ears  tattered and torn
Then the bad corn ate the good corn man they came up right behind
yes they did
And Joseph here's the punchline it's really gonna blow your mind 
flip your lid
Because the bad corn was as bad as it had ever ever been
This dream has got me all shook up, treat me nice and tell me what it means

Children,"You ought to know about Mr. Mistoffelees the original Conjuring Cat. 
(There can be no doubt about that.) Please listen to me and don't scoff. 
All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis: 
He holds all the patent monopolies, 
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions.

The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.
And you'll all say: 
Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn.

[Chorus: x2]
And we all say: Oh! 
Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire,

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

Raised by demons in abodes of the end

Wrecked by mangled wounds of life

Ain't got respect for humanity
Never lived or wanted immortality

Or the 3 o'clock bell that sounds when school ends

Lunch room status, we used to roll dice
Bang beats on the tables to see who was nice
Swore we knew it all, didn't want no advice
How unfortunate, some paid the ultimate price

We used to cut class all day, roam around the hallways
With little wooden passes
I remember 6th grade, assembly, shirt with tie

I did what I was told to get to junior high
'cause at that point in time I believed I could fly
Big blue binders, young designer finders
Livin' in the world with no rules, high school

Children's Choir,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1997
Children's Choir,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1997

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Blinking in the morning sun
Shaking off the heavy one
Oh, heavy like a loaded gun
What made me behave that way?
Using words I'd never say?
I can only think it must be love
Oh anyway,
It's looking like a beautiful day

Someone tell me how I feel
It's silly wrong, but vivid right
Oh, kiss me like the final meal
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight
'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with me half awake
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

When my face is chamois creased
If you think I wink, I did
Love be likely attributes
Oh, kiss me when my lips are thin

'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake, stumbling over what to say
Well, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

So throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right

Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right

Chilinga,"Oye, esto va dedicado a todos los barrios de Puerto Rico
¡Trujillo! Dedicado al barrio de la Perla
¡Pocho! Dile a Johana que me haga un arroz con habichuela bien duro
Un saludito a José, los cogemos bajando
¯Y tú, ¿qué estás mirando?

Yo tengo actitud desde los cinco años
Mi mae me la creó con tapabocas y regaños
Desde chiquito, canito, con el pelo castaño
Soy la oveja negra de todo el rebaño
Y fui creciendo poquito a poco
Brincando de techo en techo, tumbado cocos
Y aunque casi me mato y casi me cocoto
Nunca me vieron llorando ni botando moco
Siempre perfumado y bien peinadito
Pa' buscarme una novia con un apellido bonito
Larita, mi primer beso de amor
Se casó la bruja, lluvia con sol

Allá abajo en el hueco en el boquete
Nacen flores por ramillete
Casitas de colores con la ventana abierta
Vecinas de la playa puerta con puerta
Que yo tengo de todo, no me falta nada
Tengo la noche que me sirve de sábana
Tengo los mejores paisajes del cielo
Tengo una neverita repleta de cerveza con hielo

Un arcoíris con sabor a piragua
Gente bonita rodeada por agua
Los difuntos pintados en la pared con aerosol
Y los que quedan, jugando basketball
Un par de gringos que me dañan el paisaje
Vienen tirando fotos desde el aterrizaje
La policía, que se tira sin pena
Rompiendo mi casa pa' cobrar la quincena
Aquí nació mi mae y hasta mi bisabuela
Este es mi barrio y yo soy libre como Mandela
Cuidado con la vieja escuela que no te coja
Que te va a meter con chancleta y palo de escoba
Así que no te me pongas majadero
Porque yo vengo con apetito de obrero
A comerme a cualquiera que venga a robárme lo mio
Yo soy el Napoleón del caserío
¡Oye! Esto se lo dedico a los que trabajan con un sueldo bajito
Pa' darle de comer a sus pollitos
Yo quiero a mi barrio como Tito quiere a Jaimito
Yo no lucho por un terreno pavimentado
Ni por metros cuadrados, ni por un sueño dorado
Yo lucho por un paisaje bien perfumado
Y por un buen plato de bistec encebollado
Por la sonrisa de mi madre que vale un millón
Lucho por mi abuela meciéndose en su sillón
Lucho por unos pinchos al carbón
Y por lo bonito que se ve La Perla desde un avión
¡Oye, dile!

Allá abajo en el hueco en el boquete
Nacen flores por ramillete
Casitas de colores con la ventana abierta
Vecinas de la playa puerta con puerta
Que yo tengo de todo, no me falta nada
Tengo la noche que me sirve de sábana
Tengo los mejores paisajes del cielo
Tengo una neverita repleta de cerveza con hielo

Oye
Esto fue por la inocencia de Jonathan Román
La chilinga desde Argentina
Estamos calentando motores
Dale

Esa risa en La Perla la escuché en el chorrillo
Y de Tepito hasta Callao y donde se acallan chiquillos
Creo en barrios con madres que vivieron iguales de razones
Y al final se murieron sin tener vacaciones
Como decía mi abuela: así fue la baraja en casa del pobre
Hasta el que es feto trabaja por ese barrio eterno también universal
Y el que se mete con mi barrio me cae mal

¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Veo las luces de La Perla desde Panamá
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Brillando en clave Morse y me invitan pa' allá
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Un camino hecho de estrellas, semáforo la luna
¡La noche me sirve de sabana!
Salí a las siete y media y voy llegando a la una
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Nena frótame con vicbaporu como me hacía mamá
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Ni dormido me olvido de mi identidad
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
El hombre bueno no teme, no teme a la oscuridad
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
¡Ea! Y no me falta más nada

Allá abajo en el hueco en el boquete
Nacen flores por ramillete
Casitas de colores con la ventana abierta
Vecinas de la playa puerta con puerta
Que yo tengo de todo, no me falta nada
Tengo la noche que me sirve de sábana

Esa pared del barrio y eso es pa' que te asombres
Cincuenta años más tarde todavía guarda mi nombre

Aquí no se perdona al tonto majadero
Aquí de nada vale tu apellido, tu dinero
Se respeta el carácter de la gente con que andamos
Nacimos de muchas madres pero aquí sólo hay hermanos
Y ese mar frente a mi casa te juro que es verdad
Como el de La Perla aunque yo esté en Panamá
Y sobre el horizonte veo una nube viajera dibujando la cara del gran Maelo Ribera
Celebra esta reunión compadre
Qué te parece esta combinación de Rubencito y Calle 13?

¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Pero eso no resuelve el blanco sospechoso
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
La noche no absuelve al verbo mentiroso
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!

Chilinguita,"Sé que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar 
Que estas cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar girando siempre en un lugar

Sé que las ventanas se pueden abrir
Cambiar el aire depende de ti
Te ayudara vale la pena una vez más

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza

Es mejor perderse que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
Aunque ya ves que no es tan fácil empezar

Sé que lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá
Y así­ será la vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela

Since the first time I saw ya
I knew I was attracted
Reacted to the fact
On how ya make me act
Shy but sexy at the same time
Always on my mind was a little bump and grind

Usually I don't play it that close
You got's to kick it wit me
Before I serve you up
With an overdose
Of that bomb-ass puh-nanny
Make you my man
I ain't got no love
For nobody else but you

Cause you's my boo
I prove to you
My love be true
So do you know where you goin' to 
Through thick and thin, baby
You all in, time will reveal
That my love for you will never end

My heart keep tickin'
No time for trickin'
You who I'm pickin'
So lay me down
Just give it a good lickin'
I'll treat you like my king
Cause you royal
And only give my love to you
Because I'm loyal, escape with me

Come over to my place

After our first night
You discovered who's the bombest mommy
L.A.'s finest with my top dogs all around me
Down to ride, harder than Bonnie and Clyde
We're sexual healers, do ya feel this
Baby, check my vibe

They'll never be a love like me
That got your back in this industry
That got your back in these streets
So you don't have to worry 'bout me
On the creep
And I don't want you ever to try to 
Play me cheap

Cause I don't sleep around
Because it's sleezy
Good lesson taught by my big homey E-Z
I got to compliment you on how you please me
Touch me, but don't tease me
Now put it in nice and easy

And rub my body down I'm feeling wheezy
And cuddle up to me
Cause now I'm getting sleepy
But I'mma be dedicated
To this relation
So stay away from all them cowboys
So we can not be playa hated

Cause if you wit me boo, then keep it real
And if I catch you sleepin' around
Then I'm gon' have to chill
When ya find good love
You best to keep it

[ VERSE 1 ]
The truth will set you free, let you see the light
You don't need to watch TV tonight
And stop talkin while I'm speakin or start walkin
Coke you're smokin got you gaggin and coughin
It's a beacon of light that I present
Illuminatin the mic with common sense
I profile the style of the Chill one
Now close your eyes, son, cause I'm the rising sun
Back up, don't sweat me, let me earn my pay
People fiendin for funky tracks we lay
Need I say I built my rep on
The fact when others turned back I kept on
Rhymin, climbin, the timin, the fist fighter
All you crumb snatchers, I'm here to diss biters
I don't trust you any further than I can throw you
You have any doubts? Look, let me show you

[ VERSE 2 ]
What type of thing are you into? These rhymes I'm bringin you
Are sort of like slingin you, I'll tell you a thing or two
I see what's in front of me, the G is no want to-be
I hope you know this ain't as hype as it's gonna be
I know I'm original, the G is no criminal
Never switchin position cause the condition is terminal
I do what I gotta do like a brother's supposed to
I'm livin my life right like I took an oath to
I'm pushin my way through, I won't let you slow me down
Chill is a prefix, Rob is a proper noun
G is for greatness, I don't want to debate this
The way that I'm risin I appear to be weightless
I may sound crazy, this might look easy
Suckers don't faze me, crabs don't skeeze me
You want to know the time, then bust a rhyme
Here's my favorite line - let me show you

[ VERSE 3 ]
I hear a lot of rappers who seem to lackluster
Execute your rhyme with all the force that you can muster
Just a hint, as I sprint toward my own goal
Rob is chill, got skill and get stone-cold
But I'm a free thinker, I'll tinker with your brain game
More when I put you on board my thought train
All aboard, you can all applaud, and Lord
Have pity on a fake or flake or fraud
Think you're cool? What a fool we take you for
Wastin time on rhymes that make you snore
Puttin yourself to sleep is ridiculous
To shake you up, wake you up, we kick you this
Seems like you get up and go, got up and left
Now just watchin me you're all out of breath
Sit down, relax yourself, don't tax yourself
Here's a pretty good question to ask yourself
Am I lackin, how am I livin, am I givin all I got?
If not, let me show you
",Let Me Show You,1990
Chill Rob G.,"My rhymes as I kick them ( ? ) em to the beat
I'm advancin, people dancin in the street
To my drum, more wise words from the Chill one
You felt the effect in the past and you're still numb
Leavin you bugs in the dust is a must for me
Silly you clowns got around and discuss the G
Wonderin which move I might make next
I'm stackin my rhymes so I climb to the apex
Why should I wait for a date with destiny?
I'll pick the time, the place that's best for me
Don't bother tryin to block or hold me back
Advancement is my mind's only track
I'm an aristocrat, a ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with a gift for rap
So I'm shootin my mouth off cause suckers are shootable
Flauntin my flesh cause I'm black and it's beautiful
Many have fallen from bein too careless
It pays to raise your cultural awareness
Know who you are, where you're goin and where you came from
Breakin your neck for respect, man, that's plain dumb
Respect is somethin you gain by bein yourself
Otherwise we're respectin somebody else
The person you want to be, not who you really are
Yo, can you follow me, or did I just go too far?
I don't want to confuse y'all, so just get on board
And walk this way, cause I'm movin forward
Advancin, swift is how I move
Before I grip the mic I calm my mood
Let me activate, I'm an activist
You want to rap? Develop an knack for this
Learn to use your head, got to be more careful
Be doin nothin stupid cause somebody dared you
I'm an ear full, an eye full and a rival
Givin you back what you lack for survival
Into rappin, it just so happens that I'm a blackman
Rob is chill, got skill and I pack jams
Rhymes I wrote I devote to promote pride
People can quote what I spoke cause I don't lie
My records do not slip, skip and they won't slide
This jam was made by the King and I
Mark's remarkable, bass shakes the floor board
The whole place vibrates while I'm movin forward
Out of my way, you seen my comin
Drop from the sky and I hit the ground runnin
No confusion or complication
The name is still Chill Rob and this groove is Motivation

On the trail of the lonesome Pine 
In the pale moonshine our hearts entwine 
Where you carved your name and I carved mine.

Like the pine - I am lonesome for you 
In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia 
On the trail of the lonesome Pine.

Just below is the little cabin home of a little girl of mine

Chilla,"Yo, Fleetzy on the track

J'ai commencé le rap dans ma city 
Gravé toutes les marches jusqu'à m'élever 
Notre histoire et nos âmes sont bien reliées 
Au sommet de la cote, posée, j'roupillais
J'ai gratté quelques seize noyé dans le Rhône 
J’affûtais tous mes flow et ma clé de sol 
Je remplissais ma tête d'or 
Les pensées dans les nuages, le ciel d'un bleu immuable 
Je passais pour une escroc 
J'ai bien des rêves à réaliser 
C'est pas en dormant que ces rêves vont se réaliser 
J'ride l'université lumière 
J'dois dire qu'on fait pas la paire mauvaise élève car 
Je suis passionnée par le son j'dois travailler pour des sous 
Additionner les sommes ne plus dépendre des autres 
J'ai pris le courant de la Saône afin d'éviter la zone 
Et ronger par les songes j'suis revenue à la source 

J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville (à la recherche de la rime) 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville (à la recherche de la rime) 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville (à la recherche de la rime) 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville 

Toujours sur mes gardes j'suis la panthère face aux lions 
Le brouhaha de la gare me fait bouger dans le vieux Lyon 
Je me souviens encore des graff et de l'odeur des bouchons 
J'suis enivrée par le 'cab? Non! Par les bouteilles sous le pont 
La métropole m'a fait grandir et m'inspire 
Ce métronome j'en ai fait d'ma vie un style 
Et toutes ses âmes j'ai pu croiser m'ont instruites
La grisaille m’a ternie, j'ai boité comme Thiercy
Les néons des snacks et des pub, le béton, la BAC et les punks 
Change de couleur 
Mon vrai coup de cœur, c'est se faire plaisir près des péniches 
Mes pompes ont ridé le bitume 
Mon ombre a caché mon attitude 
Chante la douleur cherche la douceur 
Posé je me dis que j'vais être paisible 
Du mal à m'endormir possédée par le tempo 
Je compte les heures, obsédée par les échos 
Des sirènes, leur chant n'a jamais cessé de tourner dans ma tête anh 
Du mal à m'en sortir, obligée de faire du réseau 
J'compte mon beurre au pic et je taffe mes exo 
Mais dilemme, la chance n'a au grand jamais fais partie de ma quête 

J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville (à la recherche de la rime) 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville (à la recherche de la rime) 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville (à la recherche de la rime) 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville 
J'roulais, j'roulais dans la ville 

J'roulais j'roulais même la nuit 
Le métro hanté par mes mélodies 
J'roulais, j'roulais même la nuit (j'suis la panthère face aux lions ouais) 
J'roulais, j'roulais même la nuit 
Le métro hanté par mes mélodies 
J'roulais, j'roulais même la nuit (j'suis la panthère face aux lions)",Dans la Ville,2018

I need someone
To treat me right
I need someone
To hold me tight
Somebody
Gotta love
Gotta love
Gotta love
Gotta love
I want some, need some
Got to have some
Take some, make some
Got to get it
Gotta get it
Good loving
Oh oh somebody
Looking for somebody
'Cause what seems real to me
Was just a fantasy
My infatuation
Is the current situation",Somebody,2001
