Cleve Douglas,"It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It don't mean a thing
All you got to do is sing
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It makes no diff'rence 
If it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm 
Ev'rything you got
Oh, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing

Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)",It Don't Mean a Thing,2000
Cleve Douglas,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2000
Cleveland Jazz Orchestra,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,
Cleveland Jazz Orchestra,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,2007
Cleveland Jazz Orchestra,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2007
Cleveland Jazz Orchestra,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,2007
Cleveland Jazz Orchestra,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, I do love you""

I still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will
I hope 'twill never depart

Cleveland Jazz Orchestra,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'

Cleveland Watkiss,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I

You, over you",Overjoyed,2006
Clevie,"Yeah, I'ma missing you
Missing you

Talk to you but it's not the same
As touching you
And every time you whisper my name
I wanna run to you

We'll be together
And it won't be long
It won't be long
But it seems like forever
And it's out of my arms

Baby, 'cuz I'm missing you now
And it's driving me crazy
'Cuz I'm needing my baby
I'm missing you now

Can't wait another moment
Baby, 'cuz I'm missing you now
Needing you right here by my side
Is all that I can do
Arms around my pillow at night
They should be holding you

I was much stronger
How could I know?
How could I know?

But it seems like forever
And it's hard to be strong
Baby, 'cuz I'm missing you now

And it's driving me crazy
I'm needing my baby
I'm missing you now

Can't wait another moment
Baby, 'cuz I'm missing you now
Said I'ma missing you now

And it's driving crazy
I'm needing my baby
I'm missing you now

Cleyde Jane,"Levantai, jovens!
Levantai, Igreja!
Levantai!
É tempo de reagir!
 
Não vos conformeis com o mundo
Aborrecei o que é mal
Resisti às tentações
Não ceda ao sistema do mundo
Tenha a mente de Jesus
Pense nas coisas de cima
Tenha seus olhos voltados para o Senhor
Atente para Seu ministério
Chega de ser apenas parte da multidão
Seja um discípulo, um profeta do Senhor
 
Aproximai mais de Deus
Repudie o pecado
Apresente sua vida ao Senhor em santidade
 
Faça parte da geração que toca as vestes de Jesus
Faça parte da geração que faz a diferença
Faça parte daqueles que colocam a mão no arado
E não olham para trás",Levantai,2016
Cli' She,"What's up baby, Mexican D hollering this
Just getting back with you, told you we was gone chill
Come through, blow something, smoke something
You know how we do it, keeping it real on this side
Letting y'all broads know, we too real

What's happening I see you capping trying to play that role like
You don't know me
Come into my world of diamonds and pearls cause you look a
Little bit lonely
I decided I wan to to cut, couldn't help but notice the shape of
Your butt
And the way you stretch just drive a player nuts, man what's up
Could I just talk to you for a second I don't want to take up
All your time
But see your 36, 24, 36, done blew my mind
I can't take it the way shake it to make me have to push up on
You
To see if we have anything in common, you see I like to smoke
Marijuana
Would you be interested in smoking a square, running my fingers
Through your hair
Go to the Residence Inn with a 3's and 10's coming up out of
Underwear 
See I'ma be chilling, I won't be hard, got a wife at home so
Don't leave no scars
On my back, cause Z-Ro penetrates so if you gone see stars
I'ma get the roof up out killing out when I have
Do a little wine and take a little bath
Sip a little wine to ease my mind then it's back to knocking you
Down
All you got to do is put me in the penn
Got to bet it won't sink, I'm around the way
Make you want to tell somebody cause I'm a square or something 
Keep it on the low and we could do this today

[Chorus]
Let's chill, so I could knock you down
Cause all that I want to do, is fornicate with you
Let's chill, and we can bump and grind
I want to get into you, that's all I want to do

OK, seen you peeping a storm, so I took the opportunity to jump
In my ride
And we could bump heads again and see we could go inside
With our minds, you got something that I cut for
The bald head and the thug in you, that makes me want to lust
You
You balling with your boys, while I'm funk deep with my girls

Diamonds glistening to the tip of my chrome just missing the
Curb
Hey love, what I got to give is probably more than you could
Receive
But we can compromise and bump many times my body's at ease
Did I shock you when I approached when I said let's chill
Or did I shock you when I didn't knock you for coming straight
Up and real
Show me a good time, make me feel like I'm in paradise
Me and you, one on one I ain't trying to claim to be your wife 
So let's just chill, and take time for two of the same minds
To make twice the hustle and grind and fornications that's on
Your mind
Won't you meet me at my place, I say around 10 and don't be late
Cause I want you to feel me when I say classified ladies want to
Chill baby

[Chorus]

I can feel your earth, wind and fire so retire to my rap sure
If you grin it means I win and then your skins have been
Captured 
If you one to five times and knocking five times of running away
Together
Bumping and grinding, smoking and leaning steady reclining up on
The lever
Get aqua tinted with each other as we feel the Mo City
These cats ain't having it when they do they thang and no never
Show pity
But if you scared, I mean you not alone
It might be the ghetto but I call it home
90 percent of the killers are cool with me
So it's cool to sit back and blow a bag with me
So if I said I wanted to be your better half, you know that I
Was lying
No disrespect but I want some sex, can a player get up in
Between the thighs
But if you say I move too fast, I'ma slow my role and romance
We can go to the Papa Do's and all of those fancy places and
Then slow dance
Under the candle light, sipping Dom Perignon
The stereo bumping our slow jam song
From 2 to 6 we ball in the mix and chains sex places getting it
On
Cause I'm a pimp baby, not a simp and I want to be the trick in
Your life
It's plain and clear that a g came here to put this dick in your
Life

Don't that sun look good going down
I said well good evening
Don't that sun look good going down
Don't that ol' army cot look lonely

Well I tried everything baby
To get along with you
Now I'm gonna tell you
What I'm gonna do
I'm gonna stop my cryin'
Gonna leave you alone
And if you don't think I'm leavin' big momma

You ain't gonna see me
You ain't gonna see my sweet face no more

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

And it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through

They got some hungry women there
They really make a mess outta you

Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot

To get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor
Won't even tell me what I've got

Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she takes you to her room

And you're so kind
You're careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon

I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough

But the joke was on me
There was nobody to call my bluff

I think I've had enough

Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray

O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From god our heav'nly Father a blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born the son of god by name

""Fear not, then,"" said the angel, ""Let nothing you afright
This day is born a savior of a pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him from Satan's power and might""

The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightaway this blessed babe to find

But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this infant lay
They found him in a manger where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray

Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface

God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign
And many a merry Christmas may live to see again
Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near--
That God send you a happy New Year, happy New Year
And God send you a happy New Year",God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,

Are also on the faces of people passin' by
I see friends shakin' hands, saying ""how do you do?""

Cliff Richard,"
Everyday now seems endless... 
How slow the moments go but how fast they fly... 
The next time I see Mary-Anne...

All my sorrows soon will leave me... 
Then the sadder world will seem like new... 
The next time I see Mary-Anne...

Mary Anne, there are no words that I could say, 
No way to tell her what it means to me 
To see her face again.....

In the sunlight I'll kiss her, 
Married we will be - my baby and me 
The next time I see Mary Anne... 
The next time I see Mary Anne... 
Mary Anne... ",Poem,1968
Cliff Richard,"How to start? What to say?
I don't remember ever feeling this way.
Can it be true? Does anyone care?
Is it only make-believe or are You really there? 
Is there a chance I've been missing the best?
Could it be life is more than a guess?

I'm afraid to let go, yet I long to see.
If You are real, be real to me,
If You are real, be real to me. 

Okay, supposing I were to come to You?
Not saying I will, just supposing I do?
Would I have to be, just another guy?
Two a penny's not for me, it just won't satisfy.
I'm just confused, by candles and prayers.
I just need to know, if You are there.

Show me the way, for I long to see.
If You are real, be real to me,
If You are real, be real to me.

I'm just confused, by candles and prayers.
I just need to know, if You are there.

Cliff Richard,"What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alley ways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears
Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, I love you","For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her",1969
Cliff Richard,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow,1969

That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will be my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess, within the veil

Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun",Amazing Grace,1974
Cliff Richard,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again

Together, give together.
One fine day,
A time beyond our time.
Come that day we'll make
It if we're strong,
So help it along, help it along,
Help it along.

Please don't laugh at me
When I tell you
I believe in love,
'cause it's still
The only thing that
There is too little of.
And it's a long time coming,
But come I'm sure it will
And just in time
The world will rhyme on
The far side of a hill.

On some fine......
....... help it along.

Cliff Richard,"Butterflies danced on invisible strings  Showing wings they borrowed from a rainbow  And a blackbird on high sang a praise to the sky  While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain  Furry backed bees with a tireless drone  Never moan, they're happy to be working  And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen  While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain  Chorus:  Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul, before there's nothing left to fly at all  Take to the sky, higher than high, before the silvery rain begins to fall  Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn  Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song  There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew  Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain",Silvery Rain,1974

In a different light

We'll be free

Sing a song of freedom each and everyman

Cliff Richard,"When did you becomethe topic of conversation,
When did you become this country's
Popular myth
Seems that overnight you caught
Everybody's attention
Everybody sings about you and your name
Bounces off their lips

When did you become superstar of
This generation
And when did you become commercial property
Everybody's got their own sweet lord,
Hear them sing
Looking here, looking there but they just don't
Seem sweet

Were you a guru, a godly man,
Or where you a genius, the best in the land

I read in the paper that you were back in fashion
Amongst the famous men you were high on the list
Don't they realise that fashion's a passing fancy

The truth is yesterday, today, forever
You'll be staying
Yesterday, today, forever never wavering
You stated who you were and that will
Never change
Like it or not you'll always be the same
Son of god

Like it or not, yesterday, today, forever (x6)
Yesterday, today, forever, like it or not

Cliff Richard,"My heart has no desire to
Stay where doubts arise
And fears dismay.
Though we must dwell
Where these are bound
I must go on to higher ground.

I want to scale the
Utmost hight and catch
A gleam of glory bright.
For faith has caught
The joyful sound,
The song of life on higher ground.

Lord, lift me up
And let me stand my feet
On heaven's stable land.
Oh, greater plane
That I have found.
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground.

I'm treading on the
Upward way, new hights
I'm gaining every day,
Still praying as I'm homeward bound:
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground.

How

So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now

Six months later I'm a cool operator,and I know my way around

But that don't bother me now 'cause I've got a friend who's gotta friend who
Really knows how
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now

Still hanging on,still hanging on,hang on

I met this real live walking,self-styled,self-assured,slow talking bore
I thought I'd play him along,give him a song,to keep the doom dust away from
My door
But I didn't do what he wanted me to,but it didn't seem to matter somehow

So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now

Still hanging on,still hanging on,hang on

Six months later I'm a part time waiter,but that didn't last long
I stretched and squeezed at words I'd never heard to write a song
And when it finally came,it sounded the same as a tune I'd heard before
Somehow

But mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now

To pay respects with painted frowns

Underneath the ground

He'll see another day

Alright, it's alright
I'm gonna get to see you
Alright, it's alright
I'm gonna get to see you

But all you could do
Was talk behind my back
Now I see through you
Nothing I could say or do
Would get to you

You've bitten off more than you can chew
Although I've got to say we're through
There's nothing I would rather do
Than be with you

I see myself at the end of each day
I'm feeling sad somehow
My rumble tumble days are over now

Took loopy loo to a paper hat party
And fought the kid who tried to take her away

My rumble tumble days are over now

Running away,you don't know,you don't care

Playing spoof at the back of the schoolyard
With no thought for the rest of the day

Drinking her memory away when he can
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore

But now they don't cry anymore
How does it all come to happen
That's not what loving is for
And if i thought it was,i would leave here in the morning

It never tells a lie

You're always telling stories
You're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories, why?

So think of yourself in the water
Seeing your days flashing by
It's too late to see what you wanted to be
You've spent all your time, you must die

Every face tells a story
It never tells a lie
Every face tells a story
It never tells a lie, oh

You're always telling stories
You're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories, why?

Why don't you step down
And make it work out right
I'm trying to get to you with my warning
Been here for nearly half the night

Look it's nearly four in the morning

Cliff Richard,"Got every reason to feel like I do
From the top of my head to the bottom of my shoes
'Cause last night my baby took the weight off my mind
Told me everything was gonna be fine
She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way

But she knows how I feel and she's not exactly shy

Oh I used to be so lost and confused
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried
But still I didn't rest I had to know
What was behind it all I'd come so far
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote
I couldn't resist it being beside her
Could have held that moment forever in my heart
The moment I saw her was the moment I knew
That her love is my life and her light's shining through
She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me

Our love never shown
Except, when we are parted
Or oh, so alone

When we're together
We miss love by a mile
So I lay back take it easy
And try a smile

Can this really be for the best
I got an achin' in my heart
I wanna tell you that I love you

I know we had to close the door
Only to find that there were more
I wanna tell you that I love you

Buys the pride I'd rather sell

And leave it all behind
Looking windward for my compass
I take each day as it arrives

No grand illusions of the romantic fates

Don't know why we conceded

'Cos we were high, now we're low
Tell me why did we go
Falling in luv, falling in luv

Under pressure from family and friends
They seem to treasure a storybook end
One look at them I realize luv is real overrated

'Son I have something to say'
And what he told me I'll never forget
Until my dying days

He said son you are a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son you'll be a bachelor boy
Until your dying days

With a girl as sweet as can be
But I remembered just in time
What my daddy said to me

Meet a girl and fall in love
Then I'll get married have a wife and a child
And they'll be my turtle doves

When nothing is moving. 
Least Of All Me. 
I lay on my back in the hay. 
The warm sun was soothing. 
It made me feel good. 
The day I met Marie. 

The Sound of her whisper hello. 
Came tiptoing softly into my head. 
I opened my eyes kinda slow. 
And there she was smiling. 
It made me feel good. 
The day I met Marie. 

With the laughing eyes. 
She'd toss her hair and tantalize. 
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze. 

I remember her kiss
So soft on my brow
And the way that she said
Baby go to sleep now
Baby go to sleep now

I woke with the chill in the air
The warm sun no longer hung in the sky
I reached out but she was not there
She'd gone where she came from
But I still feel good
To think I've known Marie
With the laughing eyes
She'd toss her hair and tantalize
She came to touch me then she's gone

We've just met
Just how lucky can one boy get
There's a light in your eye
I know it's love and I know that I could be happy
With a girl like you

Tell your mom tell your pa
And tell your favourite old wishing star
We're in love, just by chance
I asked you would like to dance
Fancy dancing with a girl like you
Funny how love can come to a lonely heart
I'm a boy, you're a girl I guess that's a pretty start
Here I am, there you are
Together baby we should go far

Two hearts together like they ought to be

His blankets are made out of cardboard
And his pillows are made out of stone

Every face tells a story
It never tells a lie

See the man walking on the water
See the light in his eyes
He came into the world with a message to tell
He came into the world to die

It never tells a lie

It never tells a lie

You're always telling me lies

Cliff Richard,"There was one who was famed for the number of things
He forgot when he entered the ship:
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
And the clothes he had bought for the trip. 

He had forty-tow boxes all carefully packed,
With his name painted clearly on each;
But since he omitted to mention the fact,
They were all left behind on the beach.

He came as a Baker; but owned, when too late-
And it drove the poor Bellman half mad-
He could only bake Bridecake -for which, I may state,
No materials were to be had.

I came as the Baker on this escapade,
I knead the dough, but I can't look after the bread,
The Banker does it instead,
And although I never feel afraid,

Somehow I know
It could be the single worst mistake I've ever made,
To come as the Baker on this escapade.",The Escapade,1986
Cliff Richard,"Some people, they tease one another
Take pride in themselves, keeping the other one down
Well, I'm not like that at all

Well, I'm not like that at all

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one's hand
They always understand

Some people cry
Some people know why

Some people, they use one another so aimlessly
Not like lovers do
Well, I'm not like that at all

Some people they long for each other
They love to talk holding the other one's hand
They always understand

Some people cry
Some people know why

With a word unspoken with a voice unheard
When a word is broken by a tender word
When a heart is moved, when a heart is thrown
The silence tells you, you're not alone

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one
Holding the other one
Holding each other

I'm just so crazy about you

The one you love
The one you prayed for
Brought you an angel
And the angel stayed for
The light of love just
Walked into your life

She said hold me and keep me warm
Hold me for ever and keep me from harm
Hold me and keep me warm
Hold me for ever in your loving arms

'cause I love you
And I need you
And I want you here for evermore
I'm just so crazy about you

The only one you ever lost your heart for
The one you cried a million times for
Your only dream has walked into your life

She said hold me and keep me warm
Hold me for ever and keep me from harm
Hold me and keep me warm
Hold me for ever in your loving arms

And I need you
And I want you here for evermore

Cliff Richard,"You wonder why do the things you do
With all the heartache that you've been through
It's only human to feel like this
It's only human the need to kiss

Too many times you've begun to cry
And after all this time you still don't know why
It's only human to feel so much
It's only human the need to touch

Who's in love, in love with someone new
Who's in love, in love with someone madly
Who's in love, in love with someone new
Who's in love, in love with someone madly
So madly, who's in love

You wonder what will the future be
And will the answer be there for you to see
You're only human, you need to love
It's only human the need to love

Who's in love, in love with someone new
Who's in love, in love with someone madly
Who's in love, in love with someone new
Who's in love, in love with someone madly
So madly, who's in love

Listen to your heartbeat (*4)

You're only human
You need to kiss

Talk about the reason and the rhyme.
Talk about the sentimental feelings,
Talk about the candlelight and wine,
Talk about the children.

Listen to the voices singing.
Listen to the laughter as they play
But listen to the whisper of a heartbeat
Whose loneliness is never far away.

In some hearts it's never christmas,
But it's winter all the time.
All our lives spent waiting for the sun,
Children of tomorrow,
How they need a star to follow.
In some hearts it's always winter,
For some hearts it seems,
That christmas never comes.

Don't forget the winter's children,
Shadows on a star that never shines.
Looking for the love that never happened
Looking for the chris in christmas time.
The lonely voice,
That can't rejoice,
That has no choice.

Help to make the season bright.

All the streets were dark and bare.
In our town no scarlet ribbons,
Not one ribbon for her hair.

through the night my heart was aching,
Just before the dawn was breaking.
I peeked in and on her bed,
In gay profusion lying there,
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for her hair.

We could be here wild in our wishes
With all the love that's in my heart

So you could ride away
To the one you love
And be here for this day

You're someone to look up to

One day I'll promise I'll be with you
Always I'll love you
Now just a memory
A lifetime of rivalry
I couldn't have a better friend than you

I used to criticize the way you used to be
The child that had the look that dreams are made of
A window to the past looks onto everything I see
The fire went out the flame just dies
I couldn't have a better friend than you

Brother to brother, when we meet again
There'll be no differences between us
Free from the darkest night, free till we see the light
Burning ever after

Time is a healer, calming our fears
A thousand questions left unanswered
Oh I believe in you

Become a memory that's larger than life
Have you ever felt there's beauty in distortion
If faiths a crime give me a clue
And if it is then brother it's still you

Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came here to you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman

Let me see the lines of your hand
I can see me a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned

I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for

Is he devil?

Thought it may disturb you now
Abandon all attempts to love me

And the snow capped mountains so white.
From a distance the ocean meets the stream,
And the eagle takes to flight.
From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land.
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace,
It's the voice of every man.

From a distance, we all have enough,
And no-one is in need.
There are no guns, no bombs and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed.
For a moment we must be instruments,
Marching in a common band,
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace,
They're is the songs of every one.

God is watching us, god is watching us,
God is watching us, from a distance.

From a distance, you look like my friend,
Even though we are at war.
From a distance, i can't comprehend,
What all this war is for.
What we need is love and harmony,
Let it echo through the land.
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,
It's the heart of everyone.
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,
It's the song of everyone.

I am not afraid when
I can hold you tight
If there must be an answer
Then there must be a prayer

My life is such a statement
Of my hopes and despairs
But nothing really matters
Just as long as you're there
You love me such honesty,
You love with no gain
You speak to me so tender
And you never explain
So I lean on you, I lean on you

It's so easy to do
My baby she tells me what to do
She always tells me the truth
My baby she cares
It's so easy to do
My baby knows what I'm gonna do
That's why I lean on you

I dream of an island,
Of a fantasy place
Where I can go to sometimes
And nobody can trace
Well such is the nature,
The nature of love
That when we dream it
Sometimes means that we need love

Così tu nella nebbia più fuggir non potrai
E accanto a me tu resterai.

E il tuo cuore riscaldarsi potrà
E mai più freddo sentirai.

In pain, or in joy, or in sun, or in rain
It just seemed the same

But I'm only human
Branded by ambition
But I'm going to make it count

Vita mia 
Quanta vita see'e
Ce nell'rosso acceso in me

Vita sia
Come un nuovo canto
Ora che, muoio per te

So many intentions
In life I could have followed
Here and now is how
I'll live every moment
Unafraid of what life gives
Respect things I don't understand

Vita sia

How long must we wait?

The seasons, the sun.
Put an end to the sorrows,

Bang bang, my baby shot me down.

Cliff Richard,"We turned water into wine but that didn't last
We were the victims of our age
Now we live on different floors
And go our separate ways
And talk behind closed doors
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

We used to sit around the fire
And whisper words the world outside would make no claim to hear
But now we talk an octave higher
In droning tones that don't relate at all to yester year
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

Do you remember when we were seventeen
We took a boat out for an hour
But we preferred the greenery to the scenery of the sea
And tied up in some cozy cove
Till harbour lights appeared across the bay

Into love and out of mind
A poet claimed that loving you has only made me blind
But love is really crystal clear
It's only when you need someone the clouds will soon appear
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

Do you remember when laughter was the cure
For all the hard times that we knew
But we forgot to feed the fire - let it all burn down
Warmth returns to cold and poison into pain
It's such a shame but who's to blame

On the night you began

Meant everything-the closest thing
That your heart ever had

But dreams change-change your heart
And interfere with your plans

The same heart-the same love
Are now out of my hands

When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say
Tha the real diamond ring
Didn't ever really mean a thing

When two hearts drift away
A lonely voice begins to say
There's no room for anyone
But you're thinking over what you've done

Well here you go-now you're free
Free to go where you please

But when you're free-all you hear
Is your lonely heart beat

When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say
Tha the real diamond ring
Didn't ever really mean a thing

When two hearts drift away
A lonely voice begins to say
There's no room for anyone
But you're thinking over what you've done

One lifetime say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning

You will curse the day you did not do

Cliff Richard,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

Cliff Richard,"Free to turn like the wind on a summer day
Heart worn, like a ring around the moon
And your eyes are ablaze, reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life than standing still

Or running from place to place in the heat of the day
Just follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life

There beyond the horizon, there's another day
Far above the pain and fear you feel
The power and the peace, the greatest sensation of all
There is much more to life than you'll ever know, the rise and fall

There'll always be you and me, we're moving as one
So follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life

We all have our dreams, we all have our visions
But time after time, we're faced with decisions
Which road to follow? How hard to fight?
Then you wake up and see that there's much more to life

Free in acres of sky on a summer day
Fire that burns with hope inside your heart
We are never apart, reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life

So just follow your heart and you'll see
If you follow your heart you'll be free
'Cause there's more to life, more to life",More to Life,2002

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...    Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore  Let me in or else I'll beat down your door  When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade  Said to myself ""you're on the wrong block""    Rushed out to your house with wings on my feet  Loved you like I'd never loved you my sweet  Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade  All of our days, two silhouettes on the shade    Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...

When it's early in the morning
Very, very early without warning
I can feel a newly born vibration
Sneaking up on me again
There's a songbird on my pillow
I can see the fun in weeping willow
I can see the sun
You're on your way
You'll be coming home

When it's early in the morning
Over by the windows day is dawning
When I feel the air
I feel that life is very good to me, you know
In the sun there's so much yellow
Something in the early morning meadow
Tells me that today you're on your way
And you'll be coming home

When it's early in the morning
Very, very early without warning
I can feel a newly born vibration
Sneaking up on me again...",Early in the Morning,2003
Cliff Richard,"Come rest you weary gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Lay down your swords and fight no more
For the sake of Christmas Day

A saviour came down to this earth
To show us everyone
How to live in harmony
Together under the sun

Beyond the dark horizon
Lies a far more bountiful land
Void of all starvation
For every woman and man.

so reach out from the wilderness
And pray to heaven above
A future lies in wait for us
A world united in love

We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
Peace on this earth

Through the valleys
Over the hills
Church bells echo their sound
Whispers travelling through the trees
Over the snow covered ground
Spread the message far and wide
So every one can hear
Home fires glow on angel wings
And banishes every tear

We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
Peace on this earth

Grant us .. one wish
No more .. pain or sorrow
Hear us .. help us
Build a new tomorrow

So reach out from the wilderness
And pray to heaven above
A future lies in wait for us
A world united in love

We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be

No more tears or pain at Christmas
No more children living in fear
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
One day there will be
One day there will be
Peace on this earth

Grant us .. our wish this Christmas

I lean on you and find
That you have got the strength
To get me through my day

You say, trust in me
I trusted you and so I found
The truth that set me free
And on my way

All that I am
And everything I'll ever be
Is because of you, because you're in my heart
And I'm dazzled by all that I see
By everything surrounding me
So come back, take me to where you are

Nothing I say, nothing I do
Could ever repay my debt I owe to you
You give and I receive
Here I stand, my head in a whirl
A little bit lost,
A little in awe of what you say
You have in store for me

All that I am and everything I'll ever be
Is because of you, because you're in my heart
And I'm dazzled by all that I see
By everything surrounding me
So come back, take me to where you are

Cliff Richard,"Looking at baby's face I saw the plight of the
Human race
Dying to survive
Shaken by the irony the anger rose inside of me
And would not, would not subside
I thought you're too young to understand
That the fate of every mortal man
Rests in someone's mortal hand tonight
In the nuclear insanity there's a death watch
On the land and sea
And I believe that we may never live our lives
We were born under the gun and just like
Every mother's son
We are hostage to the megaton and the world
Could die tonight
Under the gun, we live in fear that the end
Will come
But there's one place to run
Run to the son
Everyone can see that the hour is late
And every soul on earth got to demonstrate
Their loving if we're to survive
'Cause we're tired of living on the brink
Scared to death that our ship will sink
At the winking of an eye
This course we're on's a big mistake
'Cause we all lose in the nuclear race
It's time to show all the heads of state that we
Believe
Yes we believe that we're fighting for our lives
We were born under the gun and just like
Every mother's son
We are hostage to the megaton and the world
Could die tonight
Under the gun, we live in fear that the end
Will come

Run to the son

Cliff Richard,"Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Took a walk and passed your house late last night
 All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
 From within the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
 Oh what a lovely couple they made
 Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
 Kisses I could almost taste, in the night
 Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouettes on the shade
 I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
 ""Let me in or else I'll beat down your door""
 Saw two strangers who had been two silhouettes on the shade
 My heart skipped a beat I was on the wrong street
 Rushed down to your house with wings on my feet
 Loved you like I've never loved you my sweet
 Vowed that you and I would be, two silhouettes on the shade
 All of our days two silhouettes on the shade

Somewhere over the rainbow,
Way up high.
There's a land that I heard of,
Once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow,
Skies are blue.
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.
Someday I'll wish upon a star,
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops.
That's where you'll find me.
Somewhere over the rainbow,
Bluebirds fly.
They fly over the rainbow,
Why then - oh, why can't I?
I see trees of green, red roses too.
I watch them bloom for me and you.
And I think to myself,
What a wonderful world.
Well, I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white.
The brightness of day and light, darkness of night.
And I think to myself,
What a wonderful world.
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky,
Are also on the faces of people passin' by.
I see friends shakin' hands, saying ""How do you do!""
They're really sayin' ""I love you.""
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow.
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know.
And I think to myself,
What a wonderful world.
Someday I'll wish upon a star,
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops.

Cliff Richard,"My daddy had a 68 Camaro
When I was 16 he went out of town
There were car keys sitting on the pillow
Screaming out
""Come take a drive around""

From here to Linda's all the lights were yellow
Even though she said that we were through
When she saw me in my red Camaro
All she said was
""Let's see what she'll do""

What girl?
What tree?
What kerb?
What are you talking about?
I never left the house

What keys?
What crash?
How dare you ask! 
The car is gone, move on

Daddy you better move one

Monday morning he was in the kitchen
Asking if I had a tale to tell
A certain red collectable was missing
Sorry daddy
That does not ring a bell

Was very late but I agreed to join him
At the scene of the alleged theft
But there's an emptiness you can't ignore
When a stain of oil is
All that you have left

Even if they found the wreckage
Even if they hauled me in
I was sticking to the same old story
Again and again and again and again

The years have gone
There's a mark on the tree
I never could tell him
That I took the key

Who bust his Camaro

Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright
Beams of blue come flickering through my window pane
Like gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Moonlight used to bathe the contours of your face
While chestnut hair fell all around the pillow case
The fragrance of your body rests beneath my head
A sympathy bouquet left with the love that's dead

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Never thought the words you said were true
Never thought you said just what you meant
Never knew how much I needed you
Never thought you'd leave until you went

And evening brings the memories I can't forget
Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs
And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs

Nothing to eat, no books to read;
Making love with you has left me peaceful warm and tired,
What more could I ask
There's nothing left to be desired;
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak,
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep;
Some times, all I need is the air that I breathe

She looked an angel vision walking through the day

I took her to parties, bought her everything I could
I treated her just like a queen
I told her I loved her, marry her I said I would
Didn't realize just what a fool I've been

I met a girl once, she did me wrong behind the back
Then when I've found out I felt like my heart would crack
I met a girl once, she taught me what I had to learn
That if love's cruel, broken hearts are what you learn

Came tiptoing softly into my head.

And there she was smiling.

She'd toss her hair and tantalize.

So soft on my brow

Baby go to sleep now

Cliff Richard & the Shadows,"Ooh, well I got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rockin' she's the queen
We love to dance on a Saturday night
All alone where I can hold her tight
But she lives on the twentieth floor uptown
The elevator's broken down

So I walked one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight, more
Up on the twelfth I started to drag
Fifteenth floor I'm a-ready to sag
Get to the top, I'm too tired to rock

When she calls me up on the telephone
Say, come on over honey, I'm all alone
I said, baby you're mighty sweet
But I'm in bed with the achin' feet
This went on for a couple of days
But I couldn't stay away

Well they sent to Chicago for repairs
Till it's a-fixed I'm a-usin' the stairs
Hope they hurry up before it's too late
Want my baby too much to wait
All this climbin' is a-gettin' me down
They'll find my corpse draped over a rail
But I climbed one, two flight, three flight four",Twenty Flight Rock,1997

Why must you lead your heart and keep we two apart

We've just met
Just how lucky can one boy get
There's a light in your eye
I know it's love and I know that I could be happy
With a girl like you

Tell your mom tell your pa
And tell your favourite old wishing star
We're in love, just by chance
I asked you would like to dance
Fancy dancing with a girl like you
Funny how love can come to a lonely heart
I'm a boy, you're a girl I guess that's a pretty start

My arms were so lonely, lonesome and blue

Be true to her memory, she'll come back some day
And though there was no-one, nobody to see
A voice in the wilderness brought comfort to me

Why did you leave me, love made me blind
My darling forgive me, I yearn for your touch
Have pity, come back now, I need you so much

Oh, what a crazy party all the gang's here, too 
The beat is really jumping like a kangaroo 
I'm full of cherry soda and potato chips 
But now I want to get a taste of your sweet lips 

So, dim, dim the lights !! Dim, dim the lights
Dim, dim the lights !! Dim, dim the lights
Turn down the lights
I want some atmosphere !! 
The furniture is bouncing round the room with glee 
And rocking like a boat upon a stormy sea 
But, dig the crazy pockets on the pile tonight 
But still I haven't had a chance to hold you tight 

Look at Annie's earrings bouncing off her backs 
Look at Suzie kissing and a-hugging Jack 
Looking Nancy dancing in her stocking feet
We're all going crazy with the mambo beat !!! 
But, everybody's really having lots of fun 
But, honey as for me the night has just begun 
Cause now I want to tell you things and hold you tight

That if love's cruel, broken hearts are what you learn

The beauty that is Spring's

These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1956

I count my blessings instead of sheep

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",Lover Come Back to Me,2004

Just one of those crazy flings

Just one of those fabulous flights

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura (With Strings),2007
