Every night we have the battle to keep the girls from taking off
All their clothing, so don't go away, who knows, tonight we may
Lose the battle!

Joe Grushecky & The Houserockers,"Now if you wanna hear some boogie like I'm gonna play 
It's just an old piano and a knockout bass 
The drummer's man's a cat they call Charlie McCoy 
You know, remember that rubber-legged boy? 
Mama cookin' chicken fried and bacon grease 
Come on along boys it's just down the road apiece 
Well there's a place you really get your kicks 
It's open every night about twelve to six 
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill 
And shove and sting like an old steam drill 
Come on along you can lose your lead 
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece 
Well there's a place you really get your kicks 
It's open every night about twelve to six 
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill 
And shove and sting like an old steam drill 
Come on along you can lose your lead 
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece",Down the Road a Piece,1999
Joe Guy,"I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me
A vision fair I see
Again I seem to be

[Chorus]
Back home again in Indiana
And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight
Still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

Fancy paints on memory's canvas
Scenes that we hold dear
We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

[Chorus]",Indiana,1997
Joe Guy,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Joe Guy,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon,1998
Joe Guy,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good!",1998
Joe Guy,"Picture you upon my knee
Just tea for two
And two for tea
Just me for you
And you for me alone

Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear
That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and you'll awake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For me to take for all the boys to see
We will raise a family
A boy for you, a girl for me
Oh, can't you see how happy we would be",Tea for Two,2018
Joe Habad Texidor,"You ever want something

Joe Hamilton,"Baby, baby, fallin'' in love
I''m fallin'' in love again

I could never see 
What fate had meant for me
And then you came 
And made my dreams match reality
Maybe you can see 
All the things you''ve meant to me
And my simple fate is at the gate 
And, girl, you''ve got the key

It seems like yesterday 
You and I first loved this way
But now I know how love 
Can grow with each and every day
As we lay at midnight''s hour 
And feel love''s hidden power
So strong and bold 
As life unfolds its mystery to me

You and me for eternity 
In love will always be
Young and free and that should be 
The way it''s gotta be",Fallin' In Love,2003
Joe Harnell,"I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air,
I don't care! 
My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me! 
 
I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me

My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,",I Left My Heart in San Francisco,1963
Joe Harnell,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,1963
Joe Harnell,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere",
Joe Harnell,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind,
Joe Harnell,"I lost at love before,
Got mad and closed the door.
But you said try just once more.
I chose you for the one,
Now I'm having so much fun.
You treated me so kind,
I'm about to lose my mind.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

The others were untrue,
But when it came to lovin' you,
I'd spend my whole life with you.
'Cause you came and you took control,
You touched my very soul.
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

I love you so much, it seems
That you're even in my dreams.
I hear you calling me.
I'm so in love with you,
All I ever want to do is
Thank you, baby.

You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.
",You've Made Me So Very Happy,
Joe Harnell,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1963

Joe Harriott,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn,
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.
 

",Farewell Blues,1999
Joe Harriott,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends,2007
Joe Harriott,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,2007
Joe Harriott,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,2007

Joe Harriott,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?

Joe Harriott,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2007
Joe Harriott,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,2007
Joe Harriott,"While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to Daddy.

If I invite a boy some night

Joe Harriott,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,2007
Joe Harriott,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2007

You'll never know just how much I care

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer

Joe Harris,"I'm feelin' mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor an' watch the door
In between I drink
Black coffee â?¦

Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room.

Been talkin' to the shadows
One o'clock 'til four
An' Lord how slow the moments go
When all ya do is pour
Black coffee â?¦

Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry.

You know a man is born to love a woman
To work and slave to pay her debts
Just because he's only human
To drown his past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
Not much heart to fight
Black coffee ...

Feelin' low as the ground
I'm waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around.

Gonna drown my past regrets
In some coffee and a few cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee â?¦

Feeling low as the ground
It's driving me crazy!
Just waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around.
Please come around
Please come â?¦

Joe Harris,"Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
He'll build a little home

From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you
And so all else above

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1991

Every breeze took me higher

And so did the days
The flowered and faded
And it felt like the way
And it flew up behind me
Like good times they followed me

Awake in my bed
Alone with the clever
All the quick and the dead

I was watching you

Thinking how time hasn't changed
Even half what it promised to
You laughed and you turned
What I almost didn't see

When I felt him hit the bridge
At first I thought it was me
But I'll always keep you in my dreams
I'll always keep you in my dreams

And I was feeling brave
Pretending I might follow Joe

I want too much.
If you fall, then I confess,
Better you this time,
I want too much.

And even now, even now, even now,
I want no more, I want no more, 
And even now, even now,
I want no more, and I want too much.
I want too much.
I want too much.
I want too much.

Joe Henry,"Just think what a day's rain can do
A bridge once between us is lost,
I set it to sway
And now here I stay
Till it's cold enough to cross

I stand on the bank watching on
You wade in the flood and I'm lost,
You're calling my name
But I wait just the same
Till it's cold enough to cross

Just think what I know time will tell
What keeps me from you so lost,
It's not the water you wade
But that I wait afraid
Till it's cold enough to cross",Cold Enough to Cross,2001
Joe Henry,"Dear Marion, as I write this down
Dear Marion, I just make the bed then I need
To go lie down.
But baby knows that I love to cry
Over every little thing,
I just sweep the yard and wait
For the whole world to change
Any minute now

From across the room she mouths words
So I can see
Says, who's Edgar Bergen?
And I say, don't start with me..
But baby knows that I love to cry
Over every little thing,
I just sit up on her knee and wait
For the whole world to change
Any minute now

That bird of yours, he just bit me
And all I said was hello,
All I did was, I answered him
And sort of shook his foot, you know.
But baby knows that I love to cry
Over every little thing,
God knows, but even he must me waiting
For the whole world to change

You've got me now so I can't speak
I wonder how you turned out the stars
I hear your laugh

Like falling railway cars,
Far and away, peaking through the bars
Safe behind your own lock and key
Safe for now from me

And His roadhouse crew
Ran me out of town on a silver rail
Free at last and begging Him for jail",Lock and Key,2001

I look at you as the thing I wanted most
You look at me, and it's like you've seen a ghost
I wear the face
Of all this has cost
Everything you tried to keep away from me
Everything I took from you and lost (Repeat 2X)

Lights shine above me, they're like your eyes above the street
Lights shine below me, they're like stars beneath my feet
I stood on your shoulders
And I walked on my hands
You watched me while I tried to fall
You can't bear to watch me land (Repeat 2X)

Take me away, carry me like a dove
Take me away, carry me like a dove

Joe Henry,"Here's that rainy day
That you said was bound to come,
Funny? Now you took my hat
I can still feel it like it's on
Oh baby I wonder how
You ever learned to play so rough,
You left me with everything
Knowing it would never be enough

Now I remember? You told me so,
You're so rough and tumble, and now I know

I had a dream of you
And I'll tell you what I can
Your face was a brilliant mask
It came off in my hand
Oh baby I wonder how
You ever learned to play so rough
You left me with everything
Knowing it would never be enough

Now I remember?
I take my coffee now
At the window by the stove,
The afternoon is dark
As the shadows grow;
Oh baby I wonder how
You ever got so tough,
To leave me with everything
Knowing it would never be enough

Now I remember",Rough and Tumble,2001

A mark so fine, you barely see
You have one just like it, too
A twisting vine
A mark so fine

[Chorus: ]
'Cause I love you with all I am
And you love me because you are
As fearless as a twisting vine
A mark so fine
But still a scar

Fear plays dumb then eats the soul
Like a vagabond with a fishing pole
He whistles but he cannot sing
It's an awful tune

But very soon
I find that i am whistling, too
And your window is like a star
That I sit beneath like a vagabond
Who wears his fear
Just like a scar

The blade of our outrageous fortune
Like a parade, it cuts a path
Light shows on our foolish way
And darkness on
Our aftermath

If I love you, to save myself
And you love me because we are
So fool to think that our parade
Could leave a path
But not a scar

Tell me everything I'm not
But don't tell me to stop

Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time,
Let it fall by the way,
Leave me where I lay;
Tell the leaves not to turn
But don't tell me I'll learn,
Take the black off a crow
But don't tell me to go

Tell the bed not to lay
Like the mouth of a grave,
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf on its knees;

Joe Henry,"I've been having wicked thoughts
Terribly wicked, selfish and cruel
Imagining I stood high on a ledge
And fell just out of the reach of you

And then, we are together alone
As I fall, you look up?
Looking for all the world, like for once
It was you, not me, who had been struck

Should I love you more than I do?
Or pray to love you less
Or learn to live with the little you give
Believing it all for the best

Will I ever see your heart
Open wide and your eyes shut
Looking for all the world, like for once
It was you, not me, who had been struck

The trees are angry, toss in the wind
Devour small planes going by
Dropping wreckage, bags and gloves
Down around us where we lie

I hear your uneasy breath
As you stir, but don't wake up

It was you, not me, who had been struck
That had been struck...that had been struck...that had been struck",Struck,2001

How cruel you've become,
How so much like another
That its no surprise
That I don't recognize you now so
Beautiful and cruel

You're the meanest flower

You raise me off the ground
To see how far there is to fall,
As if I don't remember
How we passed the time,
As if I don't remember how
Your face fell into mine

Oh, you're the meanest flower

Notice how I vanish
And your world remains,
You show your head above it

Like you thought just living
Was somehow its own reward

Were awash with innocence
For a hushed sweet moment

Mine has been tamed; I'm shamed to pretend
When I'm this close to your animal skin

I remember when love was something I craved
But I settled for less and the comfort it gave,
For living is hard when real love begins
And it leaves heavy lines on your animal skin

Enclosing my world so I cannot see,

In dirty magazines.

We bust their heads, push and shove,

And say, ""look out below!""

Swear they won't forget but do,
It leaves them free to cry anew
At every song we know.

That'll do for now
The night has come and left me
Just the light that you allow

Come speak my name
Fill my head with, oh, such foolish dreams
My flesh and blood is no more real to me
Than what they seem

My love for you is burning
Like a spark on a fuse
I feel your mark upon me now
As surely as the hand that leaves a bruise

Life is for the living
And life comes hard for some
Well, the rest of us were flesh and blood
Make it hard all on our own

All I ever wanted
Was the freedom to refuse
Or something of my own to love enough
To hate to lose

The fever in my brain
Is leaving smoke behind my eyes
When the part of me that wants to change
Fights the part of me that tries

Now you see a gold light
'Cause I've turned the gold light on
Sometimes God knows
You've got to learn to shine, shine on your own

I stepped out of darkness and for a moment
I'm only living by your kiss
And just for now our flesh and blood
Is no more real to me than this

No more real to me than this
Aaa, than this

His pretty houseboys laugh and sing

Put your head between your knees, I'm
Falling for you

It's just to help me sleep,
It stops the tiny voices
And strange hours that they keep.
Who wants to hear them bleating on,
And have to answer too?
Better to be dumb when I'm
Falling for you

Joe Henry,"Thought that bell was in my dream,
All in my head,
Until the trucks were in the yard
And the fire was in my bed.
Oh, can you hear the ringing bell,
Telling time like time was to tell?
Can you see the smoke rise and curl
All the way from your side of my world?

Hush your talk, here comes the boss
Down off of his perch.
He walks the floor in cream-white shoes
Like we were piggin' iron in church.
Oh, can you hear the furnace hum
Above the shouts and all the chewing gum?
Hear the union priest lead the factory choir girls
Singing out to your side of my world?

I could dance when I was young
And I was pretty good,
I'd do all the tricks and such
But back then everybody could.

I should have seen how this would be,
But nothing's true till I've seen it on TV.
Yet there you were, in your high heels and curls
Coming in as big as life, from your side of my world.

Let's pretend we've never loved
Let's pretend our hands are clean,
Free of all the spit and shine
And the smell of gasoline.
Cause here come the planes and the tambourines,
The funeral march, and the beauty queens,
The circus freaks selling lemonade
From the back of an open-air motorcade.
Here come the heart machines and the baby shoes,
The ship-to-shore relay of the sporting news,
That mail-order brides --fake tits and pearls
All making way from your side of my world",Your Side of My World,2003
Joe Henry,"The carriage horses stamp and fume
Until all color's gone
They leave the street in black and white
And bring the eventing coming on

Lovers tug their way out of gloves
Out of shoes, and gray chiffon
The driver pulls his blanket high
And pretends to look beyond

Oh, pray for you, pray for me
Sing it like a song
Life is sort but by the grace of God
This night is long

Girls crowd into bathroom stalls
The boys smoke in their cars
The general, he's in civilian clothes
Standing at the bar

He waves at the deaf flower lady
""Come sit by me, sweetheart""
He draws a napkin battle plan
Says, ""This is where we start""

Oh, pray for you, pray for me
Sing it like a song
Life is sort but by the grace of God
This night is long

There are no more hummingbirds
Like there used to be
They're fat and slow and careless now
They've turned blue and mean

And the parrots sound like monkeys
Screamin' from the trees
As the decent people
Fumble for their keys

We used to spend the night in town
Down by City Hall
And the water works of Irish Beach
Just below the falls

We'd walk down to the Park Hotel
Past the Baptist Veteran's Mall
Back then, a man in uniform
Might mean anything at all

Oh, pray for you, pray for me
Sing it like a song
Life is short but by the grace or cruel
Heart of God, the night is long

Joe Henry,"I saw Willie Mays
At a Scotsdale Home Depot
Looking at Garage Door Springs
At the the far end of the 14th row

His wife stood there beside him
She was quiet and they both were proud
I gave them room but was close enough
That I heard him when he said out loud

This was my country
And this was my song
Somewhere in the middle there
Though it started badly and it's ending wrong

This was my country
This frightful and this angry land
But it's my right if the worst of it might still
Somehow make me a better man

The sun is unforgiving
And there's nobody who would choose this town
But we've squandered so much of our goodwill
That there's nowhere else will have us now

We're pushing line at the picture show
For cool air and a chance to see
A vision of ourselves portrayed
As younger and braver and humble and free

This was our country
This was our song
Somewhere in the middle there
Though it started badly and it's ending wrong

This was our country
This frightful and this angry land
But it's my right if the worst of it might still
Somehow make me a better man

I've started something I can't finish
And I barely leave the house, it's true
I keep a wrap on my sores and joints
But yes, I've had my blessings too

I've got my mother's pretty feet
And the factory keeps my house in shape
My children, they've both been paroled
And we get by on the piece we've made

I feel safe, so far from heaven
From towers and their ocean views
From here I see a future coming across
What soon will be beaches too

But that was him, I'm almost sure
The greatest centerfielder of all time
Stooped by the burden of endless dreams
His and yours and mine

He hooked each spring beneath his foot
He leaned over then he stood upright
Testing each against his weight
For one that had some play and some fight

He's just like us, I wanna tell him
And our needs are small enough
Something to slow a heavy door
Something to help us raise one up

And this was my country
This was my song
Somewhere in the middle there
Though it started badly and it's ending wrong

Well, this was God's country
This frightful and this angry land

Somehow make me a better man

Somehow make me a better man",Our Song,2007

Where's my other shoe?
I didn't know what time it was
When I came to

Is my flickering TV
Watching back at me
Oh, my love is here to stay

Saints alive
And all the saints be praised
I see them all around me now
They've been called and raised

Their jaws gone slack
Their yellow nails long and curling back
To scratch the phantom of ache
Of our lost days
Oh, my love is here to stay

I came home this morning
I was dead on my feet
Drunk on the victory
Of my own defeat

Now I'm reeling on the ceiling
But what yard bird law is this
When a heart in chains is what remains
The prelude to a kiss?

God is in the details
Of the smoke in the air
The devil, he's a pauper prince
Nesting in your hair

The things we put together
The world will ear a part
But I've beat them to the start
Alone the way

And fleeting as breath
And you move up behind me
And scare me to death

Where want becomes need

Where lust takes the toll

You stir within me
And scare me to death

Where lust takes the toll
Of a quick stolen breath
You stir within me
And scare me to death

A dose now
Of either heart or of mind
Can be lethal, it seems
If they're not combined

They show but contempt
When considered as two
And pretend that each
Is the other to you

Now you spit in your hands
And haul on the rope
And fill up my cup
With the worst kind of hope

You lift me with words
I haven't found yet
I fall like your shadow
And you scare me to death

And scare me to death
You sleep here beside me
And you scare me to death

If you fear the angels above while you sleep
Then I'll be the blood, you paint on your door
Your dream is a worry that nothing will keep

Your dream is a worry that nothing will keep

Setting fire to every house that’s in view
Lighting the ruin of my hope and my will
Till I’m like a shadow and I’m falling on you
Crawling on you, oh, you know how I do

So sleep here with me and I’ll keep you close

Hats flew up and everybody cheered,
But you turned as I guess someone spoke to you,
And in a sea of arms you disappeared.

I lived the life of a ragged soldier
The secretary to a rebel king,
He kept us drunk and hungry in a jungle
Tangled in the lilies of his scheme.

We gambled and we fought with one another
We had no code to give us unity,
Most died among us without God or honour
As blood became our faith and currency.

And all the while I kept your name beside me
I wrote it, but refused it on my tongue,
Believing you a song still there inside me

I feared your loss if ever it were sung.

I booked my passage home and stood in tears,
With a bag of apples and a forged passport

Appear among the living at your door,
Will you have a husband and some children?

Salt is sweet upon my mouth
And dark throws sparks against my house
The state of love is a smudge on my brow
But you see through me and you can't fail me now
When you see right through me, you can't fail me now

I've bit off more than I can chew
It's something that I tend to do
When fewer words are what we need and how
Oh, you bite my tongue and you can't fail me now
I rant and rail but you can't fail me now

I've lost the thread among the vines
And hung myself in storylines
That tell the tales I never would allow
God knows the name of every bird
That fills my mind like angry words
But you know all my secret heart avows

Joe Henry,"There's a suit on my frame like a shadow of birds
Stitched all together by a murmur of words
That hang like a moon in the thread of the air
And speak with the sound of my every prayer

There's a light at the end of the evenings that bring
A fire that only such hour can sing
It slips off the tongue in the trees going bare
That lean in to hear your every prayer

The past is a dark foreign country that calls
That you whisper regret into the cracks of its walls
That rise at the border of love and despair
And fall when they've heard our every prayer

An old woman stands up in a boat with a fan
Signals the shore with a wave of her hand
To a town disappeared and a boy unaware
That he wades into reeds with her every prayer

Now there's a cut on my cheek that I can't leave alone
I reach it to find just how close to the bone
Does my skin and my blood allow me to dare
To live in the word of my every prayer?

My every prayer

Joe Henry,"Oh this is my favorite cage
It grows up around me like silver strands
Of briar and roses, wisdom and rage
To cradle my heart like a bird in your hand
Of briar and roses, wisdom and rage
This is my favorite cage
It grows up around me like silver strands
And cradles my heart like a bird in your hand

This is a beautiful war to be sure
A surrendering hero's name will be sung
Or scratched in the sand like some secret cure
When all else has failed and the battle feared won
Scratched in the sand like some secret cure
This is a beautiful war to be sure
A surrendering hero's name will be sung

When all else has failed and the battle feared won

This is a star more perfect than peace
A flash in the dark setting fire to trees
Wresting my faith down out of the eaves
Bending my will back up on its knees

This is loveliest tumble from grace
Into the arms of what is unbound
From gravity's rule by a glimpse of your face
It sets to falling what will never touch ground
From gravity's rule by a glimpse of your face
This is loveliest tumble from grace
Into the arms of what is unbound
You set me to falling and I never touch ground",This Is My Favorite Cage,2009
Joe Henry,"I clawed at your skirt like it was a dirt floor
And I could dig my way free of myself taking more
But prisoners know nothing of victory at war
Let's a call it a truce for now

Georgia looks covered in blood from the air
Where the clay and river fight and run as a pair
And women comb bramble and stones from their hair
Let's call it a truce for now

True revelation is a thug and it comes
With narrow gray eyes not the rolling of drums
It may take your hand but it's seeking your thumbs
And we'll call it a truce for now

Let's a call it a truce for now

Joe Henry,"Absence makes the heart grow fonder
And the mind begins to wander back
to happier days.

I guess you'd say you were taken for granted
I went on and on and I raved and I ranted,oh--
My tyrannical ways.

Bridge 1
But now things are different,
Cause now you are gone,
I'm not so sure
I can carry on.

Always knew you were important to me
But now I know you are a necessity, otherwise--
I start to go insane.

Things weren't easy when we were together,
We had plenty of days of lousy weather
I'm in a hurricane.


Bridge 2
I'm gonna grieve,
I'm gonna moan.
Cause you're not here,
I'm all alone.

The joke's on me
You get the last laugh
I found out the hard way you was my better half, and now-
I'm the worse for the wear.

When I see you again expect some champagne wine,
On Valentine's Day expect a valentine
Cause now I know
How much I care.

How much I care.

You speak out all you feel is defiance
All you need is some self-reliance
Cuz this world is gonna always try us
And all you wanted was to run for cover
Well here's looking to yourself and no other 
We're all searching for that special something 
And we keep on running

We all have the choice to take the lead or follow 
I want to feel the light shine on me

You're so afraid of what people might say 
But that's okay cuz you're only human 
You're so afraid of what people might say 
But that's okay you'll soon get strong enough 
You're so afraid of what people might say 
But that's okay cuz you're only human 
You're so afraid of what people might say you're going to break so please don't do it

You wanna spread your wings but you're not sure 
Don't wanna leave your comforts 
Wanna find a cure 
We're afraid of who we see in the mirror 
We wanna let go but it feels too pure 
Who wants to be alone in this world 
You look around and all you see is hurt 
But the light it always guides us 
If we move with a little trust

A diamond don't define what shine is
I don't need a Rolex to know what the time is 
You got yours let me find what mine in 
I'm a survivor look how strong my mind is 
I stand on my own it's all me

Joe Hicks,"Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could die

Honestly what will become of me
I don´t like reality
It´s way too clear to me
But really life is daily
We are what we don´t see
We missed everything daydreaming

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end

Traveling I always stop at exits
Wondering if I´ll stay
Young and restless
Living this way I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets it and I don´t cry
I only feel gravity and I wonder why

And the sun was wondering if it should stay away for a day until the feeling went away
And the clouds were dropping and the...

Laugh now, cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average player hater and spectators
Buy my CD twice, they see me in the streets
They be like, ""Yo he nice, but that's on the low though""
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort 'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range, nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
'Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz, thinking 'bout
All the planes we flew, bitches we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at 'cha
Blood rushin', concussions ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out fronting, smoking something
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TV's, a system
Knocking Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard your shit, 'fore I stick you for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, long kiss

This might be the night (Kiss your ass goodbye)

Niggas playing they hands wrong, that's why they won't last long
Finessed what I was dealt with from the day I was born
While you bent up on that corner, niggas plotting and scheming
Huggin' them little hoes, be creeping with MAC demons
Niggas know not to fuck with my dough
Niggas know not to fuck with this little bro, I'm 10 seconds hit'n'go
Black mask, black truck, chrome rims, Chuk' Timbs
Enough to confuse any witness
Strongest of calibers, is what we only travel with
You gotta get hit, your man dead, so you gotta handle this
Extort y'all, once friends, now we gotta cross y'all
You know the niggas with the biggest balls set the new laws
And flip fours, have 'em washing drawers while you up North
Gat to your jugular, getting your salad tossed
Overhearing niggas situations, singing like Lou Rawls
Sitting on the stand with no remorse

Y'all can't see this

Yo, yo, how we do niggas, I don't beef, I shoot niggas
If I can't get the main character, a few niggas then
I don't need no gin to boost me
I got enough steam to blow, somebody gotta go
I got fire in my heart, guns in my car
Cash in my Carhartts, it ain't hard to get 'em
Like blaow when I hit 'em, the nigga shit his drawers
When the 40-pound hit him, the fuck these niggas thought?
Could it be the fame, maybe it's the 2 Benz or
Would it be the same if I couldn't claim those?
Fuckin' put holes through your Range Rove'
Cocksucker, beat it, while you bleedin' on the dashboard
Niggas get, what they hand call for, I'm gettin' rich
You get deaded, I get erections over revenge, kid
You get a quiet spot in the shade for a grave
I'll lay a nigga down and steam roll away

Journey Through the life of some real niggas
Some real niggas, You'll never see what I've seen

When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood
Naked bitches, dead nigga's ghost, Feds with toast 
Knockin' my door down sweat poor down my body 
Roast from the heat so I soak my sheets
Wake up shiverin', pull my hoe close to me, she sexy
Every night is different pussy since my girl left me
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me
I reminisce how I miss a stare in this space
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face
Lampin' in a mansion, home alone
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics
I hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits
If nigga's try to rob me then I won't hear it
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now
Missin' all the blocks cuz I'm surrounded by woods now
It's supposed to be good now
It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down
Fire below me
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress
Models with fat ass and big breasts
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets
Millionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the MTV diva
Nas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive)
East vs. West the rap game where words became flesh
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress
Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect
Feel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax
Tell me if you feelin' that

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder
Through the rain and the pain and the thunder
By the time that you realized that it's goin' down
You may find yourself going underground
When they see that this life is upon us
We would see that there's no one that we can trust

You can never see what I see, motherfucker
Beanie Sigel, the realest nigga from the streets was taught
Stay cased up nigga, stay deep in court
Reminiscin' on that cold cell, deep in thought
Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it
Streached up in hospital beds, fed fluid
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it
My life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap
Upstate the case niggas slice your throat
Wear your boxers in the shower when you gaurd your soap
I done seen the biggest nigga's in the yard get broke
I done took blocks through war, took blocks for fall
Took blocks to Wall for box of raw
What you think 33 in the glock is for?
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars, 
C4, block your doors, nigga's can't stop this war
I show you faggots what this Swatz' is for
Hidding spots in the door for the glocks is for
Read the papers, '94 I took the cops to war
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie
Only reason you switchin' up your droid is cause you keep gettin' robbed
I looked that nigga in the eyes before I send him to God
Beanie Sigel, desert eagle, the realest nigga alive

The Bible has words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats
I speak all my life under oath
Since a kid, troublesome
Thrownin' shit at little girls jump ropes
Bustin' B-B Guns at stray cats, that was way back 
Watched it die, covered in flies
Then I picked up a stick, try to dig in it's eyes
Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit
I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals
With heroin habits they picked up from the penile
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile
Lifestlyes of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch
I got a pine box just your size, I know it'll fit
Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen
Kill yourself, come back as a man over again
Cause in this lifetime I'm reignin', slay men
Leave your whole body cold
Your nails grow long, you get gray skin
May this nigga rest in peace, Amen
I run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'
Names engraved in the pavement
Brick building, grown ladies jump off the roof
Nigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth
New York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga

Taking flicks around the corner

Like a potato, she got five-oh on the payroll

Caught 'em in the 'gator shoes his girl probably bought 'em
Too bad, Black ain't get the chance to extort him
'Cause niggas like that don't deserve to live

Saying tonight's the night, Black Rob, let's write these hits
In the halls of death, you get left, I'm in the top 10
Even Rocky trainer and his wife said you can't win
Scream battle, but you never fought
That's like me sayin' I got five, never ran a full court
Stab the devil in his belly, took his Pelle Pelle
Blew the spot down and slid straight to the tele
I see envious eyes, envious guys, different states
Mad we seen 'em, different cake
Rob me, tear that asshole out of place

You say I move drugs, cuz my shit is unplugged
Everywhere I go, results hound our love
Black unbless them like the heavens up above
Catch me in the new wave carriage with Sinbad and Etro
The nigga is growin' H20
Got beef so I'm taking it slow, making it grow
Right now my main concern is making it blow
Guns and ammo, man, yo, you gots to understand, yo
I'm not the one that hit them with the banjo
Here y'all is, bringing my fingerprints
Up in them camaras and shit like I was ??
Ask her if she seen my face
Look- I was out of town getting cake with Moore and Little Jacob
Wasn't even out here in New York State
Trying to play me like a goat, like my name was Scape

Kick the door in, I find Satan
From up top, bullets soaring, but I fake 'em
I'm hard to hit, Spanish speaking chick that constantly
And Mafia connections, chopping niggas, it's hard to get
Hit me with the 411, and the gun
And the nigga hit me low, transfered funds from Big Pun
Conversation, job well done
Fuck this lifestyle now, shit, y'all do it all for fun
Rippin' the frames, got at least 20 different names
Know at least 20 different games with different lames

Seven numbers, told Harve to call Puffy
Say they got his man locked down in six-ten
Gotta get him out, not now but right now
Catch him when they shift him when they open the yard
Hurry up, before these six rounds smokin' the guard
On the humble, I'ma just wait for y'all to come through
Creat a diversion for me, I start a rumble
Holdin' me, they ain't even take my flicks
Got on Simmy's, they ain't even take my shit
Got my jewels, lend 'em right, them a be fools
On the sneak out, the peek out, had two left shoes
I'ma freak 'em, through the front gate, on administrations

Straight up out a crystal face, like I'm Jason

Its time to eat most definitely
Grab ya plate
Get ya knives and ya forks yea
Keith Murray Get ready

Yo as I look out at the high rise
And right about my life into the sunrise
Lookin' at the smoke where the twin towers stood
Forty blocks away forty stories high I could see it good
But we been at war and under attack
We got P.O.W.s fightin' to get back in jail
And these affected by the poverty war
We pack gats frontline and will endure
I go to bed with god and wake up with the devil
In a battle I blacked out and beat a man with a shovel
Its obligatory that you hear my side of the story
He had the face a fear, shakin' like a leaf on a tree
You just another potential casualty
This is a walkin' corpse song and the beat is your conspiracy theory
And the time is getting more scary
So pack when necessary and say your L.O.D. Hail Marys

Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay

Yo I'm eye of a tiger inside the head of a liar
Give 'em pure hell brimstone and fire
This is MC cannibalism by connoisseur
From the lyrical lexicon matador of metaphor
Yo from the little voice in my conscience
I might just leave your fuckin' ass unconscious
Yea I seen you wit with that smirk on
You little fuckin' clown I turn that smile into an upside down frown
Produce chaos in the culture of the enemy
You will never posses the skills to defeat me
I be the all eye seein' you hear it sporadic
I rhyme at will be on your ass automatic
With thoughts of power I rain thunder showers
I eat a lot of brain food and you'll get devoured
Man hunt chase of the night stalker off da leash walker
My dog is a fire barker

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Yo from the instinctual coming of the insect
To the mind of a genius and the heart of a prophet
To them bootlegged niggas and the chicks that cop it
Ask anyone they know how the fuck drop it
And coastin' constant motion essential
With fusion nuclear potential
You hear a cold whisper you see da mask of a phantom acts wailin'
Deranged assailant
I tame the rage, isolate, chase and kill my prey
Walk the lion outta da cage
And that's a part of life or should I say death
Reach in your mouth snatch out ya very last breath
Searchin' my subconscious for the meaning
I'm sweatin' blood bullets cause my whole world is bleedin'
Ooh now check how I come at you
I will eat you defeat you I'm parasitical

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this mornin'
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here

Just because you woke up this mornin'

But it seems like all I brought you is tears
I tried to eliminate all of your fears but it's conflict
Yeah, check it out, uh, yo

Aiyyo, the game keep callin', niggaz in the streets is ballin'
Tryin' to creep just to keep from fallin'
But the block keep hollerin', yellin' my government name
I tried to stop but the love of the game

They got my girl in a frenzy, my niggaz used to be friendly
'Til they seen me and Puff in the Bentley
Now, forced to stay, forces use force and spray
Coffins lay when I'm forced to play

Like an animal, dawg, if I put my hand on you
I'ma handle you, like I'm Hannibal, the motherfuckin' cannibal
All plans is through, dreams and goals
The block hot but why this shit seem so cold

This shit seems so old, tryna redeem my soul
The Feds roll and my team done fold
Like a bad hand of poker, even ya man'll smoke ya
For these crushed up leaves of coca, now

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Yo, check it out
It's been four years and you ain't shed no tears
And through the course of that, I lost four pairs
That's why I smoke more blunts, drink more beers
You never consider it, like you just don't care

The pain I feel inside, you just don't share
When I share my deepest thought, you just don't hear
Well aware of my fears of me losin' my life
I'm well aware of my fears of me losin' my wife

That's why I stay usin' my gun and usin' my knife
Gotta deal with this shit 'til my music get right
I buy you pretty things just to see you wear it
You sayin' I ain't shit, tryna break my spirit

I try to change my life but you just don't hear it
Guess I gotta find another girl to spend four years with
Damn, all that time got wasted but I guess I gotta face it

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Even though I know they wanna be like me

Twizzy gettin' busy with wifey, gettin' head on the highway

I'm gettin' money to fly away
Pull me over just to fuck up my Friday
What could I say? Nothin', still they be frontin'
Throw a brick in the trunk and try to make up somethin'

But I'm not with the bullshit, that's why I roll with a full clip
Flint cock the hammer and pull quick
Don't care about your uniform or that bullshit you be on
Now who gon' really mourn when you be gone?

One in your head like a unicorn
You movin' on, your favorite suit is on
Moms singin' that stupid song, ""My baby ain't blast nobody""
But he still got smoked at Bay Bay's party, that's why

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do
I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Joe Howard,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1956

I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Do I try to feel the same as I feel when we're apart?

Anyone can be so hard hearted

But everyone 
Still everybody wants a happy ending",Happy Ending,1984

So hard for me to find
How can I change my mind
If you can only lie?
These shattered dreams
I try to build again
But looks could kill again
And I'm too young to die

[Chorus]
Smiling faces all around us
You don't want to make a scene
Not here, not now
And I don't want to cry

We drink the wine
Like we were really friends
But can our sadness end
And words turn into play?
We dress so fine
And step out on the town
And friends may gather round
But soon will turn away

Joe Jackson,"Did you do me right?
Did I do right by you?
When I bared my soul it seems you did not hear
Can this be true?
Am I fool to fight?
I could do just what you say
But I'm following my heart and that takes me another way
It's not easy when there's no one one giving prizes at the end
Waiting in the wings
Wishing that the band would start to play
As the show begins
Wonder what the critics have to say
Waiting
Waiting
For the verdict
Some people live so fast
They're so scared of getting old
Some people keep on working 
All they do is line their graves with gold
We don''t know what happens when we die
We only know we die too soon
But we have to try or else our world becomes a waiting room
Would you testify for me?
I think I'd do the same for you

Waiting for the phone to ring all day
My witness disappears
Wonder what the jury has to say

Lights that shimmer on canals

Hey come over here I'll treat you right)

'Cause . . .
A man's a man all right
Just like any other man

Street food sizzling outside
Washed down with the local poison

These back alleys with their pinkish lights
And the occasional cries
Of smugglers, bums and credit card holders . . .
(Hey babe I feel so good tonight

I got shore leave and I sure ain't leavin' here till I prove that . . .)

Joe Jackson,"Here in berlin - people line up to get in
To wait for the end - living in glorious sin
They've looked around - and now there is no looking back
To when rivers ran red - now it's the sky that grows black

Shadows are cast as two giants roam over the earth
We light a match - but what is that little flame worth
Once allies danced and sang
But it was forty years ago

Here in d.c. - they talk about 'euro-disease'
And how the french are always so damn hard to please
Otions are passed in brussels but no one agrees

And no one walks tall - but no-one gets down on their knees
Once allies laughed and drank
But it was forty years ago
Where I come from

They don't like Americans much
They think they're so loud, so tasteless, and so out of touch
Stiff upper lips are curled into permanent sneers

That I was born at seventeen

They'd always been 

And now I plough through piles 
Of bills, receipts and credit cards 
And tickets and the Daily News 
And sometimes I just . . .

Though I know it'll never be the same 
Back to my home town 
'Cause it's been so long 

And I'm wondering if it's still there 
We think we're pretty smart 
Us city slickers get around 
And when the going's rough 

We kill the pain and relocate 
We're never married 
Never faithful not to any town 
But we never leave the past behind 

We just accumulate 
So sometimes when the music stops 
I seem to hear a distant sound 
Of waves and seagulls

Football crowds and church bells 
And I . . .
want to go back to my home town 
Though I know it'll never be the same

But something's wrong

It's not the same
I'm lonely and I'd start again
If I had the time
Precious time

But I don't ask much
Just to keep in touch
And waste a little of your precious time
Waste a little of your precious time

A million dollars never justified a million lies
To jockey for position
And if two hearts can't beat as one
How can a million souls survive

In this world of suspicion
I heard somebody say
I dream about my wedding day
Through lonely nights

I dream of you

I'd find him if I had the time

And there's still hope as the sun rises over the Rio Grande

To a pork pie hat

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?

Sometime when it always seemed
To be just us and them

And boys that wore blue
Boys that always grew up better men

Is he rough or is he rugged
Is he cultural and clean
Now it's all change, it's got to change more
Cause we think it's getting better
But nobody's really sure

And so it goes, go round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are

See the nice boys, dancing in pairs
Golden earring golden tan
Blow-wave in the hair
Sure they're all straight, straight as a line
All the gays are macho
Can't you see their leather shine

You don't want to sound dumb, don't want to offend
So don't call me a fagot
Not unless you are a friend
Then if you're tall and handsome and strong
You can wear the uniform and I could play along

And so it goes, go round again

Time to get scared, time to change plan
Don't know how to treat a lady
Don't know how to be a man
Time to admit, what you call defeat
Cause there's women running past you now
And you just drag your feet

Man makes a gun, man goes to war
Man can kill and man can drink
And man can take a whore

It's just too much for me to do (struggle through)
Especially without you
Please come home
Honey, please come home
I read the morning paper
But it all changes by the evening news
The world got so much smaller
I don't know which piece of it to choose
I'd like to fight apartheid
Wish that I could fight the guy upstairs
I'd solve a dozen cases
If only there weren't so many clues
So many clues
What shall we do this evening
Send out for some sushi and champagne
Stay in and watch TV
50 channels can't all be the same
Maybe go to a movie
50 films on 50 tiny screens
They say that choice is freedom
I'm so free it's driving me insane
And you know why ... it's all too much
It's all too much for me to stand
So much supply and no demand
There's just too much to struggle through
Especially without you
Please come home
Honey, please come home
I'd like to get to know
All the many people I could be
If I just had the time
I'm sure I could find out which one is me
Maybe I need religion
Or meditation 'til I disappear
They say that choice is freedom
I'm so free I'm stuck in therapy
And you know why... it's all too much
It's all too much for me to take
Try to be real, feel like a fake
It's just too much to follow through
Especially without you

Honey, please come home
Won't you please come home?",It's All Too Much,1991

Joe Jackson,"Moving my car forward a foot at a time
Another red light, another warning sign
Is that rain on the windshield?
Wonder if it's raining on the Jersey side
Tapping my fingers to the radio
But I don't hear a thing
Watching the hookers move in and out of the light
One of these days, one of these days...
One of these days
I'm gonna smash somebody's car
And smash the copper's face
As they take me away
But I gotta go home now
(Don't want to go to my house)
I gotta go home now
(Don't want to go to my house)
Only forty minutes to the Jersey side
Me and Suzy used to read the news and stay up all night
We used to see a lot of people then we just got tired
And gave birth to a perfect little alibi
I take a sip of diet soda and loosen my tie
Another red light, another warning sign
Hey, that Puerto Rican hooker must be six feet tall
One of these days, one of these days...
One of these days
I'm gonna turn the car around
And keep on going
Till I lose track of time...

Joe Jackson,"There was a man in the jungle
Trying to make ends meet
Found himself one day with an axe in his hand
When a voice said ""Buddy can you spare that tree
We gotta save this world-starting with your land.""
It was a rock 'n' roll millionaire from the USA
Doing three to the gallon in a big white car
And he sang and he sang 'till he polluted the air
And he blew a lot of smoke from a Cuban cigar
And the stars are looking down
Through a hole in the sky
And if they can see, they cry
That's obvious
And the walls are coming down
Between the west and the east
You don't have to be a hippie to believe in peace
That's obvious...obvious
There was a kid in the city selling crack to get by
Got caught one day with a gun in his hand
When a voice said, ""OK, get'em up in the air
You're too young to live like this
But you ain't too fast to die.""
Just another foot-soldier in a stupid little war
Another sound-bite on the American scene
Caught between the supplier only dreaming of money
And the demand of the man with the money
Who needs a little help to dream
So we starve all the teachers
And recruit more marines
How come we don't even know what that means
It's obvious
And the walls are coming down
Between the eagle and the dove

Oh well

Now, when I talked to God I knew he'd understand

But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to""

Joe Jackson,"There goes another one
Another happy couple on the road to emptiness
I think of my father and mother
Can they imagine how two people can get in this mess
But the old songs say - love's forever
And the old songs never say die
But a song can't keep us together
How can that beautiful song be a lie
Me I blame the old songs
Filling hearts with rebellion and romance
Our book of revelations
And all we had to do was dance
Play us another one
Play us the hopes and dreams of twenty years ago
They're all over the bloody radio
It's like they're telling us there's nowhere left to go
And the old songs say - ""be my baby""
And the old songs say - ""she loves you""
All the songs we'll sing come what may be

But I'd like something new

Guess we can talk at least

Imagine the things we'd do

I know that those days are over,
I'm glad that those games are won
The winners ride off into the sunset
But it's not the same for you

And I don't wanna play those nasty games that adults play
But I don't want to let you go, and I can't see another way

And I know that she's the only one for me
And you know that if I could split in two

The other me
Would stay all night

The other me
Would hold you tight

The other me
Would be the only one for you

It almost breaks my heart
But it doesn't break enough
For me to break my whole life apart

Guess we can still be friends
And we can talk all night
But I have to bite my tongue
And sometimes words don't come out right

We're old enough to know what we can't think or say out loud
To know that hearts are not just cards to play when two's a crowd

And I know that she's the only one for me
And you know that if I could split in two

The other me
Would stay all night

The other me
Would hold you tight

The one who's drinking another glass
There's a look in his eye
That I've seen so many times in the past
I've seen it in the mirror
And I've seen it in my friends
When we realize we've lost ourselves
And we try to make amends
He'll drink another two or three
And the room will start to spin
Then he'll try to let the feelings show
But he'll find he can't give in

""I'll tell the whole class if I see you""
You remember what your mother said
Remember what your mother said

From something that they can't cure yet

You make me feel like a fool
For wanting you to stay
But I'm a busy guy
A lot of things to do
But there's a reason why
Some of them just seem to lose their flavor

I feel like death warmed up
I can't taste the coffee in my cup
I feel so low I'm underground
Every time you're not around

And if I didn't feel so high
And if I didn't feel so proud

But I'm lost
Thinking of you
And the ghosts

Of so many special moments
That passed so quickly at the time
And now they come and track me down
And echo round and round and round

And time goes quickly
Or disappears completely
And I feel like I fade away
Like drowning

I don't need you
But it's so hard
To be without you
Though you're not far away

I censor my emotions
And tell myself to bide my time
But every time you come around
You batter my defenses down

But so gently
Like some sweet hypnosis
And the world just slips away
I'm drowning

It's dark
My heart is pounding
I'm sinking down
Into a pool of passion

There's laughter as I drown
Like so many lost before me
Damned by lust and gone to hell
And then I look into your eyes

And something melts
I shake inside
And cool water
Washes me all over

Washes me away
And still I'm drowning",Drowning,1991

It's three in the morning in the pouring rain

So we fight but we fight every evening
And I tell you every morning I just love her more
And life goes on, filled with disasters and friction

And life can be strange
But love can be stranger than fiction
Only love can be stranger than fiction
Excuse me operator, tell me what time it is

I think I strained a muscle
I didn't know I had
And tell me what day it is anyway

Love her so much I wish she'd just go away

And life can be strange
But love can be stranger than fiction
Only love can be stranger than fiction
I know that sometimes love goes

But sometimes it comes back to getcha

But every thing's changed
Words in your hand

Or throw them away

Like photographs that always moved

And all of the pain

Why don't I cry

Though nothing has changed
And everything we said
Is there on a tape
For the future to play

Tired of trying to be strong
When I should be crying
The further I go the less distance I see

Joe Jackson,"Shall I stay or go 
Through the door
Will the pen to flow
Watch the stars
Sleep's a chore
The moon is growing cold 
It hangs like a sliver of tin

And why are my bones feeling thin
I watch my pen as though
My fingers could shatter like icicles
And before my eyes
Lie glittering and useless on a field of snow",Lullaby,1994
Joe Jackson,"It happened one night
At three in the morning
The devil appeared in my studio room
And he said I'm your pal
And I'll make you a deal
Blow away your struggle
And I'll take your soul for a toy

After rubbing my eyes
I looked all around me
At the half-finished drivel I'd worked on for days
And I told him my dream
Was to live for all time
In some perfect refrain
Like the man who wrote Danny Boy

And I said if you're real, then I'll ask you a question
While most of us turn into ashes or dust
Just you and that other guy go on forever
But who writes the history
And who do I trust?

He gave me a wink
And he said it was funny
How mortals would pour all their blood, sweat and tears
Onto tape, onto paper
Or into the air
To be lost and forgotten
Outside of his kind employ

Then I thought I could hear a great sound in the distance
Of whiskey-soaked singing
And laughter and cheers
And they're saying, that song could bring tears to a glass eye
So pass me the papers, I'll sign them in blood
And the smell of the brimstone was turned into greasepaint
And the roar of the crowd like the furies of hell
And I hear the applause and I hear the bells ringing
And the sound of a woman's voice from the next room

Saying come to me now
Come lay down beside me
Whatever you're doing you're too gone to see
You can't hold onto shadows, no more than to years
So be glad for the pleasures
We're young enough to enjoy

So maybe I'm drunk
Or maybe a liar
Or maybe we're all living inside a dream
You can say what you like
When I'm gone, then you'll see
I'll be down in the dark
Down underground
With Shakespeare and Bach
And the man who wrote Danny Boy",The Man Who Wrote Danny Boy,1994
Joe Jackson,"Somethings coming, something big
Something I can't stand
Dark as the ocean, secret and cruel
Something I can't command
Somethings waiting down a muggers' alley
To see what's on my mind
Take a deep breath, start walking faster
It's dark, but I'm not blind
You never know, if I push at this wall
My hand could pass through
So, this cloud of unknowing
Could disappear too
It's only the future",Only The Future,1994
Joe Jackson,"I'm sinking in
To a sea of secrets
Warm and green
Down and down
Back to times and places never seen
Now and then
I can wake and I remember
Just one secret thing
Through the rain
I can keep a candle burning
Under the skin of the world
It's sinking in
No need for fear of drowning
Drift away
These monsters here
Are only faces I don't wear by day
Now and then
I can wake, and in the mirror
Demons turn to friends
Through the pain
I can dig a little deeper
Under the skin of the world",Sea of Secrets,1994
Joe Jackson,"The first time I saw you standing in the water
You must have been all of a thousand feet tall
Nearly naked - unashamed like Herod's daughter

Since I climbed your torso
Oh!
My statue of Liberty
Boo Boo
Impaled on your hair
What do you do
Do Do to me

A billion lovers with their cameras
Snap to look and in my fantasy
I sail beneath your skirt",Statue of Liberty,1995

I'm, good looking and bright
I want to see life after ten at night

So if they ask you where I am
I'm in the back of a transit van
In a squat on the earls court road
Gone down to London turning coal into gold
Down to London, down to London
Gone down to London to be the king

Hey, what's your name
The boys back home all seem to look the same
You, should stick with me
And one of us will make it, just you see

Stop, what's that sound
Seems like the sixties are still swinging around
Hey, can you hear me back there
Or is there anybody left to care

So if you ask me where they are
They're hanging tough in a Soho bar
Playing guitars in the underground
Gone down to London trying to chase that sound
Down to London, down to London
Gone down to London to be the king

So I ask you should I cry or laugh

A leather jacket against the cold

Hey chicken
Is that your girl?
Bet she lays like a lump
What's your poison - lemonade?
Velveteen or a razor blade?
You wanna walk in the dark with me
To a place where no-one sees?
Kiss the glove
Pretty please
You wanna pray?
On your knees 
What did you call me?

Claritate radiosa, stella matutina,
Brevitate legis glossa, perte lex divina

Venustate vernans rosa, sine culpe spina
Caritate viscerosa aurem buc inclina,

So I'll wear it just from a to be but not on saturdays

Should my jacket have three buttons? - am I out of style with two?
Is my hair too long? - 'cause I think I feel a change
I guess I should be ready for it, I look younger than my age
And I think there's something stirring in the corner of the page
Of the nme - and I let them lead the way

To cut your throat and run

You think I'm rich, you think I'm free
You wanna change your place with me
Be a leader then the blind can lead the blind
Happens all the time

Can't you understand . . .
Enough is not enough, it's not enough . . .
It's not enough

I've been filled with culture, I've been filled with lies
And compliments from people I despise
Shake my hand and sing along
Always getting one line wrong
Shout for more when I know I just died
Died . . .

Can't you understand . . .
Enough is not enough, it's not enough . . .
It's not enough

So - when I think I know my way around
I'm gonna take a bus to the other side of town
I'm gonna stay out all night long
Gonna sing some strange new song
Lose myself and hope I don't get found
Don't ask me how

Can't you understand . . .
Enough is not enough, it's not enough . . .
It's not enough
",Enough Is Not Enough,2001
Joe Jackson,"Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window I'm staring while my coffee grows cold
Look over there! (Where?)
There's a lady that I used to know
She's married now, or engaged, or something, so I am told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me,
There's something going wrong around here

Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street.
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there! (Where?)
Here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much
If so, there goes your proof

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me,
There's something going wrong around here

But if looks could kill
There's a man there who's more down as dead.
Cause I've had my fill
Listen you, take your hands off her head
I get so mean around this scene

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me,
There's something going wrong around here",Is She Really Going Out With Him,2001

You had a scowl like a Klingon beauty queen

And a body that sometimes disobeys

Joe Jackson,"I've got some walls around me, too
But they're not much compared to your house
Fifty feet high, with barbed wire
Guards on the top, aiming rifles at your lovers one by one
And friends, too

I've come with hands above my head
I'm damned if I'll try to break your door down
If you ever come out just call me
I'll still be armed with the memory of one evening when you smiled
At something

Sadness spreads like a black stain
But I know by now that's not all there is

There's a blue flame inside of you so beautiful and rare
And love's not something you decide to do
You'd be so hard to love if love was not just there

You tell me women get you down
And as for men, they're all bastards
I wonder what world you call home
And I wish I could learn their language just enough to make you laugh
Just one time

Yes, it was nice to see you, too
Although I'm never sure you mean it
I pick up the tab and you won't thank me
Not that I mind, but in my dreams it's all so different - we even kiss
Imagine this

Bitterness is a black hole
But you know by now you got more to give

There's a blue flame inside of you so beautiful and rare
And love's not something you decide to do
You'd be so hard to love if love was not just there

Impossible to love if love was not for some strange reason there",Blue Flame,2003

She says I caught you I went through your e-mail
He says it getting so hard just to be male now

And a gun from your dad
I guess I knew when I kissed ya

Maybe too much lipstick
Made your mouth go dumb

I have to say that we were suited
But you know what they say about Cupid
Little bit stupid
Little bit stupid

So we got ourselves messed up
And we did it with style
And the way we were dressed up
Was a little bit wild
Stack heels and tiaras
We were oh so refined
Or maybe too much mascara
Made my eyes go blind

And I sit here watching you sleeping
I only wish that I could remember your name
But I know it's written on a matchbook somewhere
And maybe I'll find it, and maybe I'll care
Or maybe your'll fix me with one of those stares
And put up a fight
So when you awake I admit I'm relieved
When you flash me a smile like a diamond
And just for a moment I almost believe
In love at first light

I propose a breakfast of coffee and aspirin
You laugh, suggesting a raw egg or two
But oh was it ever so good being bad?
Like a couple of vampires, deliciously mad
Saying this is the best blood that we've ever had
So we drank it all night
And it we untangle the webs that we weave
Then maybe there's room for more laughter
Cause just for a moment I almost believe
In love at first light

Feeling cold
You put a robe 'round my shoulders
Smile and pull one of your favorite books form my shelf
Let's opens the curtains and let out the dark
And if the sun doesn't melt us and there's still a spark
And we do something human like walk in the park
The spark could ignite
So maybe I'm moonstruck, or maybe naive
But I know there's a God and a Devil
So maybe I'm crazy enough to believe

Joe Jackson,"King Pleasure is on a mission
To take the power from the local politicians
He's come to party and he shows it
He rules the world, well, man, everybody knows it

It's King Pleasure time
So show respect, get on your knees
You can't reject his right to praise

King Pleasure is gonna get you
He do not give a damn about who wants to let you
You try to nag him, you try to scold him
They've built cages but no one can ever hold him

He knows your secret, he's got your number
He'll stop you workin' but he'll stop you getting dumber
You wanna hold him, you wanna kiss him
You can't deny it but it's futile to resist him

It's King Pleasure time
So show respect, get on your knees
You can't reject his right to praise

King Pleasure will live forever
You can't control him though you think you're pretty clever
And after computer crashes
He'll be laughing' as he's basking on your ashes

In King Pleasure time
So show respect, get on your knees
You can't reject his right to praise

Joe Jackson,"Turn off the TV and turn off the light
Turn off the street lamps as well
Turn off the billboards that scream through the night
And dream the policemen to hell

Close all the windows and close all the doors
Close all the shutters and blinds
Close down the churches and pray to the whores
Lay down and then close your eyes

It's amazing what comes into view
As we're finally breakin' the chains
When the temperature rises
We'll go to our place in the rain

Take down the pictures and take out the trash
Take up the tattered old rugs
Take up the mattress and count all the cash
And laugh with the last of the drugs

Burn all the papers and burn all the wood
Burn what we can't understand
Run up a flag for the old neighborhood
Sit back and then take my hand

'Cause it's amazing what lovers can do
With just a kiss and a glass of champagne
When the rivers run dry
We can go to our place in the rain

Pay off the piper and pay all the bills
Pay for the getaway car
Blow out the candles and head for the hills
Pray that we make it that far

Run from the poison and run from the flames
Run from the maddening crowd
Laugh at the whispers of who'll take the blame
And sing all the sinners out loud

It's amazing what crazy can do
When every good citizen's sane
When heaven's a desert
We'll go to our place in the rain

It's amazing what comes into view
When you just connect your heart back to your brain
When heaven's a desert
We'll go to our place in the rain
",A Place in the Rain,2008
Joe Jackson,"Of all the streets in the world
You walk down this one
And I see three hundred girls
But just want to kiss one

Someone that we've loved before
Is a love forever
But I never thought you'd floor me again
Maybe I should

Rush across the road
Leave my heavy load behind
It just takes a second to know your mind
And do what you've got to do
I'll rush across the road to catch up with you
Catch up with you

Some things come to an end
Before they're done with
Were we too young to be friends
That you just have fun with?

What were all our fights and fears?
'Cause I can't remember
And I've had enough of tears anyway
So I think I'll

Rush across the road
Leave my heavy load behind
It just takes a second to know your mind
And do what you've got to do
I'll rush across the road to catch up with you
Catch up with you

Time after time I'm reminded
That it's a crime to say I've lost
When I decline just to find out the final score
Why can't I pass the line and defy the sign
That says 'Don't Cross'?
Or what am I living for?

Funny how the blink of an eye
Can last forever
And how we think ourselves dry
When it's 'now or never'

If I wait for one more sigh
You could turn and see me
Then I'll never know what I would have done
So I'm going to

Rush across the road
Leave my heavy load behind
It just takes a second to know your mind
And do what you've got to do
I'll rush across the road to catch up with you
Catch up with you
",Rush Across the Road,2008
Joe Jackson,"Solo, it isn't a dream
Solo, it's just what it seems
An empty thing
Waitin' on somebody who never calls
Listening in the night to something
Scratching 'round behind the walls

Solo, with no one to care
Solo, the cupboards are bare
So I'm now to dine
On free, stale crackers and a fifth of gin
And say you're fine
Feeling like something that the dogs dragged in

No one has to laugh, still safe and warm
With peace of mind after storms

Solo, you stare into space
Solo, scared to look at your face
Scared to find
Someone in the mirror who you can't recall
Pale and blind
Talking to himself and saying, ""Fuck 'em all""

No one must admit, chances are few
To try to be someone new

No one gets to play with nowhere free
Peace at last guaranteed
",Solo (So Low),2008
Joe Jackson,"I know that you think I protest too much
I'm like a diva with a tragic touch
But if I wanna hide from the pouring sun
It has to be alright
And I could have my pride but I'll try to run
When a fool would stand and fight

And if I try hard enough
To 'do or die' and push and shove
I know that I would be too tough
Too tough to fall in love with you

You've really gotten underneath my skin
Must have been easy, it was always thin
So if I wanna cry in the burning rain
Don't worry I'll survive
But even when you're high I can feel your pain
That's what I call being alive

So if I fall I'll get back up
And there'll be tears and blood and stuff
Still I stand tall and I'm too tough
Too tough to fall in love with you, with you

And I can see your point of view
But I can see a way to be tough too, tough too

You know I hate it when you talk this way
'Cause you don't listen to a word you say
And it took a lot of time to grow your shell
Maybe enough's enough
And I could tell you why you should go to hell
But I don't want to be that tough

So if I try hard enough
To 'do or die' and push and shove
I know that I would be too tough
Too tough to fall in love with you
With you, with you
",Too Tough,2008
Joe Jackson,"If I stop and think about it
I'm either stone cold certain
Or more inclined to doubt it
But when you jump into the darkness
Well, I take off my hat

You've changed, they say
You can know when to play or to hold
And they think they can show all that glitters is gold
And they don't care to go where you go
'Cause they know you're insane
When you change to the uptown train

Well, I knew that you were trouble
You were a ten time loser
Or maybe even double
But you pulled some kind of rabbit
From your lil' hippie hat

You've changed, they say
Take it slow when you're breaking the mold
Got to pay what you owe or be out in the cold
And they don't care to know what you know
Or to go through the pain
To change to the uptown train
",The Uptown Train,2008
Joe Jackson,"Maybe it would be better if we never said goodbye
Maybe I'd grow much older with you in my life
Maybe we'd come out winners putting the world to right
Maybe I should be sorry for wasting your time

So who's right will take my side
And call it spite or call it pride
Call it love that never died
Call it anything but wasted time?

After the party's over, after the dream has died
Some people keep returning to the scene of the crime
Try to rewrite the story, tell you you never tried
Tell you you should be sorry for wasting their time

So who's right will take my side
And call it spite or call it pride
Call it love that never died
Call it anything but wasted time?

Maybe we could've done better, maybe, maybe not
Maybe we could've made better use of time
Maybe if anyone knew better how much time we've got
They/It wouldn't be so hard to make the words up right

So who's right will take my side
And call it spite or call it pride
Call it love that never died
Call it anything but wasted time?

Rolling over granite, there's a smell like cloves and clay.
And if I know my angels, they'll take it all away.

All right

Gather 'round, guys
It's time to start listenin'
Practice makes perfect
But perfect's not working
There's a lot more to music
Than knowing where your cue's gonna be

You can play all the right notes
But that don't mean you're moving me
But if you can jump like David Lee Roth
Or pump your fist like you're Bruce the Boss

If you've got a heart and soul
You can rock n' roll
Rock n' roll

Strum it, drums
Slide across and runnin'
The stage is your home if you learn how to own it
Like the greats did
There's no way that you can fake it
You've gotta feel the beat before you can move
Even though you're not wearing blue suede shoes
And making mistakes
That won't matter
If you can swagger like ol' Mick Jagger

If you've got a heart and soul
You can rock n' roll
You can rock n' roll - solo

If you're live and die for the music inside
If the 1-for-5 never gets old
Then you can rock n' roll
Rock n' roll

All right, now take it low
Now I need the spotlight to hit me
Right here
As the crowd starts to cheer
I need the fan to blow right through my rock-star hair
Right here

If you can scream like Axel Rose
Or sing like Christina, show after show
If you've got a heart and soul
You can rock n' roll, yeah
If you've got a heart and soul
You can rock n' roll
You can rock n' roll

When you're not sure.

Or you can stop and take a look around. 
And that's the choice I've made.

Making memories we can't forget. 
And when you can't forget 

You're gonna know in your soul 
This is what we came here for 
So live it loud 
Here and now 
This moment, it won't be ignored 
So why not open up that door? 
It's what we came here for. 

For every song we let play outside 
The melodies began to write 
Every time we sing 
Friends we've made, fun we've had 
Memories gonna make me laugh

I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

Joe Krown,"She didn't bat an eye, as I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would cry, or sit around my room and grieve
But oh the girl she fooled me this time
Acting like I was the last thing on her mind 
Now I'd like to start all over again
I just want to change my mind

As I took those steps, toward that open door
Knowing all the time, oh Lord I just didn't wanna go
She didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me wanna change my mind
And I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
'Cause I would like to change my mind

You know, I was confused, sitting here by myself thinking
watching you walk to the door and walk away
what was I supposed to say change your mind

Oh I've played my game so many times before
But people let me tell y'all, that I never reached the door
Oh the wind it is high tonight 
I keep lookin' for my baby but she's not in sight 
And I would like to start all over again

'Cause I would like to start all over again
Baby can I change my, my mind
'Cause I would like to start all over again with you girl",Can I Change My Mind,2010
Joe La Barbera,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

Never tell me dreams come true

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Laugh and run away, 
Like a child at play, 
Through a meadowland, 
Toward a closing door,

That wasn't there before.

Just a passing breeze, 
Filled with memories, 
Of the golden smile, 
That introduced me to, 
The days of wine and roses, 
And you!

Joe La Barbera,"We were married on a rainy day
The sky was yellow
And the grass was gray
We signed the papers
And we drove away
I do it for your love

The rooms were musty
And the pipes were old
All that winter we shared a cold
Drank all the orange juice
That we could hold
I do it for your love

Found a rug
In an old junk shop
And I brought it home to you
Along the way the colors ran
The orange bled the blue

The splash of tears
The northern and the southern
Hemispheres

And it disappears

Joe La Barbera,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1996
Joe La Barbera,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laurie,1996
Joe La Barbera,"When troubles get me, cares beset me
And won't let me go,
I turn to you for consolation.
There I find new peace of mind;
To leave behind my woe
I turn to you as I shall always do.

[Chorus]
The touch of your lips upon my brow,
Your lips that are cool and sweet,
Such tenderness lies in their soft caress,
My heart forgets to beat.

The touch of your hands upon my head,
The love in your eyes a-shine,
And now, at last, that moment divine,
The touch of your lips on mine.

The touch of your hands upon my head,
The love in your eyes a-shine,
And now, at last, that moment divine,
The touch of your lips on mine.",Quiet Now,1996

Their eyes looking coldly ahead
The two lonely people once loved and were caring
But now it's all over and dead
They don't know what happened
They can't think what happened
They had something fine on their own
But the two lonely people have turned into statues
Yes turned into statues of stone
The world was their moon once
The yellow ones
It held all their hopes and their dreams
But time came and broke them
Reality woke them

For all that once mattered
Is old now and battered
But must it be shattered in two

It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance

And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Joe Locke,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence [From The Graduate],1997

Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin

And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,1961

Joe Loco,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1961

Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay
How are things in Glocca Morra this fine day?",How Are Things In Glocca Morra?,2008
Joe Lynn Turner,"Shades of night, fall upon my eyes 
Lonely world fades away 
Misty light, shadows start to rise 
Lonely world fades away. 

In my dreams your face is all I see 
Through the night you share your love with me. 

Chorus: 
Dreaming visions of you 
Feeling all the love I never knew. 

Here we are on the crossroads of forever 
Shining star lights the way. 
Walk with me on the winds of time 
Love's mystery is for us to find. 

Repeat Chorus. 

Until that day, until the day I find you 
I won't rest, I won't let go 
Somehow some way, I know I'll be beside you 
To warm my heart and fill my soul.",Dreaming (Tell Me),1988
Joe Lynn Turner,"You're lazy just stay in bed
You're lazy just stay in bed
You don't want no money
You don't want no bread

If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live you don't want to cry no more

Well my trying ain't done no good
I said my trying ain't done no good
You don't make no effort no not like you should

Lazy you just stay in bed
Lazy you just stay in bed
You don't want no money
You don't want no bread",Lazy,1995
Joe Lynn Turner,"Black night is not right,
I don't feel so bright,
I don't care to sit tight.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

I don't need a dark tree,
I don't want a rough sea,
I can't feel, I can't see.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

Black night, black night,
I don't need black night,
I can't see dark night.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.",Black Night,1997
Joe Lynn Turner,"Just a few roots, replanted. 

Good Golly, said little Miss Molly
When she was rockin' in the house of blue light
Tutti Frutti was oh so rooty
When she was rockin' to the east and west
Lucille was oh so real
When she didn't do her daddies will
Come on baby, drive me crazy--do it, do it

I'm a speed king you go to hear me sing
I'm a speed king see me fly

Saturday night and I just got paid
Gonna fool about ain't gonna save
Some people gonna rock some people gonna roll
Gonna have a party to save my soul
Hard headed woman and a soft hearted man
They been causing trouble since it all began
Take a little rice take a little beans
Gonna rock and roll down to New Orleans",Speed King,1997
Joe Lynn Turner,"Fly into the rising sun,
Faces, smiling everyone
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition
I feel it in my heart

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

Talk about her like a Queen
Dancing in a Eastern Dream
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river
That carries me away

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

But I'm at home and I just don't belong 

So far away from the garden we love
She is what moves in the soul of a dove
Soon I shall see just how black was my night
When we're alone in Her City of light

Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire
I get high

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me
",Woman from Tokyo,1997
