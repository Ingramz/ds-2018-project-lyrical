You found a new man and said we were even now

It's funny how everything seems to even out
Even now

I wish you could put it behind you
Wish you would put up your blinders
Wish you would stop listening to you friends
And come to where no one would find us
Wish you would just keep your focus on me
So I can give you a reminder
That I can be who I'm supposed to
I can do better, I know you remember

Every single time, I was doing right, enough
To keep you around, now look at where I end up

'Cause I remember the night when you had enough of my creeping, oh
Baby, it was only for a season, maybe

And it ain't really had nothing to do with you, it was all really me (no, yeah)
'Cause I was tryna see the world like a dog on a leash
And you was tryna hold me back, I ain't wanna let you go, I held on now 
I let you go and I knew I should have never let you go ahead of it

You remember every single night, we were living life in love

Keep going round, round in circles 
Hoping you understand my circumstance 
Lord knows I never meant to hurt you
Is it because I'm a dog now?
Wish I knew then what I know now
I'm not the same when I go out
I just keep it on the low now
Is it because I'm a dog now?
I'm not the same when I go out

Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Seems I lost everything I had much without warning
More the man than I would have found time for crying
But I was in a barroom drowning my old friend's sorrow
I said mister, can't you see
No wife no family
Driving misery

I'm like a train without a track
I got nowhere to go
And even if I did, I'd probably get there real slow
Cause I've got holes in my shoes and it's raining like hell
Now every thought is like a ringing bell
I said mister, can't you see
No wife no family
Driving misery

One of these days I'm gonna get back home
Find you there alone
God I hope so
Given the chance
I'd probably do it all again
Like I did before
I haven't learned a thing

There's a bus line leaving at a quarter to nine
It runs a long round between here and nowhere

Someday I'll get over you somehow

Around my heart there's a wall
To protect it from this very fall
But I now I've grown
And I'll give you everything
Like blood from a stone
Now stone me and don't ask why
And play the one that makes me cry
It goes ashes ashes from a four leafed clover
All fall down
All fall down
Ashes ashes
Someday I'll get over you somehow

So before you go
Play it again
Here's a dime
But with a happy ending this time

Because my life pisses me off, it feeds my anger happily
'cause happiness pisses me off, wipe your smile off your face fucking human race

Not too sure which way is right
I think of my future, as my past it comes to me
But some of them left me in the fight

Please, the distance makes me sigh, when I'm further from you
Love, was destined 'til that night, the crazy battle of June
Dreams, they still embrace me

Remember, all these little things are coming back to me
Remember the time, when I got to know you
December, all these little scenes arc coming back to me
Remember my eyes, they want to show you love

Fear is never in my heart, it lives and dies with you
Time, I can not make it right, I'd turn it back for you
Screams of bleeding heartache

Remember, all these little things are coming back to me
Remember the time, when I got to know you
December, all these little scenes are coming back to me

It exceeded expectations
Distant stars of wonder, feeding to my hunger
Hidden in the thunder, lifting me towards heaven

When the feeling is gone
Where we you go when it falls
And the falls collapse around ya

Fading away is your face from the walls

Would come alive
Now the faded visions they fight to survive in me

I, blame the mystery
But you shame the history

How can you say that the feeling is gone
How can you claim you're the one
Who never meant to hurt me

Fading away is your face
From the walls as you desert me

mucha basura y mucha muerte hay que cortar

esto es Argentina y no Jamaica
es muy importante poder diferenciar
de lo que es moda a lo que no es moda
son unas palabras de vieja abuela
para el que le interese interpretar 
las antiguas enseñanzas de Don Juan

Rasta no es mas que un soldado 
peleando contra el racismo 
Y la indiferencia del que no quiera hablar
Por eso no hay que desprestigiar a Rastafari

And the money in the bank is almost gone
The only thing in life I know that stands
Is the love between a woman and a man

Well, I grew up working like my daddy did
Broke the land with my hands and the money rolled in
But it wasn't enough and I did not understand
You see, the only thing that matters money can't buy
And when it gets down the bottom line
It's the love you find between a woman and a man

Chris Cagle,"Man, I hate you found me here
With whiskey on my breath
I know I should be ashamed
So much for those twelve steps
He said ""No my son, I know you're doin' your best
For all you've been through, hey, I understand
I only came here to be your friend
You know she still asks about you
And wonders how you're doin' and where you been...""

Chorus 1:
Tell her I'm in Tampa, on the causeway
Watchin' the waves roll in
Tell her I'm in Aspen, in a cabin
Findin' myself again
Tell her that I'm happy , and I've moved on
Better than I've ever been
Just don't tell her that you saw me, drownin' in this bottle
Tryin' to make her disappear
Tell that I'm anywhere
Anywhere but here

It would only break her heart
If she knew the truth
See, I told her when she left
This was the last thing I would do
Tomorrow I swear I'm startin' over again
I've made it this far and I know how it ends
But she doesn't have to find out where I am
So if you see or hear from here again

Chorus 2:
Tell her I'm in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
Sellin' cars five das a week
Tell her I'm in Mobile, Alabama
Gettin' back on my feet
Tell her I'm happy and I've moved on
Lookin' better than you've ever seen
Just don't tell her that you saw me, drownin' in this bottle
Tryin' to make her disappear
Tell that I'm anywhere
Anywhere but here

Tell her that I'm happy and I've moved on
But let her know that I still care

Anywhere but here

But oh, the sweet redemption every time she mentions
That she wants me, oh, that she needs me, oh

The gift she gives me gets me through the day

I reach across the bed where she lay
Then I look up and see the moon dance on her skin
My heart starts poundin' once again
It's a sweet intoxication, a powerful frustration
How I want her, oh how I need her

Chris Cagle,"I remember the summer I turned sixteen,
And that old jalopy Daddy gave to me,
It had holes in the floor and just a 305
But I didn't care 'cause I could finally drive.
There wasn't much to do in my home town,
So every weekend night, we would all go down

There were freaks and hippies in my high school;
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.

Kids fallin' in and out of love,
On the hoods of Chevys, in the beds of trucks
We were stumblin' our way through life 'til our senior year,
But man we sure did learn a lot in that Wal-Mart parking lot.

She had long blonde hair and sea-green eyes;
The most beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life.
But I was young and dumb and didn't have a line,

And all I could say was can i call 'ya sometime?
She just said no and walked away,
But she just said no and walked away,
And that was the first time I felt my heart break.

There were freaks and hippies in my high school;
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.

Yeah, we all did alot of livin'.
It was small-town teenage heaven.

There were freaks and hippies in my high school;
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.

Well, I had my first kiss, my first love,
Got my ass kicked but I got back up.
Lost my way, found it again,
Had one long buzz and a dozen best friends

Wanted

No matter how hard I try, to turn it off
You keep going on and on
You're never ever gone
You're never ever gone

When I think I can fool myself for awhile
I try to call up a friend, but when I start to dial
There's a number tingling in my finger tips
I say your name, I didn't mean to, it just kinda slipped
I just laughed it off, like I don't care but who am I kidding I swear

He seem pretty tore up so I bought him a beer and we lit up a couple Cuban cigars
Well a couple beers in we was gettin' profound
He said ""A guy like me likes the simple things that I...I can wrap my head around""
I didn't know where he was going but I began to understand
When he stood up on his stool like a fool and started holerin' at the band

Something where somebody did somebody wrong, and play it all night long

Ain't... Ain't you that fella on the tv in a cowboy hat always playing guitar""

Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now

I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love we both
Made our separate ways

But now, I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you

Saturday night comes creeping cold
Saturday night comes laughing and dancing

Chris Cameron,"Nooo 
Porque tus errores me tienen cansado
Porque en nuestras vidas ya todo ha pasado
Porque no me has dado ni un poco de ti

Nooo 
Porque con tus besos, no encuentro dulzura
Porque tus reproches, me dan amargura
Porque no sentimos, lo mismo que ayer

Te digo que no
Porque ya no estaño como antes tu ausencia
Porque ya disfruto aun sin tu presencia
Ya no queda esencia del amor de ayer

No, No, No 
Aunque me juraras que mucho has cambiado
Para mí lo nuestro ya esta terminado
No me pidas nunca 
Que vuelva jamás

Chris Christian,"When you're up against a struggle that shatters all your dreams
And your hopes have been cruelly crushed by Satan's manifested schemes
And you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fears
Don't let the faith you're standing in seem to disappear

Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seems to bind you
Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you
When you praise Him

Now Satan is a liar and he wants to make us think
That we are paupers when he knows himself we're children of the King
So lift up the mighty shield of faith for the battle must be won

Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

You think you might want to turn back

And it's got to be for the better

Peace and love to share
With your brother

You think it might be too far
You think it might take too long

Situation's critical
In your life
Situation's critical
In your life
In your life

You might not ever think that
What you do makes a difference
But if you'd only try
You might save someone's life
So what you gonna do
It's always up to you but

Don't don't don't you give up
Don't don't don't you give up
Don't don't don't you give up

'cause when you think about it
You got to give it all you've got to give
You got to get back in and try it again
'cause that's the only way to make it today

Chris Colangelo,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,

Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,2001

On any other day
The date's irrelevant but she was drunk
In the heat of the June night
The faces in the windows - shouts rang out
Into dawn's early light
The flailing arms and scrambling eggs I fled
On my two shambling legs
I gotta go I said - they both looked dead
On any other day
On any other day
They say the light has got no equal
On any other day

They say the light has got no equal

The kitchen porch was all that remained
And I'm out here alone - beat up and pissed
Until this very day
That old hotel rang back in fuzzy time
And I was ravaged to the bone
Your voice got smaller 'til I realized
It was gone

But in my mind I know they still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who was taken you from crayons to perfume
It isn't easy but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I'd write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high

To sir with love
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What can I give you in return
If you wanted the moon

I would try to make a start but I
Would rather let me give you my heart

I watched the lamps fall, you pushed them over. 
They say you're gifted, well I just see a scared kid. 
They must have flipped it, your skills are latent. 
O, you snuffed the glow. Replaced it with coals. 
Threw away the throne. O, you snuffed the glow. 
Replaced it with coals. Burnt down my home. 
You had a life of privilege, hope and love. 
But now that's all gone. Maybe the design's flawed. 
So that's why I'm here, to preserve the remainder 
Of what chance we have left at an existence. 
O, the desolate dirt. The raw, scorched earth. 
It's a trophy of your worth. O, the desolate dirt. 
The raw, scorched earth. It's a scar of my hurt. 
Your cold, wicked soul boasts a foul scent.

No, a stench

The formidable taste of pure contempt. 
Every dark corner will soon see the light.

O, so bright.

The beaming flood will pour right through the binds. 
My words will tear through the air, 
Pierce through the despair, 
To find your arrogant, throbbing ears. 
If it's too much to bear, or to hear, 
Or take, I'll be frank, 
Let my inflection be crystal clear. 
This mess that you've made, it's a six-foot grave. 
It's a home for your lonesome bones that remain. 
We'll disappear, but you'll stay here to rot 
As The King of The Dark and Forgot.

What have I done? Please make me your son. 
What have I become? Destroyed all I love.

O, what have you done? 
Disobedient son, you've broken the trust of your father's love.

The arid, fallow earth would be Ahrima's new hearth. 
He would remain while he watched his family strain, 
And the girl that he loved, vacate to a new place, 
To state over on fresh terrain. 
And from his desolate throne he watched them compose 
A mountainous wall of stone, to separate themselves from him. 
A massive, jagged barricade to lock themselves in. 
Theirs would be the Light, his would be the Dark. 
For a century these halves would wait. 
One world, set apart.

Place your hand on mine. 
Untie your mind. 
We'll just disengage.

O mother, hear a suppliant child

O fiends of air and earth the essence
From this their wonted haunt exiled

Chris Conner,"Things are swingin',
Birds are singin',
And just what do you think those bells are doin' but ringin'?
'Cause they have to ring to make this whole thing rhyme,
And you know that things are swingin' all the time.

If the news is
What the blues is,
Then we'd better just practice up on our ones and twoses,
'Cause where love is you can always find a rhyme,
And where love is, things are swingin' all the time.

It's as simple as
As a dimple,
Just remember that
You can find some brand new swingin' ideas
Underneath your hat!

So keep countin',
Keep it mountin',
Till you think it must be Ponce de Leon's fountain!
Yes, the fountain of youth, for those who know the score,
Means that things will keep on swingin' for evermore.

Like an ocean
That's in motion,
Like the wind that's blowin' the boat right in to shore,
It's the livin'est thing to live and breathe
And keep on laughin' up your sleeve;

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios

Through my shadow

Cryin for the night

And the blankets that I love
Sometimes I am surrounded

Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same

Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two

Throw me tomorrow
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child

Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Thursday's child

Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet

Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms

Throw me tomorrow
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child",Thursday's Child,1956
Chris Connor,"Feeling the way I do, I'd like to say ""I do!""
Heaving a heavenly sigh
Everybody has a someone
Why can't I?

Creeping to bed alone, resting my head alone
Only my pillow nearby
Some have a reason for dreaming
Why can't I?

I feel forsaken on nights like this
Can't I awaken to someone's kiss?

Only my book in bed knows how I look in bed
Nobody hears when I cry
Everybody has a someone
Why can't I?

Feeling the way I do I'd like to say, ""I do!""
Nature is hard to deny
Everybody has a someone
Why can't I?

Feeling the way I do, I'd like to say ""I do!""
Nature is hard to deny
Everybody has a someone
Why can't I?

If love brings merriment, I must experiment
With some electrical guy
Even old maids find a burglar
Why can't I?

Should girls be good girls?
I think they should
I need a good man to make me be good

Two feet are ever cold
Four feet are never cold
I only mean to imply:
Everybody has someone
Why can't I?

Everybody needs someone

Chris Connor,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Those happy hours I spent with you
That lovely afterglow
Most of all I miss you so

Your sweet caresses, each rendezvous
Your voice so soft and low
Most of all I miss you so-o-o

You once filled my heart with no regrets, no fears
Now you find my heart filled to the top with tears

I'll always love you and want you, too
How much you'll never know

Chris Connor,"The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from hist'ry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed at christopher columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when edison recorded sound
They all laughed at wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at rockefeller center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together
Darling, let's take a bow
For ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee!
Let's at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Who's got the last laugh now?""",Mixed Emotions,1956
Chris Connor,"Will I ever find the boy in my mind
The one who is my ideal?
Maybe heÃ¢??s a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass him by
And never even know that he is my ideal?

Or maybe heÃ¢??s a dream, and yet he might be

Chris Connor,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.
Speak low when you speak, love,

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,

Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Come to me when things go wrong
Cling to me and I'll be strong

Chris Connor,"Act the fool, play the calf, and you'll always have the last laugh.
Wear the cap and the bells and you'll rate all the great swells.
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread.
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead.

You get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head.
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown.
Be a clown, be a clown, all the world loves a clown.
Be a crazy buffoon and the 'demoiselles 'll all swoon.

Dress in huge baggy pants and you'll ride the road to romance.
A butcher or a baker, ladies never embrace.
A barber for a beau would be a social disgrace.
They'll come to call if you can fall on your face.

Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown.
Be a clown, be a clown, all the world loves a clown.
Be the poor silly ass and you'll always travel first class.
Give 'em quips, give 'em fun and they'll pay to say you're A-one.

If become a gambler you'll be struck with your luck.
But jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck.

Mighty low, Gabriel, low!

I'm good by day and I'm good by night!
So blow, Gabriel, blow!

Once I was cited for hell,
Once I was headed foe hell,
But when I got to Satan's door,
I heard you blowin' on your horn once more,

And now I'm all ready to fly,

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1959

Chris Connor,"Into a cabaret
One fatal day
A little songbird flew
Found it so very gay
He thought he'd stay
Just to get a bird's eye view

When he heard the jazz band playing
He was happy as a lark
To each measure he kept swaying
And he stayed 'til after dark

Then back to the land he knew
Thrilled through and through
He sailed on in the air
Called all the other birds
And in these words
Started gurgling then and there

I'm a little jazz bird
And I'm telling you to be one too
For a little jazz bird
Is in heaven when it's singin' blue

I say it with regret
But you're out of date
You ain't heard nothing yet
'Til you syncopate

When the going is rough
You will find your troubles all have flown
If you warble your stuff
Like the moanin' of a saxophone

That a little jazz bird
Is the only kind of bird to be

Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park

This is love this is it
Heard it before

Now it's April

There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking

Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic

All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1976
Chris Connor,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive...
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..",Lush Life,1976
Chris Connor,"You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you,
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew.

You're right out of a book,
The fairy tale I read when I was so high;
No armoured knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

I'd fly out of this world
If you said we were through,
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you;
I'll spend the next eternity or two with you.",Out of This World,1976

Stop and think of me

Shall seem with down of eider piled,
If thou above, sweet, watch our keeping

Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled

O mother, hear a suppliant child

O fiends of air and earth the essence
From this their wonted haunt exiled
Shall flee before thy holy presence

To thy dear guidance reconciled

When you return to the night

Than you yourself but if you must pretend
You may meet your end

Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?

The coldest blood runs through my veins

Try to hide your hand
Forget how to feel (forget how to feel)
Life is gone with just a spin of the wheel (spin of the wheel)

Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you

Said ""don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one?""
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She says I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She said her name was Billie Jean, and she caused a scene
Every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?

People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Mother always told me be careful who you love
Be careful what you do before the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who said that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights the law was on her side
Who could can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and her plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

So take my strong advice
And remember to always think twice, do think twice

She told my baby that we danced till three
And she looked at me, showed a photo of my baby crying
His eyes were like mine
'Cause we dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Then she stood right by me, the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon, but she called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

And tomorrow stands before you
Dressed and draped in a cold black cape
Like a crow he ignores you

Done once again for the marveled crowd

As we're chasing our tails
And biting our nails
So strong and frail

And we build and tear down
Build and tear down

How did it get so late

And the minions are eager to find him
Put a million miles under your heels
And you're still behind him
Cover your clocks with your chains and your locks
While the seasons get hotter and colder

Stretch your faces and lie about your ages
And still you're going to get older

It's finally forever

There's no hill I would not climb for you
No bridge I wouldn't cross
Not a moment passes in my life
That you're not on my mind

Anytime you fall
Anywhere you limp
Even if you break
Anytime I can I will be there for you
I know that you'll understand
You'll understand

Now I never would have imagined this
So I thank my lucky stars
As I see you in your wedding dress
Never would have guessed you'd fill my open arms

Breaking down the walls my father built
Just like he did to his father before him

So I tried to make a better one
It looked just like his, so I burned it down again

'Cause it ain't no use to pretend
You're wrong
When you call me out I cant hide anymore
I have no disguise you cant see through

Well you say its bad luck
To have fallen for me
Well what can I say to make it good for you
You wore me out like an old winter coat
Trying to be safe from the cold

But when its my time to throw
The next stone
I'll call you beautiful if I call at all

You tell me I'm low cause I've slept on the floor
And out in the woods with the badgers & wolves
You threw me out cause I went digging for gold
And I came home with a handful of coal

But when its my time to throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful if I call at all
And when its my time to call your bluff
I'll call you beautiful or leave it alone
You call me a dog
Well that's fair enough
It doesn't bother me as long as you know
Bad luck will follow you
If you keep me on a leash and
You drag me along",Call Me a Dog,2011
Chris Cornell,"Whatsoever I've feared has come to life
Whatsoever I've fought off became my life
Just when everyday seemed to greet me with a smile
Sunspots have faded and now I'm doing time
Now I'm doing time
'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

Whomsoever I've cured, I've sickened now
And whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down
I'm a search light soul they say
But I can't see it in the night

I'm only faking when I get it right
When I get it right

'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

How would I know
That this could be my fate?
How would I know
That this could be my fate? Yeah

Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh

So what you wanted to see good
Has made you blind
And what you wanted to be yours
Has made it mine

Don't you lock up something
That you wanted to see fly
Hands are for shaking
No, not tying, no, not tying

I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
Yeah, I sure don't mind, sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change

'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

How would I know
That this could be my fate?
How would I know
That this could be my fate?

How would I know
That this could be my fate?
How would I know
That this could be my fate?

I sure don't mind a change",Fell on Black Days,2011
Chris Cornell,"This is a good Easter song, this next one 

Imagine there's no Heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

But you may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
Maybe one day you'll join us
And the world will live as one
Ah yeah yeah

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
Maybe someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one

Maybe someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one",Imagine,2011
Chris Cornell,"If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all, Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong,
Together we shall go until we die My, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me, inspiration, look see

And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles,
Thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad, happinessI'm glad

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong,
Together we shall go until we die

If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me",Thank You,2011
Chris Cornell,"Won't you take one link, from this misery chain
Keep it to remind you, of a long forgotten time or a place
So that you recognize its shape, when it's near
Any time or place this misery chain should appear

Take the locks and shackles, and melt all of it down
Shine a light upon, every shadow, every acre of ground
The hidden corners on in all around
Anyway you feel this misery chain could be found

When we're gone, and it's all said and done
What will we leave
Stories told, will they speak of us when God only knows
What those words will be

And if I should fall, from the top of the world
To the depths below, so far below where our belief could exist
Down further still will be, the one who hides the key
And there's to try to put these misery chains on me

When we're gone, and it's all said and done
What will we leave
Stories told, will they speak of us when God only knows
What those words will be

Won't you take one link, from this misery chain?
Keep it to remind you, of a long forgotten time or a place
So that you recognize it, 'till it's understood
And that every trace of this misery chain is gone for good
'Til every trace of this misery chain 
Is gone for good",Misery Chain,2013
