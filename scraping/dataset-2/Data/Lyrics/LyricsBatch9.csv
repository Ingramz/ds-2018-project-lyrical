Adam Green,"Holidays, Hollywood
Jolly good sir but I never met you
In your grey Cadillac car
Never gonna see the outline of a star

And the windows creek, on an elbow squeek
That will be for him comin' round the mountain
In his grey Cadillac car
Never gonna see the outline of a star

Oh my little lady lies awake in the pines
Some seem to think that I'm awake all the time
Try to get me groovin' on a blue collar crime
But a maid in the backroom leaves my clothes behind

Bye diddle-eye-dye
Never gonna chew the outline of a pie
Pie that I owe, and I owe
And god knows, I owe them to you so

You came to defy these ugly tears that I cry
Now 89, ready to lie down
91, ready for to go
99, ready to go down",Jolly Good,2006
Adam Green,"Oh I'm going with Darlene in a tragical part of the night,
But I wish she would bring me a place of morning spectacular life,
Make it last just a few, brother's knew, brother's lovers proclaim,
Down at the subway station, just a few brother's mothers remain,
Oh help the children,

Down at the television station momma,
You're bored, getting tired,
But baby you ain't trying to warn me that the maître d getting fired,

The situation is out of your hands, momma,
A funny little lady, and Johnny laid a flower,
They gonna get me, momma,
Going home now, yeah

Now I've been monkey-ing around, but a beat, bobbing free-wheeling guy,
But this lean Adam Green found this motel is how I get by,

I got a hole in my berol, Cheryl,
She let me out in the cold,
I got a hundred one fever, momma,
Should not be acting so old,
She acted so old now, yeah,

Adam Green,"Here comes Ted with his best friend Fred 
Coming up the avenue 
Here comes Mike and you look just like him 
Up and down the avenue 

Those guys stay up on the party line 
They make you cry in every way that you can 
Those guys have money for you anytime 
But you never make out with them 

Here comes Brady with his fifty dollar baby 
Coming out the alleyway 
And here comes Davey with his funny little lady 
Wiping all her tears away

They dish it out, they make you comply like a man

Adam Green,"I had to pay the toll
Cut loose on an uptown stroll
How do you need me so much ?
No amount of love could satisfy you

I had to cut the cheese
I'm outta luck so I thank you please
How do you need me so much?
No amount of love could satisfy you

Media man ain't gonna give enough
Medicine man, you need to fill it up
How many drugs does it take to find something to do?

I made love til the breaking balls
How could you fake it when the cage, it calls?
How do you need a hotel 
So big enough house for anybody else?

And I'm off the wall
So crazy in a vacant stall
Maybe you worry all the time 
'Cause no-one is to know what goes on between the lines

Any kind of love is a needle in the hay
When you get down they need me day to day
How many drugs does it take to find something to say?

Shake another baby, tell another lie
When you was gone I bawled the passerby
How many drugs does it take to get you out of my mind, yeah?

No amount of hate get faded on the shelf
Any kind of love finds anybody else
How many drugs does it take to find something to do

Adam Green,"Tall and gorgeous 
Cold as the summer time 
I wish I had some news 
To leave you this Caroline 

Seen so many vultures 
Split so many pieces 
Down the line 

Kastro would not believe 
What comes from below 
Fight me gladly 
Leave before the battles grow 

So good night, crazies 
I leave them, feeling lazy 
But I'm the god tonight

Adam Green,"Watching old movies in the evening time
How come the sun gone down
How you gonna leave me when the morning comes
Stay if I accept you now

Some boys like to go and get married
Some girl you know she'd love to get high, boy
When I had to go weak with no love 'tween the sheets
Oh, man, we had an awful fight

Watching old movies in the evening time
Get down grooving when the moonlight shines
That'll teach a woman not to get too bald
Hauling around with a faceless Johnny

Johnny please, Johnny please,
Listen to me boy
Sometimes she did not show
And you have to walk around like there's
Nothing wrong
Then I got the word to go

I want to make a hole in you
I'm gonna get fat
You know I get a hat for you too
Fuck fuck me baby
Now where have you gone
I'm a little bit older
I know what I want

Holding you lady
Is running me down
Strumming the cages
Each town after town

You hung the jury
The children were tried
""What do you want?""
She lived days inside
With a piece of Bargain Home
Into my world
Wrapped in the kingdom
Each girl after girl
White women!

One Texas hold 'em
Then she struck like a queer
""What do you want?
I'll never hear""

Where the cigarettes are nice and cheap, oh yeah
I want to hear you say it (say it)
Always wanted them to do it, oh yes (oh yes)

Of the age before the rhinestone bands
There was a strangulation fallen on these cold hands
They sold the kids to science (science)
Baby, cancel my compliance, oh yes (oh yes)

Broadcast Beach is the place to meet
Any old time you want a little sun
The moon don't flop, the phases don't cop
Gots to get the loop to make the beats get dropped

Hepititis caught me off my guard
Fly out of Vegas with my ragtop Diner's Club card
I'll follow you forever (ever)
Baby, casually surrender, oh yes (oh yes)

Movie fantasies ignite our love
With elocutions of a broadcast funeral sludge
We're turning into liars (liars)
Only feigning our desires, oh yes (oh yes)

Adam Green,"Love you turning all my pages
Love you wearing my robes
Wide awake in cold England
After the door is closed

Fine to learn another language
Fine to spin a white thread
Who’s a garbage man? Who’s a chief?
Who’s a monkey in my bed?

And it’s a fine
Baby, it’s just a timeshare
It’s a fine contagious disease
And it’s a fine swirling white guardsman
Lay a tombstone on me

Stop yearning, stop burning
Staying out late at night
Showing her the proper courtship
Make her mama feel all right

Come along a good husband
Come along a fair bride
Call the latest inception
And you look clean inside

And its a fine
Baby, it’s a just a timeshare
It’s fine contagious disease
And its a fine swirling white guardsman
Lay a tombstone on me

When I grow tired of you

Will lose its desire for you

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends

Adam Green,"When I checked into that hotel
I couldn't keep from making a living hell
I took off my jewellery and rented a movie
Then I tried to call you cause something confused me
I went for a walk to find some blood
With a blinder's eyes on my miserable mug

Breaking locks, and getting shocked
No one should ever hold me up
I've been too awful to ever be thoughtful
To ever be nice

When I took off my winter clothes
My body looked like forty or fifty crows
Alone in my mansions, I had to commend you
But I was just escaping your conjugal sand dunes
And now I'm like this, a bare-chested ghoul
With his cigarette eyes and his visible drool

Breaking locks, and getting shocked
No one should ever hold me up
I've been too awful to ever be thoughtful
To ever be nice

Adam Green,"This is not a good day to call me
Because I cannot spare some sympathy
My own feeling is mostly unclear
And when I'm talking to you I'm not here
I don't think I'll ever be ready for you
But I'll be trying to help you out, too
So I went downstairs for a walk
But I had no strength to not talk

Yes you were the flatulent one
And I am the boy who has a gun
You ran into me with such force
Now all I can be is Buddy Bradley

And all of her friends have been approved by them
And all I can hear is people singing
Now two of a kind has come across my mind
Where forever more is painted on her door
Just cancel the Sunday salon
And bury the grave digger's son
No money could last for too long
Nobody could pay for this song

And all of her friends have been approved by them
And all I can hear is people singing
Now two of a kind has come across my mind

Adam Green,"Disappear in complete disarray
Reaffirm what our grandfathers say
Love the kisses that I'll be sending you
Play the rhythm that I'm pretending to
Take the time to find out why I bowed out
I was flat on my own, my darling
Fought the lessons of grace for so long

When your trip's only five meters long, and you find you've been grown all along
Join the living innoxious lullabies; only sleeping cabróns could sympathize
Only they could forget their consciousness
I was flat on my own, my darling; fought the lessons of grace for so long

You can't stop laughing if you can't stop falling
It makes you wonder whether he is calling
Give them a token, give them a token to play

Phone stops ringing when I play your number

Give them a token, give them a token to play

Ridden with the burden of a confident man

It's a mystery just how life can lead
To a place you've never been
You've knocked on that door
A hundred times before, when it
Suddenly let you in

I don't know why 
I've been so blessed to love someone like you
I don't know why
I must confess, I only know I do

And how do you explain the way
My world has changed right before my eyes
And how do you explain the way you 
Gave me wings
When I swore I could never fly

It's a mystery what you've done for me
I'm at a place I've never been
I've knocked on that door
A hundred times before
Now you've suddenly let me in

I'll just lay here in your arms",Only Know I Do,2001
Adam Gregory,"She stares at that ring on her finger
With a far away look in her eyes
She thinks of the memories that linger
Of the good days that quickly flew by

And she remembers the day
When a young man would say
That he'd found the love of his life
She gave him her hand and he placed on a band
And asked her if she'd be his wife

And some may value its silver
And some may value its gold
But she knows no greater value
Than the memories it holds

She added a stone when the children were born
And her husband now looks down from above
She's lived a good life as a mother and wife
And the ring is a symbol of love

And her friends know when to leave her alone
They can tell she needs time to cry
She stares at that ring on her finger
With a far away look in her eyes",The Ring,2001
Adam Gregory,"I sat on the couch, with a book in my hand
I thought of all the good times that I've had
But even though life's sometimes hard
And it's hard to understand
The sky is the limit, so do with it what you can

Oh, the sky's the limit the sky never ends
Even though life's a struggle, one day it will end
So make the best of what you have
Be it good or be it bad
And oh, the sky is the limit
So do with it what you can

I wake up every morning
With a smile upon my face
The day seems so exciting
I could never complain
My family is so supportive
They're the best that a boy could have
So take each day for what it's worth
And then you'll understand why...",The Sky Is the Limit,2001

Trust in me and I will never let you down

Trust your soul when there's nobody else around

Trust in love cause it will always heal your heartbreaks

And we always learn em better from our mistakes

For me there'll never be nobody else but you


I thought of walking by myself

But I could never make it through - without you


There's nothing we can't over come

Were staring at a bright new sun

Well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache

Well touch the earth and kiss the sky

As the same moment passes by

Then well be sure to stay one breathe away from heartache

One breathe from the heartache


Touch my hand if I ever feel that you're weak


Lay your head here on my shoulder when you need

Tell your secrets to me when they get too heavy

And Ill make sure that I'm always there for you

I don't need anybody else but you - for me

I don't know if Ill find the words

But if I do will you believe


There's nothing we can't over come

Were staring at a bright new sun

And well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache

Well touch the earth and kiss the sky

As the same moment passes by

Then well be sure to stay one breathe from a heartache


And I will catch you if you fall

My heart will be there if you call

And I will cover you through anything at all


One breathe from a heartache

there's nothing we can't over come

Were staring at a bright new sun

Well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache

One breathe from a heart ache

Trust in me and I will never let you down

Like a balloon inside my chest
With all the love that's waiting here

Fingers that ache to intertwine
Warmest of chords but missing tune
Where is the laugh to echo mine
Send it soon

The words my lips would form
The circle these two arms would make 
safe and warm
Someone could be safe and warm

But maybe the love we yearn to give
Can find a release some other way
Colouring how we choose to live
Every day

The kindness we can share

The kindness we can share
The comfort these two arms might lend
In despair
Someone's always in despair

Something clear, something true

Something that seems to mean
Something I haven't seen

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Adam Kesher,"I have always tried to give a meaning to all the things that happen to me but I’m too slow to be gripped by their heat.

You know I can knock myself out.

I’ve always tried to forget the meaning of what happens to me and you know I’ve got my tricks to be a mess.

You know I can knock myself.

There are so many things that can fill my veins
And make my mind as intense as it was real, as it made sense.

Sometimes it’s like I’m driving a car, driving so fast that I can hardly see where the road is potholed.

Your movements are so heavenly.
So happy to be at your feet. Waterfalls, your spring is inside me.
Your curves are so obscene.

I’m too tough and clever to show your flow. 
I take you too much for granted, for sure.
And I keep on confining you.

My thoughts are so obscene, I’m too tough and clever to let them go.
Your fate is changing me. Waterfalls, I keep on diving.

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

The arms that clung

Adam Lambert,"Oh, seconds, hours, so many days
You know what you want but how long can you wait?
Every moment lasts forever
When you feel you've lost your way

And what if my chances were already gone
I started believing that I could be wrong
But you gave me one good reason
To fight and never walk away
So here I am still holding on

With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath, it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes to get to that one thing

Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you almost gave up all your dreams
They take you by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries, there are no boundaries

I fought to the limit to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets?
Don't know where the future's headed
But nothing's gonna bring me down

Jumped every bridge, I've run every line
I risk being safe, I always knew why
I always knew why
So here I am still holding on

With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath, it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes to get to that one thing

Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you almost gave up all your dreams
They take you by the hand and show you that you can

You can go higher, you can go deeper
There are no boundaries above and beneath you
Break every rule
Cause there's nothing between you and your dreams

With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath, it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes to get to that one thing

Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you almost gave up everything

There's a thin line between the dark side and the light side baby tonight
It's a struggle gotta rumble, tryin' to find it

Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind

I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

Between pleasure and pain

Must be one and the same

It's down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away

Is the devil's in your kiss

Ain't where your love should stay

Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all that I got

You ask me to enter then you make me crawl
And I can't keep on holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town

In God and James Dean

Lock up the gates

Walked into the flames
Called out your name

In the podium, dynamite
Napoleon like sodium mixed with petroleum,
Slowly but surely, she was walking toward me
Cut the convo short 'cause she had to wake up early,

""You're very handsome"" is what she said.
And the way she looked in my eyes said ""Put me to bed.""

Oh my, oh my, I should have known when she said to me on the phone:
""You do not know me very well, but I would never hurt a fly.""
Then she aimed at my chest with love in her eye.

Never go to loud clubs
Cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry
When they can't hear

And stay the hell away from drugs
Cause they're not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard
Like a beagle

'Cause you should never trust a bank
They've been known to fail
And never travel by car, a bus
Boat or by rail

And don't travel by plane
And don't travel at all
Built a bomb shelter basement
With titanium walls

And wear titanium suits
In case pianos fall on ya
And never go in saunas
Cause they're crawlin' with piranhas

And never take the stairs
'Cause they're often unsafe
You only live once
Don't let it go to waste

You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat 'til it's done
Cause you only live once

Yeah
And here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids
Cause their hair is filled with mad lice

There's no such thing
As too much Purell
This a cautionary tale
Word to George Orwell

So don't 1980 force
Any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt
And triple lock it

Then hire a taster
Make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy
Then destroy him

No blankets or pajamas
They can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture
Killing machines

Board your windows up
The sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straight jacket
So your safe from yourself

Take no chances (no chances)
Stop freelancin' (right now)
Invest in your future
Don't dilute your finances (uh huh)
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?)
4.2% thirty year mortgage
That's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it
Don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings
And you'll retire with money in your account
Beast

YOLO, say no no
Isolate yourself
And just roll solo
Be care-folo
You oughta look out
Also stands for YOLO

You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue

Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die

Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky

You oughta look out",YOLO,

And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way
So this is in the name of love, like Rob would say
Before you ask me to get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars
Things we seen on the screen are not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say (nothin's ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas guns clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
And Jesus, and one day that she'll see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down
Now my lil' cousin smokin' those cigarettes now
His job trying to claim that he too nigger-ish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of the noun

Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say (nothin's ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

Adam Levine,"[Intro: D-Roc]
I know what you go through
From me to you, I love you

[Verse 1: D-Roc]
From the nigga to the baller, never satisfied
So the money got you doing shit that'll fuck up your pride
You ain't a hoe, you just really trying to get by
Every day looking up at the sky
Sometimes, shit get so hard
It really have you bothered
First you sigh, then you cry
Up a whole puddle of water
Seem like this shit won't ever end
Merry go rounds to the whirlwinds
Waves turn to a hurricane
If you see joy, you got to see pain
Shit in the world ain't gonna ever change
Even when you die, it'll be the same
Now you due to them circumstances
Jars aren't counted so your forced to dance
Hoping and praying for a second chance
Just wanna put back on your pants
Walk out the club and throw up your hands
Tired of being disrespected by her man
Think this shit ain't right for you
Niggaz been yellin all night for you
Got in your mind what's best for you
Walk up to the club to tell them your through

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
She's stuck off in this little room
With nothing left to hold onto
Her life is in a little box
She's wondering will it ever stop?
The life of a stripper

[Hook: Girl]
I'm so sick and I'm so tired
Of these clubs, I keep crying
Every night, I wipe my eyes
Cause these years pass me by
I give up, I'm all in
My whole life is full of sin
This road is a dead end
I wanna live again

[D-Roc]
From the part where a child is torn from a mothers umbilical cord
No one really enforces that lifes gonna be hard
Which is kinda left up to the teachers
And the teachers leave it up to the preachers
the preachers ain't fillin' up the bleachers
It's the rappers
Sad, ain't it

[Verse 2: Kane]
It was this girl named Star, pretty fine little woman
Going to college, taking off her clothes for money
She gotta pay the rent, she got a little girl
Her baby daddy ain't shit, See what she dealin with?
But she gotta hold on (hold on)
Wanna leave the club alone (you dead wrong)
She gotta pay the bills but in the meantime
She like ""fuck how she feel"" living is real
So she back in the club again
Taking off her clothes again
Going to school, going to work, getting tiring
Lack of sleep but baby gotta eat
and these shoes on her feet
She got a test next week so she stressed
Ask god to give her a blessing, send her in the right direction
Her parents died when she was eight years old
And after that, she felt like she was all alone
But she got her grandparents and they raised her well
Keep going to school, take care of yourself
Getting hard, going to school and work in the club
And at the same time looking for love
She can't keep skipping for an occupation
In a minute, she'll be graduating
Make her wanna throw up her hands
Now she only wanna live again

Adam Levine,"Childhood living is easy to do 
The things you wanted I bought them for you 
Graceless lady you know who I am 
You know I can't let you slide through my hands 

Wild horses couldn't drag me away 
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away 

I watched you suffer a dull aching pain 
Now you decided to show me the same 
No sweeping exits or offstage lines 
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind 

Wild horses couldn't drag me away 
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away 

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie 
I have my freedom but I don't have much time 
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried 
Let's do some living before we die

Adam Levine,"Now what y'all finna hear is an update
On what we been on as of late
See I was reading a late notice on the date that I wrote this, you hear
Time flies in the Leer
And you wonder where the day went
See I'm a leader in my field, but I'm behind on my truck payments
So this is something that could help you raise your head like hello
See this is not brown red or yellow
Not a white or black poem
This is a prayer to a guardian angel
To protect our fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters
Until we bring our troops back home
'Cause it feel like we all in the same platoon
And we'll all be extinct soon
If we continue to suffer from other people's crimes
I think we well overdo for change
This time
And I know they don't wanna see me cooped up in a Benz
They'd rather see me cooped up these pens
Therefore I release the ink that's cooped up in these pens
And let my art-ticulate
People are so slow to love, but so quick to hate
Now some things finna change because we say so
Lets stop looking at how bad things are
And focus on how well they may go
And this is a declaration
That we'll be fair again
Especially to those Americans
Who were Americans, before there were Americans
This is to a small young family that's booming out of space
There's room in outer space
This is to my people
The human race

I need you to take us to the promised land
Don't just make us promises
It's too late to let go of our hand

They say we need a prophet that can touch on the topics
And make it hot as the tropics
Well you got it (you got it)

Take us to the promise land
Don't just make us promises
It's too late to let go of our hand

Everybody saying please don't let go
I hear it over and over and over like a echo
I see it in my dreams, I feel the effect though
People drowning in debt
Somebody to the rescue
Everybody's saying we need something special
Nah man, we need something extra terrestrial
Outta this world, speak for us
Be the vessel
Outta the box, reach for it through the threshold
Uh, through all of the stress though
What's best of all, people screaming like a festival
Just applaud, this moment is special y'all

And I need you to
And I need you to
I need you to
I need you to",Promised Land,2008
Adam Levine,"She shot me, she shot me,
Bang, bang, she shot me. [Repeat: x3]
She shot me, she shot me,
Bang, bang. (Get out the way, yo)

There she goes again,
The girl is Ethiopian.
In other words, she came through explodin'
In the podium, dynamite
Napoleon like sodium mixed with petroleum,
Slowly but surely, she was walking toward me
Cut the convo short 'cause she had to wake up early,
But continuing the story,
Don't worry she gave me digits for her Blackberry
""You're very handsome"" is what she said.
And the way she looked in my eyes said ""Put me to bed.""

Oh my, oh my, I should have known when she said to me on the phone:
""You do not know me very well, but I would never hurt a fly.""
Then she aimed at my chest with love in her eye.
I said she aimed at my chest with love in her eye.

She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one.
It went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away,
I stood my ground and let her spray.
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang she shot me [Repeat:x3]
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang.

Scorpion,
She's so hot she's a scorch-ian,
Killing me softly,
Lauryn or Kevorkian,
Couldn't tell if she's coo-coo or corky, when
I asked her her name she said ""Call me Ten.""
Testing, testing
Things just got more interesting
She's dressed in a vest pin, double-breasted holster,
A very Western toaster,
She ain't nothing Kosher.
Ah, she lets me closer.
Hotter than a pepper-crusted Samosa
While I try to keep my composure.

She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one.
It went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away,
I stood my ground and let her spray.
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang she shot me [Repeat:x3]
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang.

Am I wrong?
But what is love without the pain to go along?
And what is pain if not the reason for me to sing this song?
And this song is for the weak and for the strong.
Cause I was strong and still,
She got me, she got me,
Bang, bang, she got me.
She got me, she got me,
Bang, bang.

She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one.
It went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)

Adam Levine,"When I was a young boy growing up in school
There was a lot of confusion so many guides and rules
Faced with a dilemma and being told what to do
That’s when I learned to stand for something, does it come as a surprise
That I fell, fell for you, for once I could tell what I should do

Lock this baby down, make it real here's the papers sign the deal
Find a home buy a car get a dog and there we are
So I'm gonna stand up and man up, no stuttering and I won't stall
I'm gonna stand up and man up, the one time its cool to fall
In love, I'm falling in love
And please don't pick me up

We decided to get married, a little bit too soon
People told us we were crazy, 'cause we were still in school
Too young too fall in love, but we followed through
And it wasn’t all for nothing
So they shouldn't be surprised
That I fell, fell for you and for twice I could tell what I should do

Lock this baby up, make it real here's the papers sign the deal
Find a home buy a car buy a dog and there we are
So I'm gonna stand up and man up, throw my doubts up against the wall
I'm gonna stand up and man up, the one time its cool to fall
In love, oh I'm in love
But please don't pick me up

You’d never leave me on the side of the road
Or down on the floor like your clothes
Driveway with the water hose anywhere the water flows that’s perfect how it goes
Just like a penny on the street or dying when you see something sweet.
The most beautiful picture on the wall, that's you

'Cause when I fell, I fell for you
And for the thrice time I could tell what I needed to do

Lock this baby down make it real where's the papers sign the deal
Find a home buy a car buy a dog and there we are
So I'm gone stand up and man up, I promise not to drop the ball
I'm gonna stand up and man up, the one time its cool to fall
So I'm gonna stand up and man up, who cares how it looks to y'all

It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo

Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go

If I was an old-school, fifty pound boom box
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Keep myself inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low

Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and pull it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap
This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm going psycho again
And I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
'Cause I'm running in circles with

My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

I haven't been this fucking confused since I was a kid
Sold like forty million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it three A.M. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy
Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's
Never gonna end, now we number one again
With that frown on your face, and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it
This a gift, God-given, like the air in the lungs
Of every fucking thing livin'

My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away

About the two of us from different worlds.
I love you so much that it hurts inside,
Are you listening?

Listen to me, girl.

Can't we try just a little bit harder?
Can't we give just a little bit more?
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for?
Can't we try just a little more passion?
Can't we try just a little less pride?
Love you so much baby,
That it tears me up inside.

I hear you on the telephone with God knows who,
Spilling out your heart for free.
Everyone needs someone they can talk to,
Girl, that someone should be me.

So many times, I tried to tell you,
You just turned away.

How did I know?

My life is changing so fast now,
Leaves me lonely and afraid.

Don't be afraid, girl.

Can't we try just a little bit harder?
Can't we give just a little bit more?
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for?
Can't we try just a little more passion?
Can't we try just a little less pride?
Love you so much baby,
That it tears me up inside.

Adam Marano,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

rise up and disappear from me
Fill my cup, now that I've had two or three,
I can get a little free
It feels good, to celebrate the loss of my independence
I’m in the mood, to let the rhythm push me out of my head

(You're the one)

I’m lit up, dancing in my room alone
I lock my door and turn off my phone
Fill my cup, now that I've had three or four,
I could use a couple more
It feels good, to tune out from the wrongs
of the world around me I’m in the mood,
to let the warm embrace of my cup surround me

(You're the one)

I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em

I could get myself off the floor
Spilled my cup, the room is tipping to and fro,
my mind is moving kinda slow
I know I should, break out of these walls
I have built around me
If only I could, face up to the world
let the truth surround me

Oh, no, everything is alright
Breathe, everything little piece of me

The ear hears, the pulse beats
Without you, the eyes gaze

The tears dry without you

As we said our goodbyes 
Can't get them out of my mind 
And I find I can't hide 
From your eyes 
The ones that took me by surprise 
The night you came into my life 
Where there's moonlight I see your eyes 

How'd I let you slip away 
When I'm longing so to hold you 
Now I'd die for one more day 
'Cause there's something I should have told you 
Yes there's something I should have told you 
When I looked into your eyes 
Why does distance make us wise?

And before this song dies 
I should tell you I should tell you 
I have always loved you 
You can see it in my eyes",Your Eyes,1996
Adam Pascal,"We all lead such elaborate lives
Wild ambitions in our sights
How an affair of the heart survives
Days apart and hurried nights

Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to live like that
Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to love like that
I just want our time to be slower and gentler, wiser, free

We all live in extravagant times
Playing games we can't all win
Unintended emotional crimes
Take some out, take others in

I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to live like that
I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to love like that
I just want to be with you now and forever, peaceful, true

I wish I had the courage
To tell you face to face
But I could wait forever
For the perfect time and place

We all live such elaborate lives
We don't know whose words are true
Strangers, lovers, husbands, wives
Hard to know whose loving who

Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to live like that
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to love like that
I just want to touch your heart, may this confession be the start

You are your mother's religion 
Down on her knees as she 
Kisses your heartache away

Are forever yours

I've been to the mountain 
I've lived through the violence 
I've seen what man can do to man

I can't promise you money 
But I promise to make you the best man I can

The former champion, our Freddie Trumper, talks to Anatoly Sergievsky,
the man who beat him a year ago,
and who is defending his title here right now in Bangkok, Thailand.
Let's get that Sergievsky family video lined up, okay?

We all want times in our careers,
when we make a little history.
Receive the plaudits of our peers,
perhaps that time is here right now for me.
Ah Anatoly, if I may, let me say right away,
you will be thrilled, because the other seat is filled
by a long-standing friend of yours.
Action!

Well, here we are face to face once again.

By any standards, a bizarre reunion!

Is being homeless affecting your game?

I wouldn't know, as I have a home in England.

No, by a home I mean real home the place where your family is.

England is my real home.

What are your latest political aims?

What are you saying?

Your anti-Russian crusade, has it worked?

I am no crusader.

What is your true motivation?
That is something we all want to know.

You know damn well what my motivation is, okay?

Here we see a man under great pressure
Two fights to fight, yet he could not look fresher.
Chess and politics, I take my hat off.
To any champion, who can pull that off?

I hear your second controls everything.

Chess is her passion.

But her obsession is East versus West.

Chess is her passion.

I know a little about her,
and she has got her own ax to grind.

That is not true.

Aren't you concerned that why your wife is not here?

I don't discuss my private life in public.

But don't you care that she is not by your side?

I think I've had enough of this discussion!

Well, we've a little surprise.
We've got your wife on the video.

Run the video!

Let her talk to you, give you her version
How married life has changed, since your desertion.
Hey come back, my friend, we are only showing
home movies nothing more, where are you going?

Great interview!

Bravo, Mr, de Courcy Walter!

Ah, Alexander!

I am glad that old film did the trick.
We are going to be able to help each other.

Heartwarming international cooperation.

I have good news about Anatoly's lady friend.
Florence Vassy's father is alive.

Really?  Well, this is good news.  Have you told her yet?

No, I was going to leave that pleasure to you.
However, my friend, there is one thing-

Yes, of course there is.

I think Mr. Sergievsky must lose the match and come home.
Do you not agree?

Sure, but there are others beside Vassy we wish to see come home.

That should not be a problem.  Do we have a deal?

We have a deal, and everybody wins.

Except Anatoly.

But he gets the lovely Svetlana.",The Interview,2009

No. It's not about her, your wife or your kids or money or Walter or Molokov.

Something I've noticed in Viigand. It's his King's Indian Defense. One of the lines he's been trying doesn't completely make sense.

Why? I don't understand.

I told you his King's Indian

No, I don't understand why you're helping me.

Because I love chess. Does nobody else? Jesus, sometimes I think I'm the only one. How can you let mediocrity win.

What about Florence's father? My wife and my children?

You've let them all down already. Win or betray yourself too. You don't want those shits to get what they want.

They'll get what they want. They always do.

No. They won't if you win. Be true to the game. The one thing you know you can count upon.

What about Florence?

He has no choice. 
In his frenzied love for you, he longs to break the chains of his imprisonment, 
He has no choice.

Do you love yourself more than you love me? 
Beloved replied: I have died to myself and I live for you. 
I've disappeared from myself and my attributes, 
I am present only for you.

But from knowing you I've become a scholar. 
I've lost all my strength, but from your power I am able.

I love you...I love myself. 

I am your lover, come to my side, 
I will open the gate to your love. 
Come settle with me, let us be neighbours to the stars. 
You have been hiding so long, endlessly drifting in the sea of my love. 
Even so, you have always been connected to me. 
Concealed, revealed, in the unknown, in the un-manifest. 
I am life itself. 

You have been a prisoner of a little pond, 
I am the ocean and its turbulent flood.

Woke up in the morning 
Put on my new plastic glove 
Served some reheated salisbury steak 
With a little slice of love 
Got no clue what the chicken pot pie is made of 
Just know everything's doing fine 
Down here in Lunchlady Land 

Well I wear this net on my head 
'Cause my red hair is fallin' out 
I wear these brown orthopedic shoes 
'Cause I got a bad case of the gout 
I know you want seconds on the corndogs 
But there's no reason to shout 
Everybody gets enough food 
Down here in Lunchlady Land 

Well yesterday's meatloaf is today's sloppy joes 
And my breath reeks of tuna 
And there's lots of black hairs coming out of my nose 
In Lunchlady Land your dreams come true 
Clouds made of carrots and peas 
Mountains built of shepherds pie 
And rivers made of macaroni and cheese 
But don't forget to return your trays 
And try to ignore my gum disease 
No student can escape the magic of Lunchlady Land

Well I dreamt one morning 
That I woke up to see 
All the pepperoni pizza 
Was a-looking at me 
It screamed, why do you burn me 
And serve me up cold 
I said I got the spatula 
Just do what you're told 
Then the liver & onions 
Started joining the fight 
And the chocolate pudding 
Pushed me with all its might 
And the chop suey slapped me 
And it kicked me in the head 
It's called revenge Lunchlady 
Said the garlic bread 
I said what did I do 
To make you all so mad 
They said you got flabby arms 
And your breath is bad 
Then the green beans said 
You better run and hide 
But then my friend sloppy joe came 
And joined my side 
He said if it wasn't for the Lunchlady 
The kids wouldn't eatcha 
You should be shakin' her hand 
And sayin' please to meet ya 
She gives you a purpose 
And she gives you a goal 
You should be kissin' her feet 
And kissin' her mole 
Now all the angry foods 
Just leave me alone 
And we all live together 
In a happy home 

Thanks to

Piece of shit car
I got a piece of shit car
That fuckin' pile of shit
Never gets me very far

My car's a big piece of shit
'Cause the shocks are fucking shot
And my seatbelt's fucking broken
I got to tie it in a knot
(It's a piece of shit)

I can't see through the windshield
'Cause it's got a big fucking' crack
And the interior smells real bad
'Cause my friend puked in the back
(It's a piece of shit)

(Piece of shit car)
Piece of shit car
(He's got a piece of shit car)
It sucks royal dick

(That fuckin' pile of shit)
100% crap
(Never gets him very far)
Oh fuck you car

It's got no CD player, it only got the 8-track
Whoever designed my car can lick my sweaty nut sack
(They can bite his ass too)
And I got no fuckin' brakes

I'm always way out of control
Eleven times a day I hear ""Hey, watch it asshole""
(You fuckin' piece of shit)

(Piece of shit car)
I got piece of shit car
(He got a piece of shit car)
Diesel gas sucks my ass

(That fuckin' pile of shit)
That pile of metal shit
(Never gets him very far)

Oh what the fuck did I do
What the fuck did I do
What the fuck did I do
To get stuck with you

You're too wide for drive-through
And you smell like the shoe
But I'm too broke to buy something new
Oh fuck me

Well the engine likes to flood
The car always fuckin' stalls
And the seat cushion's got a big rip
So a spring always pokes the balls

(Ouch, ouch, ouch)
Plus the door locks are busted
I gotta use a fucking coat hanger
(What a pain in his ass)

And if a girlie sees my car
There's no chance I'll ever bang her
(He never ever gets da pussy)
Hey shut up
(Piece of shit car)
You piece of shit car

(You got a piece of shit car)
You piece of shit car
(Piece of shit car)
Bald fuckin' tires

(You got a piece of shit car)
No rearview fucking mirror
(Piece of shit car)
Seven different colors

(You got a piece of shit car)
Fucking rag for a gas cap
(Piece of shit car)
Tailpipe makes the sparks fly everywhere

(You got a piece of shit car)
(Piece of shit car)
(You got a piece of shit car)

Adam Sandler,"Everyone in this room has been associated with Whitey
Either through basketball or the mall or various odd
Jobs he does around town for free or at most a dollar
And I'm guessing 99% of you have either laughed in Whitey's
Face or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or voice or sister
Or shortness when he wasn't looking
But the next time you'd see him he'd still go out of his way to 
Smile and wave at you and ask you about your mother's
Operation or something like that because he, unlike us,
Actually cares about someone other than himself

The reason I bring this up to you is because I was the worst
Offender of all
My life was simply going nowhere
Then a tiny little man rushed to my side
He should've gotten a big thank you
Instead he got a Porta-Potti ride

I was such a shithead
But he never quit on me
'Til I told him he was useless
And his sister was freaky
Once when we were watching Sunday football
A fuzzy screen was all that we could see
Whitey came over with a hanger
And spent the game atop our T.V.

And when the lightning struck him
He let out a wicked, loud yell
But we just turned up the volume
And ignored the burning smell
We should all rot in hell

Aw shut your wooden mugs!

Would you check out her bazugs?!

You all need to deal with pain? Well cheers is what I say
This here stuff just numbs the pain, it don't make it go away

Adam Sandler,"All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waitin' for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waitin' for you

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real

I don't expect for you
To understand
The kingdom of heaven
Is in your hands
I don't expect for you
To wake up from your dream
Too late for crying
Now it seems

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waitin' for love

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waitin' for love

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

Adam Sandler,"Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light
In every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though
It all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Adam Schlesinger,"Splish splash, I was takin' a bath 'long about a Saturday night
A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub, thinkin' everything was all right
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me and I opened the door
And then a splish splash, I jumped back in the bath
Well, how was I to know there was a party going on?
 
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang dancin' on my livin' room rug (yeah)
Flip flop, they were doin' the bop, all the teens had the dancin' bug
There was Lollipop with Peggy Sue
Good golly, Miss Molly was a even there too
A well a splish splash, I forgot about the bath
I went and put my dancing shoes on
 
I was a splishin' and a splashin', I was rollin' and a strollin'
I was a movin' and a groovin', I was a reelin' with the feelin'

Adam Schmitt,"You're a woman - you're a child
Sometimes you're weak and then you're wild
And I just can't understand
'cause I'm a boy who plays the part of a man, now
It's not hard to see
Must be the way it was meant to be

You keep me guessin' all the time
You play the fool and then you shine
Can I meet you in between?
'cause you know we could both do without a scene, now
I don't mean to blame you
I got some work of my own to do

Ooh - We could tear it down and build it up again
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, first of all, learnin'
And maybe then we can make amends
We could follow it through to the very end - it's true
I'm talkin' 'bout me and you
Me and you

We could tear it down and build it up again...

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim

Is hard but you'll know why I'm here
Once I'm gone

Shame on the liar in me
It's a shame, it's a shame

You've made trust, to me seem a crime
Just know I've been with you honestly
The whole time

Is this love or are we
Looking for perfect things to claim?
Is this love or are we
Bleeding the blood of all the pain?
I guess this is love

The sun won't stay up for long
And you are so afraid
Afraid of the darkness that comes
So what can I do? You can't be alone tonight
So what can I do? I still love you

Oh, I discovered a (Boom-ba-boom), right before my eyes

I picked it up and ran to town as happy as a king
I took it to a guy I knew who'd buy most anything

Adam Wylie,"He's a very smart prince
He's a Prince who prepares
Knowing this time I'd run from him
He spread pitch on the stairs
I was caught unawares

And I thought, well, he cares
This is more than just malice
Better stop and take stock
While you're standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace

You think, what do you want?
You think, make a decision
Why not stay and be caught?
You think, well, it's a thought

What would be his response?
But then what if he knew
Who you were when you know
That you're not what he thinks
That he wants?

And then what if you are
What a prince would envision?
Although how can you know
Who you are till you know
What you want, which you don't?

So then which do you pick
Where you're safe, out of sight
And yourself, but where every thing's wrong?
Or where every thing's right
And you know that you'll never belong?

And whichever you pick
Do it quick
'Cause you're starting to stick
To the steps of the palace

It's your first big decision
The choice isn't easy to make
To arrive at a ball
Is exciting and all
Once you're there, though, it's scary

And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave
But you have to be wary
There's a lot that's at stake
But you've stalled long enough
'Cause you're still standing stuck
In the stuff on the steps

Better run along home
And avoid the collision
Even though they don't care
You'll be better off there
Where there's nothing to choose
So there's nothing to lose

So you pry up your shoes
Then from out of the blue
And without any guide
You know what your decision is
Which is not to decide

You'll just leave him a clue
For example, a shoe
And then see what he'll do
Now it's he and not you
Who is stuck with a shoe

In a stew, In the goo
And you've learned something, too
Something you never knew
On the steps of the palace

Partout ça chuchote qu'la 9ème Zone est prête à débouler

Ça m'saoule là tout, les coups bas, tous les mecs qui veulent douiller
Y'a Souleymane, joue les fous, sous les coups de boules khey tu vas couler

Adama Diallo,"Échoué, le plan a échoué
Sachez que parfois l’ambiance peut changer
Les coups s’échangent et tu passes du calme au danger
Échoué, le plan a échoué
Tu peux passer du blanc au noir, du bien au mal

1, la soirée se passe ils jouent leur avenir à 2
En 2 minutes hop, ça devient la guerre de Troie
Ils étaient 4 ou 5 sous l’emprise du 666
Et de la weed oui, surtout d'la 8-6
Cette fois-ci stop, ce jeune homme voulait du neuf
S’marier avec sa meuf, bref avoir 10 enfants
Il en a marre des coups, avec ses zinc’ c’est simple
Mais une chose qui est sûre, c’est pas passé 5 sur 5
Un dîner au chandelles, et tout se passe à merveille
Il négocie la main d'la fille en espérant que sa mère veuille
C’est la soirée d'sa vie, depuis hier Samir veille
Il se dit qu’il veut de l’argent propre, qu’il en a marre d’salir l’oseille
Il esquive même son cousin qui lui demande de faire des coups
Des groupes de mecs le cherchent : ils voient sa tête, ils la découpent
Du coup, Samir s’est rangé tout ça grâce à sa petite amie
Il passe une soirée parfaite en songeant à sa petite famille
D’un coup des mecs à l’entrée rentrent, giflent le videur
Déboulent dans le resto à 5 avec Samir dans l’viseur
Courent vers lui à toute vitesse, coups d’bouteilles au futur gendre
Ils mettent des coups d'pression aux gens, des coups de couteaux aux jambes
Des couples goûtent aux insultes y a que le serveur que ça enchante
Ils mettent la go en sang, en plus elle est enceinte
Ils bousillent les tables les chaises et enchaînent le vacarme
Ils débranchent les câbles, vident les caisses et dépouillent le placard
Ils profitent des femmes et d'leurs fesses
Traitent leurs mecs de bâtards (sale bâtard va)
Et ils mettent en flammes toute la pièce c'est devenu un bazar
Changement d’ambiance que d’la peur, personne pour l'dire aux keufs
Belek ici en 10 minutes tu peux passer du rire aux pleurs

Échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)
Le plan a échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)

Échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)
Le plan a échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)

Ok 5, re-noi dans une caisse immatriculée Neuf-Quatre
Sur un fond sonore du Prototype 3
Fonçaient vers la capitale quand l’un d'eux
Sortit l’flash de rhum pour se mettre bi-en
Il est minuit 6 quand ça part en cette-su
La caisse fait des loopings, ça devient le grand 8
Dire qu’ils s’étaient mis yes, p'tites vestes, jeans neufs
C’est l’histoire d’un cauchemar hiver 2010
- Allô?
- C’est ""un tel"", bien ou quoi mon gars sûr? J’ai la caisse, ce soir on sort?
- Si si bien vu t’assures!
- Préviens les autres on s’capte au café qui fait l’angle
Ce soir on s’fait pas recal' : j’ai 4 tickets d’entrée
- Ok!
3h plus tard, tu connais les blacks
Mais bon y a le plein pour fuir si un keuf reconnaît la plaque
Du Sexion à fond, direction la capitale
Ça va clasher du tiek’son jusqu’à Pigalle
Flash de rhum pour s’mettre en condition
Mauvaise idée, car maintenant ""un tel"" conduit saoûl
Il serre un peu trop près le taxi devant
Un radar, le taxi pile et c’est l’accident
Le passager devant s’cogne contre le tableau d’bord
Sa boîte crânienne se fracture, un morceau d’cerveau sort
La carrosserie s’écrase comme une canette
C’est maintenant qu’il pense à Dieu et l'appelle à l'aide
Mais c’est trop tard :
Les vitres explosent les bouts de verre s’enfoncent dans les corps
La caisse part en tonneau et fonce dans l’décor
""Un tel"" sort, et voit les gens en ang-s
Voilà ce qu’on appelle un changement d’ambiance

Échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)
Le plan a échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)

Vu l’ambiance, valait mieux décal’ wesh on était pas plus de 7
Debout comme à l’armée à s’esquinter les vertèbres
Faya sous cool-al mais ce coup-ci c’était whisky
Sans cesse à débattre sur le dernier X6
Ce soir c’était nuit blanche des clopes j’en avais plus que 5
4€ d’nnaie-mo pour aller graille' s’mettre ien-b
3 képis qui rodaient en camtar' en moins d’2
Les mains contre le mur au bord des nerfs mais je m’abstiens
Y avait d’la se-ti du pilon c’qu’il faut pour sm’ettre ien-b
La ptite équipe d’élite 2-3 tits-pe qui s’trouvaient dans l’coin
Tout s'passait pour le mieux, mis à part un peu d’boucan
Un contrôle inopiné ce qu’on appelle un changement d’ambiance
A la base, ils étaient venus nous demander d’bouger
Refus d’obtempérer, contrôle d’identité
Comme d’habitude, faut toujours qu’y en ait un qui s'branle qui jacte
Comme chez nous, faut toujours qu’y en ait un pour les ficha
Ce soir là, y’avait l’poto qui dormait dans sa caisse
Réveillé pour donner sa pièce, contrôle alcootest
Il avait bu, il avait mal garé son 307
Brutalisé sous l’me-seu du capitaine et ses collègues
Manque de pot la mif est grande, y’avait 2 d’ses frelons
Ça part en couilles de tous les tés-cô, outrage et rébellion
Strangulations, balayettes, patates dans la mâchoire
Dispersion on s’revoit main-de, là faut vé-squi l’tier-quar

Ils doivent se faire monter en l'air pour mieux redescendre sur terre 
On veut tous reposer en paix, pour ça que tout l'monde est en guerre 
Et si la coke est claire c'est qu'elle doit s'prendre dans la nuit noire 
Et si mes pensées sont claires c'est qu'elle est pas encore venue m'voir 
J'avais grave des idéaux, j'ai vu trop d'choses donc j'ai dis « oh » 
J'serais pas l'idiot qui s'baisse chaque jour pour chier et qui s'dit oh 
J'ai pas d'sous et plein d'soucis, une envie fou de s'mettre sous weed 
Bien que la rue soit en béton elle construit pas de mecs solides 
Si l'temps était de l'argent les clochards seraient pressés 
Plus j'prend conscience de la mort plus mon avenir rétréci

J'suis cultivé mais pour la France analphabète 
JR Ochrome a.k.a. la dernière lettre de l'alphabet 
Décevant comme mon statut social 
Délinquant donc pas très fréquentable 
J'guette mon affaire les yeux plissés sur une jambe 
Jongle avec les flammes Rindek (Attention) à pas glisser sur d'l'essence 
Akhi j'suis aussi noir que le tié-quar que j'fréquente 
Si j'te disais que son bitume est cagoulé qu'est-ce que t'en penses ? 
Réfléchis vite quand une bande déboule 
Infériorité numérique ça tue ou ça s'mange des coups 
La rue c'est réaliste en gros c'est crue ter les gars d'chez nous 
Si j'me définissais moi j'serais l'enclume dans un gant d'velours 
Postiché comme des C.R.S. 
On s'fait la guerre on s'fait la gueule quand c'est la hass 
J'cogite régulièrement pour mailler y'a pas d'magie 
Le ghetto t'joue des tours à la David Copperfield 
Paris Centre 75 plus d'une fois j'ai bu la tasse 
Chez moi ça marche rabbate à reculons dans une impasse 
Moi j'reviens d'loin, des keufs des shayatine (diables) sur les côtes 
Avec un p'tit arrière gout d'sucre sur le dos

T'as les poches pleines tu crois p'tet que ton cake sent le Givenchy 
Mais saches que même sur les plus beaux monuments les pigeons chient 
Ce monde est éphémère tout ce qui s'y trouve péri 
Et si t'aimes tant la vie c'est parce qu'elle te camoufle ses rides 
On m'a dit « jettes toi à l'eau » j'ai bu la tasse 
J'ai voulu remonter à bord y'avait plus la place 
Là j'ai compris qu'ici souvent c'est chacun pour soi 
Limite on t'dit « si t'es pas venu pour m'faire un chèque pousses toi » 
J'ai trop ché-mar j'ai des fourmis dans les iepds 
J'me prend une nouvelle paire si j'peux m'les fournir sans les yaip (payer) 
Oui j'ai tourner dans les iefs (fiefs) j'ai p'tet manger plus de 100 tiep 
J'ai vu que ceux qui n'ont rien partagent et que les riches sont sans tièp (pitié) 
J'veux pas finir en iench à quatre te-pa 
Quand la richesse tente de nous phone ici on capte pas
Tu veux diriger ta vie mais t'as pas la clef d'contact 
C'est pour compter leur tune qu'ils t'ont nommé comptable 
Poto, t'es seul avec ou sans amis 
L'amitié perd de sa valeur comme un pain sans sa mie 
Bref, tout ça pour dire qu'en résumé [en résumé] 
Elle fait flipper la race humaine [elle fait flipper la race humaine *3] 

J'essaye de grimper l'échelle sociale avec une jambe de bois 
Je n'attend rien d'une courte échelle vu la hauteur d'mes ambitions 
Dur de démarrer la course avec une paire de Atemi 
Quel âge à celui qui dit qu'avec le temps la douleur s'atténue 
C'est dur de réussir sa vie tout comme de rater sa mort 
Certains me disent depuis le temps que tu fais du rap ça mors ? 
J'ai beau leurs dire qu'on est pas sorti de l'auberge 
Tellement j'en chie de loin tu peux même sentir l'odeur 
Un quart de vie passé avec des sparadraps c'est pas un drame 
On s'barre à Dam attendre le prochain paragraphe 
Akhi, on m'avait dit que la France était un eldorado 
Dès l'atterrissage ils m'ont collé un poisson d'avril dans l'dos 
Les années passent les saisons changent 
Les problèmes viennent plus des cours de maths mais d'avoir la peau mâte 
Comment prouver qu'j'suis oppressé les chaines sont invisibles 
Les mecs s'efforcent de faire dans l'subtile mais restent prévisibles 
Mes gars n'ont plus la forme humaine 
A contresens sur un circuit de formule 1 
Ferme la et range tes formulaires, j'vais te l'formuler 
Autrement j'te l'dis fermement j'veux pas faire l'mulet 

J'suis là pour dénoncer pas là pour faire l'pantin 
C'est plus des carottes qu'on s'mange mais des bananes Plantin 
Belek au sourire d'une femme à cause d'elle tu peux perdre le tien 
La trahison nous fait pâlir jusqu'à en perdre le teint 
Pas d'noirs à la télé si c'n'est pour le Sida 
Et l'seul kain-fry qui a la côte chez Disney c'est Simba 
M'invite pas à table j'suis pas dans mon assiette 
Pas l'habitude des couverts nous on partage un bol à 7 
On m'a dit qu'en grandissant la voisine serait moins souriante 
Qu'avec ou sans dents de lait si c'est la hass les souris entrent 
Que rien n'est sûr chaque être humain est en sursis 
C'qui est sûr c'est que chaque paire de fesses qui passe c'est un souci 
Les p'tits peuvent pas arracher les curs ils sont passés au keus 
Et si la nuit porte conseil, bah elle a zappé les geush 
En résumé crois pas que le temps chôme 
Si le monde te sourit akhi saches qu'il a les dents jaunes 
J'aimerai effacé le numéro de tout mes frères écroués 
Mais dans c'monde rien n'est parfait akhi même la lune est trouée 
J'ai les mains sur le cur, les pieds au sol et la tête vers les cieux 
Donc dîtes aux travelos que j'les appellerai toujours Messieurs 

Paname est vivante mon quartier réside dans son zen 
Quand elle éternue, les bicraveurs tombent et prennent du ferme 
Le monde est subtile, saches que c'est pas la taille qui compte 
Car si le président est un nain bah devant lui tu parais si p'tit 
Panam est un chien sans maître donc fuck l'éducatrice 
Moi, j'suis né dans l'creux d'une cicatrice 
Akhi, tu veux des frissons ? touches moi 
Martin Luther King a fait un rêve et Maître Gims a fait un cauchemar 
Tu trouves ça gore et alors ? 
Censurez moi ça changera rien comme un aveugle dans l'noir 
J'suis foutu, caractère de base têtu 
L'être humain n'est que du sperme vêtu 
Les mécréants voudraient voir Dieu 
Essayes d'abord de regarder le soleil dans les yeux
J'me demande plus quand tout ça cessera 
Marre de m'battre pour un quartier qui porte le nom d'un ciste-ra 
Puis ça m'fait chier 
Donc si une meuf me plaît de trop bah je l'imagine en train d'chier 
J'vise la tête j'ai plus le temps pour les essais 
Et si le monde t'ouvre ses bras bah saches
Qu'il fouette des aisselles
Fouette des aisselles, fouette des aisselles

Moi inch'Allah j'vais pas repartir comme j'suis arriver
En faisant souffrir la daronne encore pire la voir crier 
On ira tous au paradis n'est qu'une chanson d'Enfoirés 
Et tes et tes hassanets ils s'trouvent pas dans tes putains d'soirées
Rien ne marche depuis mes premiers pas
J'me lève tout les jours du pied gauche comme si on m'avait amputé du droit 
Les les qui à dit qui au bled c'est la santé 
Quoi l'argent n'a pas d'odeur tu mens je l'ai senti 
Stop y'a ton gars sûr qui joue au con 
Dis lui qu'il est suivi du regard et que c'est pas celui de la Joconde 
Y'a celui qui mord la vie et celui qui vit la mort 
Dans les deux cas personne peut ves-qui son heure
La beauté de l'homme est dans sa poche 
Si t'es milliardaire t'as l'droit d'être moche 
Religieux que quand ça t'chantes 
Mais les vrais religieux ne chante pas 
Comme d'hab ils diront que les kain-fry divaguent 
Eux ils lisent des livres alors qui y'en a qu'un qui dit vrai
Si l'argent tombait du ciel, ciel ciel ciel
L'avare tiendrait son parapluie à l'envers sans hésiter

Monsieur Diallo, votre enfant a des capacités
En gros, c'est une merde mais moins que des cas pas cités
Tous ces discours m'ont emmené au Bac pro chomdu
et sans taf c'est la hass, et tout l'monde sait qu'le manque de somme tue
J'ai grandi près des quartiers sales et d'la place Vandôme
et j'ai compris qu'mon pote Richesse en fait n'était qu'un fantôme
Alors ça a fait d'moi AD le squatteur de tes goûters
Maintenant j'veux juste squatter les banques car sans tunes personne va t'écouter
J'veux plus qu'ma mère frotte le sol, j'veux qu'on frotte son dos
J'veux mettre aux chiottes les factures akhi mais y'a qu'un seau dos
J'veux nourrir toute la misère, car les p'tits agonisent tant
Mais mon frigo s'mange des hagra comme les reuf' d'Afghanistan
Le Sénégal m'attend, mais merde y'a pas les loves
Donne moi du biff et j'fais danser l'Afrique même sur Yakalélo

Les Keufs te soulèvent si t'as pas les bonnes sappes
Puis c'est comme ça que tu r'trouves des p'tits qui s'cognent, s'tapent
Consomment d'la beu, opèrent en bande ou bossent à deux
Donc il faut mettre de côté pour la baraque au bled
Ici il fait trop gris, t'es mort sans ton para-problème
Mais pour ça j'ai pas les loves, j'dirai pas qu'j'ai pas l'étoffe
Mais tu vas où avec le salaire d'un passeur de balai brosse
Combien d'potes m'ont dit ""Gro j'ai un but, j'ai des idées,
j'veux monter ma te-boî mais j'ai pas l'budget""
Et l'ptit du tiek qui trise-mai l'ballon
Ses darons n'ont ni les ronds, ni les bras longs
Il les rendrait tous ouf au centre de formation

Adama Diallo,"On dit que ce monde est un mirage donc en fait rien n'est acquis,
Le diable joue avec nous et avec un rien nous taquine,
On se fatigue mais tout part vite comme dans un karting
Où ta future carcasse est garée dans ton parking.
Le jour se lève et mon heure fait encore un pas,
J'me tape chaque jour pour rendre à dieu mon corps intact,
Car toutes mes affaires en fait s'appellent revient
Et quand je serai dans ma tombe personne me dira je te rejoins.
A la mairie elle t'appartient pour la vie,
Mais cinq ans plus tard avec un autre elle parcourt la ville,
Quant au succès il t'appartient pas, t'accroches ap,
Si tu loupes le co-ch, le public te fait un croche-pattes.
Tout ce qu'on t'a prêté tu le rends
Même ce que tu bouffes tu le rechies,
Dis-leur chut, l'argent est un fidèle poto dealer de shit.
Dès le choc que j'ai reçu en sachant qu'on était seul j'me suis dit
""Mehlich il m'reste la foi donc j'mets mon front au sol""

Rien ne t'appartient, tu t'attaches aux biens,
Tes amis, ta famille, toutes ces choses qui t'animent
Mais un jour tout s'arrête, ça frêne ta joie de vivre!
Tes attaches, tes habitudes, tout est limité!
Oh wohoh oh wohoh oh wohoh
Oh wohoh oh wohoh oh wohoh

A vouloir tout posséder tu finis par rien avoir,
On sait bien que tout nous quittera mais notre âme ne veut pas le voir,
Si la vie est une prison le bonheur est au parloir.
Tu t'es vendu pour du liquide car ton honneur n'est qu'une passoire!
Accroché au matériel belek akhi c'est qu'un nuage,
Du quelque des soucis qui vont te noyer, il faut que tu nages.
T'aimais madame à en mourir, aujourd'hui c'est lui qu'elle aime
Avec la même fougue qu'y'avait dans vos nuits de rêves!
Le propriétaire ne fait que louer une terre jusqu'à sa mort
Ce monde t'appartient autant qu'Hitler avait de remords
La vie est-elle une illusion à laquelle on s'accroche
Ou la plus grande des convictions pour laquelle l'homme devient atroce?
Même mon corps n'est qu'une location j'évite les tatouages,
On s'imagine à la retraite bien qu'on puisse partir à tout âge
Attaché grave à ton pote mais c'est ton pote qui t'a poucave
Il se foutait de la belle époque, il a tout avoué!

Tout est voué à l'échec, les belles villas les grosses caisses,
Six pieds sous terre rongé par les vers!
Tout est voué à l'échec, quelque soit ton style de vie!
Enfouis sous terre même tes partenaires te laissent solos.

Adama Diallo,"Il avait 19 ans, elle avait la quinzaine
Lui c'était pour un soir elle pour une vie mais ce n'était qu'un jeune
Lui aimait les femmes et arrondir son biff en fin de mois
Fan de formes courbées plus de vingt conquêtes en 5 mois
Elle fan de feuilletons, pensée qu'il allait assumer
Lui pensait plutôt combien de spliff il avait à fumer
Et a quels sapes il mettrait pour ses soirées dansantes
Pendant qu'elle flippait de dire qu'elle était enceinte
Et quand elle lui dit qu'elle était en cloque
Il s'énerva, lui mit une claque, disant 'Tes preuves sont en toc'
Il frappa dans son ventre en disant 'Casse-toi c'est pas moi le père!'
Je peux pas porter ce lourd poids j'préfère celui de mes haltères!

Je suis tout petit, je prends pas beaucoup de place
Je t'imagine quand je suis dans ma classe

Je t'imagine quand je suis dans ma classe

Papa mais t'étais où?
Le jour où je suis né
Aujourd'hui maman ne cesse de me dire qu'on a le même gros nez
J'ai vu une photo d'elle et d'un homme, jeune épanouie
Elle avait le même regard qu'elle porte sur moi, seule ébahie
Papa! Elle te connaît, elle te déteste je sais
Moi c'est pire je te connais pas et je te déteste tu sais
Mais t'étais où?
Le jour de mes 1 ans, mes premiers pas, quand j'comprenais rien
Mes années passent et devant l'école
Le père d'Alpha vient toujours me dire 'Bonjour' franchement il est cool
Et en classe, de quoi j'ai peur et honte à ton avis?
Une question très très gênante, 'Qu'est-ce que ton père fait dans la vie?'
Dans quelques jours j'aurai 8 ans
Je suis le joker de mon club de foot qu'on fait rentrer à la mi-temps
Tel père tel fils, rien que pour ce point commun,
Mais pour devenir un homme, je fais comment?

Je t'imagine quand je suis dans ma classe

Poto je te parle d'un papy, qu'a presque 100 ans
C'est devant la fenêtre de sa chambre qui passe tout son temps
Il est devenu dingue te diront les infirmières
Elles ont besoin de la chambre, elle le préférerait au cimetière
Les psychanalystes multiplient les analyses mais banalisent son cas puis
Négligent la haine qu'il canalise
Ses membres se paralysent, seul il prépare la liste
Des biens qu'il léguera à son fils
Pendant que celui-ci se barre à Nice
L'enfoiré est devenu généraliste
Il a une femme, des gosses, écrit tout au?
Mais, il a foutu son père en maison de retraite
C'est pour ça que je lui souhaite, qu'on le jette dans une maison de traître
Des fois la nuit, ses pensées quitte l'hospice
Il se rappelle de quand au lit son gosse pissait
Il se rappelle du centre commercial
Et des flaques de larme qu'il laissait au sol quand il chiale
Toute sa vie il a, supporté ses caprices
Aujourd'hui la seule qui le visite c'est la rééducatrice
Il voulait sa villa, ses pauses sous Pastis
Maintenant pour pioncer des cachetons faut que tu lui en passes 10",Tel père tel fils,2010

Adams/Pullen Quartet,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Solitude,1994

'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby
(We belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby

It's still so hard to believe

Who's gonna take your place

Happens every time
You start to lose yourself
You turn to blame the one
That loves you the most
To stay and work it out is harder
Than to run away
So she leaves a note
Because to his face she couldn't say
""Bye bye my childhood dream man
I will keep in touch if I can

Hold on

Spent the best years of my life with you""

Worlds collide, time to decide

Where you want to go in this great big world

Lost on a street, everyone has
Vanished and you're all alone
But you don't know where to go
Yeah you're all alone
And you want to go home

Run just as fast as you can
Run, 'til you reach the end
Where the fallen finally land
And your world starts over again

Stumble upon the strength to move on
I am not alone in this great big world
And you are not alone in this great big world

Run now don't you look back
Run towards the light straight ahead
Where the lost souls make a beautiful sound
And new life is finally found

Then just what am I afraid of
When I call out your name

Everything rides on hope now
Everything rides on faith somehow

Your crazy schemes,
They always let you down.
The things we chase,
A hopeless race,
You're breathless, off the ground.
From soaring highs to crash-and-dies,
A peace yet to be found.
But you could spend a lifetime running.
You could spend a lifetime running.

And do you feel the fire when the flame gets hot?
Are you living every day like it's the last you got?
Will you step aside when it all falls down,
And watch it burn away?
Have a little faith when the walls cave in,
Pray for strength to fly against the wind.
Will you walk away when the fire gets hot,
Or fight another
Another day, yeah.
Another day, yeah.

Your fractured heart,
Your disregard,
It leaves you frozen still.

Dear babe I'll always love you and every night I think of you
'cause baby our love is strong
Dear babe you're constantly running through, through my mind
I promise in my heart you'll find, baby

Verse 1 -
It doesn't seem a big surprise to me
How I fell in love with such a queen
I would give her everything she needs
'cause deep inside my heart she is everything
I try my best to keep the love alive
And in the end she's turned away and cried
Love is crying and my heart is true
I have one thing to say and that is I love you baby

Chorus

Verse 2 -
I'm thanking you for the times we shared
For every moment that you said you cared
I didn't tell you but it meant a lot
To know that you loved me no matter what the cost
I guess I'm tryna say that in the end
All I really wanted was just a friend
I'll always be calling you baby boo
'cause in reality I'm still in love with you baby

Bridge -
When we fell in love my heart just fell apart
'cause I knew I couldn't live without you next to me
I need you right by my side so you can feel my honesty
Dear babe I'll always love you down in my heart

Sail away with me to another world

I can't live without you if the love is gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever

Ich will nach Las Vegas, alles was ich hab auf Rot
Haus weg, Pferd weg, Klappe zu, Affe tot
Ich will zur Ruhe kommen, kein Streit, kein Stress
Vorausgesetzt das man mir noch n bisschen Zeit lässt
Wenn ich dann fertig bin, hol mich da raus
Doch bis dahin kommst du gut ohne mich aus

Okay, warte kurz, guckt mich an, siehst du das
Ich bin cool, dies und das, ich freu' mir 'n riesen Ast
Ich mach das hier für die Leute die das hier lieben lasst
Mich einfach in Frieden wenn ihr Sido hasst
Punkt aus!

Ich bin ein gemachter Mann, guckt was ich erreicht hab
Eigentlich könnte man sagen so wie's ist reicht das
Aber es reicht nicht, nein, ich kann nicht bescheiden sein
Ich will so vieles noch erleben vor dem weisen Heim
Ich will den Jackpot im Lotto gewinnen
Und damit alle meine Schäfchen ins Trockene bring
Ich will high und frei sein wie eine Flocke im Wind,
Ansonsten schrei' ich wie ein bockiges Kind und dann wird's wieder eklig
Ich hab schon viel erlebt, ich hab aber noch soviel vor
Und ihr alle guckt mir dabei zu auf euern Monitor
Bis sie mir irgendwann das große Licht ausschalten,
Doch der Himmel muss es erstmal ohne mich aushalten. (Yeah)

Ich ruf es nach oben (Aha)
Der Himmel soll warten
Denn ich hab noch was vor (Yeah)
Der Himmel muss warten (Yeah)

Wenn alles vorbei ist
Nimm mir den Atem
Doch noch bleib ich hier
Der Himmel soll warten

Warte mal, Stopp, du kannst mich noch nicht gehn lassen,
Nimm dir doch lieber diese Emos die ihr Leben hassen
Ich bin noch lange nicht fertig, es fängt doch gerade an
Ich hab am Sack doch gerad' mal Haare dran, 3 Stück!
Ich will mein Sohn wachsen sehen, ich will 'ne Tochter
Und dann nach 9 Monaten von mir aus gleich nochmal
Ich will ein Haus, 'nen Affen und ein Pferd
Lass mich machen, all das werd' ich schaffen und noch mehr (Yeah)
Ich will Karriere machen, ich will noch weiter Hoch
Ich will in China mal ein Hund kosten, einfach so
Ich will nach Las Vegas alles was ich hab auf rot
Haus weg, Pferd weg, Klappe zu Affe tot
Ich will zur Ruhe kommen, kein Streit kein Stress
Vorausgesetzt das man mir noch 'n bisschen Zeit lässt
Wenn ich dann fertig bin hol mich nach Haus'
Doch bis dahin kommst du gut ohne mich aus
Und ich sing „Hallelulia""

Ich ruf es nach oben (Yeah)

Mich erreichst do nicht.

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I really thought the pain would pass.
It's been nearly an hour,
Since I thought of you.

But your not answering the phone,
I'd settle for a busy tone,
At least that I'd know that you're okay.
A girl like you ain't meant to go away.
Oh

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,

I'm tired of this empty house,
I need a drink to get me out.
A couple more til I forget your name.

I saw a boy that looked like you,
I didn't know quite what to do,
It took a power of will to break my stare.
I realized what I wanted wasn't there.

Now that it's over,

I look away, I look away
And if your mind is made up
I look away, I will look away

Adele,"I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees.

But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you.

So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper ""will you leave your man? ""
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you.

Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!

I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right

Than you ever did me before.

And lay yourself down!

Adele,"This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away

It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave

Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away

Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away",Hiding My Heart [*],2011

Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it
With a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

We could've had it all
We could've had it all
It all, it all, it all,
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand

Haven't you heard the rumors

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song

In case it is the last time

Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care

Adele,"This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away

It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave

Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away

Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away",Hiding My Heart,2017

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Adele Astaire,"A babbitt met a bromide on the avenue one day,
And held a conversation in their own peculiar way;

They both were solid citizens, they both had been around,
And as they spoke you clearly saw their feet were on the ground!

How's the folks?

How's the wife?
Got to run!
Oh my!
Ta-ta!

Goodbye!


Ten years went quickly by for both these subste-antial men,
And then it happened that one day they chanced to meet again!

That they had both developed in ten years there was no doubt,
And so of course they had an awful lot to talk about!

What's new?
How's the wife?
Got to run!

Ta-ta!
Olive oil!
Goodbye!


Before they met again, some twenty years they had to wait;
This time it happened up above, inside Saint Peter's gate!

A harp each one was carrying, and both were wearing wings,
and this is what they said as they were strumming on the strings;

Up on the top of a snow-covered mountain
There lived an Alpine miss
And oh, what a sweet little miss was this
We mean this little Swiss miss

While down in the valley below (Ho-ho)
Lived a boy who loved her so (Ho-ho)
He loved her with all his might
He loved her day and night

And every night just to see this miss
He used to risk his scalp
For the house where she lived was away up high
And the poor guy didn't know how to fly
So he jumped from alp to alp
What a chump (What a chump)
To jump (To jump)
From alp to alp

And then beneath her balcony
He used to stand around and try to make a hit with her
And he would yodel, ""O-lay-eee-tee""
That's the Swiss idea of a melody
And oh, what a yodeling fool was he
He shook a wicked yodel

And one night as he stood there
The lights were very dim
While leaning out too far across her balcony
She fell for him
He sat with his arms around her
Until the night was gone
And here's the way they carried on

He said, ""Dear I think you're just as sweet as you can be
You're like a cake of sweet Swiss chocolate to me""
She said, ""Oh, my loving one, your talk I can't resist
I hope you're as steady as the Swiss watch ticking on your wrist""

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2009
Adele Urbiztondo,"Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Ha, close to you

Adele Zane,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things

Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,2000
Adele Zane,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you
",Cry Me a River,2005
Adele Zane,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
",What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life,2005
Adele Zane,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2005
