(Oh, oh oh oh oh ooh-ah-ah, only the lonely, only the lonely)

Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)
Know the way I feel tonight (Ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah)
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)
Know this feeling ain't right (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)

There goes my baby, there goes my heart
They're gone forever, so far apart
But only the lonely know wh-why-why I cry, only the lonely 
(Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah, ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah)
(Oh, oh oh oh oh ooh-ah-ah, only the lonely, only the lonely)

Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)
Know the heartaches I've been through (Ooh yay, yay, yay, yeah
Only the lonely (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)
Know I cry and cry for you (Dum-dumb-dummy doo-wah)

Maybe tomorrow a new romance
No-o-o more sorrow, but that's the chance
You've got to take, if your lonely heart breaks

Dennis Wage,"Just runnin' scared each place we go
So afraid that he might show
Yeah, runnin' scared, what would I do
If he came back and wanted you

Just runnin' scared, feelin' low
Runnin' scared, you love him so
Just runnin' scared, afraid to lose
If he came back which one would you choose

Then all at once he was standing there
So sure of himself, his head in the air
My heart was breaking, which one would it be
You turned around and walked away with me.",Running Scared,2000
Dennis Wage,"When I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There's just no way to hide

From that old lovin' you feelin' again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you

I remember how you always get that certain look in your eye
You're not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
'Cause that old lovin' you feeling again (lovin' you feelin)
It's really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you
Lovin' you feelin', lovin' you feelin' with you

We were so close
We were too far apart
I gave you my love
I wanted your heart

Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that lovin' you feelin' again
It's really got me reeling again (lovin' you)
Will it ever stop and not start over again 
That lovin' you feelin' again

No matter how much I've tried
This lovin' you feelin' inside
It's taken such a long, long, time
To say goodbye

And getting over you
Is so hard to do
With this feelin'
Lovin' you

That lovin' you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again
That lovin' you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again
That lovin' you feelin' again

Dennis Warner,"There's something in the way she moves
Or looks my way, or calls my name
That seems to leave this troubled world behind
If I'm feeling down and blue
Or troubled by some foolish game
She always seems to make me change my mind

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now
Almost all the time
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine

Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
Yes and silently remind me
The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them

It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
It doesn't much matter what they mean
What she says them mostly just to calm me down

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now
Almost all the time
If I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
Yes and I feel fine",Something in the Way She Moves,1995

Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

Dennis Wilson,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2009
Dennis Wilson,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2009
Dennis Wilson,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,2009
Dennis Wilson,"I know a carpenter who had a dream
Killed the man but you couldn't kill the dream
Who said it was easy
People gotta be free
And the band keeps on playin'

I know people who want to go far
Make big movies and become a star
People got to dream
Dreamer who said it was easy
And the band played
Play for me

Now I've seen people from near and far
They couldn't get to heaven in their car
Who said it was easy
Driver drive on uh

Oooo let the wind carry your blues away
That's all we're tryin' to say
How 'bout a better day
Fall in love

Warmed by the blood of the cold hearted

Tickets torn in half, memories in bits and pieces
Traces of love, long ago, that didn't work out right

The ring she used to wear, pages from an old love letter
Traces of love, long ago, that didn't work out right

The ring she used to wear, pages from an old love letter
Traces of love, long ago, that didn't work out right

I close my eyes and say a prayer
That in her heart, she'll find, a trace of love still there,

These, traces of tears, from my eyes.

Denny Dias,"In the mornin' you go gunnin' for the man who stole your water
And you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the border
And the mourners are all singin' as they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isn't hangin' and they put you on the street

[Chorus]
You go back, Jack, do it again, wheels turinin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

When you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer, and you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one, and she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smilin'; you'll be on your knees tomorrow

[Chorus]

Now you swear and kick and beg us that yopu're not a gamblin' man;
Then you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your hand
Your black cards can bring you money so you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey you must put them on the table

[Chorus]",Do It Again,2007
Denny Dias,"You used to be on fire, now you chill me to the bone
We used to fly like angels, now we're sinking like a stone
You say you're trying to help me but that ain't the way it feels
I think you're trying to kill me with those stiletto heels

Paint the town black babe and let that pendulum swing
I been stabbed in the back babe
And if you don't love me, I'll never feel a thing

And oh, one thing I know, there's only one place left for me to go

[Chorus:]

Going back to the kingdom of desire, going down to the valley of the gun
I'm gonna stand too close to the fire, I'm gonna fly too close to the sun

They say the king of love sleeps on a velvet bed
My sheets feel like sandpaper, and my pillow feels like lead
But as sure as Atlantis sank into the sea
I'm sinking like a stone babe, that's how it's got to be

Paint the town black babe and let that pendulum swing
I been stabbed in the back babe
And if you don't love me, I'll never feel a thing

And oh, if I don't have you, there's only one thing left for me to do

When you dig up God's little acre, you lose all peace of mind
You stare into the distance, looking for a sign
But that sign it never comes babe, your wishes won't come true
You keep praying for the rain while the sun beats down on you

And oh, one thing I know, there's only one place left for me to go

I'm gonna fly too close to the sun, yeah
I'm gonna fly too close to the sun",Chain Lightning,2017
Denny Doherty,"Got dust on my piano
And dishes in the sink
Your side of the bed is cold
I haven't slept a wink
So I read your goodbye letter
To the face inside my drink
Lay me down and roll me out to sea

Got your picture in my wallet
And some pictures in my mind
A pocketful of memories
I never thought I'd find
And it's rainin' like a Monday
And the world seems so unkind
So lay me down and roll me out to sea

Lay me down, roll me out to sea
Calling on a mighty wave to cover me
Lay me down
Roll me out to sea
Heaven, if you're ready shine your light on me

Now listen to my story
Cause I haven't told it all

She turned to me and called

Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain.
The dark days are gone, and the bright days are here,
My Sunny one shines so sincere.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet.
Sunny, thank you for the love you brought my way.
You gave to me your all and all.
Now I feel ten feet tall.

And the rock was formed when you held my hand.

Denny Lahome,"Lo sai come si fa
Se il tuo disco non va
E non hai neanche un fan?
Sono underground
E se lei non ci sta
E ti rimbalzano al club
Lo sai come si fa?

Le canzoni d'amore
Ah, mi fan salire l'odio
Quando chi le scrive è già arrivato al terzo matrimonio
Svuotando i contenuti
Riempiendosi il portafoglio
Poi si passano le groupie
Catene di Sant'Antonio
San Valentino, scusa non ha il santino
È come se Cupido lanciasse frecce al mio intestino
Ma questo non significa che io non provi amore
Trovo sia triste fare business col dolore
E se la tua canzone non ha quella melodia
Qui la radio non ti prende, come in galleria
O sei Vasco o Ligabue
O fai ridere o fai piangere
La politica in Italia sa far bene tutti e due

E I rapper italiani sono un po' come i politici
Che prima è tutto un business
Ma alla fine è tutto un featuring
Trasgressivi sì
Ma con certi limiti
Per un pubblico di anziani e di bambini piccoli

Le canzoni d'amore mi mandano in down
La musica happy, non mi piace il sound
E combatto ogni giorno, combatto ogni round
Vivo underground
Vivo underground

Oggi va di moda essere fuori moda
Quindi butto via le Jordan e metto anch'io le Hogan

Da quando si usa, snobbare ciò che funziona
E I cantautori non vanno come i vegani da McDonald
Tu fai soldi con il rap, non esiste
Non me la prendo se mi scrivi, ""Sei un fallito!""
Vedo commenti negativi anche sotto il video dei Beatles
Una marea di pischelli che fanno il dito
Per me meno ribelli di quelli con il sorriso
Siam passati da sono tutti un mito a fanno tutti schifo
Dai prodotti Bio a fare la spesa al Lidl
Da una manifestazione ad un insulto anonimo
Dovrebbe fare effetto, spargi odio effetto domino
È cosa molto seria, essere comico

Le canzoni d'amore mi mandano in down
La musica happy, non mi piace il sound
E combatto ogni giorno, combatto ogni round

It never was much a kind of a bode
Glasgow town never brought me down
When I was heading out on the road
Carlisle city never looked so pretty
And the Kendal freeway's fast
Slow down driver want to stay alive
I want to make this journey last

Helen, hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen, hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

M six south down to Liverpool
Where they play the west coast sound
Sailor Sam he came from Birmingham
But he never will be found
Doing fine when a London sign
Greets me like a long lost friend
Mister Motor won't you check her out
She's got to take me back again

Helen, hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen, hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

Got no time for a rum and lime
I want to get my right foot down
Shake some dust off of this old bus
I gotta get her out of town
Spend the day up on the motorway
Where the carburetors blast
Slow down driver want to stay alive
I want to make this journey last

And they never gonna take her away

You and I now that's a hot couple
When it's off in the same club
Now you askin' for nothing but trouble
Watch you jumpin' at the Red Labels
Got my woman and her girlfriends dancin' on the tables
Shut down the joint, me I'm just laidback and all
Surrounded by the gangsters puffin' on the cigar
Badder chick in the world keep niggaz cranked
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked
The question is can you top that homie
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie
Not even, could have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost will be pokin' the steel
Read my will my boys get it all no gimmicks
But I'm here to let you know my jump off is off limits
Life and love get made for a thug
Once I settled in you made me a gentleman

Tot game is crazy diamonds off the lettle
Travel through these ghettos drop to top
Let 'em see what I'm workin' with came to win
How the don keeps the fun to blow in the wind
World war is magnetic that attracts loot
She look Wall Street briefcase, pen strife suit
The hair rub in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
They say a woman's never satisfied
Till she have me to fill it to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me
Your C.L. is, love me or love me not

You're beautiful, the way you wear that, share that
Have many ladies, but nothing can compare to that smile
That style that drives men wild
That ring could have Big Daddy walkin' down the isle
Proper you a show stopper, girl endure dropper
I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know whose jay in it
Oh how lucky are we catch you comin' out the shower
And I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves
Anything you want, all she deserves
Baby calm your nerves make this work
Only thing in life you fear is being hurt

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me,1995

Dente,"Where there is love there is a peace 
And in the cages that bind the bitter heart it is release 
Hold it close to your chest, let it move and let it rest 
For it is here to set your mind at ease 
Where there is love there is a peace. 

Where there is hope there is a dream 
To rise above, to remit and to redeem 
To go back, to go where there's no hurt or anger there 
To find the song that you once could sing 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is faith there is a chance 
To alter the course and fight the winds of circumstance 
Not to scar, but mend, not to break, but to bend 
And not to know but to understand 
Where there is faith there is a chance 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is love there is a peace...

Dente,"C'è un aereo sepolto
All'inizio del deserto del tuo petto
Che è un sentiero nel mezzo
Che porta a un pozzo

E intorno cupole di cattedrali
Da cui i miei occhi non vanno più via
Dove se chiedi una promessa è molto facile che non ci sia
E sotto sagome di trincee

Immacolati i pentagrammi
Che nascondono il nascondiglio
Della più bella delle melodie
E poi c'è il fondo di un mar profondo

Dove fa male l'allegria
Si espande in spuma di alghe bianche
La scia che lascia la fantasia

Infondo gambe senza bugie
Infondo pali di palafitte
Alberi di nave
Senza radici
Senza più energie

E alla fine delle vele dei polpacci
Una complessa geometria
Che ti mantiene in equilibrio
Che ti permette di scappare via

Questo è quasi tutto
Quasi tutto quello che ho scritto

Denver Brass,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ich komm' allein, meine Freunde haben kein Bock
Doch ich hab Hunger und aufm Facebook-Flyer war die Rede
Davon, dass es Fingerfood auf deiner Releaseparty gäbe
Und nun lass' ich mich tatsächlich, wenn auch widerwillig
Für paar Spieße „Satay Chicken“ auf der Party blicken
Und lass' es über mich ergehen, das Gedresche all der Phrasen
Und diese „Wann-kommt'n-endlich-das-neue-Album?“ Fragen
Und du fragst mich, wie es Jan geht?
Ah, ich frage mich, was dich das angeht
Ich will hier weg, ich muss pissen und dein Telefon klingelt
Doch ich warte vergebens, dass du Spacken endlich rangehst
Ah, nee, ich war noch nie in Kaiserslautern
Und bagger' mit dir jetzt auch keine heißen Frauen an
Und nein, es gibt keine zweite Staffel bei VOX
Und ich war auch noch nie auf deinem supergeilen Blog
Und ja, die Hose ist ganz cool (ja)
Nee, die ist von COS, sorry, Digga, ich muss los
(Ähm, ich wollt' mal sagen-)
Nee, ich bin heute einfach nur nicht so gut drauf (gut, tschüss!)
Ja, genau, du mich auch, ich hab kein Bock

Du bist doch das Letzte, ich bin das Nächste
Backpfeife links, rechts, einfach so als Geste, zack zack
Du fragst mich: ""Bartek, wann kommt
Denn endlich dein Album raus?"" Erst, wenn MTV Pay-TV ist
Deutschland geht's besser ohne dich
Ich will dich umarmen und stech' dich ab, Freudscher Verbrecher

Sag's dir nur einmal, klar, Mann? Hab keine Zeit für Palaver
Was fällt dir ein, was du laberst?
Ich schwör' dir, wenn du mich noch einmal nach Gras fragst
Abturn, wie ich reagier'
Guck, das hier ist kein Debattier-Club, still jetzt
Will ihn nicht hören, deinen Freestyle-Rap
Du Besoffener, was du dir einbildest
Chill mal, ich mach' nur mein' Job, habe grade mein Ott
Also laber kein' Trott und wir machen ein Bild
Denn dann macht's gleich ""Stopp""
Wie Ziegenwitwen, ich habe kein Bock
Du redest zu viel und du redest zu feucht
Ich tu' so, als ob ich nix reden gut deutsch
Als ob ich Hörgeräte nun bräuchte

Was wir reichen sind geballte Fäuste und keine Hände
Euer Niedergang für immer

Falscher Ort, falsche Zeit, da hilft dir auch nicht tapfer sein
Wie viel Blut muss fließen in innerdeutschen Krisen
Alter, schau die letzen Jahre haben das mir zu oft bewiesen
Dass die Menschen sich erheben, wenn die Leute nicht mehr leben

Also, wie ist das möglich? Manchmal ist es doch tödlich

Rechte Politik gefällt den rechten Wählern
Rechte Polizisten helfen rechten Tätern
Rechte Zellen in unserm Heer kommen nicht von ungefähr
Wehrmachtsveteranen starteten die Bundeswehr
Für viele ist das nur Geschichte und nicht mehr
Die alten Geschichten interessieren die Jungen nicht mehr

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
Now I see there's joy inside your arms

Every day I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now I see this star is on earth

And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life

And I am happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
Ever since the day you came inside of my life

Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom

Denzal Sinclaire,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2006
Denzal Sinclaire,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2006
Denzal Sinclaire,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone

They don't wanna see us go
They don't wanna see us grow
Stepping down on the edge
Stepping out on the ledge
They don't wanna see us there
They just wanna see us here

Call crazy comrade, catch us on the cover
Couldn't catch a anaconda, accumaliting the karma
Full off black missed a medal get fellon 'till I collapse 'cause I can't change the fact, so in fact I reenact
Read it back, reading in braille
Can Ray Charles see what he feel
I'm gassed up when I'm out of my chill
So he bringing them hell, I'm fresh out of jail
It's time to prevail gotta kill you niggas or my name isn't Nell
Denzel with the blues, bet they can't rely on Eli
12 get the A when they see I
And they know just what we do, still tryna end true real nigga
Try and cop a feel and send 'em to the cotton field
Everything light bright in my eyesight
There goes the neighborhood is just a way to say white flight
They hate at first sight, 'cause love will never treat 'em but a right life gotta give 'em light
But we live our right

I know you don't understand
I done lost too many friends, I'm just hoping that you'll beam me up with you

All I see is the opposite plotting
Niggas get kilt like a skirt in Scotland
Who mad, crackers wanna box me in like plaid
But I got 'em spinning out of control, no Taz
Too many devils to deal with
Currently camouflaging the coat of chameleons
Blend, tricked by the Rumpelstiltskin
Saying I make all but tryna to take my ends
Real world one scene when I descend
Got a nigga crossed up like a quarter nick grin
I'm rock shit like ISIS, Isaac I'm Newton Huey when shooting, might as well recruit me

Bodies on top of bodies they're always movin' in silence
I was ridin' at three in the mornin'
Hopin' they don't find me
My warrants came with a warning
You'll never see me in court bitch
It's hide n seek for every nigga in the street
Errbody want a body errbody wanna beat it
Bigger bullet bustin' than anybody that got the heat
Errbody wanna talk, errbody wanna tweet
Why the pistol in the lining only hide it when the cops out
They were lookin' for a plea or a cop out
Droppin' bullets off inside a nigga Dropbox
Why they always tryna get into the hotspot
Niggas really lose minds, but not I
I done came from a place with a face every city never seen
But a jail cell popular
Just showin' you what I see through my optical
This how a motherfucker sound when his options up

I know you don't understand
I done lost too many friends, I'm just hoping that you'll beam me up with you

I done alot of wrong in my life, as I reflect on my inner thoughts I can see alot of wrong in my rights
I condone in the light
'Cause the darkness within me tend to start
So I let the spark roam through the night
'Cause I'm blind to the fact
A black man could barely survive an attack that the government's residents
Lash at his back
Stacks prove that the truth is bruisin'
How people gotta act like they like it
But me, I could never wait
I must evolve with my fate
Fakeness dissolving the hate
This as real as it gets
Sinners get healed in the ditch

Play my cards just 'cause it's harder come to recognize I got a clean slate
And finally getting to the point of feeling free-ee
Hovers my energy
Body scars put the pain in my heartbeat so I gotta drop ether
We touch the soul because we young niggas that gotta eat
They perpetrating promoting the shit they gotta reap
My family is the reason that I even speak
Every decent memory of people still be living shife
And you ain't really gotta die to lose your life
Think about it, it's a lot of niggas living outta sight

Denzel Curry,"It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now
I cannot love 'cause it hurts me
I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now

Everything is backwards mother's saying that I'm sinning
Close my eyes and say ""forgive me""
'Cause I know the devil lame
Devil told my mother in the end that he'll be winning
'Cause the world is full of sinning
No your son is not a saint
Spirit of God and the holy ghost it was written in anecdotes
That a snake would try to corrupt what he create
Sick of facades and the horoscope I devour the antidote
Told my mother that I was spirited away
Monstrosity murdering masterpieces, I'm mutilated
Falling forever, fear and forsaken, incinerated
Innocence inferno when I'm no longer incubated
Welcome to the world whenever I'm reincarnated
Relying on the last breath, but y'all would never know
Rewind it to the last step, play me when I'm below
If heaven's set on fire that's the day they make hell snow
The devil want my soul and yet I'm telling him ""hell no""
It's still like this...

Infinite words couldn't curse me now

Everything is backwards ever since the new beginning
God has given me the vision so that I can see my fate
Blind can't lead the blind and if we try then we'll be spinning
In a cycle in position trying to find a better place
Lucifer, devil, the anti-Christ taking light up out of my life
In the darkness, it seems to me there's no escape
Initially alter it into dark, place the pain inside of a pot
And then bury it in a spot where I decay
It's death before dishonor I'm a hideous disfigurement
Who's dying from the envious evil trapped in Floridians
Came from the Vatican, kill off the advocate
Feeling inadequate, when a bitch nigga bleed
Won't even make it to see 23, yeah, fuck it I don't wanna be
Here, look at the time when I'm turning it back
On the clock and my right hand making it tick
Life is a bitch, better yet it's a pit
And my hatred is everything making you sick
Regurgitated, early stages, earn the hatred
Burn the sages, caught in mazes
Instigated, inspiration, imitations
Only here, reanimated, damn!

Drifted apart?

Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours,

I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow

Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,2003

You go back, Jack, do it again, wheels turinin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

When you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer, and you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one, and she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smilin'; you'll be on your knees tomorrow

[Chorus]

Now you swear and kick and beg us that yopu're not a gamblin' man;
Then you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your hand
Your black cards can bring you money so you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey you must put them on the table

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1975

it's only there trying to fool the public

Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care

Should have hidden it, shouldn't you
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through

It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth

Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth

Never again
Is what you swore
The time before
Never again
Is what you swore
The time before

Now you're standing there tongue tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell

To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

But this time I think I mean it for sure
We have reached a full stop
Nothing's gonna save us from the big drop 
Reached our natural conclusion
Outlived the illusion
I hate being in these situations
That call for diplomatic relations 
If I only knew the answer
Or I thought we had a chance
Or I could stop this
I would stop this thing from spreading like a cancer 
What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore
What can I say? I'm heading for the door
I can't stand this emotional violence
Leave in silence 
We've been running around in circles all year
Doing this and that and getting nowhere
This'll be the last time
(I think I said that last time) 
If I only had a potion,
Some magical lotion
That could stop this, I would stop this
I would set the wheels in motion 
What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore
What can I say? I'm heading for the door
I can't stand this emotional violence
Leave in silence
",Leave in Silence,1982
Depeche Mode,"I've read more than a hundred books
Seen love mentioned many thousand times
But despite all the places I've looked
It's still no clearer it's just not enough
I'm still no nearer the meaning of love

Noted down all my observations
Spent an evening watching television
Still I couldn't say with precision
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above
But what's the meaning, the meaning of love?

The meaning of love
Tell me the meaning of love

From the notes that I've made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
But I could be wrong, I'm just not sure you see,
I've never been in love before

Next I asked several friends of mine
If they could spare a few minutes of their time
Their look suggested that I'd lost my mind
Tell me the answer, my Lord high above
Tell me the meaning, the meaning of love

The meaning of love
Tell me the meaning of love

From the notes that I've made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
But I could be wrong, I'm just not sure you see,

Depeche Mode,"Here speaks the voice of reason
It's talking to me loud and clearly
And obviously, it's something to say

Here comes another sentence
It is relentless, it tries my patience
But neverless, it's for our concern

We can't see the benefits
So we'll ignore it or disobey it

I'll have faith, or I prefer

We'll find the solution's

Crying out in pain

Clenched ready for the fight?

And do the things we used to do
And if I'm reluctant you can pull me in
And we can relive our youth

To love

I really like you
I'm attracted to you
The way you move
The things you do
I'll probably burn in hell
For saying this
But I'm really in heaven
Whenever we kiss
But Oh no!
You won't change me
You can try
For an eternity

I wouldn't sacrifice 
Anything at all
To love

Now I've got things to do
You have too
And I've got to be me
You've got to be you
So take my hand
And feel these lips
And let's savor a kiss
Like we'd savor a sip
Of vintage wine
One more time 
Let's surrender
To this love divine

Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one

Experiences have a lasting impression
But words once spoken
Don't mean a lot now
Belief is the way
The way of the innocent
And when I say innocent
I should say naive
So lie to me
But do it with sincerity
Make me listen
Just for a minute
Make me think
There's some truth in it

[Chorus: x2]

Promises made for convenience
Aren't necessarily
What we need
Truth is a word
That's lost its meaning
The truth has become
Merely half-truth
So lie to me
Like they do it in the factory
Make me think
That at the end of the day
Some great reward
Will be coming my way

And in your head it's worse

There's a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free

Can't you see
All love's luxuries
Are here for you an me

And when our worlds
They fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my arms

And when our worlds
They fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it.

How I suffer the sweetest condition

Depeche Mode,"Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh my little girl 
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm 
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable 
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm 

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm 
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Depeche Mode,"Oh, Lilian
Look what you've done
You've stripped my heart
Ripped it apart
In the name of fun

Oh, Lilian
I'm a poor man's son
And precious jewels
Weren't found in schools
Where I came from

Pain and misery
Always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose
What you haven't got

Oh, Lilian
I should have run
I should have known
Each dress you own
Is a loaded gun

Oh, Lilian

Oh, Lilian
I need protection
I hear your voice
And any choice 
I had is gone

Oh, Lilian
Once I begun
I couldn't stop
Till every drop
Of blood was sung
Pain and misery
Always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose
What you haven't got

Look what you've done
You stripped my heart
Ripped it apart
In the name of fun

Come back Come back to me
I've been waiting here patiently

I've been walking a thin white line
Between love and hate
I could use a lil' company
A lil' kindness to go a long way

Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear

In a heart beat
You think your so special
Think your so sweet
What are you trying don't even tempt me
Soon you'll be crying unwishing you dreamt of be
You'll be calling out my name
When you need someone to blame

I can corrupt you
It would be easy
Watching you suffer
God, it would please me

I wanna touch you with my little finger
I know it will crush you my memory would linger
You'd be crying out in pain
Begging me to play my games

It will be ugly
They could sedate you
But what good would drugs be

Depeche Mode,"Well it's a fragile tension, that's keeping us going.
It may not last forever, but of all wind is blowing.

There's something magical in the air.
Some things so tragic we have to care.

It's a strange obsession, it's drawing us nearer.
We don't understand it, it never get's clearer.

There's something mystical in our dreams.
They're so simplistic it kicks and screams.

Oh when we see too recon the art occult that nothing can keep us down.

It's a dizzying feeling that's keeping us flying.
Some glittering gauntlet, without even trying.

Nothing logical to our plans.",Fragile Tension,2009

Depeche Mode,"The way you move
Has got me yearning
The way you move
Has left me burning
I know you know what you're doing to me
I know my hands will never be free
I know what it's like to be
In chains

The way you move
Is meant to haunt me
The way you move
To tempt and taunt me
I know you knew on the day you were born
I know somehow I should've been warned
I know I walk every midnight to dawn
In Chains

In chains, I'm in chains
In chains, I'm in chains

You've got me dying for you
Its you that I'm living through
You've got me praying to you
Saying to you anything you want me to
You've got me reaching for you
My souls beseeching me too
You've got me singing to you
Bringing to you anything you ask me to

The way you move
Is mesmerizing
The way you move
Is hypnotizing
I know I crumble when you are around
Start to mumble a bit of a false sound
Straggle, stumble, shackled and bound
In chains

In chains, I'm in chains
In chains, I'm in chains

Its you that I'm living through

Depeche Mode,"They're almost falling over you
Why don't they call a truce
What ever they are trying to do
Its of little use
They're drowning you in compliments
Trying to furnish proof
Although they speak with eloquence
There is little truth

[Chorus]
You're bright, you're strong, you know the right from wrong
At least to some degree
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough
You smile in sympathy

I'm watching your serenity
The way your so transense
The tidiest absurdities
Your patience never ends
And as the night begins to fade
Your heading for the door
Followed by sad parade
Your on your own once more

Whenever we walk in
You're going straight to hell
For wanton acts of sin, they say
And that I'll have to pay
But I need you just this way

They call you Jezebel
For what you like to wear
You're morally unwell
They say you never care for me
But what the fail to see is that your games are the key

Open their eyes to the beauty
Open their hearts to the fun
Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone

They call you Jezebel
Whenever men walk by
They say that they can tell
The longing in your eyes is real
And how you really feel
But they can't see your appeal

Peace will come to me

I'm leaving bitterness behind
This time I'm cleaning up my mind
There is no space for the regrets
I will remember to forget

Just look at me
I am walking love incarnate
Look at the frequencies of which I vibrate
I'm going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me

I'm leaving anger in the past
With all the shadows that it cast
There is radar in my heart
I should have trusted from the start

Just look at me
I am a living act of holiness
Giving all the positive virtues that I possess
I'm going to light up the world

Depeche Mode,"On another world by another star at another place and time
In another state of consciousness in another state of mind
Everything was almost perfect, everything fell into place,
That you may reach a different verdict,
If all the judges missed the case

In a parallel universe that's happening right now
Things between us must be worse but it's hard to see just how

And everything could have been perfect
Everything in the right place
Then I wouldn't have to play the suspect
Accused, abandoned and disgraced

I didn't choose, i didn't pull the trigger
It wasn't me, i'm just a plain and simple singer
I heard the sound, i turned my head around
To watch our love shot down

In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side
Well no-ones hurt and no-ones cursed and no one needs to hide

And everything is almost perfect
Everything is almost right
There are never any conflicts
There are never any fights",Perfect,2009
