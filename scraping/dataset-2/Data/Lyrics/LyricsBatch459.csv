Jimmy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,1971
Jimmy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"Why do you go on pretending
You know you want to be free
Darling, you know I'll let you go
You'd do the same for me
 
I understand
And darling, you are not to blame
If when we kiss it's not the same
I understand
It's not your fault because your heart has changed it's mind
You didn't mean to be unkind
I understand
Forgetting you will be far from easy
I've grown so used to your charms
I'll miss that old thrill and no one can fill
The place here in my arms
But if you find our love was really meant to be
Then darling, hurry back to me
And I'll understand

Jimmy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill where I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered till my dreams came true

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Tho' we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Tho' we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill",Blueberry Hill,1988
Jimmy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,1988
Jimmy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"I've been carrying a torch so long,
I look like the Statue of Liberty!
My friends say it's so,
And perhaps they ought to know!

They tell me I ought to get around
to give romance another play,
So I've arranged a date this evening,
And I'm on my way.

I'm stepping out with a memory tonight,
To paint the town the way we used to do.
I'll dine at the old cafe where we had so much fun,
And order cocktails for two instead of the usual one.

Then, after dark,
In a Hansom through the park,
While reminiscin' I'll be kissin' you.
A lot of folks may think I'm crazy,
Well maybe they're right,
But I'm steppin' out with a memory tonight.",I'm Stepping Out With a Memory Tonight,1988
Jimmy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1988

So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, make my dreams come true.

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Cherokee,1999

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

I could live without love

Jimmy Doyle,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

Called Tony's push cart

I said it doesn't go you have to push it.

Turn back the pages of history and what do you see
Madison Square Garden, a Rodeo
And there I was
Interviewing a prize winning cow.
I asked her to tell the radio public how she feels
She said mooooooooo
She's contented, I'm contented
But her husband ain't
So what happens?
The bull ups to me, I ups to him
And without any preliminaries
I'm flat on my back
Being a gentlemen I apologize
But the bull's not satisfied.
He demands an autopsy
So I grabs him by the tail and what happens
He flips his tail
I lands on his head
He flips his head
I lands on his tail
He's playing ping pong with me
And I'm losing
Just then the bull is ready to charge again
I gets an idea
I starts singing ""South Of The Border Down Mexico Way""
And what happens
The bull starts crying
But even regardless I keeps on singin'
This time with the castanets
That's too much for the bull and he collapses.
A cheer goes up, I'm saved and the moral is
You've gotta start off each day with a song

You gotta start off each day with a song
(oh boy your singing now)
Even when things go wrong
(oh Jimmy your a wow)
You'd feel better,
You know I'm walking down Broadway
And who taps me on the shoulder
My pal, Hit 'Em In The Head Schwartz
I said who you working for now
He said the same bunch

With a corncob pipe and a button nose

Frosty the snowman is a fairytale they say

Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me

Running here and there all

A day in the country, a night on the town,

Or else the evening you parted, the morning you met,
The love of your life you can never forget.

Oh please answer the door

Can you tell me
You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be
But you're kill everything in me

Get down on your knees
Whisper what I need
Something pretty
Something pretty

I feel that when I'm old
I'll look at you and know
The world was beautiful

Then you tell me
You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me

I'm done, there's nothing left to show
Try but I can't let go
Are you happy where you're standing still?
Do you really want the sugar pill?
I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll start
To another, it feels so hard
As a train approaches, getting on
As I'm sure your kiss remains employed
Am I only dreaming?

You say that love goes anywhere

Only just one time
Then be happy with the consequence
With whatever's gonna happen tonight
Don't think we're not serious
When's it ever not
The love we make is give and it's take
I'm game to play along

All I can say I should say
Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time

When the dance is through it's me and you

All I need is someone to tell it too
Maybe, that's you.

Our time is borrowed and spent to freely
Every minute I have needs to be made up
But how?
I'm looking for a nice way to say
""I'm out.""
I want out.

I fall asleep with my friends around me
Only place I know, I feel safe
I'm gonna call this home

The open road is still miles away
Ain't nothing serious
We still have our fun
Oh we had it once

But windows open and close
That's just how it goes

Don't it feel like sunshine afterall
The world we love forever, gone
We're only just as happy
As everyone else seems to think we are

I'm in love with the ordinary
I need a simple space
To rest my head
And everything gets clear
Well I'm a little ashamed for asking
But just a little helps
It gets me straight again
Helps me get over it

It might seem like a dream
But it's real to me

Don't it feel like sunshine afterall
The world we love forever, gone
We're only just as happy
As everyone else seems to think we are

Dance on the ceiling
Get up, Get up

It covers any mistake
Always have a good distraction
You can keep the debate

They'll forget whatever happens

We divide, we take a side
Spinning on forever
Run, slow down, run
We're all waiting in the same line

Use your head to prepare
A real fight's not declared
A symbol doesn't cause your problems
Take a walk see who cares
It only works if you're scared
Dry the fear and you have options

Pick someone, anyone
No one ever questions

Where's my girlfriend with her ancient pindred lime
I pick you up on a Wednesday night
Go out for our secret drive
Like we were kids
Will we be alright

Are they ever coming back again
Those feelings that we started with
I'll give it time

Jimmy Faulkner,"Two island swans mated for life,
And his faithful heart would not consider any other wife.
For three years peaceful joy midst the rushes of the pond,
Proud and gentle was the loving of the last two island swans.

Their love was like a circle, no beginning and no end,
With his lady by his side a treasure and best friend.
And the pond was all so peaceful with the rising of the sun,
Young and free like the island breeze their life was just begun.

'Til a dread day in November when the searing cold did start,
Stalked the hunter with his bow, he put an arrow through her heart.
Husband come to my side let your feathers warm my pain,
For I feel I will not spend another day with you again.

And the cold winds blow,
He was brave but he's laid low.
By her body in the isle of mist,
I saw him give her one last cold kiss,
One last cold kiss.

Of swans the people talk of only one in this days tide,
They brought him twenty ladies he would take no other bride.
They say he will not move from the place where she did fall,
Once so proud he's beaten now, he will not speak at all.

And the cold winds blow,
He was brave but he's laid low.
By her body in the isle of mist,
I saw him give her one last cold kiss,

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And candle lights on little corner tables

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The song that Crosby sings

Jimmy Forrest,"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
May
But soon the may time turned to December
You had forgotten, do you remember?",Remember,1998

And the words she said were these

She said, ""Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me""

Just one more time you see

All I have are the memories

And he only smokes the best cigars

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat

Here in my deep purple dreams

Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle
In the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night 
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat

Here in my deep purple dreams
And as long as my heart will beat

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

Resting in my arms
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms
You beside me here beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert Caravan
This is so exciting, you are so inviting

Somewhere deep inside this part of you remains
Images of love take me back in time

I don´t know how it started or why it ever had to end
But something stepped inside we didn´t let it in
It´s keeping us apart, where are you now

Where are you now? 
Is someone there tonight
Holding what was mine? 
Where are you now? 
Do you wonder where I am, 
Are you really feelin´ fine? 

Goin´ through my life without you by my side
You´re the only thing that keeps goin´ through my mind
And nothin´ that I do can take the place of you

Oooh, thinkin´ about you, girl, 
There´s gotta be a place for me

Throw my heart out any door
Put my heart in constant danger
I don't want it any more
It just get's me in trouble
It just get's me in love
I fly high and then I stumble
The time has come to give it up

Don't you know I was an angel
Don't you know my heart was true
The I gave it to some devil
And he broke it all in two
I don't want it any more

You can learn all my hearts secrets
You might see gold and memories
Anything you find just keep it
It just don't mean a thing to me

Don't you know I was an angel
Don't you know my heart was true
The I gave it to some devil
And he broke it all in two
And I don't need it any more

And I'm drowning every night
It's been going on for years
I keep calling out you name
I keep reaching out for you
In the sweetness and the pain
The scar becomes the truth

There's a clock right by my bed
It keeps blinking out the time
In a bloody shade of red
Just like what's on my mind
And the time passes slow
And this feeling never ends
And the darkness never goes
And the new day won't begin

'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

Jimmy Heath,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

On merely this, a look, a kiss

Could slip away in one little daybreak

So many disappointments
Too many ups and downs for me

And now all I see for me is better days

Tell me that's not me I see
That's who I wanna be
Stuck somewhere in the middle
On half full or half empty
Waiting for somebody to come and rescue me

Then I'm the man to see
I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends
They'll come runnin' to me

Here is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can

Will you try to give one little thought to me
Though someone else may be nearer your heart?
Once in a while
Once in a while
Will you dream of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two drifted apart?
In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
But if love still can remember
The spark may burn again
I know that I'll
Be contented with yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me once in a while

Y'all talk about things I've done to my life
You talk about things that I've done to my wife

I know where I'm going so I can come in a crisis
I do this for my niggas, who never get no cheddar
For my niggas up state, that'll never get a letter
For my vitally sick, that would never get no better

For my niggas in the cold, that would never get a sweater
For the life I lead, things I done
A nigga went to school I had to bring my gun
A nigga had to hustle I had to slung them drums (I feel you man)

'Cause I ain't have no fresh clothes

Mice run around the damn sticky trap
Come on home wit me, where my mother found my crack platter

Threw it away so I snapped at her, back slapped her
She picked up a bat, like McGwuier for that matter
Hit me, I was back at her
Come home where I duck the DT's

Line around the corner, but I'm gettin' the free cheese
Come on home wit me, where I stand on my post
Play wit my toast, Been here wit mayonaise and toast
And pepper, many nights I done slept wit a heefer

Any beef came it left on a stretcher KILLA!
Come on home wit me, where they rapidly flossin'
Where I begged Kim to have the abortion

Relax in a coffin

They try to box me in the corner 4 the longest
No keys, lock me in this corner for the longest but

The pain we done felt that to long
Cocaine we done dealt that to long
And my pops it don't help that you gone

My homey Cash, well he gone for five
Send my prayers, do your thing, I'll be going for mine
Shit, we live life to the fullest
Three hundred and sixty five nights on the strike, that's a bullet
Shit, and uncle Ricky got a month and some change
And it feels like the garbage truck just dumping the pain
All on my shoulders, I'm warning my soldiers
The nights could get chilly, but the morning's much colder
I've seen summers get cold
And niggaz do it up until the point they done and the fold
They can't succumb to the cold
Those of frostbitten, up north sitting, just like some fucking lost kittens
They get locked up for carrying boy
Doing time underground up in Marion, boy
Shit, I respect you
You do your time like Gotti, and come home like that Marion boy

You caught a bid? Do it, You got kids? Love 'em, hug 'em

I gotta keep striving, I gotta keep moving, I gotta keep grinding
If this was the road, and I was a trucker, then shit man, I gotta keep driving
Through the lies and deception, had to ride through neglection
I'm an insomniac, up all night, pops and moms was an addict, shit
My puffing scums is a habit
I need me a contingency plan, my pops with the syringe in his hand
He was leaning and nodding
Uncle Ricky your mission is like Afeni was Robin
Shit, you should've seen the apartment
All I ever wanted was franks and beans I was starving
Crack fiends on the carpet, shit
But if it wasn't for grandma
I swear I'm in love with my grandma
That's why I only does it for grandma
That's when I roll in the street
I pray she covers me from the crown of my head, to the sole of my feet

I figured its means as a minor, huh
Look at the foods ad fibers
The dude with the cubes will snipe ya
More tools then snider

The jewels are fire
I learned don't fool with rider from pop
I don't need a gun, just a screwdriver
Two tires, two pliers, a wrench and a few wires, shit
I take it all from the buyers
Bonfire, all from a lighter, call me ""Macgyver""
Need a rehab I'll call up Shania
Bitch hungry, good, we gonna stall in papaya
Take your recession special, yeah you less then special
Me and Jim Jones, extra special
Check it, Dre to Snoop, Gotti to Ja
Dame to Jigga, Puff to Big, D n' why
Doggy you next up, get your respect up
Or a vest can't protect you when I hit you in your chest, duck
The big heads done pushed me
You gotta be sex: dickheads is pussy, killa
I bring the hammers to the gunfight
One night stand, only standing for one night
Doggy, cause when it come to that cash
No homo, I will jump in that ass, jump and I flash
Then jump in that jag, jumpsuit
Jump back from the coroner, I have you jump in that bag
Come with that cash

We built this city (on these blocks we hustle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (turn bricks to whips)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (in the midst of the struggle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (from bottom to top)
We built this city (through the agony and pain, diplomatic will reign)

Ay yo, my dipset Taliban
We on these streets like the wars on them streets of Afghanistan
Better yet of Pakistan
To America, Harlem's our cater
Any problems I spray her that can startle the mayor
But in this 50-block radius let's get the rock and shave the shit
or get the glock and blaze the shit
Bitches get the cock and savor it
They say Jim Jones the capo my favorite
Cause some of this shit my city wasn't built up over
Drugs and money, some shit you get killed up over
Slumped on your wheel, straight tilt it over
Trust me dogs, I seen it in peril
Niggaz wasted and painted and seen on the mural
(That's Harlem) In this apple of mine is rhyme
Clap up your shines, pop shots that will crack up your minds
And cop rocks and cook that crack up to dimes
New York City, the capital of crime

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

Now once again it's Santana the Great
I built this city on hammers and weight
Gasoline, rope, bandanas and tape
Lots of fiends, lots of coke being handed away
You know, the usual
Shut em down, set up show, how we usually do
Cut em down, hit the block man, we movin through
Diplomats is the strongest force
On and off the court we ballers more than sports
We built this city from ground zero
To spittin the pound zero, brown pistol
At ya get down kicka
Yeah this is from the ground up nigga
So get your weight and your pounds up nigga
Cause when it's beef my homies mound up quicker
Fit the pound much quicker, lay you down much quicker
You never been approached by Golden Eagles
Vultures that will scope and feed you, no court just leave you
Shit you know

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

It's like what I wouldn't do for a buck
My enemies can't rest in peace Jones, you see they funerals up
New gangstas in the city bitch, ring the alarm
All y'all hoes bow down, kiss the ring of a don
It's about to get real big playa, humongous
Stacked money so long til it grew fungus
We was gon' let you live til you threw punches
Now we got to get critical and we got to get rid of you
And we the most talked about, the most popular
We live by the codes, we the Dipset mafia
You never know who's watchin ya
You never know who's plottin to pop at ya
We focused like a pair of binoculars
I'm bout to get gritty
M-5 CLK's garage look like Alphabet City
And I'm a hustler, I put cracks in communities
Cops can't touch me, got Diplomatic Immunity
Now try I'm guaranteed a million shipped in scam
If not, back to the block, ship some grams

If not, get with Cam
I got clips to lift a van, flip a van
Shit, they can kick the can
This cat think he sling
Cause he got a pinky ring
Rinky-dink diamonds, they don't even make your pinky bling
(We built this city) And now I'm about to kill this city
(We built this city) Cradle to 50, yeah I'm acting real seditty
(We built this city) Cause I collect mils and fifties
For real it's pretty and y'all gonna feel the pity
(We built this city on rock) Dipset Bitch

Stay away OK, Mr Giles'll hurt you

I ain't go to school, stayed the hell at home
In the real estate dog I seen hell at homes
You was selling out I was selling homes
Selling dreams to the phone, I can sell the tone

In the science lab I mix me chemicals
In silicone fella in the vanilla cone
The school even play the recorder
Now days he work for F-E-D-S
And plays his recorder

You think he placing he taping his order
Marking the bills they read, 
Tasting the waterf***ed up
We duct-taping his daughter
That's the taping they taught us

In addition add the eight and the quarters get it
In addition Ma, yeah you get it dog
Gets it and ditch it

Is to put the is in all
Furs his or hers b**** go pitch it whore
No disrespect Mami, no disrespect at all

That's a real friend
That's a homie right right true

I fell that is only right
That I live the life of rally
I done did knives in alleys, pipes, in rallies
What you do now?
Now I catch flights to Cali
Looking for a wife to spouse I pipe her proudly
She understands my life gets rowdy
I'm the same say
Prane day I'm icy outey

Yo, now I done been on both sides of the fence
Now I done been on both sides of the gate 
Survived and escaped
Look at me now man I'm driving away
Thinking about my old teacher who said I rot and decay
(Never)
I go back and beep the horn at them
Blowing that cheech and chong at them
Yelling, screaming the boy is platinum

It all happens so fast
They all imagine I crash
But I did straight through I'm bad
Like Michael was see what the cycle does
360 spin around, I'm the new kid in town

Yeah it's coming soldier, 
April the month it's over
Yeah your run is over
The album is done I told you
What a classic I made, I look up see Cam
See the game what a path that he made
A beautiful mind trapped in the shade
Cracking codes for the man
Who only stand in the back of my brain
At last I done came up in the proper way
True author like the great doctor J was

You can't respect the amount jewels in this new wide movement
If you don't respect the amount of dudes in this too live movement
Me and Killa, we like them,
Those two guys moving I-95 south dirty
With them two pies moving, moving
Trying to crease out the lightning
Trying to keep out the excitement
But it's hard in this bulls***, in this game
'Cause the secret indictments
And you coke experimenters
And you coke experiencers

Be easy on the phone dog,
'Cause you know the hearing us
You styling them b****es
Cause you know they serious
Just picturing, it's so easy to draw
Stop and freeze at them whores
Then we speed off in cars
Then we breezing the law
Blowing that weed from my jaw

G's up hoe's down
East Side to by dog 
(East Side)
All the time man
Thanks for even asking
Or we be seen in Aspen
In that pool house, that hot tub with that steam relaxing
And we be seen in action

Keep them fiends collapsing
And they thirsty and they nodding and the be ?
They see me my actions
I cruise by in a Beemer just laughing
I let that rock and roll

I coping poppy's load
It was like coping gold, 
I shut down poppy's load
I hit the strip dog
I see the cops get load
Now I'm living the life I got to stop and close
Big cars big stars like it's rock and roll 
Let's rock and roll

[Jim Jones]
Come on, yo, yo

[Verse]
Aiyoo my Dip Set Taliban, we are not a crew
We're more like a movement, more like in tuned with
The moon and the stars, some say I'll soon be doomed for them bars
But I could be caught, pissy clubs, saloons and some bars
Industry think that they grooming a star nah
I'm more like a thug misproving the odds, run around my city all crazy
With my goons in some cars

[Bridge: Cam'Ron]
I tell 'em
Wake up, wake up
Gotta go get that cake up, break up
Divide that payroll, aiyyoo
Go get that ya-yo, ya-yo
Killa, paper, holla at Pedro
On the 8-0 and wait for my son the lay low
Ba' bro

[Cam'Ron]
When I beef, names will be said tool will be spread
Two in your head, body be bagged, eulogy read
Dog in the news will get read, cause what I deal with is usually feds
On the first

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Aiyoo, aiyoo, aiyoo, aiyoo, aiyoo, aiyoo
It's the first of the month..
Ya-yo, ya-yo, ya-yo, ya-yo-, ya-yo, ya-yo, ya-yo, ya-yo, ya-yo
It's the first of the month..

[Juelz Santana]
Now I'm the type of dude, post up sell drugs on your property
Stone cold hustler, ain't no fucking denying me
I sell drugs in varieties, you want it, I got it
You see it, you like it, we count it, you buy it from me
I'm what the people call a menace to the public society
Fuck 'em I'm riding, my gun on the side of me
Fuck it I'm driving, I'm puffing high as can be
I'm speeding, I'm weaving, I'm bugging my eye on the street
Cam signed to the Roc it's time that we eat
Harlem's back, this time it's for keeps
You rolling or not?
The Takeover's now, y'all focused or not?
We been ready it's just that our promotion was not
But I can't blame no one for this, I'm all right with that
Can't be racist cause I sell too much white for that
So I decided I'mma milk these crackers for all they milk and crackers
Until I'm rich and these mills don't matter
Uh, you niggaz follow my plot?
If not, swallow these shots, Santana swallow your block
I run with enforcers, big dudes and bosses
Black, British and Walter, the phone call will cost ya'
Keep rolling in them caravans acting
We got big trucks with chrome Taliban action
Send one up to Jabar, my nigga maxed in
T-Money's home and he's never going back in

[Chorus]

[Cam'Ron]
Aiyo, I swear to God, you think I had a violin the way I fiddle triggers
How you older than me, and still a little nigga
On the first, I hate these chickens
Get their check, hair, nails done, steak and chicken, for they friends
And they kids fly, I ain't open friend, on the 11th, you gonna be broke again
Word to Jehova man, hoes in they shoes, barking like a Doberman
Coming to see Cam, for some coke again

[Jim Jones]
Shit, it's the first of the month
Yo, I'm the first on the block for the cycle
A rock that is first like shoots from a rifle
See they tainted our image, it's fucked up how the game painted our image
They say we dangerous people, why, because we sell caine to the people
That don't be the reason I be aiming this eagle, my aims to get equal
The first and fifteenth's got some restraints on my people

Yo, yo I speak pain, I spit power, talk courage, breathe flowers
Follow me through the debri of these towers, the rain, the sleet, the street showers
Don't get caught up when the street showers
When the guns rain, the clips pour, the soldiers grip fours, then begin war
Come on, it's Santana the Great
Tie 'em up, bandana his face, hammer his face, fucker
I'm trying to get my act together, in the booth now trying to get my rap together
You know, I got to fire to heat the street up
Abuse the track, and beat the beat up you know?
You already know what I'm about homie
 I'm young I'm focused I'm just coming out homie
You can go by what you hear through word of mouth homie
Or step out of line, Cam betting the house on me
You know I ain't stopping yet
You know my album ain't done, it ain't dropping yet
I'm in the mist of a bidding war
And we need two milli more just to move in the door, shit

[Chorus]
Yes the boys are back at it
Come holler at us, the boys are back at it
So line em up, shoot em down
Do it know
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Line em up, shoot em down

Tell 'em it's ground zero
Yes the boys are back at it
Come holler at us, the boys are back at it

[Cam'Ron]
Killa, yo, these girls told you I'm the man right? (right?)
Well listen to lover
When I beef, visions are gutter
Kids clapping, kidnappings, heard her missing a brother
I'm hitting your sister, you kissing your mother
The shit is disguster
Underground with people, lethal, trapped in the desert, surrounded by evil
Yeah, I see your bitch is impressed, my kicks is all fresh
This shit on my chest, by Mitchell and S.
I got her opened, hoping she's not, I'd have her crack in her tits, coke in her twat
Have her crack up the strip, coke up the block
She'd get cracked up and hit, keep soaping your cycle mami
My girls lay up in suites, a half of cake of week, and masturbate like Tweet
Killa, I be popping the oozies, copping them Coogis, eyes on the drop real droopy
Mair is snoopy, look at your hooptie, rocking the rubies
Hop in the hoochie, popping her coochie
Chill while I'm chasing millions
I'm a baller that would merk you like Jason Williams (uh Huh)
Don't play with villas', vacate the building
Or the eights will come and rape your children
Yeah, it's a kilo to a milligram
I'm still the man, word to Killa Cam (Killa Cam)

[Chorus]
Yes the boys are back at it
Come holler at us, the boys are back at it
So line em up, shoot em down
Do it know
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Line em up, shoot  em down
Do it know
Welcome to ground zero
Tell 'em it's ground zero
Yes the boys are back at it
Come holler at us, the boys are back at it

Two of my cards and crooks slashed at two of my pawns and rooks
For all the charms they took
To my head of security, british the titan, clicking the fifth, and gripping it tight
God dammit, not to mention my bishop and knights, I listen to Bridgette to White
Makin' crucial trips through the night (highways)
And Prince Juelz, I told you ever since Juelz
If them faggets even flinch Juelz (bluuuuatttt)
My dogs are gonna it 'em alive
Forty-fours, the pleading, deleting they lives (come on)
And Killa wallys leading the movement, for realla we wouldn't be in this movement
Over him I might kill ya (kill ya)
Be in a tomb, just facing my time
Loyal on side, outside spoiler on rides, system bumping, bumping ?oh boy? in the ride
Oh boy I done slide, shit, he done came got his boy, he's ashamed at his boy
Had to flame at a boy, over the name we employed
Which is none other than Dip Set, for ya'll dumb motherfuckers (holla)

Caddy more trucks, its daddy Warbucks

Sea soft and sandy (I really mean it)
Yeah, let's get lost in candy
I got lost in Boston, Austin, flossin' of course Miami

Hey yo lock my garage, rock my massage
Fuck it, bucket by Osh Kosh Bgosh
Golly I'm gully, look at his galoshes

From collabos, ghost writing for assholes
Want to use my brain, than give Killa mad dough
It's all good, increase Killa cash flow
Increase my fame, that's why Killa smash hoes
You'll get side swiped, look at my life
First movie ever, merked out Mekhi Phife
And papi got jerked out of pies twice

Cee-lo and craps, see-notes and stacks

Ya youngin' fucked with boys in the hood
Gave her a son like Ricky, from ?Boyz in the Hood'

Diplomats, Young Guru, Jim Jones, Santana
Freaky, came in second half
Shit man, only thing we really wanna know right now is
What? Is what's really good? That's the question

Suicide sickness, child negligence
Homicide fingerprints, wild evidence, but what?
But thou shall, respect me bloa, bloa
Clap, clap, pow, pow, bow down, nigga

Be in Columbus never seen Bow Wow, nope
We big dogs, all on the chow down
Chow and Mr. Giles lay back
Santana locked up, get 'em out asap

Aight, now boy, not tonight
I where a bomb to the court like it's a icey white
I'm real icey right, still in the hood
But the question for y'all is what's really good?

Nothing, see me on fifty five, black scooped it up
A K activated, act stupid, one did act stupid
Mac had to move it, from the hood like
What's really good?

I had to lay 'em down, clip him up, sprayed around
Split him up, he played the ground, leave, nine stayed around
Outlaw on the street, shot four from the three
Southpaw Portuguese, what's really good?

To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

Okay I admit, I mean they said I was trippin' had to re-edit the spin
Forty four lead when I'm spitting shots to the head of my victims
Big deserts we grippin' to dry out, you in the desert is slippin'

They go through extreme measures to get 'em
Them chains and them treasures the glistening
You got three hideouts, a bed in the system
My brethren I miss them, so please tell me y'all what's really good?

Top of the drop when it's missing
My block when it's clickin'
These rocks when they glistening
What's really good?

One forty fifth on this crunk, big forty fifth in my trunk
Big gouty wrists on you chumps, what's really good?
Mostly me and sometimes them
But mostly me, oh shit man, that's one time them

Squally, so through your set up please
Let me know if you're really good
And let me know if you really hood

All my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

I like this beat, drums and bells
Remind of bullets, bodies, guns and shells
I don't talk the verse, Polly wanna cracker
When she on the stand, you probably wanna smack her

Probably wanna clap her, end your day properly
Air the shit out like the end of State Property
No run away robber, gunner stay half of me
The end I see prophecy, what's really good?

I'm in the buggy mon', with the rugby on
Air Force Ones, looking like you Lucky Charms
Lotta dudes, yelling out fuck me, uh?
I'll blow this bitch dog, what the fuck we on

It's Santana, I'm straight out the box homey
Straight to the stoop, straight to the booth
When I stepped out the box homey
I still got the sun of the box on me
Grimy clothes, funky arms, my socks dirty

I told you I can count on my boy
I'm in trouble, needed bail money, dialed on my boy
Shit and just when I thought it was getting worst
I was bailed out scot-free, spittin' this verse, uh-huh

You don't sit in the dirt, clips'll disperse
What's really good? Me motherfucker
Don't play with this, I'm so great at this
Santana, bandanna, release the eight a spit

To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

Come roll with a pimp or gangsta
Hustler by nature
Trust that I'll take ya
I'll show you the rules and perimeters
Show you how to move with the ooze how to handle it
Show you how to cut loose soon as we scramble it
On the block as soon as the moon it be scramblin'
And you can be my down ass bitch
Yeah baby that's for sure
I'm a show you how package raw
How to snap it on
How to take trips with the package on
How to go and come back with the package gone
Just stacks of cash beyond
