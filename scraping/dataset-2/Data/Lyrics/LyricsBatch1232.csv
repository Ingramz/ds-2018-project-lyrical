Twentieth Century Fox Orchestra,"Paradise can not refuse us
Never such a happy pair

Everybody must excuse us
If we walk on air

All the shadows now will lose us
Lucky stars are everywhere

As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

It's plain to see
We found, by finding each other
The love we waited for

I'm yours, you're mine
And in our hearts
The happy ending starts

What a lovely world
This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you, for me, forever more.

What a lovely world
This world will be

For you, for me, forever more.","For You, For Me, For Evermore",1997
Twentieth Century Fox Orchestra,"I've looked around the country and I've seen it all
And what I want, I'm ready to name
It's big and strong and handsome and it's 6 feet tall
I'm gonna file my claim

I've struck a real bonanza and he's rough and rash
But what he's got, I'm ready to tame
He's worth a fancy fortune but it's not in cash
I'm gonna file my claim

I got the fever, ooh, the fever
But not for gold in the ground
I want the title to something vital
That I can throw my fences around

A girl should never hustle with a pick and pan
To dig for gold, that isn't her game
I'll find the man who's found it then I'll get that man
Who's gonna help me file my claim, I gotta file my claim

Ooh, looking for nuggets? Ooh, mush
A, be, see, D, who's gonna file me under love?
There ain't a man, not a single man

There ain't a man alive who wouldn't trade his gold
For what it takes to stay in the game
So have your fun and spend before you get too old
Who's gonna help me file my claim?

Who's gonna help me, help, help me
Who's gonna help me file my claim tonight",I'm Gonna File My Claim,2003
Twentieth Century Fox Orchestra,"I'm susceptible to stars in the skies,
I'm incurably romantic,
If they're told to me all covered with sighs,
The wildest of lies seems true.
Each time a lovebird sings,
I have no defenses,
My heart is off on wings
Along with my senses.
I'm a set-up for the moon when it's bright,
I'm incurably romantic.
And I shouldn't be allowed out at night,
With anyone quite like you.
But, oh! Your arms are nice,
And it would be awfully nice
If you turned out to be starry-eyed like me,
And incurably romantic too.",Incurably Romantic,2003

No one talks but, you

If your sold begin buyin', baby lets make love!
""Gosh, it's hot""
No, don't turn TV on,
Instead just turn me on
I'll light up like neon
Just a tiny section of your affection
In my direction will do, ooh
""You'll just love my embraces 'cause they'll fit like a glove
We'll be off to the races maybe""
Kiss me baby, let's make love
Don't just lay there.. honey do something
Don't just contemplate me
Prove that you don't hate me
Come on, ask you, late me

Come to groups with me,
Lips to lips with me, do""

Twentieth Century Fox Orchestra,"When I was a boy, world was better spot
What was so was so, what was not was not
Now, I am a man, world have changed a lot
Some things nearly so, others nearly not

There are times I almost think
I am not sure of what I absolutely know
Very often find confusion
In conclusion, I concluded long ago

In my head are many facts
That, as a student, I have studied to procure
In my head are many facts
Of which I wish I was more certain, I was sure
Is a puzzlement

What to tell growing son?
What for instance, shall I say to him of women?
Shall I educate him on the ancient lines?
Shall I tell the boy as far as he is able
To respect his wives and love his concubines?

Shall I tell him everyone is like the other
And the better of the two is really neither?
If I tell him this I think he won't believe it
And I nearly think that I don't believe it either

When my father was a king
He was a king who knew exactly what he knew
And his brain was not a thing
Forever swinging to and fro and fro and to

Shall I, then be like my father
And be willfully unmovable and strong?
Or is it better to be right?
Or am I right when I believe I may be wrong?

Shall I join with other nations in alliance?
If allies are weak, am I not best alone?
If allies are strong with power to protect me
Might they not protect me out of all I own?

Is a danger to be trusting one another
One will seldom want to do what other wishes
But unless someday somebody trust somebody
There'll be nothing left on earth excepting fishes

There are times I almost think
Nobody sure of what he absolutely know
Everybody find confusion
In conclusion, he concluded long ago

And it puzzle me to learn
That tho' a man may be in doubt of what he know
Very quickly he will fight
He'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so

Oh, sometimes I think that people going mad
Ah, sometimes I think that people not so bad
But not matter what I think, I must go on living life
As leader of my kingdom, I must go forth
Be father to my children and husband to each wife
Etcetera, etcetera and so forth

If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way
Everyday I try to live another day
If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way
Everyday I do my best for one more day

But is a puzzlement",A  Puzzlement,2011
Twentieth Century Fox Orchestra,"This is a man who thinks with his heart
His heart is not always wise
This is a man who stumbles and falls, but this is a man who tries
This is a man you’ll forgive and forgive
And help protect, as long as you live
He may not always say what you would have him say
But now and then he’ll say something wonderful
The thoughtless things he’ll do will hurt and worry you
Then all at once he’ll do something wonderful
He has a thousand dreams that won’t come true
You know that he believes in them and that’s enough for you
You’ll always go along, defend him when he’s wrong
And tell him when he’s strong, he is wonderful
He’ll always need your love, and so he’ll get your love

Can we try to start a new?
We'll survive in rain and stormy weather,
Take this chance for me and you...

Walking all alone but I don't ever realize,
That it's a question of love, but with a high price.
Being together make me feel like a happy man,
But now you're gone,
And I don't understand.
Can you remember all the good times,
When the power of love was like a good lime.
I keep on askin' why because I wanna know,
Why you had to go and go.

You see, a girl like you is like a dream cometrue,
You can't imagine how I feel, but what can I do?
It is a fact of life, that after all these years,
Now I'm standing in the rain,
My eyes in tears.
Tell me, will I see you again and tell me when,
Is there a chance of love, but even then.
If we were ment to be, we're gonna stay,
Yeah, maybe some day.

I wanna hold you in my arms and give
You all my charms, girl
Cause now it's cold, but I wanna be so warm, girl.
I can't concentrate, I can't hold the line,
Can it be to late get back what's mine?
Everybody needs a love,
Everybody needs a good love,
Now let me tell you.
But sometimes you you can't help but losing,
It is a part of life without choosing.

Wondering for hours around and going nowhere
I see the couples around me,
But I don't care.
I guess my time will come,
So I just have to wait,
Looking for a new, finding out my own fate.
I close my eyes and guess what I see,
It's like a visio of you while your kissing me.
It's not a lot but at least now I'm satisfied,
Casuie if I can't have you here,
I wanna dream all night.

Oh baby!
Can we find a way to live together?
Can we start a new?
Oh baby!
We'll survive in rain and stormy weather.
Take this chance for me and you.

Tell me why my feelings are afraid.

But you gotta be tough, you gotta be strong. 
Better learn before you start flying,

To hold on to a thing that's critic. 
You never know if you're doing the right thing, 
You never know what the year's gonna bring. 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do, 
Keeping the faith might be something for you. 
Trust in yourself and you'll get there, 
Or you'll end up nowhere. 

One! Take the time to know yourself, 
When you're down and out it might help. 
Two! It's only up to you, 
Let yourself go and do what you wanna do. 
Try on and never let go, 
Play your own role in your very own show. 
You're not wrong when you're playing it smart, 
Do it from your heart. 

Keep on tryin' 
When you try and believe, 
May be than you will be, 
What you wanted to be. 
Keep on tryin',

There is only one way 
To get you goal.

And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night

And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game
And then I saw him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said I'll take the grave
Please just send them all my way

'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
It is faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake

Shadows will scream that I'm alone

And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days

I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the ledges by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead

I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions

Twenty One Pilots,"Can't stop thinking about if and when I'd die
For now I see that ""if"" and ""when"" are truly different cries
For ""if"" is purely panic and ""when"" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no ""above"", or ""under"", or ""around"" it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle, let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go ""above"", the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when going ""under"" starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else

He'll always try to stop me, that Nicholas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me that's almost stopped me
Well we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for?
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time I'll try and sing this

I'll morph to someone else

Lights they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes

I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no ""above"", or ""under"", or ""around"" it

The rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion
In spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And, could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking ""I'll teach them""
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that ""it"" does not get glorified

A women that doesn’t need much but
Appreciates a whole lot
And he always call me crazy, but i’m not crazy
I’m from LA where the sun’s always shining so a lot of people are shady
But at least I got my baby

Right, look
What’s the difference between real love and fake love
The same difference between real titties and fake ones
You can feel the difference
And even though it changes overtime
It stays consistent, I ain't gonna lie though, it takes persistence
But you the one I wanna be with when the ball drop
That’s why I send for you like the call drop
Plus I know all your insecurities
And I don’t mean like mall cops
I mean the type we all got
I’m never focused on my exes more than our execution
No time to be stressed and confusing
A happy home is the best to move in
Just like happy endings can be the best conclusion
My dad used to say real love can be the best illusion
Because when you think it’s there, it’s already moving
And some feelings will leave before the rest can move in
And I know both of our families are divorced and suing
But look, this ain't repetition,iIt’s evolution
You changed the theory up
You the type to have the hardest nigga tearing up
And all your friends around you try to get their appearance up
When you ain't even wearing much
But real enough to remind me to hit my parents up

Yeah he’s sweet
I mean you know when he wants to be not all the time
Let’s not front in front of all these people nigga
Don’t act like just a couple weeks ago you wasn’t fucking with them bitches
Out here, disrespecting me
I mean you know I fucked up too
Went through your phone you wasn’t looking
And I found out, but if we in the same house, the same building
Then you can’t interrupt a happy home that’s still buildin'
You ol’ sneaky ass nigga

Fuck is you saying
Who are you talkin to
Never called you a bitch, but who are you barking to
Look you disrespecting me, calling me a lying ass nigga
Who are you trying, am I on trial?
Are you not the number one on my speed dial
You know that you tripping
You need guidance
You got these people inside our business
Like U and I is
You probably didn’t even catch that did you
You’re too undivided
You’re too undecisive
You’re too one sided
You the type to kick me out the house after I buy it
And then talk to me like you’re the pro when I’m the one that’s been providing
I hate talking about what’s private when we not in private
‘Cause I don’t want to say nothing to piss your mother off
Since we inviting everyone in the bedroom
Let’s take the covers off
And talking about how you fucking what’s his name who’s so fucking lame
I wish I would’ve known before I took the rubber off (ah!)
Got me questioning like is this even love at all
I used to see my future in your eyes like the crystal ball
Looking for some feelings in the lost and found
Contemplating
Thinking how we supposed to hold each other down if we can’t even hold on a conversation
You take the sex away then what else are we left to lay in
I’m tired of fronting for these people who ain't got our back
‘Cause to them it’s all entertainment
And they not looking at us like we real people
Or like we up here just fuckin playing
And time’s the only thing we can’t afford
Then why would waste it

If we can’t even face to face it",Talk Show,2016

Than to lose my faith in the One I love

But suddenly now, I feel so small
Shaken down to the cavity in my soul

I know the doctrine and theology
But right now they don't mean much to me
This time there's only one thing I've got to know

Do I trust You, Lord? Does the robin sing?
Do I trust You, Lord? Does it rain in spring?

Than to lose my faith in the One I love

From this moaning, arid shore
To dreaming sea where the waves are always high
Did you make your boat too frail
Is it too hard to catch the wind
Don't stray from the stream of beaming light

Heart of our sorrows, now own me
Angels won't hold me, they breach what has grown me 
Heart of our sorrows, now own me

It's nothing what you where hoping for
Just tears from the father are here for the son
Feeling nothing but scorn
No banners to welcome you
Dreams never ours, never in bond

Angels won't hold me, they breach what has grown me 
Heart of our sorrows, now own me

Reflections of my own life flash like a fire
Powder burns the memories life seems a bad dream
Fall for cenetries physical and the mental
When I crashed through work

I was cursed but still I
Quit my curse found my hustle
Stack paper made it world wide
Feeling the dream, don't be a hater son

Think you the greater one
Gotta put you on the fader son
Cut your a** up see you later
Gotta drop till your praying n****

You ain't a player hust a frail n****
I'm the slayer in your nightmares
Unstoppable
When you see me on the street

Call a audible
I got you covered, face it
And you can't dodge this bullet baby
This ain't the matrix

Got to put you in your placement
Hide your body in the basement
Your boys wonder where your face went

[Chorus: x2]
Homey we keet those on us
Smoke like mufflers
To calm down/I sell
But still explode
Those things so fast/they know not to gas they self
They can't f*** with us, we laugh last

[Verse Two]
Backbreakers of the game
Many many musical
Legendary criminal destined to be professional
I rain supreme

Ever since my days you rock vest just to push your range
No doubt about it
We grew up in the cloud
Read up in your magazine just to see what were about

Peep into the case, see me, ask
Why that black a** n**** flow over the piano
Droppin it good
For that hoody in the front row

that's my good pro down for the juggalo
Three guns busted for the battle man
Shoot the whole scene make the motherf***er rattle
Duece, double o, slow

Church folk say we ain't got too many more
Either man rush I'm gonna hit em with the head rush
So be careful on what you trusting

[Verse Three]
Yo
I was walking on the block
Heard a couple shots
Caught one in the leg

And I know who did it
They gonna get it
Wrap up my leg
Bounced upstairs and got strapped up

I love that drama s***
I'm all ga**ed up
I lit that kush up and got doughed up
And thought about all the foul s*** I did

I can't help it, I was this way since a kid
Then I slide out the crib
Hunt down my pray
The look in my eyes like I sniffed some yay

Ran up on homes
And blast away
He pa**ed away twin got the last laugh today
Anybody front I keep that on me

Twinkle Twinkle Little Rock Star,"Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
The corner bar. It just seemed right so I pulled up.
Not a soul around but the old bar keep 
Down at the end lookin' half asleep 
But he walked up and said, what'll it be? 
I said the good stuff. 
He didn't reach around for the whiskey. 
He didn't pour me a beer. 
His blue eyes kinda went misty. 
He said you can't find that here.

[Chorus]
'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date.
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause you're hands are shakin' so much
And its the way that she looks with her eyes and her hair. 
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year 
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff.

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass. 
And I smiled and said I'll have some of that. 
We sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends. 
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare. 
It was a pretty girl with bu-font hair
He said, that's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed. 
He said, I spent five years in the bar when the cancer took her from me. 
But I've been sober three years now 
'Cause the one thing's stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls 
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl 
Married his high school love.
And its a new t-shirt sayin' I'm a grandpa.
Bein' right there as our time got small
And holdin' her hand when good the Lord called her up
Yeah man that's the good stuff.

He said, when you get home she'll start to cry. 
When she says, I'm sorry, say so am I. 
Look into those eyes so deep in love and drink it up 
'Cause that's the good stuff.

That's the good stuff.",The Good Stuff,2012

Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in

Say your prayers and stomp it out

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me 
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart

A world of never ending happiness

Ask him how much of your mind, baby

Things are much harder than in the after world

Go crazy, punch a higher floor

Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for (What's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

When you can't really function you're so full of fear,
A working class hero is something to be,

Keep you doped with religion and sex and tv,
And you think you're so clever and you're classless and free,
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see,
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be.

There's room at the top they are telling you still,
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill,
If you want to be like the fool on the hill,
A working class hero is something to be.
A working class hero is something to be.
If you want to be a hero, well just follow me",Working Class Hero,2013

I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right

One of the four beasts saying ""Come and see"" 
And I saw, and behold a white horse

There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

Until Armageddon no shalom, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying

And I looked, and behold a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was Death

A warning to the crews out there who think they're hot
If you're not original rockers you will get shot
Down by the kids neglectin' your art, the stuff you did
Eventually it get so bad puts you to bed

All the world then stands revealed with the clarity
Of raw voltage, briefly we see and the hope is
You'll be able to tell just what dope is

How you gonna cope with radioactive isotope
And Boss DJ, illness upon you quickly
Infecting you fast upon the airwaves
This message brought to you by the so large system
Activate and attune yourself with meditation
And green plants they've got mad life they're sentient
They're beautiful as you and they like to dance
 
Everything we do we gotta come original
Put your hands up in the air and prepare for battle
Sit upon the rhythm like a tire upon a rim
We do it non-stop and then we do it again
Some a them whine and some a them bitch
They can not do it never switch
Comin' up from the heart and delivered with a wild pitch
Sit up on top the rhythm like a wild stallion
This is the ruling system

wait a minute let me call my ace coon boone
i know he know where it is where it was and where it's goin be
there's no answer so i guess the alley got dressed
time to do some sellin myself
I bust a right make a you then i make that left

swoop across the light black and white lookin hard
maybe someone else but i neva pull my card

the same old click that ran around in elementary,
was it the chemistry from moms and pops
who went to school with they moms and pops, so it don't stop
it was an everyday event, we spent
more time playin get like me, instead of hide and seek
and after school we play two on two
Philly versus the Lakers until the bus came through
do, you, recall goin to the games
straight actin the fool and when its over at the food chains
in the parking lot is where it all pop
we hangin around to watch the ladies and the brothas clown
pick up some food, conversate a bit
till its time for us to make our move, then dip (then dip)
I enjoyed, every minute of it then
I guess that's why we in the wind

I'm in the back of tha apartments where my homeys kickin it
thinkin bout my homeys that's gone and the ones locked up
slappin bones gettin faded and toe up
makin a gang of noise
Domino gimme what you got in yo hand
ya didn't stand a chance
count my money, gimme 25
by spots and hit the door, I hear somebody knock
damn how time flies when you havin fun
all the things we did when we were young
still stayed deeper than the mind
as time is passed
I had more thoughts of good than the bad as I laughed
'cause me and my homeys still hang ain't nothin changed
but the years and months, bringin in some bucks
and this is why we stay true to the end
now me and my homeys are in the wind

(Chorus) x4 (fades)
Things have changed but it still don't mean you forget all the time you spent

She's on her way, about to get paid
But never turning Hollywood

But never turning Hollywood

[Neb Love-]
I used to be that way, but now I'm like this
You betta miss me with that shit or catch a mighty blow to lip 
Cheeks
Beware I'm here, hooray for N-E-be	, no that's not me,
Oh, 'cause I'm in the Cherokee, cruisin with Warren G
Goin to pick up Jah Skill and the Twinz
Five footin till the end of my life, for real
Ya didn't know the sista but she had a record deal
They want to see you at the top, then they want to see you drop
Then they want to call the cops, ring hello?
Wake up, once yo ass go Hollywood ya ass is like fuck
(ya ass is like fuck)
A young buck Knee-Hi told me that Neb changed
But if I'm on the wrong track put me in the right place

Wayniac-
I'm just the same muthafucka, who kicked them nuts back in the day
This is how it is when the niggaz gettin paid
You used to treat me different now that you know where I stand
But back up in the days you didn't really give a damn
I had my own thing, me and the homeys from the PAC
We watch each other's back tryin to get our pockets fat
But now its new niggaz poppin all up in our face
From 88 to 93 I couldn't find a trace
I keeped on shit on data just reviewin all the facts
In my mind I designed how to switch and counteract
'cause ain't no Holly and me if it is its gettin stuck
I'm strictly for my paper as these groupies ride my nuts

(Chorus) x2
Jah Skills-
What, you can't speak, because I reached my peak,
Why don't you, go bout your business let your mind tweak,
But see ain't nuthin changed on my behalf still got my mics and 
Stashed
Niggaz is siamese two faced and they switch it fast
'cause Hollywood can't do nuthin for me but hang me like drapes
Distribute my phat tapes and in my pocket put some papes

[Trip Locc-]
And ain't nuthin in Hollywood that could make me want to switch
Could he please, you know what's up with me so Holly these
I'm from the G side, flip flop if you want to
Banned by yo hood and yo city shoulda stayed true
But ya didn't fell victim to the limelight
Never gettin faded 'cause the Locc was just to trump tight

[Jah Skills-]
You must be dazed
Ya goin through some type of phase
Behind my back you jaw jack but in my house you want to blaze

[Wayniac & Jah Skills-]
So thanks for smokin the click out an shit
All upon her clit
(and all upon his dick)
It makes me sick, but we don't even trip 'cause its the G-Funk

Now feel the brew that we funk

Don't ever get it twisted when the real ones put it down

Take two hits them you pass it on, pass it on pass it on

I got my droptop back, layin low in my seat
On a mission headin down the backstreets
Its 12 o'clock gotta get my sack
If I can't get my sack then its time to scrap see (time to scrap)
Ain't nothin poppin if I can't get high
On a high tip gotta get some chocolate thai
Now, I see the homeys who be slangin doves
Roll up on him, man its on break me off my love fool (whats up fool)

Stop at the store to get the zig zags (zig zags)
Not knowin that the homey in the back had a whole bag
Of them licorice ones already rolled
Take a hit god damn you just saved my soul

Barely woke so this locc keep swervin
In and out the lanes tryin to get to tip
Seems like its takin forever and that's on the real
Have some chocolate thai but the indo seems stronger
Smoked a newport to make my high last longer
Rolled up another so pass me a lighter
And fire it up, so I can get higher
Took a hit then I closed my eyes
I can't smoke no joint without my homey St. Ides
Rolled to the store ain't shit you can tell me
My eyes were so red that Visine couldn't help me
Took a drink to the head now its kickin in
And the tide done hit me so my head starts to spin
I rolled the windows down then I leaned to the side
(cuz some think its wrong) but you know how I ride

Now here I come slidin through, with my crew
The homey's on focus so check the real view
We roll the back door cut so we could plot
To hit em up and roll em up and get to the weed spot
We get the sack give em daps then we break
I thought it was on but see my homey Bo's in shape
But that ain't no thang yo, so roll up the window, Twinz got that 
Indo
I thought you knew so now its on like that black
I love to hit the Chronic and I'm bombed off contact
I'm with the skirts gettin love
Now should I fire it up (man hit that shit T-Dubb)
That's the lick so now I stare
From rollin through the hood they got big respect (yeah)
Eastside's where I glide
So take a dip with a locc and hit em up two times right

One time's there and they got me on sight
Switched lanes straight G (straight G)
If its on then its on 5-0 gotta catch me (gotta catch me)
Its off to the freeway locc
A cup of gin in my lap with the Chronic smoke
You can't beat it with a bat
AC just a blowin and my seat's laid back (laid back)
Slapped the homey on dippin in the 82
Doin it like a locc like the thang to do
Gotta always put it down for my niggaz restin in peace
The ones locked up that might not never touch the streets
Every toke that I toke is for my muthafuckin locc
Take no shorts as I blaze up some mo smoke
Its just a lil somethin just to let you know
That the real Chronic smoke is on the go
So I'll..

Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money
The way she pop it on the pole
Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money
The way she slide down on the pole

Pop that booty, let me watch it girl
Drop it, I'll not knock it
Better yet I'mma reach into my pocket girl
Watch it girl she sluggin'
Come over here cause I see what you do
Tippin' off the plenty booze
How you be attracted to plenty dudes with the Jimmy Choo shoes you in
What you doing takes some talent
So I gotta say that I'm enjoying what I witness
My money flow is endless
Lookin' at her work that pole like gymnast
Climbin' up to the top, turn it upside down then open up her legs
Lookin' sexy all the way to the bottom
I'm throwin' dollar cause it look like she finna hit her head
Now she twerlin' around it, then do a split right in front of it
Ready to go back up when she look at how thick the money get
She do it caterpillar, ballerina diamond toes aerial and vert
Full rockin' it verti crucifix fan kick
Pro pound with mils stacks spin in reverse

The way she slide down on the pole
Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money

I ain't got no plans tonight
Get somewhere, you can help me get my head right
And I love your swag, cause it's just like mine
Siamese twins me and you, we two of a kind
Strip club is our playground
She playing on her monkey bar
Up and down like a roller coaster
Call that ass a theme park
Way she handle her business
From the sky she make it drop
My money no limit, tonight I'm about to go astronaut
Never ride solo, Mr. Franklin always with me
She'd been around the pole so many times she should be dizzy
Rolex that's real crime, these niggas exaggerating
Her ass can hold a glass, that's no exaggerating

The way she work it on the pole
Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money
They way she twerk it on the pole

shots make me duck  that's when Ima have to fuck you up

its like uh  ah  muthafucka can't fight the feelin the way Ima fuck em 

have an orgasm but for the orchasm hit em as if a 4-5 buck em 

talk about a man being scared, I done killed him be dead in his tomb 

still shakin 

hit em in his body and his head, now be found in heaven with the wound 

still achin' 

I wonder if his voice still breakin' 

better be cause I steadily 

hit him with gats and styles that heavily 

armed and dangerous and deadily 

that ahead of me receive two holes like the letter be	 

better you instead of me, breakin peace can increase your chances 

to delete your advances for slate I can paint this piece on canvas 

with a paint brush that a nigga can't truss like a god so I can't rush 

won't crush 

if you ever heard about a crew that can't bust then motherfucker it 

ain't us; don't touch 

a mike or a gun if you ain't gonna use it, 

do it 

claiming your weapons and tecs and you gonna be checked and fluid

the young kill everyday the old itchin to kill 'cause they ain't offed 

a nigga dead in years 

shoot him dead in his, this style of flow is a verbal calico

show the biggest dick with the biggest clique that be hazardous if 

I let the trigga click 

you don't benefit if a nigga get from the rage if he live it just a 

little bit; so go on with the riddle shit 

if you got something to stress then get it off your chest and 

we can take it to the middle bitch 

and go on get it on and I bet you that the outcome is that I'm leavin 

niggas out done, cut up 

but its odd to see a motherfucker outrun just because he let his 

mouth run so shut up 

and sit back if you know what's good for you I can still overthrow you 

I don't give a fuck about the fact that the hood know you 

don't make a nigga have to show you

Twista,"Let me play with your emotions

Well a motherfucker could never control me, only squeeze me and hold me
That's what the ho came up and told me
Now is she bold G? But in my mouth is where the gold be
Cause I be pimpin' her like Goldie
Gotta get paid in this age my fingers ain't made
Just to be choppin' up confetti with,
If it's already thick you better study nigga if you ain't with it you can get it
'Cause I ain't even on that petty shit
So who the fuck you actin' petty wit'?
The rhythm I kick, is like a rhythmly-wicked-arith-a-metic
Pick em up quick and then give em the dick, thinkin' I'm innocent
They up in the mall shoppin' for me pickin' a fit
I got them heffer's nose red
And when we get in the bed, I be leavin' 'em with rose legs
Stuffin' that made em wanna pose dead
But you already got em until you get up in them hoes head
I don't mean to sound bogus or nothin'
But it's the bomb when I be havin' them cuties thinkin'
I'm in love with em, when I'm rubbin' 'em
Be gettin' pub with em, in a club with 'em
Smokin' dub with em, huggin' 'em, freakin' in the tub with 'em
After gettin' paid from her she ain't trippin'
'Cause she know she got what she paid for
She honor my name, I gotta tame, here it go
Now we speakin' with the game on ways to make mo'

Let me play with your emotions ho (Let me play, with your emotions)
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that,
Tell me baby can you buy that
I got you under my complete control,
You know it's worth more than diamonds and gold,
Now don't be bogus and deny that

Emotions ho (Let me play, with your emotions)
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that,
Tell me baby can you buy that
I got you under my complete control,
You know it's worth more than diamonds and gold,
Now don't be bogus and deny that

Now how the fuck you gon' act ho, I saw you creepin' out the back do'
What you runnin' from a mack fo'? Lay you on your back slow
Cause you know I got you with my lasso
Blow your mind like a afro
Come and take a glimpse of the stairs
It's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I betcha notice the smell
It's like a lotus when I flow dis, cause my eyes be the lowest
If you didn't notice then you bogus as hell
I'm puttin' women under my spell, like I'm up in their brain
Pumpin' their vein with game for the anatomy that's feminine
They're fillin' 'em up with adrenaline,
Got 'em geekin' we're speakin' approachin up a pimp like a gentleman
Submission is surrenderin, it ain't no endin' if it's on
With a blunt from the bomb side
In the right place, with the right mind and the right line
You can get a lifetime contract
They be wise until they look into your eyes
A shorty freaked when she spotted mine
Took her over to my crib, lay low, hit her off from behind
Then she signed on the dotted-line, the ho was like,
""Ooh Daddy, why you doin' me like this?
I'd do anything to be with you, you got me gone in the head""
Ya mind, I don't mean to make a disaster up
Like my Dad to master love
But if a motherfucker breakin' you for every penny you earn
Then how could you still show the bastard love?
I guess it's cause I'm cold, shit
Thought you was gon' be spendin' me I betcha think you sho' did
But game recognize game, now you lame in the brain
Stupid bitch that's what you get for tryin' to gold dig

Now let me play wit' your motions ho (Let me play, with your emotions)
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that,
Tell me baby can you buy that
I got you under my complete control,
You know it's worth more than diamonds and gold,

I got you under my complete control,
You know it's worth more than diamonds and gold,
Now don't be bogus and deny that

Yeah, this be Hype, the Verbal Tantrum
Kickin it with my man Twista
If you should suck my soul
I should make your funky emotions
Nothin is good unless you play with it
Play with me baby

I know you think it's blasphemy
But won't you give up when she ask for me? After he passed the beat
Since you said I was your Magesty, I had to see
And when you get paid, there is some cash for me, is it a tragedy
That I can get her so gone, the ho be trippin' talkin' up her love a lot
But the only love I got, is when I'm grippin' like I wanna hug the Glock
Or when I rub the twat, or pickin' up a dub at spots
Fuck the ho thugs, the clubs, and the phony perpetrators with dimes
The speed knots match voo-Do or Die, Psycho Drama, Crucial Conflict
Be pimpin' with 'em gators and dons, collect the papers and dolls
Player haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust
So keep walkin' the next time you hear grown folks talkin'
Motherfuckers betta shut the fuck up, cause we make the women suck up
You insist to be trippin' while we be gamin like Don Juan
What up the filet minion, the grey poupon
Them hoes are staked to charm, because we make the bomb
Now I don't mean no harm, but either come on in or get on gone
And let me pour my potion slow
In between your thighs, come take a pull and vibe
And let your tongue go coastin' low

Now let me play with your emotions ho (Let me play, with your emotions)
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that,
Tell me baby can you buy that
I got you under my complete control,
You know it's worth more than diamonds and gold,
Now don't be bogus and deny that

Mean difference of ways still I can light you like an arsonist
Put my heart in this particularly funny when we start to kiss  marvelous
How I see you in the cut chillin' with your homies gettin' fucked up
I got fantasies of you carrying me home
I hope you stayin'alone I'm into givin' pleasure
Echoin' rhythms of my  manly moans
Don't be playin' me wrong I'm too grown for games,
Mental manipulation ain't the occupation for the playa you facin' I'm strong
'Cause you see I don't be really quite comin' on the same
Boldly and bodily fluids with every word that 'curs
Girl you deserve some herb and company to be with,
Fuck whoever you were gonna leave with I'm the one you should see shit,
I found some love like Adam and Eve shit
Who you should be with your body I squeeze quick
Stick through the sheets are your arms and see don't be alarmed
If I make you feel good all over
'Cause I be droppin' the bomb that's 'cause I'm in the beyond
Even though niggaz in the hood is all soldiers
You still gonna suffer the consequences
Defenseless thinkin' about becomin' my wife
If I rock you tonight you be the love of my life
'Cause I be huggin' you like I'm huggin' the mic
Plus I'm the one that's rubbin' you right
And able to stick my tongue up in your navel and lick till you drop
Even though I like to hit the twat
I'm realizin' there's a variation of ways I can get you hot
I'm in to learnin' you so pick the spot,
I'll get pleasure too but let me hush and let the lust get a check
I know you don't want me to hit it yet, but don't act like its a crime
'Cause it hasn't been committed yet,
But baby won't you let me get it what? Get it wet (Get it wet)

Gimme some Tang and Alizé
Let me tickle your body, after the party we can pleasure will you come let me
(Get it wet)
Let me saturate you body with honey and lick it up
Stick it up after release and let it rupt' is it enough to
(Get it wet)
Try to marinate your mind what's up am I deserving your love
Just 'cause we up in the club don't think you bogus if you let me
(Get it wet)
But you be the only one I be thinkin' of gimme a hug you got me sprung in love

Last time I heard you was playing with emotions and po' pimpin'

Twista,"[Intro]
This goes out to all riders worldwide
Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
Where playa hatin killers and the hood niggaz thrive
And lame motherfuckers can barely survive

[Verse 1]
One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch
Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh
Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit
The high discover me, hit the front porch
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home 'cause one of them
Got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where y'all goin y'all thick as hell
What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit 
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin too much though
We just ridin around bumpin sounds trippin out while we flame janes 
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang
And slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing
Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit
Speedpass the clit and get passionate
Grab the buckle and unfasten it
And we can get into some ol' nasty shit
Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus
This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie
Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by
But hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high
Cause it feels so good

[Chorus]
It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good 
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes 
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
And it feels so good

Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up when niggas we lust 
Smokin' some but the flame tight
Trippin' off how we survivin' the rugged terrian and try to hang tight
Getting fucked up on gang night 
Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the srap even we 
Sent deebo back to back to back
We still be buildin' stacks and packs rollin through the blacks
Black ashtrays with blunt reds and crack sacs
We sittin' and chillin' what we're feenin' on been in bitches' cribs 
Hopin its on the fenal strokin were strollin alone
Rollin the chrome out really trippin because we take the smoke to the 
Dome
Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones glisten from all 
The sunlight
Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight boody hung right 
And every night we see at least one fight, hookin up with 
My fellow Westside cliques 
Now together we mush but when are we strapped through and rug cutters
Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers
Ridin' every one of ya'll my muhfuckers
So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome
We gone to blaze on till my brain's blown
Hope to get my thing on no matter what block or or street you kick it 
Throughout the world its the same song (so the Mobsters just flame on)
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood now we got up on hittin' 
The 'cause
From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves mo' we got up on some 
Bud, straight hittin' up the block searching for love
Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone smokin delight the body 
Right what the party like are you as live as I 
Come roll with me so we can ride the sky but only if you let me play 
With you while we ridin' high 'cause it feels so good


Chorus


(Verse 3)
Sittin back cruising through the slow breeze thinkin how can I get mo' 
Cheese
Bumpin' a system costin' 4 G's I stay on my P's for the po p's 
Split the philly with my door keys
Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin' through 
Sit on the floor playin' Tekken 2
Lesson two I'm adressin' you turn out the lights like the World Class 
Wreckin' Crew bring out the best in you 
Confessin true lies about your inner thighs and where they been 
Hopin maybe you be my lady
What's the potatoes without the gravy what you feelin on maybe soft with 
The silicone baby, but can you pay me
Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll while rockin dope flows I'll 
Lose the spot if I choose to stop
We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about how later on you comin' out 
Your clothes, shoes and socks now is that news or not
Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O"" get a ""be"" and 
Split it now watch me kill it
Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro on billets take a choke 
On so I can really feel it
Thinkin' about not having the rich life but the hood life was still a 
Good life and that we know 
Always and forever though, for ever more rollin in the ghetto with no 
Where to go and it feels so good

",It Feels So Good,1997
Twista,"hold on they're murderin' up if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up 

if you religious praise it up if you gotta get high then blaze it up 

for the ones that never gave it up take a champagne glass and raise it 

up 



verse 1: 



again it was the feelin when I saw his blood spillin 

poppin' lip takin over his tip is why he had to kill him 

now his body's in chalk and no longer can talk so then a life is lost 

somebody tricked off and the killer is caught so now his life is cost 

you might get caught so to make a move these motherfuckers are 

petrified 

on the best to try so when we slide so first bless the rest that died 

is it a test of pride when inside you pull the trigger but you didn't 

want to pull it 

could it be a motherfucker on the other side of the bullet 

should it matter naw, you figure Ima waste 'em just a murder for the 

nation 

for some hemmed up, locked up, broke up for felonies and other overly 

motherly abrasion 

now in front of of me encased in a coffin is a body with people around 

sad and froze 

tears drop like rain but people didn't feel the pain till the casket 

closed 

now the drastic shows and mother threw a frown even when the gunner 

was found 

'cause it seems like yesterday he was runnin around now he under the 

gruond 

'cause the gunner get down in these streets even though you pack a piece 

for heat niggaz urgin' to bust 

the game ain't the same so stay away from the curb if you out there 

servin' them up and

if you religious priase it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up

up 

make a toast to yourself for survivin in a world that's so corrupt 



(repeat) 



verse: 



again it was the feelin when I saw his blood pourin' 

tragedy mess a man look in the mirror and then I see stud mournin' 

as the streets erases others, it encase a brother 

you had enough heart to waste this brother but can you face his mother 

I was faced with other types of problems that had held me back 

couldn't tell me jack now I'm gone in my own zone but you didn't have 

to tell me that 

so come trail me back to a time when a motherfucker had lost his will 

to survive 

me and my folks had to rob and steal for a meal he'd had to kill to 

survive 

I remember when you had my back when the relative passed and my mother 

cried 

when the house caught flames you collapsed in my arms when you heard 

that your father died 

I take drama in stride I don't have to go through a thang to get myself 

together 

see for yourself but the worst is gone so its on till the roamin' have 

his shelter 

but if they end up back on the streets again and I have to receive my 

fate 

smoke weed at the wake so the pain and hate escapes to keep the kids 

straight 

'cause you did straight if your seed succeed 'cause they keep learnin, and 

keep growin up 

right now survivin' in a place that's full of doubt and about to 

self-destruct

visualize in invisible eyes how I individualize 

critical cries of pitiful skies that rain pain upon the ghettoland 

where the unforgettable dies 

subliminal lies means no motherfucker never gon make it if he knew 

people to keep it in check soon 

womb to the tomb death is in the next room if a nigga don't realize 

the k's infects doom 

lets assume anotha brotha want to laugh at you I think he just coulda 

blasted you 

you inhabit you killed them now the trigga tried to kick it but his 

niggaz comin after you 

tellin you its strange of us be crazy steppin to a motherfucker that's 

dangerous 

'cause its a gang of us throwin knuckles in a scuffle if we have two 

thangs to bust 

cocaine to us and my brains to dust I represent you up there so I try 

as long as my enemy bust but soon to be crushed I don't really give a 

fuck if I die so I lie 

my people should be glad to survive in the land of the lost 

its plan of the bos leavin motherfuckers dyin with their grandmothers 

hand on the cross 

so I take a stand when I talk, ran instead of walk to chalk up another 

victory 

how you did the caper hid the paper breaking other niggaz off is a 

mystery

keep comin' up

Mobsters reign, we hope you feel this

My click been strugglin' half a lifetime tryin' to get our shit on
Got no G's to sit on, even sold niggas sacks and packs to get on

Look a murderer in the face, comin' up where the wild and deranged get blessed

Liffs a hustler by nature, fiend for paper, schemes and capers
Constantly eyed by neighbors who do the Feds favors
It ain't no major though, whether slangin' yay or blow
As long as it's payin' me for my occupation criminal
Pullin' up on hoes, as the weed smoke blows, the essence of a mobsters presence
Is the reason she chose, as the regency rolls, on zeros, the pearl white Olds
Mobile, shit I'm a ride high til I die or get killed
Smoke like fields, forever dodgin' blue shields
We're blue steel I got full proof escape skills
When paper chasin' leavin' trails of shell cases

Givin' niggas punkin heads for nothin', while bumpin', handle my functions
My pistles pumpin', got hoes jumpin', a mobstas always into somethin'

I can feel Killuminati lookin' over my shoulder
Somethin' keeps tellin' me to get mine before it's over
Smokin' on plenty of buddah and still prayin' to get blessed, with forgiveness
For the last time I sinned on this survival quest
From hustlin' 24-7 to makin' niggas get undressed
The mobster in me got me obsessed
With lucci and success, so I can care less
If I gotta be lootin' and woopin'
I'm sick of beggin' niggas for rides
Id rather be the one that's scoopin'
'Cause in these last days it's day to day hustlin' for Maze 
I want fresh gear every day
Fat ass chain and 3 blades
Trippin' on that 2 faced niggas sweatin' dick
While I rock the stage
Like these bitches is just tryin' to get paid to give a nigga AIDS
Like I can use her for turnin' tricks
Or either for hittin' licks and then rap about the shit
In one the mobster's greatest hits

Twista,"I hang wit pullers of automatic triggers and gold diggers
My mob?s full of go getters go live or die by the cold niggas
Wit drama bringers ear ringers and pistol slingers with itchy fingers
Getting high on inhaling nigga smoke that lingers
Buck wild hostile we verbal barrels threw nostrils
My hollow point apostles turn living flesh into fossils
It?s through gospel niggas will wet it Vick Malif?ll shred it
Beef on these streets only gets the best of you if you let it

Well it?s that Westside nigga from K-Town always gonna stay down
Lay pounds on the table, smoking while watchin' cable
I'm able to lick the shot from the porch of my block
And when the gun spray stops there's no information for cops
Nigga I'm heartless some say I role wit the forces of darkness
But the closest I burned to death is the reason
That I spark this spark this, what?
Dramafied premeditated homicide that coincides with the day you die
'Cause G, I'm about to let it ride

Petty niggas down when the bullets fly
No remorse your fuckin' wit a Mobsta
For fuckin' wit a Mobsta
If you got your shit right then run and hide
'Cause I got a slip quick clip on the side

Makin' heaven a hospital, and where I'm from it?s highly probable
In a Benny, reefa roller, street patroller stackin' clips for lethal loadin'
In the city where secrecy?s golden
Live or die in the Chi, we kill demeanors wit inferred beamers
Death is the sinner
Whether the Reaper awaits your fate with your soul on his finger

Nigga you can't retreat
When the Mobstaz greet you with bullets like Robert De Niro on Heat
And makin' killin' look sweet
See a nigga like Mayze break the safety I hold the clip ?till infinite
To show your definite when I make you cry
Blood like I broke your virginity
Shit my Mobstaz is straight cheat vs. killers for cash
Quick to stick your ass and flash this 3-80 and rainbow macs
And now you thinking of bringin' that bull shit in this direction
Just cause you rap a lot don't mean you can't get a lethal injection

Picture Link the mercenary fuckin' you like missionary
Position them missile carriers precision ?till them bitches buried
But a Mobstaz sip on Sherries snitch niggas sing like canaries
Where we wrong be carrying Clone Periyon and Herringbone
We on the streets in territory we chill come and get you chest pealed
Hot steal and banana clips standing on tip
You get your flesh filled wit rhinos
Energies feel for my soul they holdin' captive
Visions of living strengthy posses me lets make it happen

'Cause it?s in the heat seaker of the street sweeper
Think I'm lying if you want shit is deadly as slugs
Got you swimming in the blood like sea creatures
'Cause you done lit to the land of the lost
Where our straps looking as pretty as bitches
But pullin' up in a hearse to a church
Is the curse of these hideous witches
Hittin' hoes wit, 44?s and four by fours wit the pain of a figure four
Wounds hit you like a hit will blow

Every nigga on this track I?ll pull a trigger for
If you test the rock vest, pullin' slugs like a lockness
I'm a for show protect my chest
Everything in holes is what I unload and not less
Until meals make progress
Why?all niggas no who why?all be never let me see your face in my spot
While you still be facin' your block I?ma be erasing you block
Snappin' off like Jason on rocks tastin' your knots
Cause when it?s pockets for profit I can't stop it this mob got me

But y'all thinking' cause I be talking shit
Them hoes say that nigga cold as hell
Fuck what the punks are talking 'bout
I want to get up with that big balling bitch
Plus niggas feeling what I'm on as well

True to the shine on his bone

Crying on the phone
Ho thinking I'm in love with her
Cause she took me shopping and had me trying on cologne
So I left her on the line with the tone
Got up with this other bitch
Brought no weed cause she firing up her own
So hurry with the Phillie bitch, I'm really sick
Off of some illy shit
Here go a rusty razor blade, but still it split
And fill it with the killer shit so I can really trip
It's like the bud was tailor made for milli-clips
And Mac Ten's, I lit the bead from the back end
Straight to the chest and it got me sprung
My lungs started collapsing, shit, nigga, what's happening?
The - got me tripping off the drums and guns, ready for action
Duck and swing on either upper thing
Try to be tougher, bang, scuff and hang
Suffer pain, left deranged then you a bogus motherfucker, man

And snatching fees, now that I'm up in this game
I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
niggas rolling me beads just so they can hang

Can you figure out the cause and effect
niggas coming on your set
Thugs coming out they drawers with a TEC
Victim bleeding from the neck
Shirts is getting wet, shorties yelling threats
Looking for the one who called for the deck
Now they airing out the hall in the spot
Hitting stomachs, leaving niggas pinched up
Bodies balled in a knot
Bullet holes in the wall from a Glock
Searching for the one who called in the shots
Hypes crawling for rocks
Going all in the socks of the recently deceased
From what was released
From the chrome beast to the dome piece
Visions in my mind being increased by inner beef
With some grief, but when I chief on some strong leaf
I'm snapping hard enough to make a nigga try to check his own chief
Violate him but can't annihilate him
Picking up his own teeth and it's on with the microphone deep
Stimulate him with pistols penetrate him
Nerves still jumping cause adrenaline pumping is a motherfucker
Hit him with the steel bloodsuckers
Murdered the bud-lovers, making sure every one of you ho studs suck us
And I bullshit you not if it was full clips, two Glocks
You would still die or you'll get too hot
Cause when my fuel kick you'll drop
Hypes is tricking on you
Tell me where he at bitch and you'll get two rocks
Cause when my tool click you'll pop
Can't this hype nigga stop shit, I'm hazardous
Making musical miracles like I'm Jesus of Nazareth
Yet disastrous, smoking on halves and hash, fuck if it's cancerous
Bust ass to the beat cause I mastered this
It's hard to breathe, I'm busting like an A-Bomb
Cause I'm in the zone, twenty-two a cold shit up my sleeve
It's hard to stay calm thinking about the bitches that I'm fin' to bone
Hitting my enemies and competition up with lethal blows
That's damaging, flows that's callous and we're leaving
Thick ladies frantic and people in the industry panicking
I thought we got in this to get out of pistol handling
Now it's possible motherfuckers could start vanishing
Fuck the Anacin I be toking plenty and stinking from stress
And flowing over notes; them studs thinking they can get close
I know I got you tripping off the shit
A nigga said off a overdose

I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
And snatching fees, now that I'm up in this game
I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
niggas rolling me beads just so they can hang

C'mon and toke on a dub with me; I love cities with parties
That's full of bitches where they let me rub titties
Be able to pack a snub with me; in case we get in some static
And gotta start leaking blood from stud skinnies
So don't ask if it's the bud in me; because for some reason
I smoke on some weed and get too wicked and raw
It can't be nickel or soft the way it's choking me
Potency'll have me rocking mic's
And giving your bitch dick in the jaw, I'm hooking the law
You're looking in awe, took what you saw
Got the B's pen and pad out the bottom drawer
Then got to biting and formulating some shit you called your own
But take it to the rehab cause you got a flaw
To put it simple you ain't cold enough
Tripping out like you can't control the stuff
Lacking rhythm like you known to bust
In a different zone from us
You niggas need to sit the fuck down
Get a swisher and roll this up
If you think I'm speaking too bold, what's up
I ain't even on no ho shit; plus the mob is so thick
I'm the type of nigga you should want to get up close to
And take a smoke with
If there's static then check yo' clique; my mind is so sick
I be tweaking with speaking, releasing energy to show I know the ropes
Cause when it comes to this rap shit
niggas will choke 'til I'm ghost
While I breath reefer smoke from my overdose
Try to put me to the test, give me some Buddha bless
I'll show you who the best
Release the vocal trilogy

Alright, T, god damn slow it up, man
Motherfuckers' done felt you, man, we can go to the next shit
God damn, man, you stopping motherfuckers and shit
Man, I'm trying to get my zone on
Let niggas hear what the fuck I'm doing man
I mean, you done zoned man, let's go to the next cut baby
Man, fuck that shit",Overdose,1997
Twista,"I know a whole bunch of motherfuckers that's prepared whoop
Leave a body bloody red to scoop
Poppin' off lead for loot
Shot the pussy up from head to boot
Just for talkin' dramatic when it was static you was scared to shoot
Police prepared to swoop
To catch a nigga on the runway but don't none stay for the white chalk
If aired out your tip watch your lip because hypes talk
I you wasn't seen then you might walk
Even if it ain't the time of day niggas will find a way like locos off of NoDoz
Careful when you servin' yo' blow because those hoes
Got the Po-Po's posing as hobos
Take a photo of him please
Tell the Chi Town he freeze they don't give a fuck if it was DT's
They be up like the sea breeze on CC's
And they handin' out these murders like free cheese
Could you pass me the B please
I got intricate shit to kick even though I campaign with a gang
Bumpin' though in different denominations in the nations
And the nations racin' worried because I'm slangin' the thangs

If you dissin' them then you dissin' me
Niggas actin like they glad to die so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me

In a hoopty shorty's will design a spot
So when the get pulled over them people wouldn't find the spot
But if you ain't got it hid you have the flowest
If you can throw it and motherfucker its a nine to knot
Just go back to where your thang lay
Cause lo key niggas they started out in the gang way
But if you wild when your aim spray
Them niggas that you aired out is gonna be comin' back the same day
In the middle of a war you ain't on the tip
If you get the guns and clips to keep doin' what you doin'
Is it the same chiefs that got the same beef
Claimin' they ain't been doin the bruh be givin' it to 'em
Flamboyant niggas must be slow
If your bitch ain't get popped then its a blessin' she a lucky ho
Cause no matter where the fuck he go
In K Town they will dress him in a casket and tuxedo
Cause you can't be actin thug roof
Because of Hennesey and drug use these niggas love juice
Some don't even considered gettin caught
Cause when you talk up some shit the gonna be quick and let the slugs loose
These motherfuckers heart is love boo
Especially like them niggas up at Ghostown Windy City snipe
Cause its a pitty when hype
For niggas wanna get witty
For comin' too pretty
Get the chilli filled and desipher
To pay the piper and bow to viper
Twice is rough
Now is what I'm kickin' hype enough
Cause every time I puff and write this stuff
I kick a frenzy facin' fuckin' and fury 'cause I don't like to bluff

So writing what I wrote is hopeless
If you see our base and you said then you better be ferocious
And matter fact I hope the dopest
For to try to cope this is hopeless

The reason I'm gunnin' I tried the runnin'
Cause I should have let you know
I don't give a fuck you was fronted because you was blunted
West side to the hunters you can't step to ho
In the state of emergency urgently the ambulance will come
And then the law will come demand the gun
But bullshit irrelevence they need evidence
Or trippin' on elegance they be holdin' out they hands for some
If anything they'll hand 'em some
Or get wit him here come the victim he be shot up in his pants and lungs
Cause he actin hard and ran his tongue
Don't mean another nigga he meet in the street gonna be the man to run

Twista,"Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Sometimes I be wakin' up at high noon
Sayin', ""Why me Lord?"" folks thinkin' I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin', but when they sleepin'
I be concealed up in my room, knowin' that it could happen
I'm just tryin' to maintin', because the future is untold
Till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin' after my P
So many phony niggas lovin' to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggas comin' after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin'?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin' for bruisin'
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin' his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin' with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin', I ain't scared to go
But yet my heart is steady pumpin' for somethin'
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin'
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin'
Bodies start jumpin', wreckin' my brain not to try and understand
But withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin'
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
Even though I'm not hopin' to go
I wish someone would open the do
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a Land Cruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a light pole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion
I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin' too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
And the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin' but steady fallin'
Right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin' Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggas wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin' us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin' shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renault's get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin' closer
Paranoid like a crack fiend when the gat seen
Scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
So now my sight is gettin' dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin'
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin' weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
But wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin' close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin', but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?

Get the dope, chop it up
Get the plate, I can't wait
Fifth of henn, in my hand
Ask for some, you too late
Now I'm high, really high
Man I'm about to shout
I see you over there talking
But what the fuck you talking about
Oh I'm blazed, in a daze
Purple haze and ash trays
Mac mike you got the light
We green this ain't no fucking day
Black havana
Craving the vapors of chronic
Dj p with no weed and know what
This shit is so fucking ironic

I got them blood shot red eyes
Look into my eyes
Did you see a big surprise
Can't you tell a nigga high
I can fly, I can float
Meet your boy up on the boat
Watch me dive into the water
Like titanic when it broke
Yo keep the weed coming
Keep them drinks coming
Niggas walking around
In that daze like they need something
Cream bumming
Lighters flicking
On the road their ain't no finish
Send them back
Stop in the kitchen

Vocal cords swords
Side board more souvenir
Skins of belly body

Make them steal
Planes crash ships sink
Every poison gets sweet
Every enemy see
Feel the nuclear nigga heat
May I propose a toast
Its coming close to world war iii
Fright night
Under moonlight
Memphis picture
Mutilating torture pressure
Till the satan took ya
I'll beat ya till there's nothing left but slop
Feed you to the swamp
Running through the forest like gunk
Bloody tree trunk
Bitch you want a piece of this
Might as well take the heart
There was no love from the start
Sprinkle body parts

Hanging with the soldiers
Still got the feelings that we pearling
Show me where they working

Money on a fifth of henn
Tell the motherfucker drink up
Why the skunk weed starting to stank dawg
Bitch go and get some gin
We gonna get the party cranked up
Put your bank up we gonna need more
Weefer chain cause our cryptic addicted to weed smoke
Get incisions of pure seeded snow
Take a puff choke shit of this weed dope
And I'm off my square now
Went and yelled out
Where the nigga trying to get sloppier
Dropping ya
If you trying to get us
While we uzing them
Rolling with the three 6 mafia
Popping ya popular
Buck at niggas with the rock
Close encounters of the herb kind
Leave you sitting on the curb crying
South side getting bucked up
In a party with a burb mind
We gonna tear this bitch up
Cause we fucked up
Gone off that sticky
When I zone off can't hit me
Have me going in illusions
Trying to get me
Infatuated with drugs
Smoked out snorted out drunken and blown
Getting crunk in that mode
Twista gotta stay high
Smoke a skunk till I'm old
Now chucking like I'm sea sick
On the front porch with the mob
And we be thick
Roll when you see twista and three 6
Who can bog the motherfucking mind

Pull my mink over your shoulders when we leave out the club 
Ain't no need to knock a con, I'm feelin' like Chaka Kahn

What's up shorty, can we kick it tonight and choke on the sack 

Come see as I foreplay, freaky at this slow-ass track 
Big and black, had attention ready to dig in that 
So what we just met, that don't mean I won't give you respect 
I just fight the temptation to get your body real wet

On my elevator you can feel our love rise to the top 
'Cause on the way up to my condo, your ears pop 
When I hit the lock I'm a villain, the mobstas make the killin' 
As we lay on my waterbed with the mirrors on the ceiling 

The wall too, got friends that's all true, I call Cru 
Tryin' to fall too, I got tall brew, it's all you 
Or like I be, let's shoot up to the club, like two tattoos 
VIP, who gets who, no dancing with two left shoes 

Do that fool, do that, do that, who that creeps on my hood 
Do I see my nigs thuggin' but, dawg, y'all lookin' good 
Ballers please, it's a straight playas party, can't fuck with these 
Champagne and Henessies for my G's and stuck a piece, and uh 

Haters please, no bustin' we up in place 
Put 'em in the trunk, the flame 
When I'm tryin' to get up with ""what's her name"" 
The precious tonight I met, let's ride, I feel this like a set 

While you're dancing, I'ma kiss off the sweat 
That's how you let me get it wet

So I, asked Proceeds, to pass the B's, no bitch

Do you wanna rock with me?
Do you wanna smoke my B's?
Never could you take my G's
I'm a Po P-I-M-P

Do you wanna rock with me?

Never could you take my G's
I'm a Po P-I-M-P

Wanna be like P-I, M-P, hoes, plenty
Comin straight from the Windy
Choppin' up tens and twenties, mm!
Lean back in the corner with the dob hat
Now my nature is to ball like a democrat
In the club with hoes, and I suppose
That I've been chose, the nigga with the hoodrat
Mm, mm, mm, mm, got it down pat
You call her what you want or even all that
I been taught by the best, so put it to rest
And I confess, I'm here just to ball black
Gettin' paid in the game bend a row free
Flip a penny to a dime I'm like an O-G
Go to the mall, with all of y'all
Show you some cash, now, tell me what you want B
You can ride or just smoke in the Cadillac
AC, windows down, with the top back
From a Caddy to Lex' to Rolex
I'm a put in a roll, tell me could you top that?
Ever though I'm makin' money in a row friend
Nickle dime if no fiend don't approach me
If you do, we could have sex, in the Caddy or Lex
But keep on the low-key

Do you wanna rock with me?
Do you wanna smoke my B's?
Never could you take my G's
I'm a Po P-I-M-P

Do you wanna ride with me?
Do you wanna smoke my B's?
Never could you take my G's
I'm a Po P-I-M-P, well a motherfucker used to say I might be broke
But now I'm stackin' C-notes, still dope
Different strokes, same folks, hangin' from a rope
Me and Do or Die just try to cope
Sit back and like a picture take a toke
Take a stroll through the hood
It's some haters but it's still all good
Roll up another bad boy, playa pimpin' to the groove
In the place to be to see who I can choose
Now it's time for me to make a move
Shorty what's the deal?

I done seen your sexy walk on the Pharcyde
So don't be ""Passin' Me By""
I'm a nigga with peas and I ain't stingy with the trees
We could be some freaks and both of our ass could be high
Fiends drip, ours is full of octane
With pimp status and a hot name, we don't gotta pop thangs
No more servin' the rock 'caine, the night-game
Flippin' flows like hoes which is a drop-game
It's like, aw suki suki now, lookie here
Stick a phrase while I trades on my hog road
Divine words form the pimp scroll
Get the bitch if I'm walkin' and she peepin' that my limp's cold
See a playa po' trippin',
Peepin' the Mediterranean try to play me in slow-vision
Picture how I'm mackin' cold women
Bendin' and grinnin my hair spinnin'
While we smokin' on Henny, still po pimpin'

Do you wanna ride, slip-slide in your thighs
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh

Do you wanna ride, slip-slide in your thighs
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh

Do you wanna rock with me?
Do you wanna smoke my B's?
Never could you take my G's
I'm a Po P-I-M-P

Do you wanna rock with me?
Do you wanna smoke my B's?
Never could you take my G's

Get up in here and do our thang, heh
That's how we gon' do
Hahahaha

[Twista]
Get down to the club
Chokin' on sticky and everything was loved, oh yeah
Look here now
Then on came the lights, hey
All the niggas and bitches in the party was feelin' high
Liffy Stokes bring it

[Liffy Stokes]
Tonight's gon' be the bomb, it's warm and calm
I got to take this cool in my arm with an ounce in my palm
I done took the bottle with Don, and I'm back for sure
Actin' a fool, gettin' skully, mixin' henny and mo
With plenty to draw, and we gotta blaze by the door
With too much M to the O from rushin' the dance floor
Mob style runnin' wild through every section and aisle
Drinkin' River, pissy now, collectin' numbers to dial
Talkin' loud, flash the cheese just for the haters and keys
That try to catch me sooner so they can cease without the cheese
Through mobstability, y'all be killin' me
With that weak shit, a nigga just came to party
With my guys and women probably pitchin' couple of innings
Break em down through my winnings and come out Detroit grinnin
With my paper and ladies on the E doin' about eighty
Tryin' to get to the (?) so that freaky bitch can lay me

[Chorus]
When the mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
'Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with
The mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
'Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with

[Mayz]
I'm bendin' curves through the gym straight smokin' and drinkin'
Westside, mob style, and the mink and the lickin'
Trippin' on the cutie that's winkin'
'Cause she know we got the shit that rocks her block
And put the boom in your box and make your speakers pop
So I take this as my cue to make sure shorty don't snooze
The mobsta's rockin' tonight at the House of Blues
With some mo and some crews and now she lookin' in dues
Talkin' about bringin' our homies and puttin' on dancin' shoes
It's like that y'all, let your paper stack tall
So when you hit the club you can ball and get some numbers to call
Don't worry about the playa haters leanin' on the wall
Because when they get the gold and start to ball
They gonna have to fight us all to the end
Playas get a glass and a set of twins
In different clothes so they can be a thug's extend
'Cause when this party ends another begins it don't stop
So flash your knot and beep me at my guy's red shop

[Chorus]
[Twista]
Hey hey, oh suki-suki now, look here now, what's cookin' now
Shook it shook it, child, shake it down, let's boogie now
From the hood and I be the chief, feelin' good as taters and waiters
With playas with the ladies pullin' up in big-ridin' Mercedes
This party gon' fade me, smokin' with the brokes and the brothers
Cherry gators, yo dawg, this pocket's full hundreds and rollers
I'm kickin' it out with tippin' dippin' off from the laws
In the glance of an eye with drawers, while they hustlin' just to ball
(?) so I bought a drink, sport a link, recall the mink
Hoe figure she was pretty and think maybe I ought to wink
And she takes a glance, party'a boomin' so maybe I got a chance
This cutie got too much booty and I asked her to dance
Flippin' 50s in my hand, champagne all up in my face
Takin' pictures, (?) close 'em all bitches' probably in the place
Straight po pimpin', I'm trippin' (?) it's the weekend
Steady quickin', take a pimpin' and pay the scraps for sneakin'

But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Sometimes I be wakin up at high noon
sayin, ""Why me Lord?"" -- folks thinkin I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin, but when they sleepin
I be concealed up in my room, knowin that it could happen
I'm just tryin to maintin, because the future is untold
till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin after my P
So many phony niggaz lovin to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggaz comin after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin, I ain't scared to go
but yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin
Bodies start jumpin, wreckin my brain not to try and understand
but withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
even though I'm not hopin to go
I wish someone would open the do'
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a landcruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a lightpole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion

I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
and the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin but steady fallin
right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggaz wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renaults get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin closer
Paranoid like a crackfiend when the gat seen
scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
so now my sight is gettin dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
but wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin, but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when

[Beanie Franks]
Picture a niggas that's raw

Muthafuckas I slaughter
Blow 'em out the water
L-E-G-I-T that's Ballers
My styles as lethal
As a bitch that's found with AIDS gettin loose
Nigga before you get spraid wit some hot shit
While you run I pop shit 
Yo ghetto ain't no harder than mine, fuck that block shit
You can't manage them thangs 
The robber takin and born in the range 
Battle the match and bang
I hold my gun up high screamin ""Fuck 'Em All""
Then I get in that as like cholesterol
I got the game lock dowm like Alcatraz
And if you escape you betta haul ass
Cause when I catch ya physically and mentally
I bring yo ass on the block that's the penalty
Put 'em in the hot seat grab a hoe
I'll show you some shit that'll make your eyes explode out ya skull
Cause bein odd ont the block is a N-O
Niggas didn't know that I could go off, and show off, and throw off the law
Turn, send ten shows that'll burn 
what's left is a muthafuckin dent in the alley
Beanie Franks is the shit on the Grand Finale

Now its time for Turtle Banks to spit

[Turtle Banks]
Turtle Banks
You know its my turn to buss
And make weak muthafuckas turn to dust
And if you weak you die in the streets of Chi
Its deep drive by my bullets fly in the seat
Them niggas ain't ballin mufuckas fakin 
Scared of facin Legit Ballers at ya crib waitin
And now you shakin
Call the guys to come chase me
I make them punk muthafuckas buckle up for safety
A bitch, a pickle, a chicken, a clique, niggas is sick
For they skits and they scurges 
Now I'm pimpin the pain cause I'm urgin
And rearrangin your muthafuckin face like a surgeon
Lyrics layin wit a four that's what I be fuck settin every peace
My shit to yo ass I see 
O, for my mob status I'ma lay low 
Representin Legit Ballers and niggas biten the flow
On the streets or the stage 
A 45 or a gauge 
that's why me and the Twista always hittin the front page
For what? cause we so damn cold
And when we enter the car niggas cluthcin they hoes
So fuck it, fall wit dust and get snatched 
While Nitty bustes the facts in the Grand Finale

[Toxic]
Yeah 'lil nigga its been once for you bitches

And just when you thought it was over
T-Nitty in here doin danger 

[T-Nitty]
The names Nitty, you know I'm comin off like a gangsta
Disrespectin the mob I gotta bang ya
An everyday, cituation when I was caught by
Fuck a car, I do a muthafuckin walk by
When the G to the A-M-E
Leavin whole fuckin familys greivin
Cause if I miss some I gotta burn ya
Then I'm aressted (For what?) attempt murda
Never out done only out doin
Fuckin them bitches and then I leave 'em boo-hooin
Why?, cause they addicted, to what the dick did
The pleasure and pain the wing ding inflicted
Given niggas two to the head
Boy you can't mess wit a mad and hard head
Fool, I'm a straight low neva broke
Cause today I be a balla, shot shot caller 
I don't give a fuck about one
Them hoes ain't even got love and they boo-hooin
Now when I take it pass rap
While I'm still gang bangin bitch nigga catch a cap
Not easy but my nine easy to kill wit
Especially if you poppin bullshit
The N only I to the T
Especially my dogs on the muthafuckin Grand Finale

[Toxic]
Yeah that shit was bangin
Last but not least Twista up in hea
The orignator of the style all why'all niggas been biten
And to show you how its done
GUNNIN!

[Twista]
Swingin, singin my raw was through rap 
To the rhythm see-cock back T-O is in the back 
So if it makes you giggle I figure you thinks its petty
But to me its kinda Tilly 
(Tell 'em what) I'm makin fetty
Trippin off the man tho we buzzin while I'm thuggin
Get drunk and discustin the way I be bustin pistols and hustlin
don't take second for me to pop off my nine 
Cause I'm the tiggy-tiggy Twista nigga what have been on out of the pick
But I was harder T-W-I-S-T-A to the formula
Its cold cause we been smokin on dro
So nigga when you take a listen
You wonder who I'm dissin
D-O-N-T L-E-A-V-E without permission
The ""Baller-T"" aka ""The Swisher Roller"" 
""The Bigger Gun Holder"" so I be damned when a nigga role up 
Ever compete wit Mobster Elites
Much Less beef
Its like you comin on my tip wit no heat
Never smile when the Twistas in the club
Cause I got a mask and gloves 
And I might be bustin out slugs
I'm comin raw cause I'm smokin on kali
Gang bangin wit Mobsta Elites on the muthafuckin Grand Finale

No mothafuckin mercy for tha new millennium
It's Victory or Death
I'm tha Twista in this bitch
Mothafuckaz talkin 'bout styles and shit
And who bit what and who made what
Nigga fuck all y'all styles
I'm finna set this shit off like this here

Chitowns murderous mob gothic
Hard knock it give me tha mothafuckin ammunition I'll cock it
Respected like i'm one of Gods prophets
Gotta put it down for legit ballaz and you don't think
That i'll rock it annihilate that nigga
'cause like a lamb I was sacrificed for this verbal murder religion
Imprisioned by my hunger to succeed
By the heart I be driven
No shakin, no shiverin, get your shit to bleed
Reciting street literature, shall i spit tha creed
Now who them mothafuckaz talkin 'bout bitin
Go get me the pump-out of my trunk-I'm finna buss
y'all better run punk
Fuck where you got your style from I be the one
Rippin the track and I'm murderin
I'm in the middle of killin 'em off when the guns dump
With a young pump two to the brain don't even harm me
You fuckin every party, you won't even startle
You' the harder crew of lyrical giants
Turnin mothafuckaz like you to microscopic particles
To hype, to stop it the modules on cruise control
Ride out on these niggas-bitches-ho's
Ain't takin no titles I instantly bruise your soul
Talkin that shit to me- trigger vicious flows
Get to rippin my clothes and start snappin like I'm
Sniffin shit up the nose, and catchin convulsions
Till i'm trembling no surrendering start shootin and
Knockin mothafuckaz out like Benalyn
Reminiscin' on that adrenaline
Oh, now you rememberin
Overdose 'em on poisonous poetry from the west to the wild y'all
Gangbagin like Gotti, rockin tha party
Straight up shockin your body doin it Kami Kaze style y'all

Hook 1:
Cause it's Victory or Death nigga, better stay out the way
When my adrenaline pumpin or you can get a..(click-clock-blast)
Die mothafucka die!
Ain't no makin me bleed cause i've got family to feed
It's (repeat)

Hook 2:
I would rather die before i can't prosper I'm a mobsta
Won't stop ballin, because it's meant to be,
It's Victory or Death I gotta hustle till i'm gone
(repeat)

To all the folks and the lords.
The bloods and the crips and every ward lets roll
You gotta go- for what you know
If it's retaliation get low
When you get to the calico let it flow
Make these niggaz know in the door
Make a mothafucka bleed for what you need
'cause the familys gotta eat in the last days it's hatred and greed
Luv to the Gov's, B.M.'s, Field marshals, elites and the chief
Soldiers we better take heed and realize
Signs of the times, stand by yo 9,
Watch out for tha haters and write yo' rhymes
But the industry is set up to fuck you so you better be on the grind
Don't be one of the blind gotta stay alert
And put in work 'cause time is almost up
Twistas, Hurricanes, and Volcanoes erupt
So we can't stop the struggle,
I'm killin my enemy, breakin 'em off and not givin a fuck.
And I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
When i go to the sky
Thank you from savin me form a torturous life of hell,
But hile I'm here I'm straight legit ballin until I die
Lets better these years, feel the blood sweat and the tears
Organize, I'll sit back and smoke a Philly witcha
Never scared of my peers, I only got federal fears
And I'm known to put it down for my city nigga
And when we get full of this indo
Hydroponics and Chronic lock up ya doors and tha window
Better go and call up your kinfolks
Cause the riders that's down with this mob
Will murder when the wind blow
Don't know what you info
We bring terror in this Apocalyptic era of Armageddon we headin in
And the only way we can survive is if we come hard
And strive to be gods instead of men!

All you care about is cash, so my feelings they assed out
And it's so sad how I do for you
Be the woman come through for you

When you do wrong, police come through for you
I'll even bend the truth for you
But the fact of the matter is
Nigga you gon' love, who you gon' love?

You gon' trust, who you gon' trust?
You gon' fuck, who you gon' fuck?
But you won't trust me, no way no how
Ya gotta give ya whole life fo a nigga nowadays

Can't leave your house, can't even speak your mouth
Can't even beat him down
Motherfuckers is so crazy, deranged
Let 'em into your brain, brings misery and pain

'Cause they call us lame, bitches and heffers and sluts
Think your nut is gonna heal my bruises and batters and cuts
Bitches, y'all better get tough and at the same time
Y'all better lock the game and re-rock the game

Get a glock ready, sit back cock and aim
And try to stop the pain 'cause you got a lot to gain
Instead of sitting home waiting on niggas to call
Putting 911 in their beepers and all
We don't deserve this at all y'all

Better watch yo back there, boy
Get on yo square or my gun'll beat your chain
Got the nigga figured out
Showing you off, tell him shit ain't the same

Go ahead and kick him out, cut him up
Catch him sleeping fuck him up
Only he must not know your name
Pimping is a deadly game

Watch yo back there, boy
Get on yo square or my gun'll beat your chain
Got the nigga figured out
Showing you off, tell him shit ain't the same

Go ahead and kick him out, cut him up
Catch him sleeping fuck him up
Only he must not know your name
Pimping is a deadly game

Nigga, how you tame a bitch
Talking 'bout your game legit when you ain't the shit?
Then get wit a chick don't maintain a bitch, you restrain a bitch
Insecure niggas they blame a bitch then reign a bitch

Get a ring try to rename a bitch get an attitude
Play games with the dick and try to tame a bitch
Y'all niggas better critically acclaim a bitch
You call we come take it like a champ drink all your cum

Do a lot of shit I've never done, so I keep my cool
'Cause I ain't the one to start acting up
'Cause he keep a bitch from backing up
I wanna pack my stuff but mama said I can't come back to her

Oh Lord, so I had keep asking ya
For help outta situations killing up my whole life
I'm in love with a thug and he ain't treating my soul right
And I know I don't see him, don't need him
Shit fuck him and feed him
Fish stuck him and leave him quick shit

Better watch yo back there, boy
Get on yo square or my gun'll beat your chain
Got the nigga figured out
Showing you off, tell him shit ain't the same

Go ahead and kick him out, cut him up
Catch him sleeping fuck him up
Only he must not know your name
Pimping is a deadly game

Watch yo back there, boy
Get on yo square or my gun'll beat your chain
Got the nigga figured out
Showing you off, tell him shit ain't the same

Go ahead and kick him out cut him up
Catch him sleeping fuck him up
Only he must not know your name
Pimping is a deadly game

If you're a nigga with no love and don't want no bitch
Don't see no bitch, don't need no bitch
Then don't tease no bitch, shit
'Cause we don't need to be

Fucked up mentally like a dumb hoe
Breaking out all your windows
Tell the po-po's 'bout your dope holes, oh no
I can get my own shit my own nigga my own dick

I don't need a nigga thinking that he own a bitch
'Cause he bought me shit
7 whole days ain't call a bitch shit
Nigga shoulda stayed right where he was at

'Cause the nigga laid right where he was at
The nigga shoulda died right where he was at
Better watch yo back

Better watch yo back there, boy
Get on yo square or my gun'll beat your chain
Got the nigga figured out
Showing you off, tell him shit ain't the same

Go ahead and kick him out, cut him up
Catch him sleeping fuck him up
Only he must not know your name
Pimping is a deadly game

Watch yo back there, boy
Get on yo square or my gun'll beat your chain
Got the nigga figured out

'Cause I be squeezin' ass 

And will make a full glass disappear like a genie 
Move to the LOX and Beanie, 
While them hoes backin' that thang up on my weenie 
It's like no nigga in the world could see me 

When I Ruff Ryde with Drag-On 
Rollin' up big babies in a Mercedes, 
If you want herb we got bombs 

[Chorus: x2] 
Gotta kick that shit for the fine bitches and all my nugz 
For the ones who smoke pot, do stick ups, and ball in our hood 
What do a nigga say when he say Drag-On and Twista (Wanna kill me) 
Gangsta (Let's ride), hustla (Feel me)

By know everybody should know, that the kid spit tight, 
And this kid spit fire light 
And the bitch I don' fucked like last night, 
I don't give a fuck 'bout a 2 and a half mic 

'Cause the only muthafuckin' magazine that I read, 
Is when I buy my gun from it 
How many bullets you could digest in that one stomach, 
I suggest y'all run from it 

And the click-click from the calico, I gotta go, 
Make it pimp with a lot of hoes 
I'm the same muthafucka that's countin' that dough, 
Cookin' that coke to a pot of gold 

'Cause my rainbow, is every color top that crackhead cop, 
I don't care I gotta cap me a cop 
As long as I got enough money to cop me a drop, pop enough glocks 
Drag open up boots by watchin' co-op's in convo at condos 

Keep the heat up in jeeps, in case y'all creep up on me 
I run up on y'all in a cab with a meter on me 
And the only on leavin' is me 
And the only one bleedin' is you, tryin' to breeze with me 

All the Roc is E-N-why-see-E, in the NYC with the white T 
All I really do is argue,

Catch me, smokin' potent, bet it leave y'all, niggaz soakin',

Whether murder or bouncy beat, my flow be philosophical 
Smokin' on tropical, achievin' all missions impossible

Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab

Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her

with the stanky inside you - listen to while a freak lickin you
Go on a bogus mission to, somethin you crip-walk in the kitchen to
Somethin you bump on the porch or the park
Or pump it while you displayin yo' heart when you flex on a mark
You can play it to clear your head from drama with the feds
and all the homies like down for when they in the dark
Used to rock up at the block club, players wasn't ridin slick

Getting down and dirty, try to come at the mob and get your body bloody

Havn't you heard off these muderous cats, ballin' for scratch
Niggas shootin' nervous with gats, so hot we circle this drought
I drops them hollows, shots to swallow, my motto be ""fuck tomorrow""
Sorrows improbable
In Chicago motherfucker, bones get fractured, crumble like crackers
Rush the stage, allow the crowd to witness your massacre
You ain't bone, you're marrow, the lead travels from barrels
Bloody apperal, unravvle, chances is narrow
Thugs get judged when I drop slugs like gavels
Embarrassed and baffled
Got people and cattle getting slaughtered in battles
In gang land, we bang and ride, vibed gettin' high
Ain't no explaining, represcussions if you don't comply
Get ready motherfucker, my city's full of brothers who struggle
Breed's, T's, I's, you's, see's, Four Corner Hustlers
Black souls, magic kings and if gats could sing
My lyrics squeeze desert ease will rock you to sleep

Feel the heat from our gunfire, can you see us coming
Making niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning
Don't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass
Come up out the trunk so fast
why'all will get murdered when the pump go blast
Set this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome, 
smokin' blow in the zone
Kicking up more shit than a broken bone
Don't fuck with a legit baller, steady stackin' water
When why'all come up shorter
Try to come at the mob and get your body slaughtered

I got love for all niggas yelling out ""fuck the police""
I'm a Jeffery Manor Gangsta wit' the mobsta elites
Legit Ballers the family 'til the day that I die
They let the south and the westside hook up in the city of Chi'
Lettin' off rounds, fifty rounds, 'bout to shut you bitches down
From the Manor in that K-Town, I say it's too late now
For you niggas that hate now, better stay out my way now
Before you end up facedown
You motherfuckers don't know a thang about me
I roll wit' G's from Cabrini down to the Ida be	's
Lakeside, 9-Tre, the Long City
Wild Hundreds got love for that nigga Nitty
Give me room when my adrenaline rushing
Cause if I go in that trunk, you know I'm 'bout to start dumping
You hear the cries as the bullets fly by
And in the end that motherfucker died

Feel the heat from our gunfire, can you see us coming
Making niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning
Don't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass
Come up out the trunk so fast
why'all will get murdered when the pump go blast
Set this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome, 
smokin' blow in the zone
Kicking up more shit than a broken bone
Don't fuck with a legit baller, steady stackin' money
Gettin' down and dirty, try to come at the mob and get your body bloody

Hungry, I was lookin' for the fetti', ready
With the mental that was heavy, now her niggas ain't ready
Fuck the Navigator, we was filling holes in that 87' Chevy
Sitting on thirty-thirties
Selling leaf and syrup on the corner trying to stir this
Had a strap with the handle that was pearly
Up early, (?)
Know the game don't scare me, competition better flury or get buried
Either scuffle or scurry, brother hunt the word down
If you want a piece better hurry
Got off our knees and putting arrows on our tip
But there's really no need for you to say we ain't shit
Got up the cheese by telling motherfuckers freeze, and run in their cribs
Now we like to ball legit
Got to get up off the gold and the dick
Roll with a clique of hustlers that's strugglin'
Pistol bustin' and mean muggin'
Get up out the way my armored heavy family huntin'
Cause ain't nothin' gonna stop us from rollin'
Rap flow and the strap holdin', tired of feeling like I'm closed in
In the back, roll in on my ass when we got going
Out the back door like smoking, 
and tripping on the brink of success or failure
Momma, I can't call when I'm caught in the thin line
And it's kinda hard to tell ya'
But on the blood of my city, I'm a' keep crawling up the barbed wire
Hold your guns higher, cause ain't none higher

Feel the heat from our gunfire, can you see us coming
Making niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning
Don't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass
Come up out the trunk so fast
why'all will get murdered when the pump go blast
Set this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome, 
smokin' blow in the zone
Kicking up more shit than a broken bone
Don't fuck with a legit baller, steady stacking bread 
And be ready for the armageddon
Try to come at the mob and get your body deadened

Here's the tale of a young black male
Raised in these city streets
Out here hustling to make ends meet
In a world that's so corrupt
That's ran by greed
Money and the power
For me I'm a survivor
I do what I have to and only God can judge me for that
So before you cash your stones down on me
I want you to take a look at yourself in the mirror
And ask somebody to pray for you
Cause that's all I'm asking is to pray for me, understand

I was born around gangstas, hustlers, and killers
Drug dealers with math figures making hella scrilla
In the city of Chi the home of the G's
If ya don't work ya don't eat that's been the code of the streets
As for me I was brought up at an early age
Learned how to cook cane started to gang bang
And its a damn shame I chose game
But see I'ma knuckle headed nigga with no one to blame
And I'ma gonna keep on tipping under the street lights
And be wondering which nigga wanna take my life
Until then I'm staying two feet in front of you haters

[chorus]
I'm living the street life
And I just can't get away
I don't know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
So everynight I pray
Oh I pray
I'm living the street life
And I just can't get away
I don't know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
So everynight I pray

well I'm surrounded by rats, roaches, and dope fiends
My whole world is being weighed up on a triple beam
Man I don't know what's in store for me god
Will I reach 21
Why is life so damn hard
See that's the question that's asked
And is there a heaven or hell can the young black live
Or will he be chained in the cell
I don't know as for me I only trusted a few
I had to hustle to survive now what else could I do
They say there's chances for everybody that's bullshit
That little girl had no chance when that bullet hit
I mean it blew to the sky
And all you heard was a cry
Oh lord don't let my baby die

[chorus]

Til the day that I die I'll stay true to my neighborhood
Fuck with my neighborhood nigga I wish you would
Ain't shit changed like oh once said
And oh no fool my nigga Fred ain't dead
Neither is Pook or Kansas City
True og's still here with me
My homie boo, boo what up
And you know I can't forget about my nigga nigga Novesnake
Nightime boats and herbie
Shine and Cherelle would ya pray for me
I rock genue death so dam sensless
Big houses what the fucking radio been missing
And there's one more nigga that be true to my heart
Mr. Motion you the reason while I'm breaking em off
So our
I peed em to dead
Whole reason was love
To that nigga twist for believing in me
I got a shorty to feed
My priority is to make sure this shit don't have to struggle like me
And if I could ask for one more wish
I tell em I wanna hug ya 'cause I'm missing ya since

[chorus]

so I'm asking to pray for me
Mamma pray for me
Daddy pray for me
Baby pray for me
Please pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me

Lives depreciated over drinks

And all his hope turned to ""I guess should I risk it?""

Why y'all got paper, I got paper so let's find some ass to jug
This struggle for power keeps us all up to no good
With constant heat, we cruise the streets like cops on D's

For this grid-ound, that's why we stand firm with these rounds

Would have our new Starter jackets filled with bullet holes

And who would have ever thought that when we would rock this shit
That we would end up gettin' our whole block lit
By-standers got hit up
And who would have ever thought that women would be up on silent nights
Lightin' pilot lights

Finger lickin' never get sick and tired, just take a look in her eyes
And you can tell she's a figure five, so we love that c-c-c-c

On the two-way, poppin' and droppin' the conversation
And I'm steady staggerin'
Look at the Remy that I had last week off Madison
Tryna walk a straight line
But I can't find a pattern in her
I looked at the door
Put my drink on the floor
Cocked my nine when I opened it slow
Half-breed Chinese, sittin' a Lac
And about a hash green, plus
The audacity of the star
Strippin' and maneuver her ass like next to me
Actually, this S-E-X is testin' me
A-double-P, E-A-L

Why you all in my business
Why you really really want to know the 4-1-1
Is it cause that my game's tight
I can scoop a bitch and fuck her on the same night

It was a, Saturday evening bout seven at night
White T, white thongs pockets feeling alright
I got a, call from one of my caramel chicks
She said I mean be careful I think they talking on some hate shit
Despite the talk of the town, I'ma be there
For 45 minutes when you hear the horn come down
And when she climbed in, I received a kiss and a hug
In a minute take off your shoes on a white persian rug
Wave your number rolling going to get bent
Why they sure call thugs mugging I see him right through the tent
He had the nerve enough to tap on my glass
But he ain't had enough light to peek in but I almost blast his ass
Is it cause that I'm known to bust
So quick to bump a bad bitch that y'all known to trust
So when you see me on them thangs in the Cadillac truck
Man don't even know me when you see your bitch in the back or front

Sixteen block my wall you want to block my magic
Now you wondering no what Nitty be doing
While these bitches trying to find out who am I screwing
And I'm so, sick and tired of the motherfucking gossip
And I'm, sick and tired of the motherfucking coppers
They actually post up at the end of my block
Take a hoe from her spot just for trying to plot

And I'm like, damn friendly why you all on me
Man I'm out here slanging records shit I stopped selling weed
Tell me, are you mad cause you see what I drive
Or are you checking out these broads with the big ass thighs
It be my main bitch, getting on my last nerves
closest now to the edge from getting kicked to the curb
She got a homegirl, all up in her hair
Maybe they just meant my hair's longer than her's

And I'm, sick of them haters that be all in my shit
Everytime I turn around somebody always be talking bout Twist
Want to know who got a baby by me, what does he drive, where my tip
Be all in my bidness because they heard that I've been bumping they chick
I ain't no lie, if I scoop your bitch up
I will, If I get scratch from her
Fold it up, if I tell her bend over
She won't get up, if I give up the bunch
What you need to know fo', you the player po-po
Steady beeking and poking paranoia smoking on too much doe-doe
Creeping all in my bid' no since I first splurged on a Rego
I got birds when I see you, I'm starting to think you work for them people
Hurt 'em when I tell 'em, I think you better ease up, cause everybody
Know you no G when it come to the money put some g's up
Until you hip lock and freeze up, you might as well
Turn around and go like the other way when I see you

Now what's on the wall? Go ahead and treat yo'self
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off
to the lot lay the paper down and cop that Jag

Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan oh man with the gun in hand
I leave your blood squirting
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fucking, a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordan's and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy speakeasy, slight with the fight words
I'll put somethin' hot through your motherfuckin' iceberg
Got a project chica, named Rica

Small, pinkies like that

What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall
Have to make a collect call, but your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox thinkin' a check but the mail's run short
No more MD, DD, LD
That means movie date, dinner date, lunch date, help me please

My sheets is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimpously serve the song
Act a damn donkey
Like the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the Indians home
Drop top rag-o with the weed gone
Chillin', bags in the trunk full of FEO Schwartz for the chill'uns
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kiddin'
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
Or are you actin' mad 'cause the money done
Slowed, down, just a little bit
Dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin' like a pitfall bull-pit
Dead game is the pul-pit
Leave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin'
A miracle happenin

Verse One:

I need...mo money mo money mo, suck 'em fast suck 'em slow
Even though I gotta pay my bills I'm still on the streets
tryin' to keep it real
Pass that shit let me take a hit, hopin' this money ain't

Give 'em 211 get 'em in line and let 'em 20 so(?)
Cut that money let's be up, which you want to ride, the

Back up, get on the one way 'cause more Sundays hotter than Monday
Often gettin' trailed by cops, gotta get away by hittin them blocks
Got my glock, never stick middle finger up my ass, known to blast
Keep me down, where I'm from I'm known to clown
Get a dub off a nine, go get a sack, I'm back, pro black
achiever, leave her, thug and ashtray
More to the fact I'm back to the scene, let in the wonder
let all the smoke out
And if Luke coulda broke out
Gotta make more stacks of these, so I Z's for bud in
the breeze, ain't spittin' cheese
What a freak want to trip off, sip off the lame with the
game, get sick of the man who point the blame
Still a P-O, P-I,M-P, we be P-A,P-E-R...chase

Chorus:

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase

Verse 2:

You see my nice Mom smokin', money slopin' 'tween my fo
with open arms when my option is to my mission it's a paperchase
So when you face to face: mom and dollar, keep to the
streets, hit the joints like hollow
Boy better figure if you owe them, better low then
With po-po corruption on the phone double 1-9-1-87, with
a couple of zeros
I'm sittin' there makin' dollars
Verse 2 G, nigga didn't want to holler
Back to the streets again, but a nigga want to go there
The game treatment so fair
Crucial, in neutral, all eyes on me I'm brutal, choppin'
up that paper like you know
Gotta click since I call them blue notes
Shippin' that paper from Earth to Pluto
Get that new song
Nineteen ninety-six we be paperchasin'!

Chorus:

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase

Verse 3:

I'm...checkin' paper like a hunter, Belo
Had dreams about runnin' four to the floor
O.G.s in my house me in the clause
Nigga want cheese, nigga want more
Bumpin' all the good shit 'cause all the good shit makes
you forget about the bad bit
Now you make a nigga match wits
Never want what I never had, 'cause I never had shit
The basketball, the all, the ounce, bounce, A to the motherfucking K
I smoke the bead but they keep on calling me and they
want my apology
And they fall, see it's unexplainable how money's unattainable
if you play in this game
So nigga never call me names when I aim the gun but holler:
A to the motherfucking K with a motherfucking spray-ay-ay
A to the motherfucking K with a spray-ay-ay
It's 95 keep your ass out the line-up
Why don't you keep the double-time up, pimp keep them lines up
Help 'em talk to shiner, give me the best wish
The paperchase be for me 'cause you got blasted with
an eighth of a key
Niggas be be-comin' up but come or stay away
And I'll let you take your fate with three...
Bullets to the chest, put your body rest
If you know P-gang going for the G-Style
Never relax, realize don't give a one-too-many free packs
Come check your ho to see I'm a G
I-get in a sick dream
Paid to pick teams in a room full of dick fiends
Much love to thugs who sacrifice their life to get greens
for the troop of 15, what the shit mean?
It's you bitch, you better save your breath, 'cause you
can't count how many days is left
Let the weed smoke, blaze, but check, until I'm ready to wreck
Then a motherfucker gonna be paid to death
Because I'm goin' on a paperchase

Chorus:

Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase
Paperchase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paperchase",Paper Chase,2003

Sipping Seagram, chewing on a wheat stem
Touching on my four fin
Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with three, one, two, seven, six, two, ten
Three line connection, as the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the bead, we got the drinks you need
And plus we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
'Cause I forgot where I met the hoe
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes want to snap
I straight up check the hoe, really doe, to the crib

Do you want to ride?

Chop it up, with Do or Die

Do you want to ride?

Three miles per hour, like we running up on some rivals
Never to deny though, these bitches look fly 'Lo
Introduce myself, a to the motherfucking K finna recognize
Then I loose myself juice myself
As you take one pull, uh, pass it to the left and em
Self-centered niggaz'll take two pulls
'Cause they thinking about sampling em

We're learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well

Mm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the see-A
D-I, Double-L, with ah A-see, A-see hoes
They peep those, P-I, M-P, and they think that automatically
'Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be, full of that
M-O, N-E, but why?
'Cause nigga be sporting nice cars and fancy clothes
Fresh jewels Girbaud flexing one five oh (chop chop)
Chop up that paper hoe, chop up that paper hoe
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fucking with a pimp doe
Get involved in the backseat

Well a motherfucker might be broke and shit
And then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spitting mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the Oprah lips and the provoking hips
And never gotta tell her many lies
I been looking in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
'Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo when out of me gotta be
Right, that'd be the flatter me right
But if the head the bonk come on suck a nigga dick
Members of my click, want to see what that'd be like
I know you want to try it out, to the rhythm of a high hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a hold of them my fellas on the train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you bow down?
Where your ride at? On the passenger side of your hoes
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another bead, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbing me with lotion
She come like an ocean coasting have a cigarette thinking
Me and Do or Die dig drinking love potion
The word that was never said
Twisted be giving women dick in the bed
Until they sick in the head, and if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the Feds or spitting game
But it's chicken and bread
Kicking them legs in the air like a player do
Then be little in a day or two
After words I'm slay a crew, now that's some pimp type shit
That be	Low and AK'll do, wearing gray and blue
If a hoe want to holler then you a player if you hit them ends
And get the dividends but you a pimp if you can get
The same hoe to want to freak your friends

Take a journey to the realm of the truth when I bust this
It's the Duke and the Duchess
Leavin haters 'buked and on crutches

It's a new collaboration of Thug Luv
between the Thug Queen and the Thug Lord
More power than a drug lord
Meant to be because we love each other the way we love war
Gotta rider bet hug yours, cause I'm full of ambition
and ammunition and a 50 like I smoked a sticky stack of hash
Ain't no missin on no critical condition
Murderin is the mission and we can bust a itchy atcha ass
Feel the flow when I drop it
Don't when to stop it, I'm goin pockets and layin bodies down
Feel adrenaline from me and Kim and them
We got it sewed from Brooklyn to Chi-Town
See the artillery, we don't fuck around with silly games, plenty
thangs
Nigga plus I got an illy aim, stick 'em up, steal his chain
Then I spill his brain, then I feel his pain

And I'm backed up by the Queen, we gon' take over the world

Bout to have it locked, eight straight summers
Bank account hold eight straight numbers

Can't fuck with us, hands down we win best murder rap of the

Pounds to the misters, hugs for the miss
Bombs in the mail, sealed with a kiss

All my niggaz wave that bling on the wrist

Well, when I heard a knock at the door
Must of been the girl that I met on the lo
She real thick, nice shape 5-4
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click, in the Expo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Damn natural, never walk from the store
Gimmie a minute, and get down with a pro
P. I. M. P. P. O. get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex, we can sport mine called S.E.X
Platinum link, all in effect
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax
P.L.A.Y.E.R., giving her eyes
Then we head to the bar
Never give her money, 'cause she know she a star
Did you want to ride in my car?

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)

23's like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro' girl, if you want to blaze
You can let your hair down, while the AC blow
Before you get in, I just need to know

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
I'll keep it on the low
Do you? Do you?

In the mood, like yes why'all
Rather be, let it test why'all
Light the be	 if it's special
Can I undress to relax why'all
Well, stretch out like a Lex ball
If it's that raw, to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it, if it's that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I can't believe how they sent them off
Took the number then I'm in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling, shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it, but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces, checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh, he flossing
Baby girl, I don't do this often
In the five double 0 for sho'
We still ride the Cadillac, slam the doors
Suppose I kick back, keep the flows
Dressed to impress, then flex the ho
Check the dough

Do you? (Do you? Do you Do you?)
I'll keep it on the lo
Do you? Do you?
Do you?

An it really don't matter, where we go
Let's sip this Henny, pop this Mo
Before I strip you, I just need to know
Can I do you?

Now I was kicking, when I met you in the club
Had me feeling on your booty, and the brother was a fiftyball
For you, I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was start wondering when if I'm a get the draws
Let me know if I'm in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin through stunting why are you running
Cause I'm coming with some pimp-type game
Iced out charm, chromed out truck
Coming through balling like I don't really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty, an purple, with the windows up
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me, backing me
To a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb??????
Hold it in, then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out
Don't ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk
Do you like the way I ride
Do you like the way I pimp spree's
You can let me down easy
Cause' still ill be the player Twista slash be a P.I.M.P

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Badunkadunk, All in your face when you're at the club,
Badunkadunk, Slide down the poll for the 30 Dub,
Badunkadunk, Look at your ass girl, it's so much fun,
Badunkadunk, I tell the DJ, I need a hundred ones,
Badunkadunk, What? Badunkadunk, rock yo!
Badunkadunk, All That, Badunkadunk bounce yo!
Badunkadunk, Big Phat, Badunkadunk I love yo!
Badunkadunk, Tell the DJ, I mean I'm number one...

[Twista]
Oooooh! Shit, damn shawty, look at the motherfuckin' fatty,
Come to daddy, tell me what I gotta do to get you lickin' in my custom Caddy,
Never want to let you get up out the ride,
When I first took a look my mouth was wide,
Lick a titty with them little bitty shorts you got on,
With the thigh's hangin' out tha' side,
When you work it you gone hurt these other bitches,
Hurtin' em' mean with the way you struttin',
Even though you only walkin',
You still lookin' like you shouldn't do that shit in public,
I can tell from right now what I see you workin' with,
You ain't even gotta ask for the blunt,
Booty so phat, gaps so nice, you can see tha' ass from the front,
You fittina hurt 'em how you twurk that thang,
You want me to hear when you pop it baby,
Fell in love when you came up in club, with a whole bottle of Mo',
Don't pop it baby!,
I know you got up on some rump shaker contest,
Let us see what you can do,
Sip a little somethin' while you bounce that ass,
Girl you gotta badunkadunk,

[Chorus]
[Twista]
Now put that ass in Burberry for tha' Bently,
Now go on and put on a bikini for the Lamborghini,
Now let me see you in a car for the big grown,
Love the way you shake it for the dollar,
Holla at me when you see me,
Now I don't want to see nobody full of rigimortis,
Go head and jiggle for tha' more more money that's in his hands,
Go head and hit tha' shades with ya thick ass,
Now come over here by the table and give me a lap dance,
Bend it over come and get this dust,
Gota a playa thinkin that be bout to cut,
Gots to hit that from the back,
Shorty gotta' lil' junk in her trunk,
Look at how she make one butt-cheek freeze,
Look at how she make the other cheek move fast,
Look at how she switch, make the other cheek move,
Then move both sides then clap that ass,
Remember them times... When you met two shorty's
And you really want the cutie,
But you let her slide... ''cause the other gotta really big ol' donkey booty,
Now shorty think she fine, only if she really knew the truth,
I ain't gone lie, girl twurk them thigh's,
I'm in love with your big badunkadunk,

[Chorus]
[Twista]
Can you make it go wobbley-wobbley, come on and follow me,
Take you on a ride on the oddesy and umm...
If you let it jiggley-jiggley, make it go wiggley,
Baby you can never get rid of me and umm...
Twurk something... Oooh yeah...
Yeah that booty softer then a teddy bear,
So phat I can barely stare, with a darier, that's scary there,
Come and drop for a nigga named Twista,
Come and pop for me like a pistol,
Got badunkadunk's from a MOB and got badunkadunk's for Jazze Phizzle,
Girl you deserve respect, you look so good girl I commned you,
The hottest thang on the menu,
When I'm off up in the strip club, I like to get you,
Twurk that thang, bounce that ass,
Work it all the way down to the floor,
Climb to the top, shake it up-side down,
Side of the motherfuckin' floor,
Work that crown, give a lap dance,
Shake it like it's for lady-groups,
Take all the ballers to the V.I.P,
Girl gon' work yo badunkadunk,

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

It definitely will
You know what I told her

I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'ma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbing me, calling me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played 'ready for the world', she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'ma lay this Vandross, you gon take yo pants off
I'ma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon get right

[Chorus]

Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby, can you please - do it faster, do it 
Faster
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!

When I catch you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm laying back smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you when I'm messing wit Kan man and Twist in the Chi
And I be sipping hennessey, play some R&B
While I smoke a b - you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light,  move it to some Isaac
His rims still moving so I bump a lil Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b - dipping through the streets
Bumping r&b, and I got the leaf, on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment controlling me
I love the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow 
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's r&b, come to the club wit me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feeling me
And still will be in love wit me

[Verse 1: Sparks]
What mean the world to you
Shit about 4, 5, 6 bricks
I roll em', cut off, spit em' the livin' room on the glass mirror
want to see if that coke steady, OK
See if folk gonna test a nigga and bring the tools
Like the flutes and the two
See if that shit turn green or blue (green or blue)
Yo look here homie, this here pure coke with me
Get off me and go take the things
Guarantee get your fuckin' face freeze (your face freeze)
And so, then let me know, ya I know
You want to fuck wit me, you want to cop yo work for me
I know there's bucks involved, you don't touch the squad OK
You can bring just some your roadies
Leave two outside, bring two inside, just don't bring that bullshit
'cause we all gon time and get caught for this shit
I know your number, 'cause I once got caught for shit
In court for shit, like look Ian, I don't feel what I done was a crime
When I crossed your invisible line (when I crossed your invisible line)
When I crossed your border, with a thousand quarters
Ya'll niggaz do when they broke gotta test the waters (gotta test the waters)
You know you want to fuck wit me

[Chorus: Sparks]
That be	, that L, O, that W that BLOW
This coke here is purified, youngblood, want to cop yo work from me
That be	, that L, O, that W that BLOW
This coke here is purified, youngblood, lemme know you want to cop for me

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
We talkin' bout that BLOW
That B.L.O.W. sniff it
Tryin' to tell you it's the shizzit
Guaranteed you get addicted
Lemme know, how you want it, pure white, or be pecific (specific)
I just came from the Pacific
My connect is jet-o-ffical
That's how we roll, keep it comin'
Long as Chris up in position, Imma keep this shit consistent
Never bitch up at the district
Let em know, Young Gunna is just a new nigga
Bout to blow straight to the tizzle
Never write straight, off the tizzle
With the flow, I get it from my big homie Sigel
But I got my own Eagles, if it's guaranteed to meet you
We can ???, but back to that B.L.O
Got some shit that I can teach you
Know if I cook up niggaz treat you weird
Got some people, might be interested to speak to
If your strips slow, you get your men, I get my people
When we get dough, give them niggaz fore warnin'
Lock down all four corners, watch that shit flow

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Twista]
I'm a nigga that'll never go a broke
Two of tens always help a motherfucker get back up
I can hook you up with whatever you want
Till' the city doubles fifty bricks and brothas get smacked up
Couple of hustle up real ass niggaz on the block, the hoes, you need some hard
Twista be servin' with the nigga Spark, and the rocks, blows, weed, cars
See us transform, double cocaine to a cherry 04 Range
Load the ki's in the sprees, and I'm gettin' P's
And I'm makin' G's, so I want to go in your bank
'cause you feelin' the feelin' of makin' a killin'
Of steady comin' up, Imma cop myself a whole BLOW feel
BLOW so trill, you can tell it was the real deal
Even if I hit a high with a pill
Tell me how you feel
Baby you was feelin' kinda froze
When you took a squirt up in the nose
Steady servin' O's, 'cause the fiends gotta get it
Even though they know it make they body decompose
Reafer in my clothes, and you know we cookin' up or shakin' up
So somebody close the door, watchin' for the law and gotta stay up on my toes
Makin' stacks, motherfucker, tell me what you know about that

[Chorus]
[Verse 4: Oschino]
See the dope move, see the coke move
See that nigga push ki's like a pro tool
Fuck a 9 to 5, I got 95 drones all in the back of the ride
And they pure like a virgin, I'm servin'
And I ain't talkin' bout Serena or Venus
I'm talkin' bout that shit
that have you doin' 50 years in a box beatin' your penis
See the car vette, see the house vette, see the young boy diggin' ya style
And you say you love that shit
They think we Shallow Hal no it's just Oschino baby (yea baby)
I'm dippin' the man, I'm dippin' the can
I'm the reason you can dip that straw in the grams
And get high, but you wouldn't understand (It's all about that BLOW)
I'm your BLOW supplier, the hoes admire
My whole attire, my rims and tires, niggaz wearin' wires
(Actin' like they want to do a deal with O)
Trains, planes, automobiles
Won't get that work across the state
Run till' they always getting' rid of the weight
Sweatin' under pressure while you talkin' to jakes
Sweatin' in the kitchen, while cookin' the cakes
Sweatin' in the mix, puttin' doe in a safe
You can sweat me right in front of my face
And there's nuttin' you can do about it

Baby I know we said it's best we don't talk no more

I thought you were that ride or die
You will never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life 
I took in your kids did everything that you wanted me too
Heard about frontin' on radio and the fuse
Don't make me feel good to lie, even though you make me wanna cry
Hey, if you gonna tell anything, then you should have told everything
Instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say then don't say nothing

Yes, I'll accept it, what's up?

Sittin' in my cell, heard about the burst
Wouldn't be alive, if I didn't bust first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray

This is the hottest remix I ever did in my life
So so Def

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions (if you got something to confess too right now, step to the mic, Twista)

I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While having other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
'Cause I pulled one out my heart and these are my confessions

Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all, yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions 

Man, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin'
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret, you famous you can't go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there, it's hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her ""Man, don't say that""
Matter fact like Pat don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin' on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back

Way back, way back, way way back

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

And this by far is the hardest thing I think that I ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this","Confessions, Pt. 2 [Remix][*]",2004

I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth (uh, oh)
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill

And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While havin other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day

You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
'Cause I'm pouring out my heart and these are my confessions

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way {Way}
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta keep part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to keep part 2 of my confessions

Yeah Kanye To tha College Dropout
Damn, how does she bring it up how does she break it down
Man you at the clinic, dawg slow down that's yo child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin

And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous you can't go nowhere 'cause everytime you go there

There's hoes there so basiclly you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her ""man don't say that""
Matter fact like Pat don't say,matter fact dont say jack,
Everytime a nigga sittin on paystacks
Things come up from way way way back way back way back way way back

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way {Way}
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do

Ever since a young buck, I been on tha come up,
Known to dish tha raw, dish tha law if they come up,
And cheddar 'till tha sun up
If there's a ransom and tha law get involved, then we never get it summed up,
Never put ya gun up, if ya come round me,
I go to war wit' niggas 'round tha corner from 'round me,
You can front 'round me, but I read through that,
Wit' tha mili' and I ain't talkin' 'bout no Segal mac,
Niggas see shoot back, we can see to that,
Hit yo front letters see through back, bring yo peoples back,
And I used to grind out on my friends spot, 'till he's mom wanted my Tim-bots,
Now my paint got me discounts, or trans-quo all around tha world, like I was signed to
Pimp-dot,
And if it's ten targets and I got ten shots,
I'm tryin' to leave at least hit nine out of them ten shot

I got my mind on my money, money on mind,
But some say its a gift, I don't write but I rhyme,
I, complete songs with just one try,
Tell 'em it's no lie, I (beef?) all my life dogg, I never think, it's already there,
I find ways to say-it, so you motherfuckers hear-it,
And when you hear it you feel it, you know its real (so)
This is how I live it, how its pictured for real, (nigga)
I'm shittin' for real
Diamonds against wood, underground king for real,
Big crib when I lay, yeah I'm livin' for real,
Trust me tha guns come off tha shelf whenever shit'll get real,
Automatics and tha extended clips, that's what I'm hittin' wit',
Dummies in tha black rhinoes,

Mask up kidnap shit, that's how my niggas get,
Chi-town, NYC, that's how my niggas get

Yes, just picture me rollin',
Tha smith and wesson'll stay goin' put a hole in yo chest,
It's just, another hustle paper gettin' made and fold ya,
Mad, you street niggas finally made it,

Deliver pies like cake, they go straight through yo payment, (Yup)
Chump, you don't really want to war,
With tha State Prop clique, if ya clique shot us, (Why us)

Transporter turned rapper, get a can for to fill my life,
Still accomplished, want to fill they cups?
Tha rap version of Mandela call my bluff,
Well still tha street dwellers feel my pain (My pain)
I spit a verse and split a clip in tha rain,
A fool-proof when tha full force open you (What)

Twista will rock you, you don't want tha thug apostle to pop you,
Hostile when I drop you, turnin' everything colossal to fossiles,
I speak street gospel, all they life I spit words and paint portraits,
For real niggas that hold down they fortress and serve off of porches,
Hit 'em in tha body wit' tha powerful forces, that'll end all your data,
Make you clean up your house, bag up an ounce, hit tha dance floor and bounce,
We blessed wit' tha talent, fuck wit this clique, it ain't gon' be easy,

Watch me spit if for tha killers and hustler's, flippin' all tha pounds and bricks,

Twista,"This is for my ladies, 
Sexy like champagne Glass, 
You what I'm talking about, 
A reflection of a Pena Colada, 
Listen up

I know you heard the terms chicks are like cars, 
Well I treat bitches like drinks, 
When I step in the club and by out tha bar, 
So let me quench my thirst wit you and a friend 
Instead of the juice and gin, 
Why don't I pour out the drink and you hop in, 
Glass full of ass for a true mutha fucka, 
Wit that that turquoise Coogi on, 
You remind me of a blue motherfucker, 
Your friend was sexy when I seen her in Prada, 
But I think Gina was hotta, 
Cause her skin tone was like a pina colada, 
I saw two Japanese chicks that got bodies, 
So I ordered them a mi tia and hot saki, 
Then I got cocky, 
And asked them do they come to this club a lot, 
Well ya got a brotha hot, 
Hop in my bubble drop, 
Can I get a double shot? 
Or get wit these two mamacita one wit the karma of margarita, 
The other one like two shots of tequila, 
And they all fine I really don't know what to think, 
As I get bubble and choose and try to figure out, 

[Chorus]
What's my favorite drink, 
Girl can I sip on you, 
Sip on
Sip on 
Sip on 
Sip on 
What's my favorite drink, 

Know not to bring no Neapolitan ass, 
I like the one that makes your face drop like a Neapolitan masta, 
No telling what these thick bitches would do, 
Reminiscent of a big old picture of Bo, 
But hit cha like a slow screw, 
Dip in a strip a club in LA wit a bankroll, 
Where the weather ain't cold, 
So I can see some hoes slide down a poll, 
I met two dancers named Moet and crystal, 
I was checkin' they style, 
We had a session It was wet it was wild, 
Then I dug these two twins thick wit Hennessey one was Remy Red, 
Wit skinny legs, 
Both of them game to give me head, 
Wit a little bit absolute vodka fo they homie Tasha, 
Tell her to come closa, 
So y'all three can give me a Sammy Sosa, 
If I was mayor I would campaign ass, 
Politician wit women swimming around the champagne glass, 
Drunk so much I might earl in the sink, 
And if you ask me why, 
I couldn't figure out

[Chorus]

If you would suck my soul, 
I shall lick your funky emotions, 
Look at that big old donkey you toting, 
I wish I could pour some of you in a bishop cup, 
And have a toast wit King Boo, 
And celebrating the fact that you thick as fuck, 
I holla Church cause its pimps in tha party, 
Let me sip on ya body, 
Get a good buzz of ya like you lemon Bacardi, 
Or a long Island havin' sex on da beach, 
Or in tha Llac sunroof let back wit a tech on tha seat, 
Got a red bone I call her strawberry Daiquiri, 
Bring her back fo may, 
Carry packs fo may, 
Had her suck off my facultay, 
Got a little mamma name Mimi, 
Who remind me of martini and Asti spamanti, 
How she move to my CD, 
I got a chocolate chick who deep throat, 
She help me shake up dope, 
She the complexion of Crown Royal and Coke, 
And they making it hard for me to decipher and think, 
As I get bubbly and choose, 
And try to figure out

[Chorus]

Hennessey mixed wit some of that Alize, 
Gimme a shot of that remy, 
And a whole lot of tanqueray, 
Keep it comin' wit that cognac, 
Pop tha moet lets sip on that, 
Naw playa put ya money back, 
Cause these drinks on me, 
Give me a bottle of that belve, 
Long island ice tea, 
Hook me up a apple martini, 
All these drinks on me, 
I want to have a sex on the beach, 
How about a gin and juice for me, 
So put away ya money G, 
All these drinks on me,",Drinks,2004

[Twista]
On a rainy day die early morn', my lethal legacy was born
I see any rapper around, 'bout the fuckin mics I left torn
But they won't give me all my peeps, and there's only one shot to get G's
Get love for my MC's at home, but some of them still hate on me
Look how many years I done repped, hustled through the streets in the cold
It's fire but our first rap as ever, signed the contract a decade ago
Put Chi name on records in the East, put Chi name on records in the West
Put Chi name on records in the South, bitch how you gon' open your mouth?
To the motherfuckin industry, why you hate on me and my city?
Would it be an imbalance of power if y'all let Chi niggaz get cheese?
Or is it us holdin us back?  Think hard when you rollin your sack
Whatever the case my Chi nigga, if it's in my means I got yo' back
What the fuck's really goin on, does the magazine know we on?
Don't he already know we established myself as Twista Corleone?
Well I'm holdin my city down, ain't goin nowhere, here I stand
You know where I am if you hate me {""Come and get me!""}
If you want me {""Come and get me!""} Here I am

[Chorus]
""Here I am..""
""Oooh, yeah, here I am..""
""Oooh, yeah, here I am..""
""Oooh, yeah, here I am..""
""Come and get me!  Come and get me!""

[Twista]
What did I do to deserve, all of this madness around me
Found me in the studio buryin myself and was smokin herb
Tried to kick me to the curb
To the back to the ditch to the dump to the shack but I sprint in the front
in the 'Llac with a fifth and a blunt in the back with a bitch and a pump
And I'm ready to bust at you hoes, ready to dump lames in ditches
Steady makin fakers bleed, L.B. family handle business
Comin into Twista's realm, journey with me through the pain
The hurt just might make you envision drama that could turn you insane
How much of my chaos bring tears, how many threaten my career?
How many threatenin to murder me but bitch you know where I live
Who the fuck do you think I is?  y'all ain't comin at wit no shotties
Why you think you can hurt like these years, yo all of my peeps can you sawed
Think you finna bring out my fears?  Tell me why my success make you cry
And why my downfalls make you laugh, but I bet my hydro got you high
Never let hate back me down, stand forth like a man
If you want me {""Come and get me!""}
want to kill me? {""Come and get me!""} Here I am

[Chorus]

[Twista]
We got Geo like Neo, of course we as sourcy as Morpheus
or we as sick as some Marcus Aurelius alias atheist
Look it's niggaz who flow be the achiest, I'm just a alias
Now why hate me is maybe is cause I'm controllin this radius
or this world and this whole universe, don't believe let me spit you a verse
Just when you thought you was worse I come wit worse that'll make you disperse
My allies know I'm too cold, my enemies know I spit thangs
My Lords know I bust that thang, my gangstas know how we still reign
My mobsta family steady ride, L.B. family steady click
While us and other crews collide, choose your weapon take a pick
Load up, click-clack, it's on ? finna bust, get back, run home
Come at me jokers get whacked with a strap to the back of the dome
Industry niggaz get gone, heard y'all be stickin Big Worm
I show you some shit that'll blow you now slow you down like you siz-urp
The Chi-Town's sacrificial lamb, well here I stand
firm if you hate me {""Come and get me!""}
If you want me {""Come and get me!""} Here I am

Twista,"Yeah, you know it's about to go down right?
(Yeah!) Got to let them know who is this? (Ludacris!)
And who else nigga? (Twista, wo, ah!)
Uh, uh (check it out)

Sometimes I think that I got to see a little bit of brighter days
Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left or the right but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my ways
I still hear a fool and I track them, distract them, and whack them
Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak them, attack them, and sack them
Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm a hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night, so talk shit and I'm a lift them up off of they toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In a two-seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of dro
Smoking, choking, get them open, croaking
It's so potent - I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it or keep it hidden, good riddance I'm felling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)
You caused some vapors and I caught the throne, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, ""leave me alone!""

[Chorus]
Throw it up if you get high, get blow, get drunk
If you want what I'm on, come on and kick it
Let's ride, smoke dro, beat the trunk
All the bad ass bitches that want to party
Just shake it, great players get pumped
Me and my thugs, and hustlers in the party
Get money fuck hoes, get crunk

(Look out!) I put a little bit of hash on some motherfucking purple haze
I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi
Got me up and then ripping shit in a rage
In the netti cofetti with a belly, Gucci
Timberland stepping on the petal up in the Cadillac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
If they all get some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for my city, anybody that different with me
Got to get him for thinking it's a game
And whether you from my city or not, talk shit
I'ma kill him especially if he say my name
I've been up on him - I handle my business
And I'm a stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat piller
Murder haters that don't feel a
Niggaz claiming they want to bring it, but really don't be killers
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grow to a hellafied sight-scene
When the dough become no bigger, I'm going to drop that 2003 on 19""

[Chorus]

We balling out of control, I floss on, play on, pimp on
A speed demon, pedal to the metal when I'm in the zone
Hang on cause here I'm gone
In the motherfucking wind when I'm sippin on Henn'
I got paper, you owe something
And I done came a long way from letting me hold something, to roll something
Find a body, then fill him up with some adrenaline
And then kill him and send him to the cemetery
With a flow for the whole world like a poet,
Check icy cold, your Pop's so hungry, he mends a berry
Shit, and when it come to shipping good
Who that?, who that?, I got the sack open
And the herb got the flow so strong
Hot them on crack, the track is for back-to-back smoking
Never come up with it unwise, and he
Nigga you ain't untouchable when I spark the heat
Coming at you like sharks to meat
The blood is softly, I can tell when a mark is hard as we
Come fully loaded cause I'm hard to beat
Always screaming where a beat and the dro at?
You know we love that cut up
In the back of the club with purple in the back crying
Twis' and Ludacris get fucked up

Twista,"Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately.
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah,
Rest in peace to Left Eye,
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay,
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers,
And everybody lost period.
All we got is hope!

I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, and I
Wish my brother would of made bail,
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, and I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, and I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, and I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, and I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold them high, and I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, and I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, but uh
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate,
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.
Instead of thinking about who gonna die today,
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.
Sit at the light so long,
And then we gotta move straight forward, 'cause we fight so strong,
So when right go wrong,
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on, let's hope!

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

I wish that you could show some love,
Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing,
Watch the music and have 'em trippin' of the joy I bring, (shit)
I wish that we could hold hands,
Listen instead of dissin' lessons from a grown man, and I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, and I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders,
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, you feel me(I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat,
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your man's gone, and I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And no po-po bring the heat on our peace like they did R. Kelly, and I
Wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breathe again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish that enemies could talk,
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game, let's hope

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic,
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court,
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get 'em on,
And in the famous words of Mr. King why can't we all just get along?
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, and I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, and I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask why are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin' on your knees in church and let's hope

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
'Cause we hopeful!

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
'Cause we hopeful!

Let's be hopeful

[Verse 1: Twista]
Standing in the midst of a hundred thousand haters
Dynamite and see-4 strapped around the waist bloody tears in my eyes
Hit the switch making sure any motherfucker in the vicinity blow away and die
Kill'em off with an explosion get up bitches
Kamikaze on you hoes I'm the sacrificial lamb
Feelin the fury flow out of every follicle in my body
While you decompose die with a blunt of dro in yo hand
I'm uppin the itchy for fuckin wit Twista
If you fuckin wit me come back for you
Cause it won't be an issue
Got some nuts to come get me
Then boy you gon get the picture for flamin my swisher
Then hollows penetrate through your tissue
Fuckin' fed up wit your blood
As I hear the cries of yo homies screamin revenge got no mercy on them either
Go to war wit the intentions to annialate everything you stand for
Wit the death of myself cause I'm a believer
The blessings of sacrifice the messenger who cometh after the Christ
Next one to glisten after ice
Fuckin wit me is a bigger gamble then a pack of dice
I'll murder you and come at you again in the after life
My brother you can't bring harm wit guns
I'm armed wit bombs fuck all that shit you carry I got your obituary
A motherfuckin phenomenon-cause I'm ah come
Til they put all of us in a cemetery

[Chorus: 2X]
Now come and look into the mind of a man you don't really want to fuck wit
(Kill'em All, Kill'em All, Kill'em All)
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us

Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
(Kill Us All, Kill Us All, Kill Us All)
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us

[Verse 2: Twista]
Go to war like I'm untouchable
Yellin' out bloody murder while I'm bustin you (bustin you)
2 deadly fingers squeezing twin triggers steady touchin you
Screamin' like a demon like I'm finger fuckin you (fuckin you)
Just put my body in a room wit the enemy and I got a grenade
I'mma pull the pin out the sum bitch
Pop 17 sins out the gun clip
Smoking dro so fire I was on 10 after 1 bligg
Nigga you have now entered the chainsaw massacre
Takin more blood than a 2000 dracula
Slip the clip in the automatic and get to bustin
Horrific hollows while you prayin' to Jesus of Nazarus
A 7 day theory like makaveli flowin on a track that's scary
Wit a Mack in the back of the pelle
Spectacular how could you dare me I'm already willing to die
I'm comin back after they bury me
Its time for your confessions I be the priest
Celebrate and salute the sign of a suicidal soldier
Better become a bible holder
As I start to massacre men with a verbal recital that's colder
Deaths coming closer
As you let kamikaze enter yo body
Careful or you die standing vertical
And anyone that opposes I swear to God I'mma get you
Even if I gotta murder me to murder you

[Chorus: 2X]
Now come and look into the mind of a man you don't really want to fuck wit
(Kill'em All, Kill'em All, Kill'em All)
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us

Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch

[VERSE 1]
You don't want to see these murder guys
Princess cuts hurt ya eyes
Got the chicks that work them thighs
Pull the top back on the prowler
Like the car ain't circumcised
Burglarize hoes
Leave ya eyes closed
Bricks in my truck while I ride slow
Smoke yo fire dro
No repercussions
He was disgusting
Turn my volume under ten
To keep my speakers from busting
If them people come rushin
Can't say I froze
Won't open the doors
Bout time they caught up
I done exposed of my outer clothes
Car in the garage
I say good God
My day was hard
Call two freaks up for the ménage trois
Parlaying hard
Sade was suave
When we was screwing
Sheets was ruin
If beef is brewing
I'mma put slugs deep into
Money they be pursuing
The nerve of these jealous bastards fo hatin
Master my patience
Them custom wood grain caskets is waitin
Passion for satin
They must have
Gave them a blood bath
Had to show them who really holdin shit down wit they tuff ass
We alias
They wishin they be us
can't three eighty us
Cause we'll wreck everything within a ten-block radius
When ya see me betta speak with love
Or leak some blood
I got connections with all type of BM, Chiefs, and GOVS
Deeply plugged who gotta retire from crime
Bout to hit that big lick
So we gonna pull it

[CHORUS]
One last time
I got some good news man
Some good news
We gone come up if we just make this quick move
Lay it all on the line
Hit'em in the body and da dome
Left the after party wit the chrome
Come up wit a milly
Soon as everybody know that I'm gone
Cause I made it mama your son he's a success
Now you ain't got no reason to stress
Gotta keep it Gangsta
Cause I'ma Hustla
Do it like a balla
Cause I'ma a mobsta

[VERSE 2]
Cause it only takes a second to pop me a snitch
Call up my connection and cop me a brick
And he sent a chezovoceian chick
She was actin cocky and shit
She like watchin blow at the hotel
Wit big dreams to never stop being rich
And she wasn't too sloppy wit dick
Said when she get on she was gonna cop me a six
Platinum blue spreewell shoes
Detail smooth
On some Mickey and malery me and my female crews
Type of demo what's the beno
I gave her two six plus ten four
That's twelve five for the brick
And five hundred for the plane and limo
Plain and simple called my guy and told'em thanks and send more
Meditating plot on my lick when I smell them frankensen blow
Do my thugdizle I ain't scared of this
Fly ya head like peagus
Bloody up that necklace
Hoe I'ma Aries
Them terrorist fucked up the lick when sendin chicks on the plane
Put a major glitch in the game
But I'm get me them thangs
As I come wit new ways to travel watch my shorties get on em
Comin back wit pound and packages wit the scorpions on them
Of course we been on them
Niggaz know they two for forty and want'em
I done seen truck load wit more keys than accordion
And you think I'm past up that quick fast dust
let me mask up
That ain't a fast truck
Get yo ass stuffed

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
I spit words that be gangsta shit
Make hustla tip and ballers rich
Hatters sick mobsta hitz
I'm the shit
You can't see me visit the optometrist
Cars I flip unorthodox like Dr. Bonovich
Prada lic but nigga got whooped
Should of seen shit was funny
My old connection he got reason to gun me
I know he took the money
Even if I probably wrong
Turn down the volume
Shoot him on plastic to lay his body on
Fuckin marcon
Two to the caveza
Pincha puto
That ring on your pinky was too cold
Got pinch for two O's
And a half brick my staff is sick
Had him confess like a catholic
Always thought things was funny now you don't laugh at shit
Stupid bastard bitch
Never fuck wit Twista, Turtle Banxxs, and Stokes
Coming up dro flowin slangin dope
I tried to chill
but when I see a lic to make the world mine
On the love
I think I got to pull it

Put you in a chameleon, 0-4 Range
Still sexy, when you smoke that flame
Jerk you like a chicken, when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven, the way that she talk
Switching to freaky, so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib, in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas
Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my-my-my-my
Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch, at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty, on the big screen
I can see me freaking you, with whip cream
I can see you on stage, at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's, and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life

The people to know or show you things, sticker than to

And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you

And I bet she gon put a hurt on em, hard in the party
And you know you kill em in the club, we go
You was born to be a po', how you gon sticking fo' do's
And I love you, cause you freaky with the dope clothes

I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'ma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbing me, calling me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played 'ready for the world', she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong

But now I need you to do it faster baby, can you please - do it faster, do it
Faster
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!

When I catch you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm laying back smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you when I'm messing wit Kan man and Twist in the Chi
And I be sipping hennessey, play some R&B
While I smoke a b - you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light,  move it to some Isaac
His rims still moving so I bump a lil Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b - dipping through the streets
Bumping r&b, and I got the leaf, on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment controlling me
I love the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's r&b, come to the club wit me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feeling me
And still will be in love wit me

Now, now, when my boo let me break 'em off, freaky when we makin love
I can do shit to you that'll make you shake in lust
Comin' through how I be stoppin' off, kinky when I make you cum
How could you wanna do shit that'll make me break the trust?
Shoulda knew you were sheisty the way you lick me on my body
And actin' shady when I'm out the crib, lightly
Cause somethin' bogus just to fight me spite me all in my area
Plus I'm a Sagittarius, you a Pisces
For some reason we be clickin like we on business
But you be on some bullshit
Askin' me where I go, what I do, how I kick it
Won't you get with it baby girl, I don't cheat on you and pull shizz
Now who don't wanna roll on, chrome with then go home with
Get you to the crib, give you some grown dick
I let you hold my pounds down, purchasin' you phones and fits
How many times I told you, I ain't known shit
But you steady don't listen even though it's your friends that listen
Gotta have trust, but you won't back up on a couple I'll catch you wishin'
Claimin' that I'm fuckin on another bitch and
All in my privacy on no premonition, you trippin'
Tell me why do you, doubt a brother, in one ear and out the other
Cause in my shirt you done found number
You steady lurkin' while I was up in the shower
Dumpin' all of my pants pockets, trippin' cause you done found a rubber
And all I gotta say is.

That's not right (that's not right)
Snoopin' through my things (you snoopin' baby, snoopin' baby)
I don't do it to you (I don't do it, I don't do it)
You shouldn't do that to me (I don't do it to you)
That's not right (that's not right)

Readin' my magazine, my Vibe magazine, yeah
I coulda sworn that I turned my damn 2-Way off
But damn I heard it ring, I think I heard it ring, yeah
If it's somethin' that you think that's wrong got you feelin' insecure
I'm grown, baby let me know, and then I'll let you know
Cause I'm the one that's footin' the bills
And I'm not the wrong one, that's for real
You can get your shit and go, go!

Now you don't see me all up in your dresser drawers
You don't see me goin' through your Jag
You don't see me in your celli, you don't see me
Searchin' through your thongs, and you don't see me though your Gucci bag
Baby you got the shabazz, sometimes you need a swift, kick up the ass
Just to to see how far a foot can go
Would you wash it and took it slow, couldn't though
Pressure cookin' low, bitch I hope you find what you lookin' fo'
I'm losin' focus from fuckin' witchu, don't get me charged
Come in from a show, my whole closet be picked apart
If anybody should be paranoid in this motherfucker it should be me
I'm the one smokin' hydro by the jars
You need to leave my stuff alone, go and get some business of your own
Cause me and you ain't spendin' precious time together
Baby don't touch mine, I shouldn't need a ""don't touch"" sign
I ain't explainin' nothin', you can find whatever
And all I gotta say is.

[Chorus]

Now when I get up in your ooh-watcha-katcha
Move to the mm-ch-ka mm-ch-ka mm-ahh, don't lie
You peepin the details of my fax, mail and voice mail
And E-mail and why sugar, don't try
To come up with the justification for what you doin'
The relationship's about to be ruined for what you persuin'
Steadily tryna see who I'm screwin' like I'm fuckin' the nation
It's nothin' but hatin' that the homies be doin'
Spittin' rumors all up in your ear, tension in the atmosphere
Baby what's the mission here, listen here
You lookin' for numbers and fist in hair
It must be here for a reason so quit before I have to make you disappear
I can do without you pokin' through pockets
Prophecy's potent, whatchu peepin' fo'?
I hate the way that all this time to tell what I been thinkin'
Shoulda told you when I thought about it a week ago
But now I'm tellin' you.

Lookin' hot in them heels, I think I want that
Come and back it up to the bottom of my throwback
With you rollin' yo' rims lookin' like a Kodak
Watch I drive I wanna smoke, she will roll that

Twista,"This goes out to all sides worldwide,
Let that playa ass nigga Twista be yo guide, as we go on a ride,
Hood to hood, chrome, leather, and wood,
And it feels so good

One mornin' I
Woke up next to a peanut butter and a caramel chick,
Feelin' fucked up, flicked out, freaked on,
Thinkin' about my new truck with the deep dish,
Meanin' deep chrome, deep chrome, in the deep dome,
After a massage and a ménage, we got in the shower,
Let water trickle down the crack of the back of they booty,
Got out the tub and went back to the master bedroom,
One put on Prada, one put on Ludi, I put on Gucci,
Duty calls, I'm bout to hit the scene and ball,
But before I leave I spray on some Itsimiaki,
Take my truck up to the wash, put the sparkle back on,
Wax on, wax off like Mr. Miagi,
Go to the liquor store so I can get blunts, get Yak,
So I can sip some while I split one,
Chronicle enter ever pholical of my body,
Calmin' down every molecule, makin' sure I don't trip none,
Hit one
Hop in the ride, come and kick it wit me,
So I can take you through the so-and-so hundred block,
And show you how my people be kickin' it in the windy city,
I wanna show you where I hang out at, where we make our scratch,
While we sit on leather grippin' wood,
Where the hustla's got packs and the G's got stacks,
And the pimps got lacks, rollin' through the hood,
And it feels so good

And it feels so good,
Turnin' corners with my pinky man,
Through my hood,
Chokin' on a be	 and switchin' lanes is understood (understood)
I'm a baller livin' pimpish,
Man, leather and wood,
Said it feels so good (feels so good)

Now I done seen plenty niggas flip twenty's, flip twenty one's,
Flip twenty two's, flip Jordans, flip two-fours,
Mega ballin', new clothes,
Momma got a new store, TV screens, hundred-forty spokes,
And we fittina' roll, right off Madison to the manor in a drop-top Lexus,
Sippin' henny rollin' reckless, 
Feelin' so motherfuckin' good I could roll my vehicle to Texas,
And spit it like, this is for the syrup sipper's
Gotta slow it down so you feel it, plus it make the words figure,
And spit some screwed shit and do shit so that you understand,
When it come to spittin' rapid-fire lyric adrenaline then I be the motherfuckin' man
Get the love, when I hit the club gotta freak in, 
It's the weekend and the DJ bumpin' tattoo,
Track move like some southern, black blues, or like the Cooper, got cruise,
And they got shoes it's packet-proof instead I be the hottest rap
Dude, ride to this while you peel, yo, hood,
You could go around the block or travel the whole world, 
When you come back it's still yo hood,
And it feels so good

And it feels so good,
Turnin' corners with my pinky man,
Through my hood,
Chokin' on a be	 and switchin' lanes is understood (understood)
I'm a baller livin' pimpish,
Man, leather and wood,
Said it feels so good (feels so good)

I spit some game wit the intellect, 
To the media, like I'm in the Encyclopedia Brittanica,
Come and take over the world wit' me girl, 
If you good I might can see if I can be yo manager,
Get yo career on track and yo life on point and I'll show you how yo taxes go
Tactics flow quicker than a hat-trick go, 
Smokin' on some fire, galactic dro,
I know it's good when you smoke that fire, 
Puff that herb, get that dirt, hit that lick,
Cop yourself a motherfuckin' Bentley car, 
Cop yourself a motherfuckin' Bentley crib,
Pop that ass, throw that dick, 
Twork that thing, bust that nut,
Drop that top, turn the base up, 
Put you a chameleon paint on the truck,
Get iced up, bumpin' Twista grooves as I cruise new shoes rollin' smooth up in K-Town,
In my city come and feel it ghetto blues, 
If you snooze you lose don't pay dues for the
Tre-pound,
Take tha time to kick wit' yo home girls
And feel yo' nugz
Keep on hatin' on the L, 
Big family we gon' steady come up and I'm a still smoke good,
And it feels so good

And it feels so good,
Turnin' corners with my pinky man,
Through my hood,
Chokin' on a be	 and switchin' lanes is understood (understood)
I'm a baller livin' pimpish,
Man, leather and wood,
Said it feels so good (feels so good)

And it feels so good,
Turnin' corners with my pinky man,

Twista,"When I wake up in the mornin' love,
And the sunlight hurts my eyes,
Then somethin' without warnin' love,
Bears heavy on my mind
Let's get them dollars, let's get this money

I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind,
I got my finger on the trigga', stayin' on the grind,
And when I wake up in the mornin', I gots to hit a lick,
Saw the two thousand and three Navi, on Sprees wit' a kit,
Soon as my eyes see the sunshine,
My thoughts is jukin' the block, and dodgin' the one time,
Peep how we movin' the rocks and wit' pounds of dro before I double my shit,
I can serve sixteen ounces for six and get back ninety-six,
A killa' for the skrilla', nigga', best not be stalkin',
I gots to get them bigga', figga's, fuck what you talkin',
I represent them nigga's ballin' wit' jewelry full of zickels,
Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams servin' nickels,
And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up,
And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up,
Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'cane,
Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs,
Gotta get that money man

It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
It's lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day

A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch,
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that,
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks,
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs,
I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto,
Semi-auto and Marlboro's in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto,
Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words,
My nigga' flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds,
I got the, mentality and the motive I'm on a mission,
For the money, you can get it too, it's all about yo' ambition,
Play yo' position, provide the plans, and follow procedures,
In the six-hundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's,
Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up,
Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when the grip stack up,
It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems,
Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar
Gotta get that money man

It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day

Got love for the corporate playa's that's ballin' rollin' jags,
Got love for the thug nigga's who get it on the ave.,
Love for those, who can make a mil' and sit back and laugh,
And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass,
Love for the single parents that's workin' through the struggle,
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle,
Love for those who gotta watch the hater's rollin' bubbles,
Causin' trouble every time a young brotha' try to hustle,
And if I can't, legally make or not
Then I gotta get, right back on the block
And if it no work we do a stick-up and whip-up a concoction,
Might leave yo' face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money man

It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day

Ain't shit sweet cause I seen you unpleasant
I steal would spray broad day ain't nothing
The lilac one AK doing something
I'm immuned to the drama
Act a fool if you want to
Lean in my pocket, 40 calb by the stomach
He acting' like he want it, I'm show a nigga somethin'
Somebody finna to have put ?
I don't tolerate suckas who be trying me
Take a special kind of nigga to defies me
Similar to 8ball and MJG been coming that hard since 93
Niggas know, ain't no out shinning me
I've been the G you're trying' to be
I mob with gorillas, squaders and robbers
And killers true niggas gonna ride me

Take a look at my wheels, rolling through the south
Still spinning and I'm still smoking heavy
Look at both of my grills, my motherfucking mouth
Looking just like the rims on the Chevy
Pimp twist I'm a playa still, ballin' in the game come major bills
Come and take a trip with me to hater Ville
On some 24 omegas and gator grill
Fuck a twist, fuck you bitch
I don't really want to have to bust you bitch
Roman gold shine so hard
Niggas out here know they can't touch that shit
I don't trip, niggas pull up
I be lookin' proud when I bust that dutch
Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Niggas try to jack you and loose my coop is by the kennel wheels
Mother fucker want to take my style
Cause niggas out here know I'm only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters want to see me fall
How can I let y'all niggas play me
Shitted on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin' 8 Ball and MJG
Twista bitch and I from the shy
With my Memphis connect and I ain't going' lie
We be specializing in and up coming with dope shit
And pulling up in cool whips that's fly
Still drink, still blow, then I creep through the hood real slow
While I bump kamikaze shit, while I scream look at my grill hoe

Don't try to ever take my cash from me
You mine as well, jump of a cliff you fucking crash dummy
Like that's my last money

We don't discriminate, we'll hurt now hurt you later

Catch him open when I'm kickin in the do'
Shoot up on the ceiling then I get him on the flo'

I woke up early Saturday morning sick off Rhemy and brews
Wit a hang over from blues
Hurl on my clothes and shoes stomach on wooz
From this killer weed that's so fired it made your nose bleed
I had me so high, my brain was fried movin at slow speed
This thick bitch chose me and was stickin like liquor
She look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like ""Dick her""
But wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken
I swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken
I remember wakin up at the flat fucked up in the back
Checkin on my weed and scratch I damn near fell out the lat
I hit the sack to sleep it off woke up woozy and still smoking
Twista's wishes thinking about last night and the bitch that was scopin
Fuck it lets get 'em on I grabbed the phone ""Girl call your friends""
Then I hit Twista and Maze and them bout the bitch in the Benz
Nigga push only cause I see them already been in the block
You know the lit niggas you'll find us in my favorite spot

In the summer I hit the front porch wit a morning be	
Sippin on the duce duce OZ
And I be killin me how many thick fees I see
Getting bubbly waitin for Stokes and T, I spit a little game at three
Tryin to talk up on the shoppin spree
Or a be	 of that stinky green free
Straight getting, to puff puff pass 
and drive up my gas hittin all the hot blocks
Bumpin ""Legit Ballers"" to ""Rock why'all Spot""
Everybody know the shit 'bout to drop
See from Northbound to Ten Row in it go tryin to get they props
Pollutin the air wit squares, blunts, and tops
Settin up shops for lots comin back nots
Each and everyday of the week 
the Mobsta Elites be on somebody porch dumpin heat
Bustin flows in the cipher getting deep 
While we cheat something sweet to Legendary beats
'Till we reached our peak
Scummy aloud attractin crowds to the street
Then it's time to retreat grab something to eat
And head to the late front to get up wit some freaks
Wit a treat under the seat
For the cats who get the sudden urge and want to try to jack
Cause when your pockets is fat
It seems like all the haters and hood-rats want to attack
And when the park close we hit the liquor store 
for a box of Sitches and a fifth of Yak
South on the corner and get a few sacks 
Or betta yet the whole pack so we can get back

One morning I
Woke up next to a choclate fee and a red bone 
My dick was hard I started stroking and poking
After toppin I tell them to role the blunt
Cause on the front I hear them niggas steady smoking and jokin
I heard it's gonna be hot outside gotta get up and lay my clothes out
It's gonna be too many hoes out 
Before my ladies rolled out I got 'em to clean up the whole house
Then I threw my fit on look in the mirror get on gone
""Nigga you looking dope because you got a knot""
Ain't no cruising up out the hop 
I'm hangin by the spot cause I had to put the Lexus off up in the shop
But it's all to good it's a hood thang 
Never too bogus notice the love on the block that nigga coolin
Aiming the radio out the window steady grooving
Tip by the corner store wit the indo steady movin
Niggas who flippin new 98's is steady cruising 
Bumpin up the block flossin for the chicks cause they rich
But I ain't leavin off the front with the blunt 
Set a switch just to pull in all the thickest btiches
At the crib I can't get caught wit heat
If it's some static I shall chalk and sweep
I go and get the be	's up off but chief
""Come get me if the phone for me I'm at the party across the street""
I'm enjoying the breeze high degreez and no ease
Pockets be full of G's smoking be	's hiding the fees
Making no enemies the po P's yellin out ""Freeze""

A nigga been hustlin' so long, god knows I've done so much wrong
I was 16 grown and holdin' chrome, servin' blows, we in' zones
My mom didn't understand me ""boy, you gon' die just like your daddy
From two to the head, dumped in the riverbed
I didn't to hurt you so badly,"" I was young and dumb
Fast life sprung of the money and hoes that it brung
Had a clip full of hollows to bring your momma sorrow
But now regret what I've done
Drama's all in the game whether gang bang or slang
I had to do my thang
When the shots rang, that's when it clicks in my brain
All the shit's the same
My nigga need a change, I had to get off out these streets
To get you out your seat
Flip a trax beat, hit the crib and puff on a sweet
And let 'em feel something deep
Deep so the realest can feel
How I felt right before I bust that steel
Rappin 'bout my life of skrill

This shit I've been tokin' is potent
Got me straight thinkin' about takin' mary jane and eloping
Blowin' smoke with the sunroof half-way opened
Countercode with the scope in close range
I guess he gotta aim, and stick a few thangs in the nigga's brain
No face straps (?) thinkin' that he can
Puttin' food on table is an everyday strain
But now I did finally flip my shit legit
And workin' a different angle of the game
Even though my hussle ain't changed
I'm still prayin' my best presence to overcome my pain
Singin' tapes of cain
The roads to riches seems longer than the freight train
And every little stop keep a nigga tryin' to plot
On the paper you done gain until you drain
But I put that on the foe
I'ma flow 'til I got no choice, or better yet no voice
But still by that time I hope to write enough rhymes
To own a fleet real estate with a rolce royce
Rollin' deep through this chi-town streets
With my mobsta elites on the way to north riverside mall
Givin' thanks to the all for givin' me a legit where to ball at

Be sold, or be poor up in these city streets
Or with the pistol playin' for you mr. reaper
Forgive those, I explode like see-4 so give me 50 feet
Bustin' shots in every directions

I done witnessed public aid, people get sprayed, the tip raise
And momma cry, why my bills won't get paid
If I have to I'ma send cheese from blows
Nobody can hurt me or run thugsta greed, gd's or foes
Workin' the spot 'cause we need some clothes
Who ever thought I'd be making money off of my cd's and shows
My crib got gats in the hall, rats steady crawl
Roaches comin' out the cracks in the wall
On the tip, bust it with my back to the wall

Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams servin' nickels,
And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up,
And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up,
Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'cane,
Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs,
Gotta get that money man

It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
It's lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day

A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch,
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that,
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks,
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs,
I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto,
Semi-auto and Marlboro's in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto,
Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words,
My nigga' flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds,
I got the, mentality and the motive I'm on a mission,
For the money, you can get it too, it's all about yo' ambition,
Play yo' position, provide the plans, and follow procedures,
In the six-hundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's,
Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up,
Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when the grip stack up,
It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems,
Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar
Gotta get that money man

It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day

Got love for the corporate playa's that's ballin' rollin' jags,
Got love for the thug nigga's who get it on the ave.,
Love for those, who can make a mil' and sit back and laugh,
And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass,
Love for the single parents that's workin' through the struggle,
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle,
Love for those who gotta watch the hater's rollin' bubbles,
Causin' trouble every time a young brotha' try to hustle,
And if I can't, legally make or not
Then I gotta get, right back on the block
And if it no work we do a stick-up and whip-up a concoction,
Might leave yo' face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money man

It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day

And big man you can search all you want
But you ain't gon' find no drugs or no guns
Yea why'all can get weeded up, beated up
But don't eat it up this ain't a slow jam so I can speed it up (lets go)
I ain't sparkin a meadow
I jus want to talk to the ghetto
Bag the baddest chick with the sharpest stilettos
I'm so influential, you so impotential
Man you gon' know what I'm workin wit
When I hold it against you
Destination vip you can follow us
But if it was the last sip well jus follow us
Shorty feelin my style because I'm humourous
Put me on cloud nine and its accumulous
Assume its us Jin, mista quick to diss ya
And Twista spit so fast ya lips'll blista

When I come in the party betta get high
'cause I pulled up in the platinum seven six five
Who say lyrical niggaz don't know how to party
See me jackin up shawtys wit a grippin on her thick thighs
I like the way she workin that badunkadunk
Bouncin the fatty when the base go bump
She witness how Twista spit it
So now she want me to hit it
'cause I'm blazin up the booth and raisin up the roof
I'm in the vip sippin on Cris' and Henn'
All the ladies is trippin 'cause they can't get in
They see me ballin wit the Ruff Ryder homie
And say they only drink liqour nigga but now they want some Jin
Everywhere we kick it we got the club sold
International hustlas that travel the globe
Rockin the thugs makin hoes keep it live
It's the Double are connect and that nigga Twista from Chi
I'm fly

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Jin]
We can definitely kick it
I don't want to just stick it
If bein fine was a crime well I'd havta write you up a ticket
If you dance for me its sign jus like a picket
And I got two middle fingaz for all you critics
Never you in this someone so clever who spit this
I'm only here for one night so I mix some pleasure with business
Every few minutes

Peanut-butter interior, black body
And in case you didn't know, I be the Twista
Hundred bombs in my pockets, put your ones up
I hear some niggaz lookin at me for the come up
Try to creep creep, I pull a gun up
I put a hole in the first nigga that run up
The ballers be Jay, are, and T
Spit it cold cause the music is a part of me
Can't nobody spit it fast as me
Got an academy of haters comin after me
I know I got what you want, I know I got what you need
Come and mob to the top before you get, this, money

Pull up on the block in the alien gray Bentley
Full of sport modes, you never could hang with me
Just to get in early, I paid a extra 50
Gettin that money my nigga
Oh-five Chrysler, trees for the blunts
Three hoes in the back, two fiends in the front
Twenty-two inch shoes, CV's in the trunk
Gettin that money my nigga
Makin dough off a style I be the best in
Glad to be down with these two livin legends
Now let me see which league I'ma invest in
Gettin that money my nigga
Rollin this cheer, put the niggaz in fear
Makin bitches shed tears, take a look at my career
Now the shit's swell; when I get up to 70 in the Coupe
Peep the wing when I hope out the tail - tell 'em Kel

Drinks in the club because we gettin that money my nigga
We rollin 24's, open them Bentley do's
Got plenty hoes because we gettin that money my nigga

Pull up to the club, chicks in the back
Some smokin on weed, some sippin Co-gnac
Into the club, whole crew to the back
Super the stars make it sharp as a tack
Gotta have my forty-five inch in it
In the house, from the gate, twenty minutes
Game over and I'm still not finished
I play haters like V play tennis
Livin like a motherfuckin Richie Rich nigga
Got a butler for my Maybach nigga
White linen, smokin ci-gar
Lyrics like bullets, tongue like a trigger
Feelin on your booty
Tryin to get one of these nice ladies
to come up to my room and do, me
Have her man like who's, he
Was a pimp at birth, first ho was a nurse
And I'ma be a pimp 'til I'm stretches in a hearse
Sometimes showbiz is the worst
I'm blessed with ""The Gift & The Curse,"" whoa
Shoot ball, now I'm off to the spa
Fresh and clean, now I'm off in the car
Got a date with a superstar
We take lunch, now twelve o'clock
Hit the mall bout two o'clock
In the movies bout five o'clock
Seven o'clock 'til nine o'clock

This for my project niggaz, widebody Mo' sippers
Pimps hustlers herb flippers, get, this, money

Gettin this money switchin my whips and my kicks
Like I'm just addicted to difference you pick what you want from me
To be a, lame with visions of riches, enter my brain
Like I picture myself in deep dishes, just switchin lanes
It's just insane, is it? I'm from the district where niggaz
either in prison or pay visits like in-laws
So we fend for ourself, and the wealth is in raw
We can't help but been lost, what else gon' make that engine roar?
Lay back in 745, big boy cars, that's all we drive
Into the club we get all the eyes when you gettin that money my nigga

(Man don't feel defeated, 'cause trust me you can build it)

Now hear the words that I flow when I spit
I know shorties that be havin dreams of goin legit
But the hustle quicker so they cop a fo' on the split
Now they got enough money where they can go get a brick

It's on - ain't nothin' goin' stop us now
Gotta look at 24's while they watch us now
Spinners rollin' up the block while they pump out noise
But they always get into it with the jump out boys

And why? Take a look at all the people that got dubs
You ain't legitimate, you out here servin them rocks up
I know you want the radio and screens to pop up
But we gotta get the money and try not to get locked up

Know the difference between real and fake
Different work is just like different real estate
Open your mind, you got more than the skill to take

Yes - I know that puzzle
N****z at each other thinkin' they will bust you
The bang is the same even if it's muffled
But the moment so loud when a dead man hug you

He's cold in your arms, but you ain't gon' be foldin your arms
You goin' be lowered in your arms
Cryin' to open the jar, and to add injury to insult
You're smokin' your life away

Look at me, big car big house big jewels
All that came out my backpack
You ain't goin' do it, it ain't goin' work, you ain't goin' prove it
Even though that hurt, I just skated past that

Look - everybody got dreams about ki's
Chains full of ice with S after the V's
Horse on the hood, a grill full with the B's
Dangling your feet in San Turin-y breeze

Make a virtual picture, and spin around
That ain't it, well f*** it n**** we get it down
Devil try to grab your ankle, n****, we'll kick 'em down
Focus up, we gotta hit it now

Aren't you ready to go?

I make the decision to get liver
Reminiscin as I take a listen to my n**** 'Pac
While I envision my ""Ambitions Az a Ridah""

Listen to Pharrell spit to the track
Pull up in a burgundy Bentley with a b**** in the back
I get to the paper like a hyper get to the crack
I ain't speculatin homey I just stick to the facts, c'mon

If you wanna get the money and the status and the mob
Better ride when you roll with the crew
Take a listen for the bub hit the bud
When you hear this in the club then you know what to do

Look at the vision of a mack spittin crack on the track
Throw these stacks in the black Cadillac
Get it like Twista and Neptunes, I got your back

Bust at any motherfucker acting hard with us,
Don't really wanna show you what a GIB, I'd rather be sippin' Remy in VIP,
When you hear the music it'll be by me, Twista with the legendary nigga BIG,
Brooklyn and K-town, when you checkin' out the flow
You know it's gon' reign with persistence
Two legends on the same track, two different plains of existence
Lets get it crackin' I love to bust flows
Hit it from the back 'cause I love to buck hoe
Spit it for the city I love Chicago
Calico's buck, I love to bust those,
You think you can spit on the mic like Biggie and flow just as steady as I

In the middle it it I'ma, bring niggas more drama than their baby mommas
Nigga wanna battle, I'ma bomb ya
One man, but attack like a pack of piranhas, like Terra-cota
Niggas always ready for the war, but they really don't wanna see a nigga though
We can do em in a minute, then we finish with 'em
Hit em wit the feelin of a nigga wit a sick ol' flow
Doin it wit Swizz, oh no, you niggas is in some trouble
Somebody better call po-po
It's gonna be murder when I get to servin 'em verbally, man
Nigga y'all heard of me, wig splitta, killa nigga word to me
And I'm classic, like Bird and Magic
Wit a tactic to snatch it, strap back and stack some platinum
Double on the mag random, with the bullets I brand em
Finna hold the game ransom
Runnin' up in your mansion,
Catch them magnums, flashing cannons
Niggas ain't ready for this one
'Cause I'm on a mission to get even better
Believe it I'm heavily heated it's easy to see me
If you trying to see me, let that be the reason

What you know about Kellz & Twist, two multi-platinum artists steppin'out the suicide doors
I ain't claimin' the crown or the throne, but I know I'm Chi-town to the bone
Come and have a round of Patron and get down to the song while 
I tell you bout the ground I be on Chicago
Tell a girl about K-town and the projects, downtown and all these places
Caught her starin' at the ice in my ear, she almost fainted when she saw these glaciers
Feel the words when I spit em in the mic, First I gotta get up with the mob in the light
Rollin' 40 deep to the club and I'm like, gotta see what I'm bout to fuck tonight
The party so live, and I'm bout to set it off for the 0-5
It's all good but I got the 4-5, and I found me a down ass hoe to ride
And she got a fat ol' ass that'll brighten up the room
Come let a West Side Nigga slide this dick off in yo womb, Uh huh
Put the dial on her booty make her lively, most likely, she think I'ma make her wifey
Got her hooked like nightly, she wanna bite me, when I come up in the room in a White-Tee
Presidential Suite, wit some drank and some kush about to get em on
After dis one night, I'ma be the one you call, when you wanna get a hit until the early mon

Tryna get her to let me dive off in that ass like it's an ocean
(rub her down) with some heated lotion
(and now)got honey soakin'
(she's ready) for the pipe
(fuckin' with) her emotions
Wanna show you what a true player's like, you would swear you was in paradise
Wanna turn that ass over and ride, good-bye to them other guys
Girl if you ride out wit me I promise you won't regret it
I shoot hoop and so you know this boy is real athletic
You want me to go down on you baby don't even sweat it
Just pass the Remy to me and watch me get real nasty
R's gonna give it to you how you like it, I'll be bumpin' on dat

Grab another clip, hit it like the trip, represent the pimps (still a lot of platinum on me)
Sit back relax and watch her ride on me, get up in the morning do the same to her homie
Chuuch right here, motherfucker can't clone me
Louis Vitton, Gucci and Prada, hit it from the back and make her girlfriend holla

She was dark-skinned had a shape like a mountain so I know she ain't frying
Put that ass in the back of the jeep and I know she's coming
Says Belo when her toes curl up when I know she's cumming
They supposed to be coming
I can give you what you want like some dick for days

It was some what early, I was on my way
To get me some hay from my nigga in the Tray
And a four of that drank to go with my dank
It makes me lean all day
About three, I'm full of them trees
A dog want to hunt for a pack of fleas
Can I get me a freezy please
These H-Town freaks be a hundred degrees
It felt like a dream, sittin' on the lot at Dairy Queen
Very clean, in my dirty three pullin' machine
Jeans with tightly packed booty caught my eyes
My mind started to wonder about the prize between her thighs
She caught me lookin' grinnin'
Sharing my thoughts of late night sinnin'
Hey baby can I speak to you (Naw, naw you probably got plenty women)
Damn, how you gonna shoot a playa down
Before the conversation gets started baby
Ain't you done seen me and MJG on BET with J-O-E
Anyway, I wonder if we could set this thing off properly
Jet to one of my properties and blow a bag of that broccoli
Possibly, we could be, more than friends if you let it be
Imagine it, you and me, in the middle of the night

[Hook]
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really want to hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here

I was chillin' at the bar, girl gave me the eye
So I had to start a conversation took by vision of my bone
Made me feel this chick was on
She said (I'm bored I ain't did nothin but lay round the house all week)
And so I said in my mind
That's a line of a flat down straight up ho down freak
Then I pulled her to the side and I asked her what's up
She said (What's on ya mind)
I said well if ya thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We straight ya ain't gonna waste my time
Then I shuffled to the bar
Done missed the stuff that was goin' at the affair
Then as I came to the corner of the wall
I noticed that the girl was just standin' there
And then she gave me a look
Not an ordinary look but a look that made me thank
Did she want to romance, did she want to hit and run
Man, she out to try to count my bank
Now I was sippin' on the Hen and she approached me again
Choosin' on the playa with a grin, telling her friend
(Girl, I'ma be a lil' late gettin' in)
Now I was feelin' kind of hot in the spot
Gotta figure out a way to get my temperature down
Hit the town, ran a red to the hip without a flip
Without all these windows is around
Let's me and you do what we gotta do to get through
The rest of this episode, hold on tight
Let's re-write in the middle of the night

[MJG]
I'm on late night mission top let down
That's the way I gotta flip when I be
Feelin' 'ike I want to take a dip in the wind
Night-life livin' all the way to the end
It's just something bout the moon and the stars
And the dark blue sky that turns me on
I be chillin' in the day by the time somthing down
Gotta get better believe I'm gone
Now you can call me the vampire type
Batman livin' in a cave no lights
Seem too bright MJ outta sight
Never gotta fuss plus I never gotta fight
I might make another round through the Mound
Gotta get a sack of hay to make my trip complete
Look at all the women still hangin' in the streets
Temptation is an animal hard for me to beat
But as I creep through the midnight
Checkin' out the few tail I'd like to get right quick
Got my hand on my tone if a crook try to get me
Then a crook gonna wind up sick
I need to find a way to spend my time
Situation dirty, gotta erase my mind
Hangin' out to dry like clothes on a line
Everything fine, just like wine
Ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves in the trees
Young women knees in a fresh set of keys
Now I'm fixin' to break em' to the birds and the bees
MJ put the P in tha ABC
In the morning I'ma stay up in the bed
Reaching for the cup filled up with ice
Blend it in with that H2O coolin' me off from my flight

Baller in the bubble, blowin bubble, always actin up
When trouble feel the double barrell of a double platnium thug
Clappin, ready for some action, and I'm going to empty the crib
I rep for the Roc and the State Property clique
Homey, you can't do shit
Throw a finger up, give me love, Remi in the club
When they see these thug, in a circle, snort the 50s up
Range Rov, 24 inch, blacked out bulbs
Blows fast, but hit your ho slow with the soul pole
Creeping on niggas trying to test me in the black drop top
Pull up and let the booper go bop, bop-bop
Treat you, in the wind, to my borough, blowin on my back
And do the same to any nigga that's tryna take what I got
I Can't Have It!

Twista,"Twista, first time I kicked it off with ""Adrenaline Rush""
Next album I kicked it off with ""They Kill Us All""
This time, I'm a show you how to ""Check That Hoe""
Check it out

Take a look at the way that I came
Hard times, long road, mean streets
Motherfuckers back up off me when they look at the way that I am
Put the bullet in your brain when I ride nigga
Got it out when you entered they don't fuck with the boss
If you disrespectin' me I'm reposessin'
like you catchin' the holy ghost make him die like he touchin' the cross
Now you spiritually committed suicide nigga
I got the power to get diamonds and riches and gold
Motherfuckers tried to get it with extortion
But I'm too vicious for blows and I'm checkin' these bitches and hoes
Make a shower full of hollow point bullets rain on
For yo' death you got me lookin' in my itinerary
If I ain't got scheduled to be dead where the men are buried
I think I can fit you another cometary
Like a disciple of death I'm bringin' pain on
I can see nobody playin' me like I'm a punk
I'm a let you know off top if you come at me bogus
And there's more than one of y'all if I gotta stop I'm a dump
You done made me a murderer from the Westside
Haters come at smilin' but really they wanna fuck up a nigga hustle
So I just get bubble smokin' bubble when I try to just stay out of trouble
But some shit you can't let slide, you gotta check that hoe

[Chorus]
If a nigga come at you like a lame or big slander your name
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe, if a nigga come at you in the club
Talkin' 'bout a bitch that you supposed to fuck
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe, you and somebody put in half and half
And he come back at you with twenty-five percent; then
you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe, if you get played for a bird and some herb
All you got is your balls and your word
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe

I just wanted 'em to see what my CD was like
Hip-Hop is in a state as if it was a baby bein' murdered
I just wanna feed in poetry breathin' you life
I'm a black revolutionary in hip-hop
I just wanna hit the earth like a meteorite
Now droppin' lyrical bombs upon the planet
And just get a little dust and word out on media hype
Fuck the drama I'm just campaignin' Chi right
niggas feel like they position is better than mine
But I stay on a mission, I'm on the grind
Takin' no prisoners I can see 'em gettin' mo' cheddar than mine
How I flow make the dough get larger
Take over with an immaculate verbal assault
Just to do it the way I'm doin' it, rollin' how I'm rollin'
Motherfuckers is gon' have to just go in the vault
Shit on niggas in the oh-six Charger
When it come to titles you know that I'm holdin' 'em
I've been down since the days of breakin' on linoleum
'til Kanye preach and ""Jesus Walks"" right up at the podium
Now let me speak about the prophecy of Twista
Just when you thought you worse, I'm bringin' you a hearse
I make you feel the heat and cold when I'm tellin' the street scroll
I got you feelin' the universe through the verse
The way I'm teachin' it has got to be a scripture
So look at me like I'm a prophet on top of the game
Puttin' money in my pocket for the way a nigga rock it
And I bet if I'm a cock it I'm poppin' the thang
And if I ain't strapped then I gotta whup ass
So I take off my pinky ice, if a nigga come at me with some bullshit
or fuck me out of money I steal on him like Winky Wright
Hit you with the left hook fast, you better check that hoe

Stay up in the street lookin for honies throwin money in the club
Chubby thug ballin in the white tee
Roll a Swisher up and take it to the head
Havin fantasies of havin me two bitches in the bed
Dark-skinned and light-skinned like Mike, both of 'em lookin right
Spectacular when I get up in them legs
Have you ever seen a light-skinned freak
Butter pecan or vanilla, nipples and her pussy pink
(Hazel-eyed jet black baby hair that'll hurt yo' hearrrrrrt)
Have you ever seen a dark-skinned freak
Sexy and chocolate when she droppin in, my African Queen
(When she starts what is she like a Hershey bar)
The three of us need to drive up to an exotic place
Where y'all can double up on me, take me to outer space
Or we can keep it ghetto while hang in the hood on the porch
And later on we can fuck in front of the fireplace
But for now I'm only dippin through the block
Expressin to you all of the feelings in my chest
Wishin I could find a couple of girls on what I'm on
So they could help me end my stress, until then I'm just

Talkin jazzy at the mouth, cause she think she the shit
Thinkin everybody around supposed to bow down to her
cause she's bored, but she's still my bitch
Now come take a look at miss black
Always got an attitude, and she stay on the attack
Why you always wanna whup a nigga ass, tellin me I'm bogus
But I love you cause yo' ass so fat
So now I gotta pimp my ride
Custom material, computer, and chrome on the side
Paint job can make you look like butter rollin
but you ain't rollin unless you got some twenty-fo's on the ride
And the do' suicide
Niggaz hatin but the bitches on the dick when the do's go up
Let the enemies see it good
When the homies in the ride and the forks and the fo's go up

Twista,"The day after, the day after

""Are we on the air? Yes, we are live at the scene
Of this tragic accident, where a car has ran into a building.
The person in the car was positively identified as rap star Twista.
Apparently, he went ""Kamikaze"" the big question is,
Will the rapper survive?""

You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You got a right to survive, oh, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it, you've gotta fight

Now it was a war it was like I was in Vietnam
But I kill 'em all, cause ""Kamikaze"" was the bomb
Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist
Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm
Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because it
This cup of death, Death was not yet meant for me to drink from it
Thinkin' how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride
I even had C4 duct taped to my stomach but uh
(You got a right to survive)
But you gotta have will and always be ready to come off the wall
They gon' be willin' to test you and catch you if you talk the talk
But I'm a keep on with the struggle fuck leavin' my body in chalk
(You're gonna make it)
Look at me now cause I'm standin' on top of the globe (say what)
Makin' big money for spittin' my popular flow (say what)
Now look at the swagger of a platinum veteran servin' 'em medicine
It's not a given to work cause I'm choppin' them O's
Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh
I'm stickin' them daggers in haters just look at them cry
The shit don't affect us effect us they wanna imagine
They take us lay 'em on the back, I'm makin 'em look at the sky
If I think they cool, I give 'em a dutch
If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch
If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust
If they talkin' shit I'm a bust at 'em and get 'em to hush
Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the street sweeper
A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I)
Lyrical retriever but good with them heaters
When I'm full of passion and fury like when you listen to Syleena (and I)
Went multi-platinum when I stepped on enemy grounds
Now bodies all over the world is fin' to be found
And ""Kamikaze"" was successful now c'mon and feel ""The Day After""

But this bad motherfucker right here gonna (""make you do wrong"")

I could tell when I dropped the top
I nippled off on the block, I was gonna get into some bullshit
That's the reason why I watch for cops
And keep me two baby glocks, both of 'em loaded with a full clip
Still I gotta be on a mission for paper
But later on I'm a be hanging out with everybody
Never knew I should of been scared of the hottie
I got up with later on at the R. Kelly party
So I pull up the club in the Coupe
Look at how them jeans hugging the boots
Saw me ippy uppy icy as hell, f'rilla good smell
Have you ever seen a thug in a suit? Jacking bitches up
Socializing with everybody flirting with girls but got plans to go home
Till I felt the way you was backing up on the thing
Getting down on the floor I could see the top of the thong
She a (bad motherfucker) she could bass a deuce
A fine-ass Medusa make your dick turn to stone
Take a look at the thong, get in the zone, took a shot of Patron
And I was gone, she a (bad motherfucker)
Take a look at them hips, and how she licking them lips
Like she was licking ice cream

I got the champagne and popped the top
And then unlocked the lock, the Queen 'bout to get her bang on
I don't know what I'm a tell my dog
When he look up and realize that a bitch ain't came home
Shit, he about to be rocking it
Looking sweeter than chocolate, he got the smell of a Reese's
Break a fella to pieces, it's a hell of a thesis
Adjusting his body with telekinesis
Got on top and then he knocked me off, until he was soft
Got in the car and dropped him off
Trying to sink down as low as I can up in my seat
Cause I'm rolling in the Hummer and the top was off
My guy sleeping anyway and that's whats up
But I'm paranoid, driving fast as fuck
Thinking 'bout what I did, I try to sneak in the crib
Here come my man in the front, asking me what (""make you do wrong"")

I don't know what you talking 'bout
Baby wont you go on back to sleep
I was at the police station, when you hanging in the club
Wit'cha boys getting drunk 20 deep it'll (""make you do wrong"")

If you got up with a ho
Should of told the bitch use another douche
If you was at the police station, should of smelled like heist
But you coming in smelling like puss what will (""make you do wrong"")

Well I couldn't resist
Cause she was thick as hell and so cute
Steady coming at me, she was throwing it all on me
And I couldn't leave, she had a big dookie shoot, it'll (""make you do wrong"")

My fingers on frost, ears on froze
Hanging at the club while hoes slide down the pole
Rolling with the Gs and the Foes and the Souls
With two bitches on my arms, sporting thousand dollar clothes
Looking kind of stunning, so the cameras on flick
Ain't no motherfuckers out here that can do it like this
On top of my game, and when a hater's all fall
Imma be smiling, revealing my grill from Paul Wall
Shake it for me bitch, let me see you get loose
Let me see you sipping on some shit that's 80 proof
Let me see if Imma let you get up in the 'lac
Bend over so I can see how Imma hit it from the back
I hustle wit the rhymes, but I'm better wit the keys
And I'm clubbin' wit the pees, I get cheddar wit the fees
I'm always on the hustle, so don't ask why I succeed
I got flows, I got dro, I got whatever u need

When it come to mobbing, Imma motherfucking boss
I stay making paper, behind the mic and on the tipping
I ain't stingy wit the dust, the whole crew ride slick
Think you shitting on the nigga t, I doubt that
My flow will make your booty move, like a house track
Have 'em at the party screaming, ""Get the doe"", ""Get the doe""
And if I ever go broke, I guarantee to bounce back
If beats was like a tipper, then my flow would play the cane
Got shit to make you float off the floor, like David Blaine
You rich because I spit it universal to the drums
And I circle with some guns, blow out purple out my lungs
I pimp and fuck a bitch, I don't need to buy her 'lacs
I be on the move, staying paid pushing Cadillacs
Investing in my raps, if I don't make a quarter back
I throw eight balls to my homies, on the corners like quarterbacks

Hope them haters don't coma at me thinking my blocks off
'Cause we known to get the heaters burnin' like hot sauce
Its all because I gave them baby mamas dick on the low
I tell em
Get down hit da floor

Twista,"Chi town balla, K town nigga.
Runnin through the streets with my hands on the trigga.
And on the block smokin' weed with hash,when i breeze past.
I'm 'bout to run through the game like I was Steve Nash.

Naw, naw T, naw, I feel that shit man. 
But we gotta come with some of that original twista shit,
You know, some of that Chi town playa shit.
You know, you know, that old shit, man.
Lets kick that shit T...alright I got ya 'cause.

Take a look at my Impala.
Make 'em take a look at my Chevy Caprice.
Now take a look at my platinum BU500 Benz rolling through the streets.
In the city of the goals.

Shit...making money is the mission.
I'ma glistenin'. 
Killin' off the competition.
Steady tipping, cause of how I be pimpin hoes.

Now I know just how to treat 'em, cause I need 'em.
I don't really got to beat 'em,
So we cool.
As long as they bring me my money.

Got 'em walkin' survin'. 
Ass with a passion.
While I'm talkin' better never see you laughin'.
Know I gotta show 'em ain't a damn thing funny.

Twista got game.
Finna spit it to 'em hard.
Get your dame, put 'em on the boulevard.
Now I got 'em in training with my bottom bitch.

She can learn a lot a shit.
Like how to get it on a stroll.
Be in control and shit on the other hoes.
And be able to get fedy for her daddy from a lot a tricks.

But the thump bumpin' speakers in the trunk.
Cause a nigga have to cop a little some some.
Leavin' niggaz bodies slump when I let the thumpa dump.
If I ever catch you fukin' with the bump bump.

Like a diamond I'm flawless.
Ain't no fucking with rawness.
When you enter my vicinity better be cautious.
If you into makin' money step into my office.

Makin' hoes, close shop.
My flow caine got the block hot.
Two for tens got me swoopin' through the city in the drop top.
Screamin' out I just don't give a fuck.

I'm the truth in the booth from when you see me coming through with the crew.
I make it do what it do.
I'm a win for the city.
For the Chi till I die cause there's just no givin' up.

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
I'm holdin' down the game.
What would you be hatin' for.
I'm a playa from the go with the shit that you've been waitin' for.
I'm holdin' down the game.
Show me how you get buck lil momma.
You can make a buck the momma.
Niggaz out here like to fuck lil momma.

Take a look at my japer.
Now come look at the diamonds up in the ears.
Now come take a look at the gators jumpers. 
And 150 hat crocodile on the bib, and the ice on my charm.

Man I'm no joke.
Came up big in the 04.
Now as fast I can kill 'em with the slow flow.
Specially if I been smokin' that hydrogen bomb.

Shit man, now that's what I'm talking about.
Now that's that original twist, right there, man.
Man, but you know what, man lets go down and slow it down, man.
And take it down south Houston style 'cause.

Chi town balla.
K town nigga.
Runnin' through the street with my hands on the trigga.
And on the block. 

Smokin' weed with hash, when I breeze pass.
I'm bout to run through this game like I was Steve Nash.
Ain't no fuckin' with the twista when I toss words.
That's the 22 up against a moss berg.

Feel the thump in your trunk from the fatty chacer.
Alias auralius nigga call me gladiator.
Spittin' screw words at a screw pace.
2 times stronger than them bitches call me screw face.

You fuckin' with a real ass nigga.
Stuffin' pockets tryin'. 
To make 'em bigger.
Gotta let you know.

(Man don't feel defeated, 'cause trust me you can build it)

Now hear the words that I flow when I spit
I know shorties that be havin dreams of goin legit
But the hustle quicker so they cop a fo' on the split
Now they got enough money where they can go get a brick
It's on, ain't nothin' gon' stop us now
Gotta look at 24's while they watch us now
Spinners rollin' up the block while they pump out noise
But they always get into it with the jump out boys
And why? Take a look at all the people that got dubs
You ain't legitimate, you out here servin' them rocks up
I know you want the radio and screens to pop up
But we gotta get the money and try not to get locked up
Know the difference between real and fake
Different work is just like different real estate
Open your mind, you got more than the skill to take

With the burners on and with the fresh yams in they tube socks
Uh, two times for my niggas with they hands in the air
Sayin' a prayer cause the game left their dude shot
Yes, I know that puzzle
Niggas at each other thinkin' they will bust you
The bang is the same even if it's muffled
But the moment so loud when a dead man hug you
He's cold in your arms, but you ain't gon' be foldin' your arms
You gon' be lowered in your arms
Cryin' to open the jar, and to add injury to insult
You're smokin' your life away
Look at me, big car big house big jewels
All that came out my backpack
You ain't gon' do it, it ain't gon' work, you ain't gon' prove it
Even though that hurt, I just skated past that
Look, everybody got dreams about Ki's
Chains full of ice with S after the V's
Horse on the hood, a grill full with the B's
Dangling your feet in San Turin-y breeze
Make a virtual picture, and spin around
That ain't it, well fuck it nigga we get it down
Devil try to grab your ankle, nigga, we'll kick 'em down
Focus up, we gotta hit it now
Bruh when your cell goes clink, that's when you forfeit
All them dreams, all that divorce it
You ain't even get to see new mansion and Porsche shit

I make the decision to get liver
Reminiscin' as I take a listen to my nigga 'Pac
While I envision my ""Ambitions Az a Ridah""
Listen to Pharrell spit to the track
Pull up in a burgundy Bentley with a bitch in the back
I get to the paper like a hyper get to the crack
I ain't speculatin homey I just stick to the facts, c'mon

If you wanna get the money and the status and the mob
Better ride when you roll with the crew
Take a listen for the bub hit the bud
When you hear this in the club then you know what to do
Look at the vision of a mack spittin crack on the track
Throw these stacks in the black Cadillac

Now you spiritually commited suicide nigga
I got the power to get diamonds and riches and gold
Motherfuckers tried to get it with extortion
But I'm too vicious for blows and I'm checkin these bitches and hoes
Make a shower full of hollow point bullets rain on
For yo' death you got me lookin in my itinerary
If I ain't got scheduled to be dead where the men are buried
I think I can fit you another cemetary
Like a disciple of death I'm bringin pain on
I can see nobody playin me like I'm a punk
I'ma let you know off top if you come at me bogus
And there's more than one of y'all if I gotta stop I'ma dump
You done made me a murderer from the Westside
Haters come at smilin but really they wanna fuck up a nigga hustle
So I just get bubble smokin bubble when I try to just stay out of trouble
But some shit you can't let slide - you gotta check that hoe

If a nigga come at you like a lame or big slander your name
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe - if a nigga come at you in the club
Talkin 'bout a bitch that you supposed to fuck
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe - you and somebody put in half and half
And he come back at you with twenty-five percent; then
you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe - if you get played for a bird and some herb
All you got is your balls and your word
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe

I just wanted 'em to see what my CD was like
Hip-Hop is in a state as if it was a baby bein murdered
I just wanna feed in poetry breathin you life
I'm a black revolutionary in hip-hop
I just wanna hit the earth like a meteorite
Now droppin lyrical bombs upon the planet
And just get a little dust and word out on media hype
Fuck the drama I'm just campaignin Chi right
Niggaz feel like they position is better than mine
But I stay on a mission, I'm on the grind
Takin no prisoners I can see 'em gettin mo' cheddar than mine
How I flow make the dough get larger
Take over with an immaculate verbal assault
Just to do it the way I'm doin it, rollin how I'm rollin
Motherfuckers is gon' have to just go in the vault
Shit on niggaz in the oh-six Charger
When it come to titles you know that I'm holdin 'em
I've been down since the days of breakin on linoleum
'Til Kanye preach and ""Jesus Walks"" right up at the podium
Now let me speak about the prophecy of Twista
Just when you thought you worse, I'm bringin you a hearse
I make you feel the heat and cold when I'm tellin the street scroll
I got you feelin the universe through the verse
The way I'm teachin it has got to be a scripture
So look at me like I'm a prophet on top of the game
Puttin money in my pocket for the way a nigga rock it
And I bet if I'ma cock it I'm poppin the thang
And if I ain't strapped then I gotta whup ass
So I take off my pinky ice; if a nigga come at me with some bullshit
or fuck me out of money I steal on him like Winky Wright
Hit you with the left hook fast - you better check that hoe

If a nigga come at you like a lame or big slander your name
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe - if a nigga come at you in the club
Talkin 'bout a bitch that you supposed to fuck
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe - you and somebody put in half and half
And he come back at you with twenty-five percent; then
you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe - if you get played for a bird and some herb
All you got is your balls and your word
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe",Check That Hoe,2005

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only

I'm riding home in pain again, baby
But that don't mean shit to you
You're currently engaged
In an intimate conversation
With a young groupie or two
They say ""Players only love you
When they're playing games""
Still, I gave my heart to you
I should have stayed away
Like my friends all told me to

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only

See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow
Make me sing real high
When he goes down low
But see, it ain't just a physical thing
He's gotta treat me affectionately
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust
Just like every other motherfucker does
Is this just an impossible dream, baby
Too elusive to pursue
It's been such a sad and windy road for me
Just searchin' for the truth

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only

And I'm dishin' out N's

Baller, havin' bitter conversations 
While we're rollin' on 24's 
And I know you got doubts 
Why you listen to what people talk about
You ain't figured out why they call ya 
The heavy steady hatin' cause 
You rollin' on 24's 
See how your money flows
You dress in designer clothes 
From head to the toe
You ain't satisfied, well tell me 
What you lookin' for

I'm lookin' for my one and only

Well, I'll be your one and only 
If you give me a chance
I'll make the change for you, girl 
I know I ain't been the most faithful 
Nigga in the world
But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls
Spittin it to ya while I roll a shisha of fire
To kiss your lips, I desire
Twist and Mariah, together like a 
Grip on the tire 

I'm lookin' for my one and only

Well, come on Shorty, let me make it better 
We can do whatever 
While we're sittin' on suede and leather 
Thinkin' through the city 
While we rollin' lonely 
Let's kick it in the Chi
I know I messed up with ya, I ain't gon' lie
I know you were feelin' 
You really know your guy 
But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high 
Let me pick the pieces up 
And put them back together cause I want to be with you 
Don't want to leave you lonely
Ride with you like a homey, never, no phony
Shorty, can I be your one and only

Uhh
Hold up
Comin' down
Hold up
Smoke somethin'

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Lately he been flippin' and, stayin' on the grind
Tellin' you that you fine, but he ain't spendin' no time
I be pourin' wine, tryin' to, knock out your spine
Make you mine, from behind, to some slowed down ""Bump n' Grind""
His thang like a dirty Sweet, from off the street
My thang like a O' of indo, from Sacramento
Lately y'all been monkeyin', he, call you a bitch
Keep me all up in yo' shit, try'na dig you a new ditch
Now I admit, that he rich, and that his money is good
Got my dicked sucked in his 'Six, I'm fuckin' on leather and wood
I'm just a yougin' from the hood, with some dick if ya good
With him, you know that you shouldn't
With me, you know that you should
Go pussy thug, like a glove when I push and I shove
Knock a dime out the climb, cause I ain't makin' love
See yo' man the type of guy, to get jealous and hit'cha
But me, I lick ya where he don't, and suck real hard on yo' nipple
My game is sharp as a cicle, she love my pickle
And if you gave her a dime, nigga she gave me a nickel
So while you thinkin', she done jet, she got my dick on her mind
Keep on neglectin' yo' gal, young Pimp C be spendin' yo' time
Time

[Chorus]
Is'a playa
Is'a mack
I love gettin to this ladies
But not more than these paper stacks
Now rule one, get your cash on m.o.b.
Keep paper in my pocket my nigga p.i.m.p
Don't hate me major
Just hate the game
The only reason your woman diggin' me 
Is cause I play with things
Don't take it personal my nigga
I dont love I'ma playa
She just gon' keep me company
While I get lifted and I lay her

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well naturally, I have to be, dead serious, maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

[Chorus]

(Verse 3, Twista]
Did you ever think about who's ass ya girl's was
Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me
I'm the Twista, I flame a ho pissy drunk and drippy
Damn skippy, gamin' it from a shot of Mississippi, now pimp on

Twista,"I've been waiting my life, and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why, it's just impossible, It's I'm-poss-ible
And you know that
(I don't wanna hear that bull shit, I wanna hear that official shit)
(Kanye and that Twista shit, that's so impossible to get it (it's just impossible))
(Get it, that's so impossible to get it)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible))

Ain't no way you could pull up to the party in a Bentley blowing be in a club like this (oh no)
Ain't no way you could cook up in the studio with Kanye and get it jukking in the club like this 
Ain't no way that you could win, dust some haters off while I'm sipping on my 'hen,
Holla at a chick while she sippin on her gin
And I got the mobsters hollering at her friends, (its impossible)
For you to ever be the nicest; you ain't get gangsta or get righteous,
You ain't never stood on a tip like this, you ain't never stood for no shit like this 
(Its just impossible)
For you to get it if you don't wanna win; so get up off ya ass
And go for yours
And never for mine
Now you ain't from the ride that I'm in
Know what I'm
Saying

It's impossible for you to ever get wit me because of how I ride on the track;
Got the bitch in the back of the billy yo? When my celeb
Used to have the bitch in the back of the Cadillac (it's just impossible)
Niggas always hating
Leaving me for wiling out for po kim
You be sitting back talking yo shit
I can't help but I see you tho, I don't get it (Its impossible)
Lil mama, for you to fit all that up in a pants, moving kinda wilder
Turn a regular jeans in a low riders
Tell me can I be your man (its just impossible)
For you to ever deny, that I'm about chi-town
Represent the city with the deal for 12 years and sell a couple a mil and still hold it down, That's possible

Get it, bundled up and, lit it, smoke a lil' blunt don't, admit it
Do it like I did too late, I did it
The controversy can't worse me man, I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and
Thirsty what is you saying
I gotta a duel with a couple niggas that's Thursday man
Why the hell is I'm worrying, hopping out the Benz with the perfect 10
Man your life must be perfect man, look at how they came up with the perfect plan
Its impossible
Got strip clubs playing gosspital
Girl so sick in the hospital
You know I jumped out like pakadu
I only break it down I when I rock wit you
Since Michael Jackson made rock wit you
I done did shit on logical
Maybe cause we did the impossible
Maybe we done did the impossible

No matter what I do, see I been waiting all my, waiting all my life, yeah, 
And I know I stayed on my grind, I know I stayed on my grind,
Its impossible for me to fail baby, I gotta keep on moving, 
Gotta keep on moving, its impossible

Tryin' to get up in your mind in your body your spirit 
Take your soul

Let me creep in your world 
Let me see the backside of your moon 
No Vickies only La Perl-a
Let me take you to Indonesia 
Where nobody can reach us

Baby let me be your tour guide 
I'm your burger 
You my fries 

Run through sets 
Come through sets 
Chicks hypnotized by my 1, 2 steps 
I'm way too fresh 
So complex 
Niggas try to predict what I'm gonna do next 
Let's get the party started 
Far from a motherfuckin' starving artist 
Got something to prove 
Don't talk it, walk it
My niggas outside on them walkie talkies 
Pop that trunk 
Pass that dutch 
Let's get crunk 
Baby don't play dumb 
Baby don't say none
It's on me 
Louie 13 and the Cris on me

And I flat up a sac on strap on the Cadillac and the glove 
Could call me when you start shit with the ambassador of New York and the queen of the Chi 
And I'm backing her up 
Flow be ugly but it's a beautiful thing 
Aluminum rings 
Get money like I'm moving dem thangs
I got connects in every section 
When I'm up in the hood 
Chain looking so nasty all the bitches going uhhh 
Heard they wanna get me 
But I got my guns cocked 
I'm dirty ridin thirty somethin' cocked like Yung Joc 
I'm the talk of the town 
Lettin' off fifty rounds 
Meet me in a circle everybody it's goin down 
Give you Hpnotiq to get you erotic 
And then I take you somewhere exotic 
Where we can blow chronic 
A full clip for a lil drama 
You know I ain't a hoe 
Snap yo bitch 
Come here lil mama you know you wanna go 

I'm from the city wit nothing pretty 
And everybody know 
I spit a flow to get up with Diddy 
And now we finna blow 
Niggas in the hood show me love 
I'm the girl 
Pimp tight let my mink hang down to the floor 
Pardon me if I gotta be a boss bitch 
I don't give a fuck what it cost bitch 
I floss big whips

Cause I'm got big thangs 
Now what you wanna do 
You betta not step 
Now nigga move back

Twista,"Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to (hell)
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

I swear to God I just want to (slit) my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm (dead), a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe (suicide's) on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

I reach my peak, I can't speak,
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' [echoes]",Hold Ya Head,2006

Twista,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got

Where them niggas carry chrome and the best die
Where we push up in the corners that we fight for
City from the shores breeds gangsters and Vice Lords
Bustin' pistols while we runnin' from the five-oh
Hit the adversaries up because we drive slow

Oh I'm a killa mayne, standin' on these corners
Hustlin' for my denim mayne, and if you try to move
Soon as I hear one shot
I'm a let the tec and desert eagle ride non-stop
If I have to I'll commit a murder just to maintain
Tell me what you thought I'm from a city where they gang bang
And I got that thang thang

When I'm in the 100's you can always smell the scent of purple
These niggas always gettin' money in they inner circle
Fuck with 'em they fin' to hurt you; gotta get they cash on
Necessary evil they quick to put the mask on
Then they gotta put the mash on; steady bustin' at each other
I take a tool and bust my strap and scream out ""Free my brother~!""
Bitch-ass motherfuckers; I'm about to break 'em out
If they hit me before they get me I'm a take 'em out
If we successful we gon' smoke a blunt and cruise home
Introduce him to his new Charger with no shoes on
'Til the haters move on
Fin' to set up shop now, gotsta hold the block down
Gettin' paper make me feel like (la-da-da-dah-dee)

[Chorus]

Now let me take you to the motherfuckin' projects
Where the true thugs, and the elite members of the mob at
Know somebody; better call them out or try to tell them later
When they tell you ""Where you from"" when they catch you on the elevator
The fiends lurkin', niggas serve in pissy hallways
Can't say shit cause they be gettin' money all day

Mercedes parked out front, chilli'n with a hat cocked to the left
In the ride with the glock cocked smokin' a blunt
300Z with the Lamborghini do's and some hoes with a big ol' project booty
And the beat kinda hot but the cops wanna come
To hold the work he got that duty
So they can't do nothin' to me
Seventh flo' with the 'dro now, nineteenth flo' by the rocks now
Gettin' paper make me feel like (la-da-da-dah-dee)

Twista,"Monica, Twista, Twista, you already know

It's the 17th, one week before the day you were born
I been makin' big plans just for over a month
Tryin' to make this the best birthday you ever had
Show you that you're my baby

Damn, all this strain got me feelin' somethin's wrong
Pulled up to my gate, they keep sayin', ?He's gone?
Found envelopes in between my door
Biggest day got me panickin', what the hell this letter gonna read?

Hell no, you say you don't want it no more
Hell no, you say you can't give me what I want
Hell no, how you just gonna leave
When I stayed wit you through hard times and you cheated?

Hell no, I hate to say it but I need it
Hell no, God, please talk to me
Hell no, your so called love was so deep when it told you
You should run far and not give a damn about me

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home

Now I need you, wanna laugh, wanna stand
Wanna get just one more chance just to see you
All my friends, all my kin say, ?Mo, just let that end?
But I breath you

In the driveway, I found pictures on the ground of our first date
I never in a million years thought this would be me
I'm trapped in love with somebody that no longer thinks
I'm somebody special, look at me

Hell no, you say you don't want it no more
Hell no, you say you can't give me what I want
Hell no, how you just gonna leave
When I stayed wit you through hard times and you cheated?

Hell no, I hate to say it but I need it
Hell no, God, please talk to me
Hell no, your so called love was so deep that it told you
You should run far and not give a damn about me

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home?
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home?

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home?

Monica and Twista, y'all

I remember when you said I couldn't get none of that
Then I remember when you let me hit it from the back
I remember we was young and sprung
And steady talkin' on the phone and how we both kept runnin' back

To each other, we were always together forever to the end
I don't really know why I froze up
Plannin' for a weddin' but gettin' married, it's scary
Now I got you cryin' 'cause a nigga didn't show up
Can't really tell you why but I'm Twista from the Chi
And I'm dyin' inside 'cause I know I really want you

So for leavin' one day, I will have to give you the answer, girl
But right now, I can't tell you why I left, girl
Sweet personality and good sex, girl
Fear will take a man life, you suppose to be my wife
Goodbye, hope to see you in the next world

You was all up under me, actin' like you was so in love
I was talkin' 'bout you but thug nigga, what you runnin' for?
Cop wit you in the Benz, you the first one seen on the block wit it
Took you to the club, showed you how to 'Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It'

You was bold when you wanna get some of that
When you wanna hit the hole like a running back
Then you left, now you wanna come runnin' back
Hell no, nigga, I don't wanna hear none of that

I know you quick, betta spit that shit to so
All I ever wanna say to you is
How could you leave me when you?
How could you leave me when you?

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home?
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home?

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home?

All the women I caught you with
Still I didn't leave but I didn't forget
All those women I caught you with
Maybe I didn't leave but I didn't forget

But I didn't leave but I didn't forget

I didn't leave but I didn't forget

[Chorus]
Hey
Motherfuckers acting like they don't know me but they know just who I am
I'm a motherfucking killer gorilla nigga
You better act like you understand
'cause I'm a killer
A masked murder
The realest nigga that you ever heard of
Motherfuckers acting like they don't know the deal
But they know just what to do
Everybody's talking on the streets so you know that I'm coming straight for you
'cause I'm a killer
A masked murder
The realest nigga that you ever heard of

Try to play a nigga and get over on the twister
I'm gonna see you when I see you and I wouldn't wanna be you
Got the Desert Eagle and I'm rollin' in a regal
When I'm looking at you evil through the eye of a needle
Not a misdemeanor but a murder with a millimeter
Feel the heat of twister when I'm busting at your whip
I became a burglar-er when I'm coming for your shit
I'm gonna get you for your goods when I run up in your crib
Tell me where your jewelry at
Where you're safe (where you're safe?)
Don't make me have to smack this ugly bitch in her face (shut up bitch)
Is it behind the portrait or is it in your floor? (uh huh)
Just let me so that I can hit it up 'cause I got to go
'cause I got up on it so hit a lick on them niggas 
'cause it use to be if I gotta get 'em I'm gonna get 'em
Never ride a burgundy Lamborghini Masialago through the city 
Because I know that'll kill 'em
Averaging a hundred yards a game
My competition better back up I'm the key running back
Niggas that ain't ready get the machete for the lyrical chase in the rap 
I'm gonna keep coming back

[Chorus]

The lyrical assassin
A mack and it gotta be attack on a track if I gotta pack the cheddar good
T a legendary representer for the city
'cause I put it down every since I been rapping for the hood
17 years I go and I flow on the show on these niggas 
When it comes to beating me nobody could
I been spittin' venom every since the days U-G-K 
Been rapping and talking about putting diamonds on the wood
Rolling in a old Cadillac before I got some flames
I done got that gwap got a little More slot now I ride a range
Maybe 'cause I spit that crack is the reason we got some change
And if we ain't making money off rap then we got them things
Got the 8 dollar hollas 2 for 15
And 4 when I split the 9 piece so you can get the whole brick
How about when I was making a hundred every summer
Pulling up in the hummer can make a nigga so sick
I would constantly come up with hits and steady be getting fed 
Just only because a nigga flow sick
So there's no debate everybody know I'm great
Any mother fucker that hate can suck my dick

Don't want to see you wit no pistols

Don't want to see you wit no pistols
If you ain't ready to roll, niggard

Don't want to see you wit that four five unless you gone ride
If I say you gone die, motherfucker, I get so live
But you be procrastinating
I think you fucking play wit pistols 'cause they're fascinating

You motherfuckers ain't gone do nothing When you get through fronting
Niggas that I know already know you ain't gone shot nothing
End up at the pearly gates when they test you
Got a dirty face but what you know about a 38 special, shit

And I know them hard words make you jump
But ya heart worth when you make the moss barb pump, bitch
And them shorties looking at you like a punk bitch
'Cause you ain't make what you claim ain't gon bump click

And my pry when you hear them bullets bumping
When them shorties come and ride on em
When the pistols click clack

If you still alive will you really get the dumping
If you got that 45 on you
Tell them bitches get back

Once upon a time in the chi
There were three real killers who bust guns and puff fi
They copped weight by the key and backed up every gram
And stay ready for busting wit the pistol in they hand

I'm preaching murder like a vicious reverend
About niggas who claim they shooting but neva seen three 57's
Now what reason would you hold it fa
Put the pistol down, nigga, pick that weed up, roll it up

Twist up the lie, you don't really won die
Don't ya blood clot lying, ya bullets don't fly
V style aim smooth like Vidal Sason
I keep the smith and Weston wit me like I'm black moon

Tossed up the living room, stomped through the kitchen
Knocked off that nigga in the bathroom shitting and pissing
What you shaking for, I taught you said you ready to ride
Don't be coming wit me if you said you strapped because I

You fucking wit a shooter quick to bloody ya suit up
My aim impeccable, point like a decibel
300 foot away in a tower snipping the festival

What you know about 9's
And glock 40's and 45's are 15's wit the 5 pound slide
30 shot clips snub, noses wit the rubber grips
Wicked tex would put the kiss of death on ya lovers lips

It's M.O.B nigga , we quick to squeeze, nigga
AK-47's making them bitches retrieve, nigga
Like a G nigga, I make 'em bleed, nigga
Come at me wrong and I'm busting that's on my seed, nigga

My poor chest is filled of bullets and tec's
Ski mask gloves and vets so nigga what's next, nigga
It's real tugging you a bitch to the bone
If you ain't gone do nothing, shorty, leave them pistols alone

Don't want to see you wit no pistols

It's Twista come this way, c'mon, we gotta creep fast, c'mon

Watch as I hit it through the middle of the city in a Chevy
And I'm ready with the woofers that'll flip your block
And I got the tick and a machete for the niggas actin' petty
Get to talkin' an' I'm a heat up your block
If you wanna bring your boys
Better bring the toys
Better bring the noise
I'm a pump both up with ammunition
Bodies I be hittin' when I get to spittin' everybody
Shoulda broke and ain't nobody listen so now I

Roll and 24s when I'm on your tip
They don't know who I am ain't no body talkin' shit
Tell me when did they ever think that I was a hoe
'Cause I got killas with me, Crips, Bloods, G's and folks

And we be focused on the paper when we be up in the kitchen
When we thinkin' about the money on the steady come up and I got the niggas
That be ready for whatever with a whole war chest if a nigga run up
AK 47, Desert Eagle, SK, Mac 11 for the niggas that'll try to run up
Nigga what ya want I'm a bone thug get you while your sleeping

Quit the playin' nigga and get over on the Twista I'm a see you when I see you
And I wouldn't want to be you
Got the desert eagle
When I'm rollin' in the regal
And I'm lookin' at you evil
Through the eye of a needle
Not a misdemeanor
But a murder with a millimeter
Feel the heat of Twista when I'm bustin' at your whip
I get a burglar when I be comin' for your shit
I'm a get you for your goods when I run up in your crib

Tell me where your jewelry at
Where your safe
Don't make me have to smack this ugly bitch in her face
Is it behind the portrait or is it
In your floor just let me know so that I can hit it up
'Cause I gots to go
'Cause I gotta throw it so I had to lick on them niggas
'Cause it used to be that if I had to hit 'em I'ma get 'em
Never ride a burgundy Lamborghini Murcielago through the city
Because I know that'll kill 'em
Averagin' a 100 yards a game
My competition' better back up

Niggas that ain't ready get the machete
For the lyrical Jason of rap i'ma keep comin' back

I'm a killer, a mass murda, the realest nigga that you ever heard of

The lyrical assassin the pocket I got in
I be attackin' the track
And I got a package of the good
See a legendary representa for the city
'Cause I put it down ever since I been rappin' in the hood
17 years of goin' and flowin'
And showin' these niggas when it come to beatin' me nobody could
I was spittin' venom ever sense the days U-G-K been rappin'
And talkin' about puttin' diamonds on the wood

Pullin up in a old Cadillac before I got some thangs
And I got that gwap and the numba one spot now I ride a range
And because I spit that crack is the reason we got some change
And if we ain't makin' money off rap then we got them thangs

Got the 8 dollar hollas two for 15's
A 4 and a split a nine piece so you can hit the whole brick
How I win it by makin' a 100 every summer
Pullin' up in the hummer can make a nigga so sick
How we constantly come up with hits and steady be gettin' fans
Is only because a nigga flows sick
Showin' no debate everybody know I'm great
Any muthafuckers that hate can suck my dick

Motherfuckers actin' like they don't know me
But they know just who I am, I'm a motherfuckin' killa gorilla nigga

Twista,"[Chorus: x2]
I ain't that nigga
I jus' thought I'd let chu kno
When I'm rollin with a black Fo' Fo'
I ain't that nigga.

Nah I ain't a gangsta, but kick it with board members and governors that love larry hoover.
Niggas that'll do ya, Crackin a rifile over deciple have ya mama screamin' out (holla-lu-ya).
And No I ain't a Vice Lord, But I kick it with niggas that bang that shit to tha left.
C-V-L love tha BL, them thug folks that love low, down with my click to tha death.
And naw I ain't Black P Stone, but when I was getting production with Villain we was chillin'.
South side, Swole brothas, who long ass braids, who real niggas stackin' millions to tha ceilin'.
And naw I ain't a soul, but got into it with dollar and rocked pink with jack Vo Vo.
Knew all them niggas when my raps flow so slow, befo' I was ridin black benzes on black Mo Mo's.
And I got plenty of friends and relatives that still be all up in tha mix.
Out chere up in tha streets', well fuck this rap shit nigga, I got guns you ain't gonna do shit.
I ain't gonna be frontin' an fakin' and actin' petite all in my music, not uh, that's too lame.
When it's on it's on, I pop a nigga, when you gone you gone, 
You finna be wiped of the earth like a memory, What's dude name?

And naw I ain't a killa, But I'll stank a motherfucker while I'm hooded if he pull it.
Make a nigga bite tha bullet, hit em
With tha chrome cause I got tah show it's on to tha fullest.
And naw I ain't chief, But I'm a motherfuckin' beast when it comes tha runnin' in tha streets.
Ain't been on it in a minute cause a nigga getting money when I do it's cause a nigga gotta eat.
And naw I ain't solid but I got tha up most respect fo' a nigga if he holla it.
Or if he ride unda tha six I know he be tha shit to tha real g's, I gotta pay homed.
And naw I ain't hard, but on god I'll push a niggas shit back and leave em scard.
Get tha inferred beam then go steal em N steam em, stank a nigga then go put tha car in my garage.
I spit crack you gotta pardon my berauge, uh lyrics I'm throwin' is countin' tha vesauge.
Tha thieves wanna be thugs tryna put on fo tha streets, 
Some beats but ain't got heart up in tha mind.
Quit lying you metamorphicly speakin' motha fuckas 
Don't want it with real niggas that's out chere.
Give a description of hellava gun but you don't wanna really feel it 
From real triggas that's out chere.
(cause it's out chere)

[Chorus: x2]

Naw I ain't a playa, but in my city all tha bitches holla at me like I'm tha mayor.
Devistatin' while I'm say-uh, but if you wanna make it bigger than words I gotta spray her.
And naw I ain't a pimp, but peel a hoe fo' a fimp and I walk with a limp.
While I be smokin' on the hemp and at tha party bitches sayin' look at him look at him.
And naw I ain't no mark or no coward, come at me you gonna get yo lil' heart devoured.
We don't buckle easy tah threats we be comin' after next for techs for sex, money, and power.
Been doin' tha Bid fo' so long that everybody around us talk shit.
Can't do nothin but hate off tha money we make, 
If we don't come up off of rappin' we comin' up off bricks
You lil' soft Bitch!

Twista,"Kell's and Twist' uh
Girl, it ain't no other way to describe you
Your momma raised you right
Yeah, I like that, it's like

Sittin' here in love rehab, I'm so crazy about you, dear
Doctor of my soul, I will never check out of here
Filled my prescription when I came to you and needed peace
You took me in and gave me joy and, girl, now I'm free
You are my circle, when I needed to talk you had my back
You my homie we go back, thank you for your love rehab

Doin' bad, ain't nobody in my life
I'ma kill a nigga or somebody gon' murder me soon
I'm a hope fiend, I need a woman in my life
Could you take me to the emergency room?

I need somebody that can nurse me back to health
'Cause I'm out here lovesick, shakin' like Pookie
You took me up outta the hoopty
Put me in the Lex 300 and got me blowin' on dookie

Now why do I respect ya, 'cause she down for a nigga
Before I was rollin' city to city
She got me screamin' out ""Yes Sir"", like I'm Pretty Ricky
Lookin' freaky, freaky while I'm smokin' on the sticky-icky

When I'm down and out, you be rubbin' my back
Because I miss you, you know I got issues
When I'm ridin' dirty and I got the thumper
And the law pull me over you will hold my pistol

Sick of how the women harm on me, you charmin' me
In the pharmacy of love, body be right I wanna hit you
You like a veteran when I need some medicine
You better than Exederin, fellas in trouble that wanna get you

I thought I knew what real love was till I met you
I'm reminiscin' on the love we had
I'ma stay sick forever hope I never get well
'Cause you got me in a love rehab

Sittin' here in love rehab, I'm so crazy about you, dear
Doctor of my soul, I will never check out of here
Filled my prescription when I came to you and needed peace
You took me in and gave me joy and, girl, now I'm free
You are my circle, when I needed to talk you had my back
You my homie we go back, thank you for your love rehab

So many problems, so many people, so many decisions
So many roads that I have to choose, yeah
But still I'll roll the dice and pray that I don't lose
There were times that I got weak, fell short
I couldn't go on and she came through

So many friends, so many liars, so many haters
Sometimes I just don't know who to trust
But yet and still I turn the wheel of life and try my luck
There was a time when I was broke, didn't have a job
And this woman, she showed me love

Oh, since we first met, I've been risin' like an escalator
Now five years later, we have come up like an elevator
You made me better, babe, when I thought I was goin' crazy
I was just about to lose my mind, then you put me in your love rehab

Sittin' here in love rehab, I'm so crazy about you, dear
Doctor of my soul, I will never check out of here
Filled my prescription when I came to you and needed peace
You took me in and gave me joy and, girl, now I'm free
You are my circle, when I needed to talk you had my back
You my homie we go back, thank you for your love rehab

If I hit it I'ma spit that love flow
Forget what they all say
She the only one that helped me
Hit her with a little bit of 12 Play

When the Twista wasn't proper sippin' Vodka
I could remember tellin' the love Doctor ""I need some help""
Through the fire like I'm shocker, love it every time I rock her
Cock a pistol when I think I bleed to death

My surgeon and my methodome
The only one I talk to when I'm left alone
You the one that helped me fight through my challenges
Tell me what's my psychoanalysis

I thought I knew what real love was till I met you
I'm reminiscin' on the love we had
I'ma stay sick forever, hope I never get well
'Cause you got me in a love rehab

Sittin' here in love rehab, I'm so crazy about you, dear
Doctor of my soul, I will never check out of here
Filled my prescription when I came to you and needed peace
You took me in and gave me joy and, girl, now I'm free
You are my circle, when I needed to talk you had my back
You my homie we go back, thank you for your love rehab

Uh, Kell's and Twist
Gotta let her know that she the only reason
We make it through sometime
That's why we sittin' here in love rehab

Twista,"[Chorus:]
Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll nigga(put down that 45)
Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll nigga(gotta let that 40 ride)
Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll nigga (let's do a homicide)
Don't ever wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll nigga

Don't wanna see you with that 45 unless you gon' ride
If I say you gon' die motherfucker I get so loud
What you be procrastinating I think you fuck around with pistols cause they fascinating
You motherfuckers ain't gon' do nothing
When you get through frontin' niggas out here already know that you ain't gon' shoot nothing
End up at the pearly gates when they test you
Gotta dirty face but what you know about a 30 ain't special shit
And I know them hard words make you jump up with your? when you got the mosburg pump bitch
And the shortys lookin' at you like a punk bitch
Cause you ain't making what you claim ain't gon' dump click
You gon cry when you hear them bullets dumping when them shortys come and ride on you
(when the pistol click clack)
If you still alive will you really get the dumpin' if you got that 45 on you?

[Chorus]

Once upon a time in the sha there was three real killas who bust guns and puff fire
They cut weight by the key and baggin' every gram
Instead? bustin' with the pistol in they hand
I'm preachin' murder like a vicious reverend
About niggas who claim they shootin' but they never seen 357s
Now what reason would you hold it up
Put that pistol down nigga pick that weed up roll it up
Twista up the light you don't really won die
Stop your blood clot crying
Your bullets don't fly
? aim smooth? I keep that Smith and Wesson with me like I'm black moon
Toss up the living room storm through the kitchen
I caught that nigga in the bathroom shittin' and pissin'
What you shakin' for I thought you said you ready to ride
Don't be coming with me if you ain't strapped because I

[Chorus]

I keep a p95 nine milli rugger
You fuckin' with a shooter
Quick to bloody your suit up
My aim impeccable point like a decibel
300 feet away in a tower snipin' a festival
What you know about 9's and glock 40's
And 45's see our 15's with the 5 pound slide
Thirty shot clips snub noses with the rubber grips
Wicked techs that'll put the kiss of death on your lover's lips
? we get the squeeze nigga
Ak-47s make them bitches retreat nigga
Like a g nigga
I make em bleed nigga
? I'm bustin' that's on my c nigga
My war chest is filled with ballers and techs
Ski masks gloves and vests so nigga what's next nigga
It's real thuggin' you a bitch to the bone
If you ain't go through nothin' shorty leave them pistols alone

Buck buck, my guns fire horror
A lil' money you better wire momma because I am diabolical
To your life I say sayanora
Better call God or hire Allah, cause nigga I am lava
Flow out the volcano to burn the village
These cooking utensils ain't given to you boy you gotta earn the skillet
When it come to a cap you gotta learn to peel it
When it come to a track you gotta learn to feel it
when it's your turn to kill it
Musical masturbation I'm feelin' myself, I'm deadly and mannish
But I still'll leave you and your buddy damaged
Freakin' on the tracks so nasty that you can't understand it
'Til you see me sippin' dollars and eatin' a money sandwich
And the new Jag be lookin' so splendid
But I can't re-cop it 'til you get finished, it's been three days nigga
Give me mine, you know I gots to get paid nigga
Don't you know the consequences of fuckin' with a made nigga?

Rocks on my wrist make me feel like the Italian Stallion
I don't do much but every piece cost at least five digits
Just use it as inspiration and say, ""He got it so I gotta get it""

If a heffer got a fatty then I gotta hit it
If it's princess cut then I gotta get it
Handcuffs on the wrists, ain't nobody out here fuckin' with Twist'
I be flowin' so you gotta feel it

But let me slow it back up
So you can hear what I'm spittin'
They call me Cocky Balboa
I'm Rocky, come and look at how I glisten

Even without it my aura make me get my shine on
It's just a reward to myself for gettin' my grind on

My swagger up in these stones got me feelin' like Rocky
When I pull up to the party in the all white Maserati
It feels so good when I know
That I got 'em diamonds that'll fuck up everybody's

Don't hate 'cause I got that there, don't trip on how I do it dude
Different color rocks on every side of the Rubik's Cube
My jewelry's screamin' loud, so I stay cool and mellow
How many colors you got in that watch?
Black and white and blue and yellow

Hundred karats on the iPod, hundred karats on the Gucci link
In the club talkin' shit like I don't know that my dookie stink
White tee or the fuchsia mink, dependin' on the weather
You wanna take it or compete with me
Then we can do whatever 'cause my

It's a motherfuckin' shame how my earlobes hang
From them knockers and a bracelet
On my wrist flick, flick, flick, flick, flick

Watch so cold, they say they lookin' at the time
On the wrist tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
It's the reason I could pull up on a thick chick
So fine and her ass so thick thick

I told her, ""Let me be your manager
On the red carpet while the camera flick, flick, flick
I could put some diamonds on them arms and have you lookin' better""
She looked at me like Elena, pulled her sleeves back and said her

Been in the game since Brand Nubian was spittin', reign of the tec'
I done spit lyrics for DJ Jam Master Jay and Kid Capri
Now it's DJ Drama, now you all on the dick lil' mama?
Where the fuck was you at when a nigga was on the block? (where you at?)
When the nigga was drivin' dirty Nike's with no knot (where you at?)
Before the Billboard number one spot
It was so hard to get a bitch to get down and suck on a cock
Before rockin' the Bentley and I got so popular
Thuggin' with the G.D.'s you wouldn't see me even with binoculars
Steady actin' like you ain't been ran through
Never gave a nigga no pussy now you sweatin' and talkin' 'bout you a fan too
Before the Vin houses and the trucks and Impalas
Tell me where was you at when the nigga needed a couple of dollars
I remember her off the block, now I can't fuck with lil' mama
Walk off on that hoe, I'd rather let another bitch holla

Spend the rest of the life in the trap bein' grimy (oh yeah)
On the grind tryin' to stay out the county (oh)
Limit ties when I ain't had no money (oh yeah)

Cause underneath all the cars and clothes (cars and clothes)
The lights, the bling, and oh
Oh oh oh, diamonds and gold
Underneath all the diamonds still cold, yeah

Bitches used to say ""ugh,"" now I got pull
My life like Ace, from ""Paid in Full""
Low like a turtle, my queen mad fertile
Run a marathon, same time, jumpin' hurdles
Put a broad on a plane, brick in her girdle
Why I'm still here, got my life in gear
Fuckin' a rich white bitch like Britney Spears
Runnin' in her hard like a car hit a deer
Live life no fear, boxed in like a square
Two Coronas with lime, sip my beer
My vision's so clear from the front to the rear
That's why I'm reclined in a La-Z-Boy chair
Can't see me like I'm air, but I'm there
Mean I'm here, like Ray Lewis or Steve McNair
Real Hall-of-Famer, real big gamer
Semi-automatic or a four-fifth flamer, blaow!

It's a blessin' to be still in the game
Considerin' where I came from the music changed
Some would continue to hang
I'm, right where I oughta be
Whatever obstacle in the way, won't let it bother me
Grindin' since the early teens in my dirty jeans
Now I'm on the scene fulfillin' my worldly dreams
So get yours, I'll get mine in due time
We'll be able to survive some lunatic rhymes
But nowadays you gotta find different ways
To keep your pockets on fat, who got it? Where it's at?
Shit, you gotta go get it
The road you gotta hit it, the show money's splitted
Yeah, and if everybody wit it we can make somethin' happen
With the push of these buttons and some cut-cuttin' and scratchin'
I've been rappin for years, and I think I'm gonna
Sang or do anything other than slang on the corners
I'm gone

And let me get another victim again, gain-gain-gain-gain
Whether they don't gimme any Henn' or befriend them, when they say I was
But I been right here 'cause, you know what it is, you know what it was

Blowin Cali to the haters, oh what a pity
When they hit a nigga, Twista rockin city after city
They gon' ask, ""Is he doin it with Bizzy?""
And you know why they done that (why?)
Because we two of the coldest motherfuckers
To spit these fast lyrics on one track
Buck 'em with a lyrical bullet in the body
Because I gotta get the fire know the shit don't stop
Pull up in a Lamborghini or the Ferrari
I know I gotta get the props, cause I gotta get the drop
Gotta get the dough and get the money money
I could really feel it when I hear they comin for me
Try to get it if you think you feelin kinda lucky
Twin glocks so you know you better bring a buddy
And I got the ammunition for anybody
That wanna go against the Midwest Militia
A whole clip at the competition for Bizzy
A whole clip at the competition for Twista
A whole clip at the world, because it's us against

For static, I'ma hit 'em with an automatic

How 'bout everyone livin in harmony, look at the army now

We dancin our way to the gates, if you comin with me we'll need every Muslim
We human, we're all in the brethren
Veteran deep in the city I pity the fool who jump out of this fake
What do I look like massagin the thought
When they come with the matrix and say that we 'fraid
We'll never break, 'member that conny and Twista
We're gonna go through the fire
Never expire, give it the way that they want it
They'll front on you if you tired (what about)
Money you tell me what's money to you, pay for the rappers and corporates
The office that burn wood, but the burn good and the brain wave
Puts the energy certainly, I don't have time for emergencies
Baby the word and we walk with the covenant
Party and poppin the melody baby, I know that the ladies be lovin it
Brush the dust, enemies way, get 'em a drink, we look too lovely

Never disrespect a Legit Balla when on the scene
Oh wee I rip shit like velcro

Fuck up the punk that step up got the umm next nigga screamin' ""Oh No""

Hustle mode is if the cocaine cook good and different methods on how to cut that dough
Had to ? because it used to be cool you trusted him and now you gotta go to court
Cause he gave you the money and when he drove off he called you and told you he was short
That?s some shit that could?ve got you killed listen to it when the rap tunes real
Put the bitch on the plane with a couple of pounds that you can't smell cause its vacuum sealed
Take off a quarter then smoke in order they choke I cut it open they collapse from the scent
Pop it all off for 600 an ounce I?m get to smoke for free and get back what I spent

Moving them hips, ride me ever so slowly, 
Actin' so grown and sexy you know what I wanna see
I like to watch your body move 
When your ridin' on top, on top ,on top, on top eh

Look how they move like jelly man
You know I gotta get a shock wit a steady can
You can have a brother coming out the pelly pants
If I gotta keep em looking at the way you belly dance
She got a cute portfolio, fast like a Nascar that she drove before
Because I can tell by the way she ride that stick, 
That she ride that dick like a rodeo eh
On top while I'm huggin' them thighs, 
And you know I like looking at what I do see,
I'm tryin' to hit it from the bottom but she told me 
To be real still cause she wanna do me
Like a gangster when I touch her
Thought I was rough but she was rougher
She cut me, I didn't cut her
We tradin' places like Usher
Because drop to the floor then Eisa
Come rock my boat like Aaliyah
If u can grind on me like Shakira
Well u on top then I just might see ya
He don't really know the way you can work
He said he ain't hit it good while he was at you
But you be givin' me the vision of a freak 
So I gotta lay back I wanna see what that do girl

Come and slide with the twist if you ain't got class (class)
How you doing? And I knew that you was ready 
When I saw how the fatty lookin' in the black pants (black pants)
I and you know that I know that I be good 
When you be on top of me giving me a lap dance (lap dance)
You move your body like a choreographer 
I would lay down and watch if I got that chance (that chance)
I would be all on you, with an apology, that I would be better
But I'm lovin' the way she rockin' me
Possibly I could open the odyssey from a good to bottom, let her get on top of me
I knew that she was a little bumped when she got in the truck
I wanna hit after sippin' the yack in the club
I love the way the booty look when she backin' it up
Come with me and lets get buck in the back of the bus
A good time if want that there with me
Give it to me cause I gotta get that there
New po is here go in sip that there 
Then pop this here let me hit that there

When you be see'n me would it be better if we was hollin' on the phone
They tellin' me you got a problem, if its a cancer
Baby the twista got tha cure that can solve it I got the answer
Too many guys, too many guns
Plenty muscle when I hustle
You think a nigga was takin' enhancers
We need to holla and get it resolved like gentlemen
Because if we don't I got thumpers that turn niggas feminine
I'm a pursue when I pop it to'em they're goin to be choppin'
And screwin' as if I swallowed a bottle of benalyn
I'm a just goin' to end up and dumpin' if we just don't holla bout somethin'
Because you just might makin a plot to come murder me
Oh, your word to be, open heart surgery
Yeah you got a white t but I'm a be turnin' motherfucker burgundy
I think there's a better way that we can handle this
So sit down and talk at the table, we got to be adamant
Takin' a ride, and choppin' it up in the phantom
As two niggas breakin' it down like an analyst off the with cannabis

Now how will I ever be knowin' about when struggles arrive
If you don't be open enough to let me see inside

But since he's been incarcerated his spirit has died
He's sittin' off up in the county while he goin' be fightin' a case
I'm seein' the pain cause I'm lookin' him right in his face
Never got caught off for pushin' a bird
Now he goin' be lookin' and thirty for murder
Even though he ain't on the tape
Soon as he got locked up I had to visit him early
The truth was the homies and none of those niggas was worthy
He gave me my game and told me how bitches'll burn me
Damn, I want to kill off the district attorney
The loser aka the prosecutor was a steady accuser
Of my boy as bein' around as the number one shooter
They sayin' that the evidence is a rugger, a steady pursuer
What it do and make you disappear like the Bermuda triangle
Why dangle a weapon in front of the court that I know he won't use
Now you in deep shit
Now I just gotta go pay off my lawyer's retainer
Homie gonna have a better defense
And I know that you ain't really feel like talkin' about it
You want your freedom and just to put it past you

Still a player know you got it
When you climbin' from the bottom
To the top of that pole

Your fatty's so accurate
When I'm smackin' it

An entrepreneur with ways to get more money
So don't be trippin' whenever you see me throw money
Haha it's just a little bit of show money
But if you want me to get it wet another ways
Then I'ma have to beat it up the first time I play with you girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play with your pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play with you pearl?
When I lay you down you ain't gotta be frontin' or fakin'
On me baby cause I know it takes the right touch
I ain't stoppin' til you wet up the covers
Because I gotta keep on fuckin' til I see a lot of white stuff
Now you got me excited I can't hold it
I'm feelin' it coming I'm bout to let off an explosion
Let it ride when I see you I'm ? and shakin'
When I touch your body you catchin' convulsions

She blew the whistle like *whistle* be still
Hold it in now roll it in
She lifted her pumps to hold my face
Because she want me to control my pace
She said she wanna feel it all
Slidin through the wiffles of the walls 
'Cause the feelin was too cold to wait.

West side ain't it mayne, put some flame to the maryjane,
Down with the same thang with main in the left lane, peep game.
Put the duck in the ash tray, got on the freeway,
Sprayed a lil' cologne on the car seats then I gotta up wit' big d and six freaks,
They was thick as hell, you understand me? I was sippin' on patron about to fade out,
Got up wit lil' ma, had the whole lick layed out.
Put the Gucci on the door seat.
Countin' some mo G's, the dice game damn near broke me.
So I'm callin' fo' mo G's and putting a pound of weed and four b's,
My thumper and my door keys, 
Walked up like she know me I gotta keep it moving 'cause she prolly be the police.
So I, got turned tough told her to meet me in the range rove we ain't gettin' money
So I gotta go and change clothes bumped out wit the same hoes,

Who the one that saw the body wit the booty of a Maserati 
While I'm in the party way back in the club.
You be kinda reminding me of my gee princess, so I gotta say majesty when I say that.
And when I see the way the fatty lookin' from way back, 
You be kinda reminding me of a Maybach.
You be the type I know I mite kiss, and if I flow it right I know I'm so righteous.
And if you wanna try and get as lyrical like the twist
You gotta flow li-li-li-li like this.
So now I'ma go to the back, get a cup fill it up wit the drank when I mack on a hoe.
Triple it up cause wen I get out I wanna cut 
'Cause I'm twist and I'ma kick that spectacular flow.

Like a gangster when I touch her
Thought I was rough but she was rougher
She cut me, I didn't cut her
We tradin' places like Usher
Drop to the floorer then Eisa
Common rock my boat like Aaliyah
If you can grind on me like Shakira
Well you on top then I just might see ya

Possibly I could be up in the oddesy 
For my good the bottom be when I let her get on top of me

I wanna hit it after sippin the yak in the cup,
I like the way the booty look when she backing it up, 
Come wit me and lets get buck in the back of the bus
A good time are u wit that there, come and give it to me cause I gotta get that there.
New boat was here, gone sip that there, then pop this ere let me hit that there

Women freakin me greedy lickin me doin body graffiti

Two players in the Chi, you're thinkin Do Or Die

The style of flow is a vocal calico 

to show you with the mic I be speakin love, what's the words, weak and

I ball cause I see you all on Rap-a-Lot

So I see if I can have a fruit 

a peep show like the hoe when she thinkin bout me havin you 

She laughin too, and pass a few, beads around 

Smokin trees till the leaves come down 

She be clothed ain't a skeezer now, show em the paper 

that be caught up at your crib with your pantses down 

But money maker want a triple take 

Look at the nigga with the endless dividends of heavyweight 

See him ridin in the see-A, D-I, double-L, A-see 

always checkin paper in tall ways 

Pull em off the sprawlways 

Herd a couple hoes in clothes and I'm supposed to be all day

Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O 

Verse Four: Nard 

Now for some typical reason I'm rollin up with a hoe 

and I'm pattin my back seat 

I pimp lyrical tactics like a dirty kid flippin on a mat 

never could I come flexless, when I wreck shit 

Then be dip through the Chi and enjoy my Lexus 

Better blow when you bob your head, to the fed shit 

Why you waitin for the next kid, motherfucker 

makin money just wanted to take a little get the dick wet 

Get my girl in bed 

Spend my money in the Southern, motherfuckers 

that's thuggerin, but I'ma come from the heart for start 

to stop all the niggaz the bigger the trigger the larger the dividends 

Pimpin and paperin leavin sugar in 

Till money flow like a dreamland 

But really though, could you tell me how the money flow? 

Chorus: 

Don't you know, how the money flow

And in the morning the sun don't seem to shine

You know they say (they say) that its all gonna end some day

Let's make love (let's make love)

Are we really that close to Armageddon 
If living on the planet 'till this point has been hell 
I survived 'cause I am legend 
What if it's all about to be over 
Then I'm gonna say you need to be my girlfriend 
Hit the blunt after the world in the dim 
Then you can get it in like the world fixin' to end 
It's predicted by the ancient Mayan civilization 
I don't want to see the world go soon 
But with such a beautiful girl in the room 
I want to be up in you when the world go boom 
Get down with your body 'till it's lights out 
Making love 'till the terminator come 
Global warming is having a major effect 
Comfort each other but we don't know which way to run 

Mother Earth is about to go to another cycle 
And I know that is about to end someday (someday) 

Right before it does (right before it does)

Tomorrow it's all about to be over 
So I only live to serve ya 
The dark is about to devour the Earth 
So come and ride with the Silver Surfer 
Now will it all in from the element 
Of ether or artificial intelligence 
As long as we both have the passion 
The sex it just makes all the issues irrelevant 

I know it's all about to go 
So I just sit back and blow my dro' 
(Right before it does) 
Steady looking at the clock, 
Before we suffer let me make your body rock 
Having sex 'till the big bomb drops 
Or 'till the planet go pop

Twista,"I'm about to take everybody back to the basics
I'm historical an oracle event is about to occur
Because a motherfucker put these raps in the matrix
And I'm a terror when I spit it on tracks full of hatred
But there's beauty in the dark, just put it in yo mouth
And the flows like hmm, like that when you taste it
Commin' at niggas like a disciple of death, you would think
I'm poppin' a rifle or tech, I'm aimin' right for the neck
Yo' momma might as well call up the funeral home so she can
Right em' a check, a vile of dialect. That's why they feelin' me
A trilogy, a horror is what I become so they call me Jason Vorhee
Oops I mean chasin' more cheese, niggas gotta pay some more fees
Hot enough to brake a thermometer from another planet I kill em'
From here to Andromeda, astronomer because I'm out of the galaxy
Challenge me I will disintegrate yo' body like a particle
Follow you into a corridor at 4 in the mornin' so I can horrify you
Rite before I slaughter you. My boys sayin' they don't think I'm comin'
So you know a nigga gotta get em' all. Then Ima' be murderin' em'
Like a serial killer then Ima hide em' in the sealing and the wall
Fuck em' all. Niggas will never get next to this
I rock a rollie so I flex the wrist. Ima blow up and sit in yo' place
Then through up shit in yo' place like the exorcist
You can't mess with this

Now let's take shit back to the basics
How we used to do shit
With the original sound but still 
Somehow comin' with that new shit

Talk about the way there ain't no morals or respect in the streets no more
Don't pause with the heat no more
Cause there really ain't nothin' out here to eat no more

Now a days niggas actin' like they lovin' the dime, used to be some respect
But now they just kill em' and stack em' 
'cause Benjamin Franklin the governer now
Theoretically you better be ahead of everybody around you 
'cause a nigga might fuck you
Don't need to be nothin' but killers in yo' family 
That always surround you 'cause a nigga might touch you
Since the recession It's been hard on the streets
So a nigga comin' hard on the beats, no order in the hood
I remember when niggas would get into it, 
They would have to take problems to chief
Now they don't give a fuck who they be shootin' 
Or who they be robbin' or what you ride
All they really care about is you got that
And if you let one of these knuckle headed bitches
Know you sittin' on somethin', motherfuckers guna' be at that

It's those south side murderers
It's them west side killas'

Up north and over east is a beast
What they release be leavin' you desceased
Fuck up anybody that try to do damage
The block is the planet and shorty is too buck
For there to be peace, so I carry a piece
But I don't wana' shoot cuz' I already wana'
See some of my niggas locked up in jail home
Instead of hollerin' at em' on a cell phone
R.I.P cuz' my lil' brother Rel' gone
We need to find another way to get it instead of always
Being on the attack full of hatred
Or get smacked in the face with the reality of death
If we don't get back to the basics

You look like you want to be in this movie
So don't be acting like a trippin' with a stranger mission (stranger mission)
Recording you while you lovin' me down below
Switching the camera angle when we change positions
You could be the director aiming the camera down at me
Feeling me licking and do you say cuh
Ready for any footage you wanna get

Kissing right down to her stomach and then I'ma
Tell her we could be in Russian cinema

I let you hold the camera first and then I hold it then
'Cause I wanna see how its coming out and goin' in
Let you see such a freakin' me, I hope to step on your team this is fifty world star or CNN
Baby girl you kick the world off the axis
I'm no director, filming you for practice
And you know I think you a hell of a actress
Especially when I'm shooting you on a mattress
Shanty straight to the top that's where we headed
And I'ma see my name in the credits
And be the shit if you let it
See somethin' that you not really feelin
Then we can always go back and make an edit
I'll be sippin' on patron platinum
She knew about the rapping
But didn't know I'd be on acting
Our personal reality show
So there, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh ohh)

Now even through you're not so classy, you see... when I talk so nasty
And I love it when you tell your secret to telly cause you take it out so sassy
Look how I touch you when I spike that juice, mmm, do you like that boob?
And I got up in the strawberry's a whip cream, cause I be loving the way you wipe that fruit

And I go down and lick it at the crime,.. you don't know how to act
So does... and you be waiting, nobody be sweating but your heart be racing
... time's a crime, but you're trying to exercise your patience
Then I pull up the acupuncture looking... while I'm acting...

Twista,"[Chorus: x2]
Twista been comin' with fast lyrics for year, 
I'm glad to see niggas catch up to speed
But when I come to doin' a intricate pattern I bet you 
Y'all can never fuck with me (no way)
Cause when it come to this music, 
I am a Mobsta', I am a chief
And when it come to this rap shit 
Then I am a monster, I am a beast

Never let negative energy interfere with this
I be from the Outer Limits and I devour to men to haters 
That intend to annihilate what I put together 
They don't want to do what I got out from a military 
And they want to push and then fire my lyricist 
I would murder 'em with the dialect of an apostle 
I'm apocalyptic and I can kick it whichever way you wanna hear it 
Ain't no tellin' who I'ma kill and bury 
How can you fuck with a nigga willin' to kill 'em all 
With the ability to body and brigade a motherfuckers that come 
With the ruckus screw who any that's out of me 
Whoever strategy you will try to initiate 
Theoretically I'm decipher that's infinite 
In other words I'm a molto I came through with polo 
And one day I'ma go back and tell'em how them niggas 
That hate on me cause I kept a circle and no will not affiliate 
Ain't no impossible nigga I go the whole yard
Ain't no law with my continuum my minimum is forever 
And ever nigga so whatever you wanna do it 
Don't really matter to me lets handle it right now
What happen to goin' and pullin' nigga hoe card 
Fuck all the thuggin on the internet 
Cause I'm not into that I'm on a higher intellect 
And I don't wanna catch a murder cause I know 
That it's possible that you might die

[Chorus: x2]

Now they be tellin' me Twista come with the hard shit
I don't wanna disappoint 'em so I gotta get it in 
And kill 'em with every syllable after syllable 
Like a gorilla do when I beat 'em at a physical 
I be knowin' the way I spit it be God's gift
Cause I'm feelin so fab, when I fuck a nigga up,
And send immaculate conception of something 
And more than one the proportion of the distortion is biblical 
Like Isaiah Deuteronomy and Leviticus
I be a lyrical prophet I'm a disciple with a rifle 
When like John the Baptist, 
My raps is a revelation of the genesis of ya down fall
I'm a playa you should follow me cause I'm infamous
And my flow is off the chain, I be rappin' about something holy 
Then I talk about your body being cut up in pieces, 
Out on the premises when they found y'all 
You gotta give me the status of being a legend
In my continuum what I be givin' 'em be killin' 'em in everybody 
Feelin' 'em I'm colder than December I'm a symbol 
And I make 'em remember my emblem 
I hit you with the automatic and see you in heaven 
Committed a verbal murder we heard the surgery wasn't a success
When you was in the hospital so if I ever get charged, 
I hope that I'ma get the minimum

[Chorus: x2]

[Repeat: x2]
Now there'll be no killing of Twista cause I'm omnipotent 
But most of them niggas just hate on me cause I flow different 
Like the way that I spit it once I get in a niggas ass

Twista,"This is the trip
The best part I, really really like
Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number
Ayo, Kali, kill 'em

Kali baby
Know we claim we insane seeing Strange do the same thing
Drain the main vein on mainstream they plain janes
Tell 'em wake it off, tell 'em knock it off, (mane, mane)
Tell if they penciling pick em off (Like the primetime)
Coming out the middle is the reason we done took so long
Give 'em this just a little when they d-do it to my song
I'mma make you do a song, sick it to you a song
Fluents keep movin in the middle with pillows they chewing on
Other rappers ain't compatible, they be fallible
If you wanna challenge me with a battle we better saddle up
I work for battlers,seal it by pittlin pattilin
Tittling tattling rattle them 'till they had enough
And like old liquor,kali can speak easy,be breezy
And if I lick her,kali can freak easy,your breezy
Little shitter and like in P.E. O-N-C's
And if they different than me
Then they can be eat me in season
Ah uh, I'm ripping my mouth off
And the niggas that mouth off
I'm taking they top off
I'm the dope, and you are the drop-off
My niggas are not soft, ignorants pop off, hot sauce
I'm coming from the planet of Barbie
When niggas are niggas are awfully, I feel like keeping my car keys
Spreadin that spark, and pick up a clip in a heartbeat
Sit in the star seat, then I'm getting back to killing 'em softly
Why you gotta do it on me on the c-c-choppers when I did it in the beginning
I hit it on it,just the type of me to show 'em im a c-c-c-c
Just put put em in a blender and hit it on it
See they be shaking the fact
Put a snake into the record for the sake of the bat
Uh,maybe stare at ya act
Put the safety from rabies,and maybe that they never had
That Krizz cray
Better yet,call me Kali baby
Really will deliver it in any kind of way
I slow it down for it to be easier to say
Totally awesome dude
I'm a predator and you're awesome food
It's better than when I was offin you
From up here there's a pretty damn awesome view
And a moment of silence, we just lost a few
Ah uh, bring that back now

[Chorus]
You already know the outcome
How 'bout turnin up the volume
And watch me kill shit
You already know what I'm talking 'bout
If you don't understand the words that's coming out my mouth
Then watch me kill shit

Twista! They call me Mr. Malevolent
With a style to show that I'm another pistol that's elegant
Kaliko to cut the throat of me no patrollin me
Nickin every syllable that's strong enough to lift up an elephant
I consist that you're as soft as a moccasin
I can send niggas at you and have em take away your oxygen
I could then murder you in another dimension
Of diabolical proportions as I find a portal and lock them in
Eat the key up then re-up I'm gone
See the way that I re-up a G up, I'm on
Now I'mma hang my feet up from reeboks, it's on
Niggas this ain't a game put your wii up, I'm grown
I'm general militia and you be feelin every person
Though everybody can spit it but we still a very
Packin so much artillery we are like a military
And no tellin how many bodies we bout kill and bury
Gimme the block then I'mma ball
Because I be tippin
Spending the money when I'm in the mall like tryna be different
Different kinda clothes
Other kinda shoes
When the hoes see the swag they be askin if they can come and kick it
Shorty what you talkin bout just get your homies and come with it I'm over here Gettin drunk up the limousine
Now I got a drunken fast flow
But it don't matter I can still blow the whole party to smithereens
Splittin' words in the middle like kali-
Ko we Killin em cause you put together a team
As if you were Pat Riley
Cus ain't nobody compara-
Ble to us if you want it then you know what it means
Twista!

[Chorus]

Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay A. Yates
You don’t know the handle then you’re a day late
Death and destruction it is they fate
Because when I get up on a track, it'll be like wait
Sick em deliver, get to flipping
You be the victim and I’mma pick em off
Fix em with a quick, and I’mma knock division off of niggas
No living giving or igging on the rigorous
Look at this, will somebody look at this
I be killing em
Put up or shut up, get up be cut up
It's animosity
Foot in ya gut up, bullet for colors
I’m an atrocity, wicked
I went around, arrange one off, I rip it
I’d rather be red and ready then running with the rigits
Don’t be stupid, if you got a minute better run away
You better jump im slumping you cause
Never gonna put the gun away
You better back up off of me or get it
Admit it, I’m killing off everybody and then it
Acquitted
And we knocking, he stopping
Never can beat the cleverness
She joshing, me cocking
Coming to get the head of the Chula
I shoot her because lots a Gouda
That dude'll be foolery, because I socked the ruler
Ay yay yay yay yay yay
Yank em, when he thinking he better then Nina
I gotta spank em, shank em with the thang
For thinking that we'll come & give up the game
We hang the really bane in my sanctum
They don’t really wanna see me
Tecca Nina eating your whole supper like Ziti
When I get to going, I smoke a nigga like a beady
I’m leaving em all dead lips blacker than Miss Sealy

[Chorus]",Kill Shit,2012
Twista,"I'm humble because I know what it feels like
To be at the bottom and have nobody
No fans, no nothing, nobody believing in you
Now look at me

I was down on the ground with nobody
Some in my town said my sound was a hobby
Now that I'm crowned they're astounded and oddly
They try and come around now I'm somebody

Middle finger in the air with a hope and a prayer, I started this
Never had no money then my daughter hit
That was a get-up-and-hustle-nigga starter kit
Hard to spit, bars to get, at stars when it's, not marketed
You're far from it, dark and your partner quit
Really barking, you wishing for the spark to get heart in your art a bit
But they doubted me cause I'm nothing like 'em, never knew how to be
Stylistically foul, and he’s proud to be wild and he's
Thinking now is time to get the crowd shouting
Now people found him, it's, ""Wow, peep his salary""
Way back when I was feeling defeated
When inspiration, motivation was needed
At the pace to be great, I've exceeded
All of your expectations, you fakers can eat it!
This my world, this my game
All the wicked shit is coming out of my brain
This is my girl, music is my dame
If you can get it I'ma keep it P.I., mane
Why not share the pie? Scared that I
Would get the people liking me and wouldn't dare to buy your shit
Try to told ya before that my flow sick
Milli sold on the road with my whole clique
Everybody listen in to witness, Tech's whirlwind
In the club with MGK, thick sex twirlin'
Fought to the top, never did stop, now we got it, it's ""Fuck the world"" then
The haters in the past on my ass wanna come around like my ex-girlfriends

(Oh!), for the block I (Go)
For that spot I (Go), to the top I (Go)
Screamin' ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive, head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")
""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")

I remember thinking I would rather die
Than go through what I was going through when I was struggling to survive
Full of ambition and I’m ready to ride
No tragedy over triumph and I am a Lion I gotta try
Full of drama, I was feeling like a failure
Fiending for the industry again, I was living in disgust
Doing odd jobs
Everybody seeing me
Traveling to work, back in forth, on the bus
Yeah, I was fucked up
But I got it together for y’all
Spit venomous lyrics cause I was ready to ball
Started Po Pimpin’ on everybody and certain motherfuckers 
That want to get in my circle I tell 'em naw
Cause I got to get money up in my anatomy
Naturally, and I gotta be gradually happy to holla
At somebody when they speak and they might be on that bullshit
So sometimes it’s, fuck ‘em I don’t even botha
And who knows what’s next for three angels chasing dreams
Hailing from the Mid-West, as we spread our wings
All of us striving to surf over the summit
Creating us a vision that would be stunning
When we come to Earth and your city and do a show
You would get to see everybody from miles come running
Yelling for Machine Gun Kelly
And Tech N9ne and Twista get it in better bring something smelly
We could take it to another level
Wherever you wanna go, everybody put they hands up I’m ready
Come on and get wild let loose
Celebrate the fact that you made it and let me see you get buck
You done been through some shit
But you did it cause you had the heart to throw the middle finger up

(Oh!), for the block I (Go)
For that spot I (Go), to the top I (Go)
Screamin' ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive, head to the sky, middle finger up high

From the back streets
To the packed seats
On the block, running from the cops, like athletes
Whoever would've imagined lace up
Could've got me to the finish like track meets
And when everybody’s hot, I’m past heat
And if I don’t need the fuel, don’t gas me
It’s been a long time coming
Since 100 words and running
Mother fucker come catch me
And while these other rappers pen and pad it
I was 13, with a semi-automatic
Anything we ever wanted then u know we gotta have it
Don’t nobody ever snitch, get pinched? You forget like magic
Kids carry tools like go-go gadget
Leaving high school to an open casket
Now another baby in the stomach of his baby’s mother 
Never’s gonna know his daddy
Tragic

Why’s the government gotta lie to get money?
Why’s the federal reserve gotta take from me?
Why we even fighting for another country?
Have u seen my city mother fucker we hungry!
Representing for the middle of the map 
Even though me and mine are coming from the bottom
Why do all greats fall when it isn't autumn?
Where would Pac be at if nobody would've shot him?
Do u really think the Notorious Big would believe these guys?
All these internet thugs that the the media finds
You wanna talk about grind
Look in encyclopedia what name is in it I bet u see mine
Mother fucker this Kells
Skinny boy six foot three
Heart bigger than an SUV
Lord knows I been through hell and back
Ducking jail and crack
And still I came out on t-o-p
This is for the kid who never had a father figure to depend on
Spending every school day being sent home
Feeling like he doesn't know anybody
Because the only thing he ever had on him was his headphones
So he picks a song
And he turns them on
Every morning just to get him through the day
Looking for an escape
In the kick in the bass
That’s the story of MGK

(Keep those) Eyes open, gotta keep ‘em open
Need a higher dose
Just something just a little more potent
My eyes open, gotta keep ‘em open
Need a higher dose
Just something just a little more potent

On the gas, saved up the bat, can’t forget where I came from
Same mistakes, that’s madness, you end up back in those same slums
Day one, my eyes was on that prize that I sized up
Now I supposed to check, I supposed to check, I found that for the white fuck
Cold care, beauty pies, steaming all the way that jury lane
Bad fuck behind that mask, bitch might have that booty face
I earned this and I be down, before they told you I be there
I let you in, you bit the hand, nigga that’s downright treason
My eyes out for that mischief, fuck that, fill clips
To the top, real rap, know that I just build this
Sweat, blood and tears, my brother died was the only time I shed tears
Then switched gears, pulled out of here like last year
Now everything gets smoothed, like jasmine, chinchilla
Puff so white, that’s Mac Miller, for some kind of wait then blast, nigga
Worry me that’s the good one, fear nothing, add ‘em
‘Round here ain’t no fab one, we knocks it without no flare gun

[Chorus: x2]

I stay down, I’m a chaos, havoc and mayhem
To be in the streets you gotta be a brave man
Talk about you coming up and do the main band
‘Cause ain’t no telling what these motherfuckers would do
Be prepared in case anybody fuck with the crew
They was in the club, watching, you was in the VIP
Throwing hundreds around like money ain’t nothing to you
They be the ones that fall back, up in the cut and probably in all black
Mean motherfuckers and they all strapped, looking you, acting like you was all that
Acting like you untouchable ‘cause you tripping till they catch you slipping
And then what you thought you’d see?
Better be on top of your chip when you walking through the shots
Same demo when you walk through Queens
Shorty like I doubt that, I got things and I’m ‘bout that
This hood life what it look like, probably snatched up still ain’t felt that
The game is better, it’s cold or vice versa depending on what you see, so
Learn when to check your ego, watch your people, money is evil
When you learn to keep your

[Chorus: x2]

Either with me or against me, there ain’t no in-betweens
Don’t walk around fearing no man when they bleed just like me
I represent that bad block, I’m mascot, is that real dope?
Roam around with that fuckery and get stomped out with them steel toes
Mashed up on that sidewalk, can’t go against that current
Taking turns whipping that ass, we gonna give respect that’s earned
And to whom it may concern, got a problem, be my guest
We will play fair but you will ‘cause you’re not keeping no death around
Keep those

I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug

I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it

Blowing O.G. has got me creating anti matter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga

Man, you probably couldn't get a ho any day
'Round my way can't get murder planned
Ain't no hoop, play dirty, man
Put some through your jersey, man
If your partner want some we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E G-A-N-G, yeah wait
Yeah, pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go ahead, Gaga

Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it, quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, your father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
If you've surveyed the way we've acted
Keep it coming, I'm coming around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

E'verbody want that money what you want
High as hell trying to have some fucking fun
You don't need 'em but the diamonds make it shine
Tried to kick it just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet events, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passing 'em freaks

Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money could never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating anti matter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably
A dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels n' drugs

Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money",Jewels N' Drugs,2013

And I love it when we argue cause eventually we make up

I remember when I used to bag up in the basement with her
With the attraction of a Michael Jackson swag, but in this case a thriller
And she was a wolf not in sheep's clothin', but a grey chinchilla
Even though I found another assassin nigga never be your replacement killer
When I got up in the goods kinda good to me
But I know that she don't put it down like you
Cut from the bottom when you up when you pop on top

I’m bumpin some crank and planking fucking her good
But then you go frontin'
Steady cutting with bitches all on me
Cause I'm with Joe Budden, but what ho wasn't
I'll put you in the category of somebody that give it to me good but rubs a niggas nerves
Individual and I'm never particular but Ill never be with her so I kick her to the curb
I got a new woman and though I be buildin' her up to be better than you
She fine but don't know how to throw it back

Reality of dreams, younger for memories of a still wonder
Of who I might be
And for her it’s hard to stomach what’s left behind
And what’s to come in the same introduction of a king
Just know everything coming can only give birth to the principle that by any means
I produce like eagles
Soar in the highest clouds to let my conscience free
So I can feed ex girls like sea gulls with better egos in out work
While these ambitions girl with the tip of my penis
To write stories, a young boy the genius
And I mean this, there’s never been a day off
Never been laid off, my own boss and my payoff is to get laid off

And with no hands she give me a hug
Go ahead and reverse it baby you pop it like a drug
Asking me how I feel when I'm inside your love
Better than the mall
In other words whenever I'm up in your hall
I feel the ripples on the wall
A spectacular feeling when I get up in them draws
And with no hands she can even give an applause
Cause you got me gone, all I can say is “True that”
Whenever I put the soap hole inside you at
Snug, but you can see its something you ain’t new at
Ooh, I can feel it when you do that
I can feel it when you do that, she got a nigga stuck
Murder with the pussy now you just been cut
She got the kush in her bush and I’mma take a puff

How I’m a breathe of fresh air, you been so bored lately
And how you like to be reassured by me telling you that you the one
And how it be mine and how I’m going crazy
You got a nigga caught up in it, every time I’m all up in it
Loving every minute, all I know is I don’t wanna finish

Blowing a blob before I go in the club
And I feel they wanna get my dick sucked
Look at the haters, I call on them
Get drunk and I fall on them
Lift up by my designer jeans
And my phone parts as I ball on them
Throw on a party get ratchet
Then I make a toast I hope it don't stop
Too many hoes I don't want no drama
Even though I got the toast I hope I don't pop
And I've got a bag of money, come and show me
That you work the crime up, all the way to the top
And when I drop it gonna twerk it
I'ma throw it and crush it and when it's over I take them all of that

And I murder for the squad like an outlaw

Plenty niggas I know pulling up with a Glock and a key
Acting like they winning the game
Like they pulling up at the top of the key

I am such a Mobsta

So come and bow down to royalty
Kiss both of my cheeks to show loyalty
The flow is ceremonial, the style of rituals so be cordial
And please act accordingly

This ain't a legend or folklore
Chi-raq violence is real, not a Cold War
But in the streets call it coke wars
And do not open your mouth unless you spoke for
Please Father forgive me
I had to give him two to the kidney
Didn't know that I was nice
Any night I perform like Rice, Jerry, Sidney
Ray too, hangin' out with Windy City gratefuls
In the back of the club we play pool
Only real niggas 'cause they cool
And who did bids and didn't snitch and stayed true
But now-a-days family come first
Shorties out here is gettin' killed over turf
Well if the meek shall inherit the earth
Tell me why I gotta know what a hundred bricks is worth?
Ah, flow so gorgeous
The coldest to ever touch a cordless
I'm on the streets Forbes List
And with the rhymes I'm divine like Osiris, Horace
It's a clash of the titans
Warriors on the street blastin' and fightin'
Seen it all, been a part of it all
Don't get it twisted if I'm on a different path when I'm writin'

Blowin' loud by the quarter
Conversations about what's up with a porter
We can sit down at the table, but first
You gotta kiss the pinky ring, it's according to the order

My niggas show me how much to cut it with
And what to do when the kitchen was the workplace
Bring the pot over the stove to a boil
Comin' out the crib smellin' like burnt paste
As the Lord is my witness
I done seen so many end up on the hitlist
Shootin' the car 'til it slow down
And now I see nothin' but lifeless, stiffness, hit this
Three-eighty in the headset
Bricks in the dashboard and the door panels
Give me the ball nigga, hand check
Niggas can't ball cause they got poor handles
So with a wave of the hand
I'ma gang green if I offer them work
Create a chain of command
Don't try to talk to me unless you talk to him first
In God we trust
And it ain't another Mob like us
Pocket full of eightballs on the bus
To undercovers I say what's up in the truck
Whole team full of bravado
Gettin' money since niggas that wore Movado
Rollin' in a Cadillac El Dorado
Bubble Lexus or the all-black Tahoe
Why?

And I'mma come with the style, most of 'em like, then, most of 'em bite
Whether they go write it down, or spit it then, they, move a device
Niggas could never compete, they lesser than me, I'm, destined to be
Run the Midwest and the reason the lesson'll be, one of the best in the streets
Takin' a lesson from me cause I'm wreckin' the beat, a molecular special MC
If you wanna take it and be, with knowledge of self, there's no better weapon than me
And I hope you got the kush, gimme the woods, cause, I gotta smoke
And if you don't got the dough, then it'll be, adios, I gotta go
Unless you got somethin' to say, look at the time, no, look at the mind
Don't think about what I'mma do if it ain't about money or you don't say nothin' divine
I'm ? that you in the way, I wanna get, that, power and guap'
Remember I used to get break, now I don't sleep, nope, now I don't stop

Hopin' that you would do so when you bring the attention your focus is critical
Snappin' like a Kodak'll be, hope you get the picture, now Twista you notice I beast
Don't flow after me, I'll eat 'em up and then say ""Bon appétit""
And it'll be so depressin' if I talk about everything that bother me
Millionaires livin' in the same country as people in poverty
So fuck you and your opinion, I'm on my own dominion
Street scriptures, hieroglyphics that ain't the book of the Gideons
An infinite era I'm in, travellin' through a multiverse
Keepin' it smooth, I tell a motherfucker come insult me first
Can I get ahead of us and I can see you be scared of us
And you be talkin' et cetera, et cetera, but everybody'll know what you spit is a replica
of what I do so I'mma just stay hot
And I be makin' the cash, and when she ask why I'm away a lot

Hey lover am I the only one 
Or are you selling your baby a dream 
(Am I who you thinkin' of who you thinkin' of) 
Hey lover boy am I the only one 
Or are you selling your baby a dream 
(Am I a sucker for love a sucker for love) 

Damn I'm trippin' 'cause I never really felt like this 
To me women used to be only fuck foxes 
But it's like with you I cherish every kiss 
I know it's a risk but you make me want to come clean 
I want to make you my queen 
Put you in a crib and give you plenty green 
To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams 
Only for your love I fiend 
'Cause the way you put it on me make me want to scream 
And fuck you in places you ain't never seen 
In a private boat as we float down stream 
Yeah I already know you done heard this before 
But the way you make me feel is real 
Playas don't love no hoes but stayin' true like you do 
Got me head over heals, so tell me what's the deal, baby 
'Cause you lookin' too fine to not be mine 
And I ain't gon' never be satisfied 
Unless you're on my side to the end of time 
I can tell you think I'm lying 
But I swear to you girl this ain't no scheme 
You stay on my mind, even in my sleep 
You keep a nigga havin' wet dreams, on the real

From the first time I met ya, you was on my mind all night 
A Maybelene queen with a body too tight 
Wearin' black and white and some brand new Mike's 
Draped in ice, attitude nice 
You the type of woman that I need in my life 
To add a little spice, cookin' nigga steak and rice 
I can see you'd one day man and wife 
Walkin' down the aisle, havin' our first child 
Plus our marriage worth while 
With a brand new lifestyle, I could walk that mile 
But baby I need you right now 
In my arms caressin' me 
I can see your eyes undressing me 
Girl it's destiny and love is the recipe 
But this way's got the best of me 
On everything, I can guarantee you better things 
If you just get rid of ""what's his name"" 
And let me in your world 
So I can show you, baby, that my love is real and not a game 
So can a brother come through 
So I can show you, boo, just exactly what I mean 
It don't matter if you fuck me tonight or next month 
Babe, only time can reveal a dream

Baby I'll drink your bath water about a pint 
Think I'm ever gon' give your love away, uh-uh 
I ain't sayin' you never lovin' another nice stud but shit 
I'm cravin' you every night and we just met on a night 
But it seems like I've been knowin' you all my life 
Ain't it funny how you be thinkin' you never be true enough, but you the one 
A helpless seeks succumb, lovin' you more than everything 
But my dollars, ? and smokin' sticky up through the lungs 
I can see you havin' my sons, screamin' your name on my next tape deck 
In the city, no hear my pretty go 
Quick to break a 54, put you on my video 
Young and witty hoe, the only thing I'm feelin' pity for 
I don't know what I was frontin' on 
But I don't see nothin' wrong, sprung or gone 
My every heartbeat's weaker, follow the leader 
I promise I won't hurt you baby 
Don't feel the heatseaker 'cause we gon' be smokin' on sweet cheeba 
Take my boo to the mall and go shopping until we fall 
Get you the finest things like diamond rings 
Even though my mind is strain, I'm tryin' to change 
How we fuck and kiss and the hugging make me bind the pain 
No lying, no game, you gon' give me some, hey now, we freakin' up in the cut

Hey lover am I the only one 
Or are you selling your baby a dream 
(Am I who you thinkin' of who you thinkin' of) 
Hey lover boy am I the only one 
Or are you selling your baby a dream 
(Am I a sucker for love a sucker for love) 

Damn I'm trippin' 'cause I never really felt like this 
To me women used to be only fuck foxes 
But it's like with you I cherish every kiss 
I know it's a risk but you make me want to come clean 
I want to make you my queen 
Put you in a crib and give you plenty green 
To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams 
Only for your love I fiend 
'Cause the way you put it on me make me want to scream 
And fuck you in places you ain't never seen 
In a private boat as we float down stream 
Yeah I already know you done heard this before 
But the way you make me feel is real 
Playas don't love no hoes but stayin' true like you do 
Got me head over heals, so tell me what's the deal, baby 
'Cause you lookin' too fine to not be mine 
And I ain't gon' never be satisfied 
Unless you're on my side to the end of time 
I can tell you think I'm lying 
But I swear to you girl this ain't no scheme 
You stay on my mind, even in my sleep 
You keep a nigga havin' wet dreams, on the real

From the first time I met ya, you was on my mind all night 
A Maybelene queen with a body too tight 
Wearin' black and white and some brand new Mike's 
Draped in ice, attitude nice 
You the type of woman that I need in my life 
To add a little spice, cookin' nigga steak and rice 
I can see you'd one day man and wife 
Walkin' down the aisle, havin' our first child 
Plus our marriage worth while 
With a brand new lifestyle, I could walk that mile 
But baby I need you right now 
In my arms caressin' me 
I can see your eyes undressing me 
Girl it's destiny and love is the recipe 
But this way's got the best of me 
On everything, I can guarantee you better things 
If you just get rid of ""what's his name"" 
And let me in your world 
So I can show you, baby, that my love is real and not a game 
So can a brother come through 
So I can show you, boo, just exactly what I mean 
It don't matter if you fuck me tonight or next month 
Babe, only time can reveal a dream 

[Chorus: x2] 

Baby I'll drink your bath water about a pint 
Think I'm ever gon' give your love away, uh-uh 
I ain't sayin' you never lovin' another nice stud but shit 
I'm cravin' you every night and we just met on a night 
But it seems like I've been knowin' you all my life 
Ain't it funny how you be thinkin' you never be true enough, but you the one 
A helpless seeks succumb, lovin' you more than everything 
But my dollars, ? and smokin' sticky up through the lungs 
I can see you havin' my sons, screamin' your name on my next tape deck 
In the city, no hear my pretty go 
Quick to break a 54, put you on my video 
Young and witty hoe, the only thing I'm feelin' pity for 
I don't know what I was frontin' on 
But I don't see nothin' wrong, sprung or gone 
My every heartbeat's weaker, follow the leader 
I promise I won't hurt you baby 
Don't feel the heatseaker 'cause we gon' be smokin' on sweet cheeba 
Take my boo to the mall and go shopping until we fall 
Get you the finest things like diamond rings 
Even though my mind is strain, I'm tryin' to change 
How we fuck and kiss and the hugging make me bind the pain 
No lying, no game, you gon' give me some, hey now, we freakin' up in the cut

Smokin' reefa
Hm yeah

I woke up early Saturday morning sick off Rhemy and brews
Wit a hang over from blues
Hurl on my clothes and shoes stomach on wooz
From this killer weed that's so fired it made your nose bleed
I had me so high, my brain was fried movin' at slow speed
This thick bitch chose me and was stickin' like liquor
She look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like ""Dick her""
But wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken
I swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken
I remember wakin up at the flat fucked up in the back
Checkin on my weed and scratch I damn near fell out the lat
I hit the sack to sleep it off woke up woozy and still smoking
Twista's wishes thinking about last night and the bitch that was scopin'
Fuck it lets get 'em on I grabbed the phone ""Girl call your friends""
Then I hit Twista and Maze and them bout the bitch in the Benz
Nigga push only cause I see them already been in the block
You know the lit niggas you'll find us in my favorite spot

Sippin' on the duce duce OZ
And I be killin' me how many thick fees I see
Getting bubbly waitin' for Stokes and T, I spit a little game at three
Tryin' to talk up on the shoppin' spree
Or a be	 of that stinky green free
Straight getting, to puff puff pass 
and drive up my gas hittin' all the hot blocks
Bumpin' ""Legit Ballers"" to ""Rock y'all Spot""
Everybody know the shit 'bout to drop
See from Northbound to Ten Row in it go tryin' to get they props
Pollutin' the air wit squares, blunts, and tops
Settin' up shops for lots comin' back nots
Each and everyday of the week 
the Mobsta Elites be on somebody porch dumpin' heat
Bustin' flows in the cipher getting deep 
While we cheat something sweet to Legendary beats
'Till we reached our peak
Scummy aloud attractin' crowds to the street
Then it's time to retreat grab something to eat
And head to the late front to get up wit some freaks
Wit a treat under the seat
For the cats who get the sudden urge and want to try to jack
Cause when your pockets is fat
It seems like all the haters and hood-rats want to attack
And when the park close we hit the liquor store 
for a box of Sitches and a fifth of Yak
South on the corner and get a few sacks 
Or betta yet the whole pack so we can get back

One morning I
Woke up next to a chocolate fee and a red bone 
My dick was hard I started stroking and poking
After toppin' I tell them to role the blunt
Cause on the front I hear them niggas steady smoking and jokin'
I heard it's gonna be hot outside gotta get up and lay my clothes out
It's gonna be too many hoes out 
Before my ladies rolled out I got 'em to clean up the whole house
Then I threw my fit on look in the mirror get on gone
""Nigga you looking dope because you got a knot""
Ain't no cruising up out the hop 
I'm hangin' by the spot cause I had to put the Lexus off up in the shop
But it's all to good it's a hood thang 
Never too bogus notice the love on the block that nigga coolin'
Aiming the radio out the window steady grooving
Tip by the corner store wit the indo steady movin'
Niggas who flippin' new 98's is steady cruising 
Bumpin' up the block flossin' for the chicks cause they rich
But I ain't leavin' off the front with the blunt 
Set a switch just to pull in all the thickest bitches
At the crib I can't get caught wit heat
If it's some static I shall chalk and sweep
I go and get the B's up off but chief
""Come get me if the phone for me I'm at the party across the street""
I'm enjoying the breeze high degrees and no ease
Pockets be full of G's smoking B's hiding the fees
Making no enemies the po P's yellin' out ""Freeze""
Serving niggas wit ease staking cheese so nigga please
Tell me 'bout some ghetto love

Here she comes with them big legs, no fat on the back 
What's up shorty, can we kick it tonight and choke on the sack 
Come see as I foreplay, freaky at this slow-ass track

Campaignin' your nation, in a legit demonstration
And gotta face incarceration
Eh yo, Liffy Stokes, let 'em know what's happenin'

A nigga been hustlin' so long, God knows I've done so much wrong
I was 16 grown and holdin' chrome, servin' blows, we in' zones
My mom didn't understand me ""Boy, you gon' die just like your daddy
from two to the head, dumped in the riverbed
I didn't to hurt you so badly,"" I was young and dumb
Fast life sprung of the money and hoes that it brung
Had a clip full of hollows to bring your momma sorrow
But now regret what I've done
Drama's all in the game whether gang bang or slang
I had to do my thang
When the shots rang, that's when it clicks in my brain
All the shit's the same
My nigga need a change, I had to get off out these streets
To get you out your seat
Flip a Trax beat, hit the crib and puff on a sweet
And let 'em feel something deep
Deep so the realest can feel
How I felt right before I bust that steel
Rappin 'bout my life of skrill
And the everyday struggles of a nigga in the chill

Chi shot-callers (Shot up the chrome and let's swang)
Tigers all up in the wall

 take a match and spark up a little bud and get blown away)

This shit I've been tokin' is potent
Got me straight thinkin' about takin' Mary Jane and eloping
Blowin' smoke with the sunroof half-way opened
Countercode with the scope in close range
I guess he gotta aim, and stick a few thangs in the nigga's brain
No face straps ? thinkin' that he can
Puttin' food on table is an everyday strain
But now I did finally flip my shit legit
And workin' a different angle of the game
Even though my hussle ain't changed
I'm still prayin' my best presence to overcome my pain
Singin' tapes of cain
The roads to riches seems longer than the freight train
And every little stop keep a nigga tryin' to plot
On the paper you done gain until you drain
But I put that on the foe
I'ma flow 'til I got no choice, or better yet no voice
But still by that time I hope to write enough rhymes
To own a fleet real estate with a Rolce Royce
Rollin' deep through this Chi-Town streets
With my mobsta elites on the way to North Riverside Mall
Givin' thanks to the all for givin' me a legit where to ball at
Keepin' shit tight for y'all

On the bus in disgust will I able to throw rocks in my pocket
Nickel sacks in the other
For po-pos who watch, can't stop, it's hot
But I gotta make a profit for my baby and my mother
Straight up hustler
What's the mental frame of mind
That nigga had to have the roll
Be sold, or be poor up in these city streets
Or with the pistol playin' for you Mr. Reaper
Forgive those, I explode like see-4 so give me 50 feet
Bustin' shots in every directions 
a nigga stop a moment from getting made
I done witnessed public aid, people get sprayed, the tip raise
And momma cry, why my bills won't get paid
If I have to I'ma send cheese from blows
Nobody can hurt me or run thugsta greed, GD's or foes
Workin' the spot 'cause we need some clothes
Who ever thought I'd be making money off of my CD's and shows
My crib got gats in the hall, rats steady crawl
Roaches comin' out the cracks in the wall
On the tip, bust it with my back to the wall
Work my way up to an ounce, now I'm back to a ball
Now I fin to spend stacks at the mall
Bend the blocks on barbers hopin' my profits stack a bit taller

Go insane on em', guess he done wit that work range on em
Rain over, so nigga respect my mob like royalty
'Till I'm dead why'all hoes dred my love, life, and loyalty

[Twista]
When you come strapped in a circle
No I'm finna hurt you
Cause the mob put me peeped all of your loopholes
 Cause the trigger work you
Bust all of you bitches and all of you hoes
When the bruh come
Thugs betta run shit look at what thugs want
See what drugs done
When held the gun got you runnin from a loved one
Thought you was down to die but you been found to lie
So fuck you can't trust you, gotta bust you
Crush you now you can't lick hits and hustle
Try to flex your muscle 
But my criteria gotta over comes yo strategies
Try to make a mob out of peas
I can ride on you wit Money-T and an amount of cheese
Plus I had a lot of bud in 'em
I get mad at the budgin' 'em
Whippin out the stud in 'em
But I ain't even studying
If again and it's on I just put a slug in him
Duggin him dead and headin hoes off at the pass
Open up a can of kick ass
Toy wit me loyalty die quick blast

[Maze]
I roll wit straight mobsta leaners 
That always carry beamers 
And exercising trigger fingers on niggas who come between us
Shockin' the world wit young slingers
And we can't be defeated, even if you triple team us
Cause this game got my mod deranged if you in pain
Kamokaze like my nigga Lo if we loose to you man
So ready to aim cause it ain't shit to explain 
Shots to exchange plenty of paper in the game
To help us remain on top of the world until we go bang
Doin our thang while why'all niggas just hate and complain in vain
But it'ws still gonna be the same we gonna mob forever
And out shine all you bitch ass niggas together

[Chorus]",Loyalty,1998
Twista & the Speed Knot Mobstaz,"Yeah, mobsta style for you muthafuckas, you know what I'm sayin'
We fin to bring this shit like this here
This muthafuckin' Chi shit, check it out

[Chorus]
The niggas in my mob can't be touched
You best to mob up to come fuckin' with us, oh no
Niggas in my mob bring the heat
You best to mob up fuckin' with the elite, oh no

You just a bitch in the sky, I hear cries
'Cause you can't whistle for your guys
Surprise when you saw this pistols in your eyes
So I peal like mere mortals, bet I shoot bloody portals
To motherfuckers  who owe us, niggas die, causin' horrifyin' ?
My passion for blastin' made me an assassin on all enemies that work us
Whose purpose is to serve ? timbs 'til they high and they hurt us
Murders got us murders, I pull my weed and gun out
Blastin' 'til they run in the house while I got the blunt in my mouth

We in a rage bustin' rapidly like when I'm on stage
It don't get no rougher than Liffy Stokes, Twista and Mayz
In the blood of your day, then lay flat on your back
Then while he fuckin' your hoe
The mob gon' be straight coppin' you stack

Your mob lacks, I'm a defeat you run three-two on contact
Cogniac, get me strapped with the black gat itchin' to bomb back
Hoes can't get no sleep
Bullets hit your chin for the grief that you bring us
Shots hit his face as he grabs his chest
Then we watch him bleed through his fingers
Now come on, come all, but if all come all fall, fuck all y'all
We road dawgs, then I come gunnin', niggas runnin' like they sold y'all
In the heat of the night, the ? static we start up
Guards up, while we come strapped they come ready to mob up

[Chorus]

If it's static, one of my niggas gon' get two niggas
Two of my niggas gon' get four niggas
Four of my niggas gon' get more niggas
That's more triggers meaning more killers
You motherfuckers better mob up

[Chorus]

If it's static, one of my niggas gon' get two niggas
Two of my niggas gon' get four niggas
Four of my niggas gon' get more niggas
That's more triggers meaning more killers
You motherfuckers better mob up

It's a static, it's automatic, so grab the automatics
And pumps and pull the triggers and make some niggas look acrobatic
I was cold but frantic, the foes have panicked
They got bloods blew out their dome, bet the bullets run rapid
I kept bustin' for the love of hustlin' squeezin' my wesson
Ruger, gang ? maneuvers, niggas want to be bruisers but I'm a shooter
Fuck the squad, because when it's said and done
Liffy Stokes will do some poppin'

Nigga the devil's knockin' at your fuckin' door
With some hot ones and toe
And ready to hit 'em with nothin' less than four
Nigga let me go, I'm 'bout to pop this bitch
You know you know the lick, art of the mobsta click
Fuck the argument, mob elite's runnin' up apartments
Kickin' in doors pistol whippin' hoes be heartless
Searches as the bullets marches between your arches
Make one call and wait and reload the cartridge

[Chorus]

If it's static, one of my niggas gon' get two niggas
Two of my niggas gon' get four niggas
Four of my niggas gon' get more niggas
That's more triggers meaning more killers
You motherfuckers better mob up

[Chorus]

If it's static, one of my niggas gon' get two niggas
Two of my niggas gon' get four niggas
Four of my niggas gon' get more niggas
That's more triggers meaning more killers
You motherfuckers better mob up

You can't even mess with a mobsta, nigga, is you sick in the head
I torture that ass and have you overdosing on lead
Or maybe I just leave you cut up, drippin' and dead
With your crew skippin' town scared, my lead gon' lead their ass red
Don't get misled, don't mistake me for somebody but a soldier
The elite niggas got more death than AIDS and ebola
Getting old and colder
I be quick to ? start uppin' but that chip off your muthafuckin' shoulder

Behold the stack folder, gun holder, AKA blunt roller
Mayz if I die for you get your ? and trap holder
To hurt particular niggas comin' with perpendicular figures
Crushin' triggers, y'all niggas better bring back some memos

It really don't matter if that nigga pack a glock or a gauge
'Cause whatever the fuck Mayz blaze gon' make him see his last day
Takin' 'em out, my life and makin' sure his cast stays
Jack 'em for his last days, that's how livin' fast pay
Nigga, you know the word on the street
It's the mobsta elite that's servin' the streets to the rockin' these beats
You better have a nice way to greet us than rolling with your guys
And you could still die in a multiple homicide

[Chorus]

If it's static, one of my niggas gon' get two niggas
Two of my niggas gon' get four niggas
Four of my niggas gon' get more niggas
That's more triggers meaning more killers
You motherfuckers better mob up

[Chorus]

If it's static, one of my niggas gon' get two niggas
Two of my niggas gon' get four niggas
Four of my niggas gon' get more niggas
That's more triggers meaning more killers
You motherfuckers better mob up

Let's mob up

[Chorus: x2]",Mob Up,1998
Twista & the Speed Knot Mobstaz,"[Liffy Stokes]
Nineteen-ninety-muthafuckin'-eight
Mobsta elite's back up in this muthafuck 'em (Bitch)
And we airin' out all you playa-hatin-lame-ass niggas
And we on this laid-back track, something smooth
Eh yo, Mayz, whatcha don' do, kick it

[Mayz]
And ride on, niggas get your high on
While we pump this shit to vibe on
The muthafuckin' mobsta elite'll leave you breathless
When we hit you like this
Early in the morning, hop into the Chevy Caprice
I'm hurtin', so I'm thinkin of ways to gettin' paid
Cheddar in a bundle, fifties and hundreds and G stacks
If I could just hit that big lick I could relax
And ease back off of thuggin' and stick to hustlin'
Concentrate on paper and let the shorties do the bustin'
While I motivate on power moves, you live be coward rules
Singing the blues while I pack shit that'll knock you out your shoes
'Cause I'm a fool playing the game of the streets
Claiming elites, making sure my family eats
We roll and it flees, bunkin' niggas out of their seats
While mobbin' on beats, soon niggas can't back down or retreat
Preventing mine, just doing petty crimes, I'm not petty or nice
Standin' in line, calmly waitin' on my time to shine
'Cause when I shine, I'ma glisten
As all the heads come up missing
I'ma slide in and assume the position
My mom's stick thick, who the killas and convicts
Bulletproof now, pistol holsters under the arm pits
Ready to go out in the blaze of glory
Standin' firm on the deck makin' the front-page story

[Chorus]
When your mobs' at your side and they're ready to ride, nigga
(Nigga, that's mobstability)
And when you go from movin' O's to keys for more cheese
(Fool, that's mobstability)
And when it's money over bitches 'cause you're stackin' your riches
(Playa, that's mobstability)
Gettin' your mind right for payin' for the year 2G
(Gotsta be mobstability)

[Liffy Stokes]
I heard a raw beat, somebody told me the funk did it
But if Trax didn't do it I can't fuck it
'Cause it's a family thang
You know Chi-Town's the motherland of the wild
The chain of mobsters and gangs
But we're the elite few that just can't be contained
Tippin' only the plane, determine it's about the game
Like a playa stays the same, ain't tryin' to act strange to change
'Cause the more paper you got, the more you got to slang
And there's more haters to bang 'cause they all want a piece
You got to be slick as grease 'cause they want the playas deceased
Restin' in peace
But my motto's simply too tight for you to threaten my life
With a knife, gun or mic
You don't really want to fight so just swallow your pride
Before I come inside your crib and kidnap the shorty and bride
Every nigga alive wish he had a psycho status
Will your punks ready to ride so the bitches can come at us
In the city of thugs, police, politicians and drugs
If they ain't passin' the bubble, niggas carry a grudge, but no love
So I don't give a muthafuck if you killin' me
I'm pissin' out headshots, protestin' my mobstability

[Chorus]
[Twista]
If I'm not into nothing, I don't feel right
So I circle the block strapped
Watching the workers while they circle muthafuckas at night
They work to tippin' me 'cause dope fiends ain't wangers
These wanches are skanches, this ain't just how the cracks and hiatus
My crew react tamers than sweat hogs, to protect that (?) bomb
But no teflon, your flesh was tearin', for the love of this heron
I bare arms and I'm quick to snatch cards to those who react hard
Don't judge these, got you robbed, I'ma get more cheddar for my black mob
My legion is broke down into sections to run every regions
Slugs and thugs, rifles for rifles 'cause we walk every season
Having shootin' apartments, cars with hidden compartments for po-pos 
Zip polos holding pistolos and mobstas know those
Sooner then booted, looted then zooted, (?) shoes so can I
Automatics but semi, then I, watches your midnight
'Cause I be handlin' my function when the nine-milliter get to jumpin'
Dumpin' on niggas who claimin' my muthafuckas ain't worth for nothin'
I'm bustin', how's game I peep when I was a shorty
Having big dreams on money, cars and bitches by the time I reach forty
Nation affiliation, dummy paper-chase and willin'
For pay probabilities only seen through mobtability, feelin' me

[Chorus]",Mobstability,1998
