Elvis Costello,"It's a long way down from the high horse you're on
When you stumble and then you're thrown
Yeah, the last time we saw him, he was out in the rain
Watching that train roll down the track
Now he's back in showbiz
Trying to make a comeback

We know that he's desperate
And we know that he's broke
He's the mystery guest we'll puncture
They told a young girl with a clipboard
""Just keep him amused""
""Whatever you do, don't tell him your name""
""Whatever you think, don't let him drink""
Under lime, under lime, under lime

He whistles out of tune
His words don't always rhyme
But we will be right back
We're almost out of time

Down a long corridor, he's trying to impress
He was helping a showgirl fasten up her dress
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

In the violent strip of an undressing room
She loosened his grip and started
Tell me your story if you feel so inclined
He was a mess, almost resigned
Though she could guess, I think you will find
She thought ""Oh, you know, I wouldn't mind""

He asked her boyfriend's name
Then her whole family tree
She thought, ""I can't believe
It's happening to me""

And upset, said ""Hey, Pet, would you kindly pass that pill
And allow me to just dictate my dying will""
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

Jimmie was dreaming as she uncrossed her legs
He shuttered his eyes discreetly
And he thought of a drummer and considered a snare
But the beat of his heart said, ""Don't even start""
His conscience was bare, it said ""Don't even dare""
She's completely unaware

She forced a laugh or a sign
At every alibi
Once every crime was confessed
He buttoned up his vest

Said ""Hey gal, you're a pal, you've really been a sport""
And you don't get a record if you never get caught
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

It's a long way down from that high horse you're on
It's a long way back, 'less you cover your track
Or you bury your crime
Under lime, under lime, under lime, under lime

It's a long way down from that high horse you're on
It's a long way back, 'less you cover your track
Or you bury your crime
Under lime, under lime, under lime, under lime

It's a long way down from that high horse you're on
It's a long way back, 'less you cover your track
'Cause you bury your crime
Under lime, under lime, under lime",Under Lime,2018
Elvis Costello,"I set off alarms and fire off flares (?)
'Cause sometimes the answer (?)
I'm listening

If you finally do come true
You may regret that too

While dressed for a lover's gaze

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"Photographs of fancy tricks to get your kicks at sixty-six
He thinks of all the lips that he licks
And all the girls that he's going to fix
She gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle
But there's no place here for the mini-skirt waddle
Capital punishment, she's last year's model
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie
I don't want to go to Chelsea

Oh no it does not move me
Even though I've seen the movie
I don't want to check your pulse
I don't want nobody else
I don't want to go to Chelsea

Everybody's got new orders
Be a nice girl and kiss the warders
Now the teacher is away
All the kids begin to play

Men come screaming, dressed in white coats
Shake you very gently by the throat
One's named Gus, one's named Alfie
I don't want to go to Chelsea

Oh no it does not move me
Even though I've seen the movie
I don't want to check your pulse
I don't want nobody else
I don't want to go to Chelsea

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"We're all going on a summer holiday
Vigilantes coming out to follow me
Heard somebody say they're out to collar me
Anybody want to swallow me?
It takes two to tumble, it takes two to tango
Speak up--don't mumble if you're in the combo
On the beat, on the beat
Till a man comes along and he says
""Have you been a good boy, never played with your toy?
Though you never enjoy, such pleasure to employ""
See your friends in the state they're in
See your friends getting under their skin
See your friends getting taken in

Well, if you only knew the things you do to me
I'd do anything to confuse the enemy
There's only one thing wrong with you befriending me
Take it easy, I think you're bending me
I've been a bad boy with the standard leader
My neighbor's revving up his Vauxhall Viva
On the beat, on the upbeat
Till a man comes along and he says
""Have you been a good boy, never played with your toy?
Though you never enjoy, such pleasure to employ""
See your friends walking down the street
See your friends never quite complete
See your friends getting under their feet

Oh, I don't want to disease you, but I'm no good with machinery
Oh, I don't want to freeze you, stop looking at the scenery
I keep thinking about your mother, oh, I don't want to lick them
I don't want to be a lover, I just want to be your victim
I don't go out much at night, I don't go out much at all
Did you think you were the only one who was waiting for a call?
On the beat, on the upbeat
Till a man comes along and he says
""Have you been a good boy, never played with your toy?
Though you never enjoy, such pleasure to employ""
See your friends treat me like a stranger
See your friends despite all the arrangements
See your friends, nothing here has changed
Just the beat

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"Calling Mr. Oswald with the swastika tattoo
There is a vacancy waiting in the English voodoo
Carving ""V"" for ""vandal"" on the guilty boy's head
When he's had enough of that, maybe you'll take him to bed
To teach him he's alive before he wishes he was dead

[Chorus:]
Turn up the TV, no one listening will suspect
Even your mother won't detect it, so your father won't know
They think that I've got no respect but
Everything is less than zero
Hey, oo hey-ey
Hey, oo hey-ey

Oswald and his sister are doing it again
They've got the finest home movies that you have ever seen
They've got a thousand variations, every service with a smile
They're gonna take a little break and they'll be back after a while
Well, I hear that South America is coming into style

[Chorus:]

A pistol was still smoking, a man lay on the floor
Mr. Oswald said he had an understanding with the law
He said he heard about a couple living in the USA
He said they traded in their baby for a Chevrolet
Let's talk about the future, now we've put the past away

Lip service is all you'll ever get from me
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to me

These are dangerous amusements

Don't say a word if there is any doubt

You say you're sorry for the things that you've done
You say you're sorry but you know you don't mean it
I wouldn't worry, I had so much fun
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being

It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
Oh yeah

Get to the slot machine, almost dead on arrival
Just hit me one more time with that live wire
Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million
You say I've got no feelings, this is a good way to kill them

Select the control and then insert the token
You want to throw me away but I'm not broken
You've got a lot to say--well, I'm not joking

Little triggers, I don't want to be hung up, strung up
When you don't call up

Little sniggers on your lips
Little triggers in your grip
Little triggers--my hand on your hip

Thinkin' all about those censored sequences
Worryin' about the consequences
Waiting until I come to my senses
Better put it all in present tenses

Little sniggers on your lips
Little triggers in your grip
Little triggers--my hand on your hip

Worryin' about the common decency
When it is only a question of frequency
When you say OK but you've got cheek to be

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"Romeo was restless, he was ready to kill
He jumped out the window 'cause he couldn't sit still
Juliet was waiting with a safety net
He said, ""Don't bury me 'cause I'm not dead yet""

[Chorus:]
Why don't you tell me about the mystery dance
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why don't you show me
'Cause I've tried and I've tried, and I'm still mystified
I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied

Well, I remember when the lights went out
And I was tryin' to make it look like it was never in doubt
She thought that I knew, and I thought that she knew
So both of us were willing, but we didn't know how to do it

[Chorus:]

Well, I was down under the covers in the middle of the night
Tryin' to discover my left foot from my right
You can see those pictures in any magazine
But what's the use of looking when you don't know what they mean?

[Chorus:]
I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied
I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied
I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"I've been on tenterhooks, ending in dirty looks
List'ning to the Muzak, thinking 'bout this 'n' that
She said, ""That's that, I don't want to chitter-chat""
Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Pump it up, until you can feel it

Down in the pleasure center, hell-bent or heaven-sent
Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander
There's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it

She's been a bad girl, she's like a chemical
Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic
You want to torture her, you want to talk to her
All the things you bought for her, putting up your temperature
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it

Out in the fashion show, down in the bargain bin
You put your passion out under the pressure pin
Fall into submission, hit-and-run transmission
No use wishing now for any other sin
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it",Pump It Up [Live at the el Mocambo],1978

I wonder who he's gonna stick it in this time
Everyone was looking for a little entertainment
So they'll probably pull his hands off when they find out his name
And then they shut down the power all along the line
And we got stuck in the tunnel where no lights shine
They got to touchin', all the girls were scared to call out

Won the schooling  prize
Does her heavy thinking
Bristols and her thighs
Never had a teacher
Messing with her brain
You should see her pupils

Shifting her transmission

Shaken on her shoulder
Shaking on her arse
Ain't no doubt about it
She's a gamey lass
Jerking with her elbow
Clever with her knee

Diction very bad
Friction double rich
Brazen little hussy
Rock 'n' rolling bitch

Take off like a jet
Rocking's her vocation

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"The man from the television crawled into the train
I wonder who he's gonna stick it in this time
Everyone was looking for a little entertainment
So they'll probably pull his hands off when they find out his name
And then they shut down the power all along the line
And we got stuck in the tunnel where no lights shine
They got to touchin', all the girls were scared to call out
Nobody was saying anything at all

We were waiting for the end of the world
Waiting for the end of the world
Waiting for the end of the world
Dear Lord, I sincerely hope you're coming
'Cause you really started something

Things got back to normal as the train began to roll again
We got to the station about 20 minutes later
The legendary hitch-hiker says that he knows where it's at
Now he'd like to go to Spain or somewhere like that
With his two-tone Bible and his funny cigarettes
His suntan lotion and his castanets

He was waiting for the end of the world
Waiting for the end of the world
Waiting for the end of the world
Dear Lord, I sincerely hope you're coming
'Cause you really started something

And then the bride, the groom, the congregation and the priest
All got onto the train when we were three stations east, yeah
Hiding from a scandal in the national press
They had been trying to get married since they stole the wedding dress
You may see them drowning as you stroll along the beach
But don't throw out the lifeline till they're clean out of reach

Butter wouldn't melt on your paws
If this is a dog's life
Then you're the cat's clothes

Hire out your daughters

Serves you right now she wants you to feed her and clothe her

Kick you where it really matters
Send all your friends to Coventry
And look for your name in last night's obituaries

If you've got the Deutschmarks
If you've got the yen, then
You get the shirt off her back and the clock off Big Ben
Somebody's soft touch
Struck all these bargains
In the drinking clubs with the council men making
Plans to put lead back in their pencils again

With their continental fingers that have
Never seen working blisters
Oh I know they've got their problems
I wish I was one of them
They say daddy's coming home soon
With his sergeant stripes and his empire mug and spoon

No more fast buck
And when are they gonna learn their lesson
But when are they gonna stop all of these victory processions

When he ran from you?
In a private detective's overcoat
And dirty dead man's shoes

Is a far cry from the nod and wink
Here at traitor's gate

'Cause the high heel he used to be
Has been ground down
And he listens for the footsteps
That would follow him around

But will you still love
A man out of time?

There's a tuppeny, hapenny millionaire
Looking for a fourpenny one
With a tight grip on the short hairs
Of the public imagination

But for his private wife and kids somehow
Real life becomes a rumor
Written in a French letters with some dutch courage
And a German sense of humor

He's got a mind like a sewer
And a heart like a fridge
He stands to be insulted
And he pays for the privilege

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love
A man out of time?

The biggest wheels of industry
Retire sharp and short
And the after dinner overtures
Are nothing but an after thought

Somebody's creeping in the kitchen
There's a reputation to be made
Whose nerves are always on a knife's edge
Who's up late polishing the blade

Love is always scampering
In a cowering or a fawning
You drink yourself insensitive
And hate yourself in the morning

There's no money back guarantee on future happiness

Why doesn't he come home
Why does her friend's phone keep on ringing
Maybe she should just pretend

That`s why I only operate at night time.
Wait until the clock strikes ten,
It`ll all start happening then.

We can have a little party, laugh and sing and everything,
I know you`ll like it, just you wait and see.
Maybe first we`ll dig a movie,
Then we`ll hit they high spots feelin` groovy.

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"I've looked at it every way I can
From under and above
And every chance I've had
My love went mad
Love went mad love went mad
You you feel like I feel?
Do you have a heart?
Do you have a heart of iron and steel?

Are you a man now you wear a man's hat?
Are you a man now or are you a rat?
You go to church quiet as a mouse
You're a big cheese now in the workhouse
With these vulgar fractions of the treble clef
I wish you luck with a capital 'f'

A silent partner in someone else's mistake

Every day goes by without a hitch
You feel the urge becoming an itch
The boys in blue are hard to catch
They're busy turning Piccadilly
Into brands hatch
But with your fingers in your ears
Feeling bright as a button
Thinking 'thank God there'll be no more
Lamb dressed as mutton'
Playing family favorites on a tissue and a comb
Dying a thousand deaths
In the safety of your own home",Love Went Mad,1983
Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"This town belongs to you and your tricks of confidence
All the pavements for miles around are littered with your footprints
Now every girl I get close to seems to be wearing your perfume
And the clock strikes the letters of your name
Both midnight and noon

But I used to shoot my mouth off
Til' you'd had enough of me
Once or twice nightly
I know I've got my faults
And among them I can't control my tongue
But if you didn't believe me
Why did you have to leave me
With my mouth almighty

Mouth almighty that's what I've got
Mouth almighty telling you what's what
Mouth almighty
I wish I'd never opened my mouth almighty

So I threw away the rose and held onto the thorn
Crawling round with my crooner cuff links and my calling card cologne
But the realization of being replaced starts to tell tales across my face
Without a soul to talk to or a hair out of place",Mouth Almighty,1983

But you can`t put them back together
You can`t put them back together

Out of the frying pan into the fire

There are ashtrays of emotion for the fag ends of the aristocracy

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"I made my selection from the lonely hit parade 
In the town where time stood still 
I was feeling very little pain 
Until some joker played ""Almost Persuaded"" 
Now every girl I see 
Looks so much prettier to me 
My faithfulness has faded 
And their looks established daggers 
And the conversation heated 
Since the boys had all been late 
I found them walking round defeated 
In the town where time stood still 

Somebody in charge must have pretended 
The future's been suspended 
And I say I don't want trouble 
But I find myself back in it 
In the town where time stood still 
I am the man of the minute 

Teach me to say ""I love you"" 
I'll teach you to say ""You will do"" 
In the town where time stood still 
A way (?) that I can find a little girl 
To wind me up with all the usual spells 

There's nothing else to do but rearrange somebody's future 
And check your figures in the till 
The bar is full of girls just like the creature with the curse 
And the food is just like cabaret and vice versa 
In the town where time stood still 
Just as my heart (went down) sinking 
I found the town was shrinking 

And suddenly I saw her through the smoke and empty beers 
In the town where time stood still 
She might have well have waited years 

Now I suppose we did some things we used to do 
But no amount of darkness could ever turn her into you 

And so I woke up in the town where time stood still 
With a headache and a heartache 
And a handful of pills 
A welcome mat, a scandal rag and unpaid bills 

With her head inside her handbag

I gave you my life, you gave me your life.
Like a gush of wind in my hair.
Why do we forget what`s been said
And play the game of life with our hearts?

And when my heart returns to ashes, it will be just a story.

You`re drinking vintage Elvis Presley wine

Bored out of your tiny mind while life is twice as large
They`ll cut her down to size on television
She's available and beautiful, but with more time to devote
They're going to take this cable now and stick it down your throat
So this is an obituary which should be right and fitting
For every clockwork cat and conceivable kitten

In a very fashionable hovel

I hang around dying to be tortured
You'll never be alone in the bone orchard
This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel

So in this almost empty gin palace
Through a two-way looking glass
You see your Alice

You know she has no sense
For all your jealousy
In a sense she still smiles very sweetly

Charged with insults and flattery
Her body moves with malice
Do you have to be so cruel to be callous

And now you find you fit this identikit completely
You say you have no secrets
And then leave discreetly

I might make it California's fault
Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault
Just like the canals of Mars and the Great Barrier Reef
I come to you beyond belief

My hands were clammy and cunning
She's been suitably stunning
But I know there's not a hope in Hades
All the laddies cat call and wolf whistle
So called gentlemen and ladies
Dog fight like rose and thistle

I'm going to get a lot of grief
Once this seemed so appealing
Now I am beyond belief

I wanna bite that hand so badly
I want to make them wish they'd never seen me

And the promise of an early bed

I love you more than I can tell
I don't think I can live without you
And I know that I never will
Oh my baby, baby
I want you so it scares me to death
I can't say anymore than ""I love you""
Everything else is a waste of breath
I want you
You've had your fun, you don't get well no more
I want you
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall
Be careful darling, you might fall
I want you
I woke up and one of us was crying
I want you
You said ""young man I do believe you're dying""
I want you
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
I want you
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways
I want you
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget?
I want you
Since when were you so generous and inarticulate?
I want you
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
I want you
It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing
I want you
He tossed some tattered compliment your way
I want you
And you were fool enough to love it when he said
""I want you""
I want you
The truth can't hurt you, it's just like the dark
It scares you witless
But in time you see things clear and stark
I want you
Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop
I want you
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop
I want you
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you
I want you
I want to know the things you did that we do too
I want you
I want to hear he pleases you more than I do
I want you
I might as well be useless for all it means to you
I want you
Did you call his name out as he held you down?
I want you
Oh no my darling, not with that clown
I want you
I want you
You've had your fun, you don't get well no more
I want you
No one who wants you could want you more
I want you
I want you
I want you
Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up
I want you

I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"As I stepped out upon the landing my heart was already down the stairs 
She's in the bedroom with that boy of hers

Now she seems contrite will she make the change

The next time 'round 
You'll be someone else's baby 
But I'll be underground 
The next time 'round

Now it's a future for me and you that I lack 
You'll be the one who'll stands out in the dark 
Even when you're all dressed in black 

[Chorus:]

You've got something I want now 
And I've got something I can't hide 
I've got too much love for you now 
Have you got too much pride

Your elastic love, this velvet-line purgatory 
You used to take the breath out of me

She called you her Magic Fingers

I bet that isn't all she fakes

And turn it into soap flakes

So good night little school boy, you`d better learn some self control
Did you mess up your hairstyle, pour scorn in your begging bowl

Bare wires from the socket to the bed where you embraced that girl

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"Oh, the sky fell over cheap Korean monster-movie scenery
And spilled into the mezzanine of the crushed capsule hotel
Between the Disney abattoir and the chemical refinery
I knew I was in trouble but I thought I was in hell
So you look around the tiny room and you wonder where the hell you are
While the K.K.K. convention are all stranded in the bar
They wear hoods and carry shotguns in the main streets of Montgomery
But they're helpless here as babies 'cause they're only here on holiday

What do we care if the world is a joke? (Tokyo Storm Warning)
We'll give it a big kiss, we'll give it a poke (Tokyo Storm Warning)
Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke (Tokyo Storm Warning)
We're only living this instant

Well, the black sand stuck beneath her feet in a warm Sorrento sunrise
A barefoot girl from Naples or was it a Barcelona hi-rise?
Whistles out the tuneless theme song of a hundred cheap suggestions
And a million false seductions and all those eternal questions

Well, what do we care if the world is a joke? (Tokyo Storm Warning)
Oh, we'll give it a big kiss, we'll give it a poke (Tokyo Storm Warning)
Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke (Tokyo Storm Warning)

So they flew the Super-Constellation all the way from Rimini
And feasted them on fish and chips from a newspaper facsimile
Now dead Italian tourist bodies litter up the Broadway
Some people can't be told, you know they have to learn the hard way

Holidays are dirt-cheap in the Costa del Malvinas
In the Hotel Argentina they can hardly tell between us
For Teresa is a waitress, though she's now known as Juanita
In a tango bar in Stanley or in Puerto Margarita
She's the sweetest and the sauciest
The loveliest and naughtiest
She's Miss Buenos Aires in a world of lacy lingerie

What do we care if the world is a joke? (Tokyo Storm Warning)
We'll give it a big kiss, we'll give it a poke (Tokyo Storm Warning)
Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke (Tokyo Storm Warning)
We're only living this instant

Japanese God, Jesus robots telling teenage fortunes
For all we know and all we care they might as well be Martians
They say gold paint on the palace gates comes from the teeth of pensioners
They're so tired of shooting protest singers
That they hardly mention us
While fountains fill with second-hand perfume and sodden trading stamps
They'll hang the bullies and the louts that dampen down the day

What do we care if the world is a joke? (Tokyo Storm Warning)
We'll give it a big kiss, we'll give it a poke (Tokyo Storm Warning)
Death wears a big hat 'cause he's a big bloke (Tokyo Storm Warning)
We're only living this instant, hey

We braved the cold November air and the undertaker's curses, saying
""Take me to the Folies Bergères, and please don't spare the hearses""
For he always had a dream of that revolver in your purse
How you loved him 'till you hated him and made him cry for mercy
He said ""don't ever mention my name there or talk of all the nights you cried
We've always been like worlds apart, now you're seeing two nightmares collide""

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"Big nothing. 
He stood in the road outside of town 
With a broken clockwork toy in his hand. 
A graveyard for childish dreams in his palm 
A broken lifeline. 

Big nothing. 
The mechanical amusement sputtered to life in his fist. 
As he clenched, it whirred and died again. 
It was a cowboy who drew his gun, 
But the pistol was welded to the holster 
By age and careless children, 
So it struggled and strained 
And it unwound its own spring. 

Big nothing. 
He didn't need tattoos to show where he'd been 
And who he'd loved. 
It was the same thing that men had cried for; 
That women had dyed their hair for. 
The cellophane illusion of a starry sky 
Stretched over an open sore. 

Big nothing. 
He thought about his lost daughter 
The way her eyes would alight at the greedy circus barker's blackmail song 
How he wanted to smash her skull in when she parroted back, 
'Tell mommy; tell poppy; you need this little dolly.' 

Big nothing. 
Big nothing. 
The smoky voice of the petaled girl woke him long enough. 
There was too much light in the room, so he unscrewed the bulb. 
She took him to bed like an adopted dog. 

Big nothing. 
She lit sickly incense, as he tried to tell himself 
The resemblance were pure and coincidental. 
He unleashed his grip on the toy and all it meant to him, 
And it wound down forever. 

Big nothing. 
He woke up in a sweat, the next day. 
With her smile still painted on his mouth 
He walked out of a town called Big Nothing.

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"The landlady`s husband came up to town today
Since he left them both ten years ago to serve the ministry
The dark down road of his approach in constant rain was drenched
The tenant`s boy said ""How d`ya do"" then swore in French
Did you teach this little child these curses on my soul
You should both be shut down in the coal-hole
That`s the way to treat a child who cries out in the night
And a woman who teaches wrong from right

He`s a battered old bird
And he`s living up there
There`s a place where time stands still

The tight lipped leer of judgment
That had seen her love desert her just like sleep
""Filthy words on children`s lips are better, my dear spouse
Then if I were to speak my mind about this house""

[Chorus]

On the first floor there are two old maids
Each one wishing that the other was afraid
And next door to them is a man so mild
`Til he chopped off the head of a visitor`s child
He danced upon the bonfire
Swallowed sleeping pills like dreams
With a bottle of sweet sherry that everything redeems

And on the second floor is the Macintosh Man
He`s in his overcoats more than out of them
And the typewriter`s rattling all through the night

And it is always Christmas in a cupboard at the top of the stairs""

The crimes of Paris
And you can't keep your peace
And try to forget it

How come everybody wants to be your friend?
You know that it still hurts me just to say it

Because she's feeling so abused (oh, that's too bad)
She gets tired of the lust (oh, I'm so sad)

Can you say that I'm too old
When the angels have stolen my red shoes?

She said, ""Drop dead,"" then left with another guy

Not long before sleep arrives
They come with their sirens
And they sweep away all the boys
Busy draining the joy from their lives
They never said their prayers out loud
And while I'm dreaming
There's a passing motor car
That broadcasts a popular song
And a girl appears to be saying
""Do you think that I'm gonna go far?""

Just look at me, I'm having the time of my life
Or something quite like it
When I'm walking out and about
In London's brilliant parade

She's one of those girls that you just can't place
You feel guilty desiring such an innocent face
But of course they knew that when they cast her
Along with the red Routemaster
And the film takes place in an MGB
And a perfect re-creation of ""The Speakeasy""
Everybody looks happy and twisted
Though she probably never existed
For old times' sake
Don't let me awake

Especially at twilight

Into the water below

And a trolley bus in Fulham Broadway
The lions and the tigers in Regents Park
Couldn't pay their way

In Kensington and Camden Town
There's a part that I used to play
The lovely Diorama is really part of the drama, I'd say

""Isn't that very fortunate for you""

When he ran from you
In a private detective`s overcoat
And dirty dead man`s shoes

Lying for a minister of state
Is a far cry from the nod and wink
Here at traitor`s gate

`Cause the high heel he used to be has been ground down
And he listens for the footsteps that would follow him around

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love
A man out of time

There`s a tuppeny hapenny millionaire
Looking for a fourpenny one
With a tight grip on the short hairs
Of the public imagination

But for his private wife and kids somehow
Real life becomes a rumor
Days of Dutch courage
Just three French letters and a German sense of humor

He`s got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge
He stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love

The biggest wheels of industry
Retire sharp and short
And the after dinner overtures
Are nothing but an after thought
Somebody`s creeping in the kitchen
There`s a reputation to be made
Whose nerves are always on a knife`s edge
Who`s up late polishing the blade

Love is always scarpering or cowering or fawning
You drink yourself insensitive and hate yourself in the morning

An invitation east
So we can watch it all crumbling

She came off like light and so softly she spoke
""You don't know, no you don't know about my dark life""
And you think you're a guest, you're a tourist at best
Peering into the corners of my dark life
Now that you tear your dreams from consumptive ballerinas
She'll stand on tiptoes for you in a grey and tattered tutu
She stays where she is because of voyeurs like these
With an accusative look that says ""my dark life""

Robber men await you then in each beguiling alley
To shake you and to pierce you and remind you of
My dark life

Enter the pious elite, in their preening finery
And bang the tambourine
They're dining on rice paper scenery
See how the villain attracts envious glances from everyone
She's waitressing by day
It doesn't bring in much money now

And his strong concealed arms set off bells and alarms
In the strangest locations of my dark life
But the fantasy slipped as he tipped her in cigarettes
She tries to smile very graciously when she wants to kill him
Now the victory is sweet, you get down on your knees
It's the perfect position for kissing western leather

So they came from ugly Texas and from nameless Tennessee
From peculiar Missouri and from places closer to me
All the cream of heartless England, cheered ""the carnival is over""
The are remnants of red army bandsmen played ""America The Beautiful""",My Dark Life [*],1996
Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"I feel such sorrow, I feel such shame
I know I won't arrive on time
Before whatever out there is gone
What can I do, that day is done
It's just a promise that I made
I said I'd walk in her parade
Hot scalding tears I thought would flow
Still in my heart they'll never show

[Chorus:]
That day is done
That day is done
You know where I've gone I won't be coming back
That day is done
Well I recall the time and place
When they announced her precious face
I thought at once my heart would burst
Still every time is like the first
There was applause when she stepped up
I wished that I could interrupt
I made no sign, I made no sound
I know I must stay underground

[Chorus]

That's why she walks, or so they say
She always knew just what I needed
Now if she would just look my way
One time before they proceed
She sprinkles flowers in the dirt
That's when a thrill becomes a hurt
I know I'll never see her face
She walks away from my resting place

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"It's at times such as this she'd be tempted to spit
If she wasn't so ladylike
She imagines how she might have lived
Back when legends and history collide
So she looks to her prince finding he's so charmingly
Slumped at her side
Those days are recalled on the gallery wall
And she's waiting for passion or humor to strike

What shall we do, what shall we do with all this useless beauty?
All this useless beauty

Good Friday arrived, the sky darkened on time
Till he almost began to negotiate
She held his head like a baby and said ""it's okay if you cry""
Now he wants her to dress as if you couldn't guess
He desires to impress his associates
But he's part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased
So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny

She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books
That were later disgraced to face celluloid
It won't even make sense, but you can bet
If she isn't a sweetheart or plaything or pet
The film turns her into an unveiled threat

Nonsense prevails, modesty fails
Grace and virtue turn into stupidity
While the calendar fades almost all barricades to a pale compromise
And our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts
They still think they're the gods of antiquity
If something you missed didn't even exist
It was just an ideal, is it such a surprise?

She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books

Till you don`t know what hope is

But there`s one thing that I had to keep inside
Because I was shaking

And I`m nobody`s fool

Behind all this paraphernalia

Where you only have three wishes
It isn't easy to see
In a lifetime of mistaken kisses

Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"Lucy Grace can't show her face down in the North End Road 
For in Belgravia 
Rumours have been whispered and suggestions have been made 
Did you sell your friends out when the heat got too intense? 
You say you like the danger but it's only a pretense 
You say you need the money 
When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance 
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms 
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide? 
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss 
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss? 

Who's that sneaking 'round the door? 
You can't come here no more 
Can't you go home again? 
She used to sit alone for hours 
Spend her evenings watering dried flowers 

When her mother came to stay and finally went to bed 
Lucy Grace was in the front room shooting through your head 
She tried to take your breath away and give you something else instead 

Next year she'll serve her function in that Audrey Hepburn hat 
It still won't suit her much but she'll get over that 
She'll be pale and feign indifference as they're handling out the prizes 
Spilling Daddy's pearls of wisdom 
And her ugly sister's tranquillizers 

Why were you so tardy putting up your guard? 
When you hurt so easily and you try so hard 
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms 
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide? 
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss 
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?",Basement Kiss,1996
Elvis Costello & the Attractions,"Shall we agree that just this once
I`m gonna change my life
Until it`s just as tiny or important as you like?

And in time we won`t even recall that we spoke
Words that turned out to be as big as smoke
As smoke that disappears in the air
There`s always something that`s smoldering somewhere

I know it don`t make a difference to you
But oh! It sure made a difference to me
You`ll see me off in the distance, I hope
At the other end
At the other end of the telescope.

The promise of indulgence in my confidential voice
Approached immortal danger but you`ll never know how close
Then down the hall I overheard such a heavenly choir
They interrupted my evil designs
One day you are up in the clouds 
The next thing you`re down with the Sweet Adelines

[Chorus]
Lie down baby now don`t say a word
There there baby your vision is blurred
Your head is so sore from all of that thinking
I don`t want to hurt you now
But I think you`re shrinking

You`re half-naked ambition and you`re half out of your wits
Or several tiny fractions that this portrait still omits
And it`s so hard to pick the receiver up when I call
I never noticed you could be so small
The answer was under your nose but the question never arose

I know it don`t make a difference to you
But oh! It sure made a difference to me
`Cause late in the evening as I sit here moping
With a bamboo needle on a shellac of Chopin
And the cast-iron heart that you failed to tear open

The same eyes, the same lips, the same lie

Ring to the boots of roustabouts

Well, you chase down the road 'til your fingers bleed
On a fiberglass tumbleweed
Well, you can blow around the town, but it all shuts down the same

The same eyes, the same lips, the same lie
From your tongue trips

They set him up, set him up on the stool
He falls down, falls down like a drunk
And you drink 'til you drool
Well, it's his story you'll flatter
You'll stretch him out like a saint
But the canvas that he splattered
Will be the picture that you never paint

Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror

Gets into it pretty thick
A butterfly drinks a turtle's tears, but how do you know he really needs it?

I've got this harlot that I'm stuck with carrying another man's child

They'd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived

And they were surprised to see us
So they greeted us with palms
They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms
I might recite a small prayer

If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam
I wish that I could take something for drowning out the noise

Wailing echoes down the corridors
I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial
I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye
And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme

Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams
Now I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi
For if I hold my hand outstretched
A little bird comes to me

I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam

Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars
Wailing echoes down the corridors
The player piano picks out ""Life Goes On""
Ring tone rang out ""Jerusalem""

And in this pit of sadness
Where the rank of wretched plunge
We've buried all the innocents
Now we must bury revenge

They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a mustang
And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars still spangle
They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine
And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to Palestine

Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces
Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces
Then my thoughts returned to vengeance, but I put up no resistance
Though I seemed a long way from my home

It really was no distance
And I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame

With his crying statues and his flying bomb
Goes 'round acting like the chosen one
Excuse us if we treat him like our idiot cousin

He hangs up flowers and bells and rhymes
Hoping to hell someone's forgiven his crimes
Fills up the air with his pride and praise
He's a big disgrace to our beastly ways

Man uses words to dress up his vile instincts

If you had the need
I'd step right in your shoes that you've been walking
'Cause someone put the hurt in you

And you only have to speak to tell your fortune

Both by damage and by choice
It tells of promises and pleasure
And a tale of wine and woe
The uneasy time to come
And the long way round we go to get there

Once you told me fairy tales
Everybody knows
But I didn't care for their prediction
Now you say you're leaving me
And packing up your clothes
I finally see you were a work of fiction

There's a story in your walk
Then you crumble just like chalk
And I could say that I was sorry
But I wouldn't mean it much
There are pages I can't touch
And something that's been torn out of this chapter

Far away, not far enough
'Cause I can still recall
How it felt when I read that last sentence
Now I go inside some rooms with Gideon in them all
And hide myself from all hope of repentance

Cheap sunglasses might disguise
But when the bedroom light reveals
All that bravado and that fright
That you cover up in spite

But I'm a limited, primitive kind of man

Maybe with nothing but a drum and drone
I want to beat it 'til I get unknown

Stretch it tight
Make myself up overnight

Maybe this is nothing but drum and drone
Wanna beat it 'til I get unknown

Dig my pin
Kick up some stink
Find myself a brand new kink

Prick that berry
And squeeze this ink
Scratch out all of the words I think
Before your very eyes can blink

Just undoing and undressing

On a fey little gunsel
Who dreamed of drilling that vamp

I'm walking the shade
Of this silent parade
With my pepper and mace
And my heartbroken face

Rainy railway station
Drowns out a tearful parting
Last canister rolling

A screwball comedy

The honeymoon didn't last
Somehow they didn't seem young

But they still find a reason to fight
No matter how long they stay
Can't make the rest of the year right

I looked in her eyes and saw barely a spark
He laughed too loud then he drank until dark

In the shadows something is slithering

Wandered everywhere and then
Stood outside and gazed upon

Elvis Costello & the Imposters,"Between last breaths and first regrets
The days dragged on like cigarettes
In the distance martyrs and martinets
Dally, dancing with the empty silhouettes of threats

So, where but heaven does love end
And where on earth does it begin
It's not the kind of love that is pinned
Like a medal
Or presses pennies in a tin

There is hope, and after that, there is only faith
Love like a wraith
Never made me afraid
Consoled as I was by that shade...

Here lie the roses in the ashes
Deep as the barnacles that cling
Just like a lace that runs through everyone and everything

In that other still forever
In that time before the past
I told myself we'd be together
Can you promise me that it will be eternally?

There is hope, and after that, there is only faith
Love like a wraith
Never made me afraid
Consoled as I was
Consoled as I was
Consoled as I was by that shade.",Song with Rose,2008
Elvis Costello & the Imposters,"You should wear your red galoshes
Walking o'er the city pride
Streets are paved with heaven's pennies
Gutters full of suicides

Teddy steadily fell from grace
Somewhere near Arcadia
Once she overheard a voice
That she didn't hear on the radio

Velvet gloves and country clubs
Were never going to hold her
Ringing the necks of silly
Southern belles
Who wanted to scold her

[Chorus]
Don't bring me down
I'm trouble bound
Blue song
Red Alert
Who made Stella Hurt?

Teddy soon dropped out of sight
Turned up in another town
Changed her name for the spotlight
Singing like a blue bird in a sequin gown

She finally fell and married well
But I knew it wouldn't last
Reversing back into the limelight
No one ever saw her even half-plastered

[Chorus]

Then she saw those soldier boys
Throw their bonnets in the air
Self-made men would pledge their fortunes
And dream of her
And dream of her...

Generals in the commissary opened up a case of wine
Checked the perfume of the cork
Said ""Made in 1929""...

They used her up, to raise morale for money
And Old Glory
Her voice was shot beyond repair
But this is not the last act of this story

The night is black as cracked shellac
Abandoned in an attic
Stella is silent as the grave
Until the needle drags her through the static

Back when I was drinking turpentine
Don't blame me

With a song in my heart that is longing to break
Let it out and let it fly high
Up where the spires scrape the sky

Elvis Costello & the Imposters,"I was tuning in the shine on the light night dial 
Doing anything my radio advised 
With every one of those late night stations 
Playing songs bringing tears to my eyes 
I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver 
When the switch broke 'cause it's old 
They're saying things that I can hardly believe 
They really think we're getting out of control 

Radio is a sound salvation 
Radio is cleaning up the nation 
They say you better listen to the voice of reason 
But they don't give you any choice 'cause they think that it's treason 
So you had better do as you are told 
You better listen to the radio 

I wanna bite the hand that feeds me 
I wanna bite that hand so badly 
I want to make them wish they'd never seen me 

Some of my friends sit around every evening 
And they worry about the times ahead 
But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference 
And the promise of an early bed 
You either shut up or get cut up, they don't wanna hear about it 
It's only inches on the reel-to-reel 
And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools 
Tryin' to anesthetize the way that you feel

Are you ready?
To be
Mr. and Mrs. Hush

I don't know if I'm deep down
Right inside her heart
Or outside her door
I don't know if I have the key
To either
Uncertain if I should take
Her hand or leave her

(I thought I saw her)
It's a game of blindfold and bluff
(I thought I saw her)
You know I love you
Is it ever enough?
(I thought I saw her)
Oh, what did I know
(I thought I saw her)
Heigh-ho and there you go
(I thought I saw her)
A voice that caresses and heels
Like spurs
(I thought I saw her)
What if you walked in with some
Other fella
(I thought I saw her)
Heat is rising
And red is the colour
(I thought I saw her)
Green is the colour of my true
Love's eyes
(I thought I saw her)
And green is the colour of
Those jealous disguises

Haven't you tired of that
Darkness yet?
Didn't you cry your heart out?
It's only a dream
What is it about love you
Can't accept?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

That I have the gaze
That must recall my father

Why can't she see through him?

Elvis Costello & the Imposters,"I got time on my hands, I'm just stripping paper
It's amazin' what you will find stripping paper
When you get down to the past

Back then we didn't have means for fine decorations
So we painted while mixing wine with flirtation
There in the mess of it all
He took me right there in the thrill
Not quite against my will
With my back to that rococo wall
We slipped right down to the floor

I can't close the door, he complimented my taste
I anointed his serious face with wallpaper paste
I wish we could laugh like that now
But what seemed to follow
That ended up hollow
Was I there?

Tear a strip or two
See what what came not much later
Here's a pony and a toy balloon
Behind the violet all too soon
Here's the pencil of a measurin' mark
And the monsters you spied in the dark
Now I got no place in her heart

You think I'm powerless when you speak

You look so beautiful when you cry

If I seem unconcerned
Perhaps it's time you learned

I'll cry until you suspect my tears

Elvis Costello & the Imposters,"It's a long way down from the high horse you're on
When you stumble and then you're thrown
Yeah, the last time we saw him, he was out in the rain
Watching that train roll down the track
Now he's back in showbiz
Trying to make a comeback

We know that he's desperate
And we know that he's broke
He's the mystery guest we'll puncture
They told a young girl with a clipboard
""Just keep him amused""
""Whatever you do, don't tell him your name""
""Whatever you think, don't let him drink""
Under lime, under lime, under lime

He whistles out of tune
His words don't always rhyme
But we will be right back
We're almost out of time

Down a long corridor, he's trying to impress
He was helping a showgirl fasten up her dress
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

In the violent strip of an undressing room
She loosened his grip and started
Tell me your story if you feel so inclined
He was a mess, almost resigned
Though she could guess, I think you will find
She thought ""Oh, you know, I wouldn't mind""

He asked her boyfriend's name
Then her whole family tree
She thought, ""I can't believe
It's happening to me""

And upset, said ""Hey, Pet, would you kindly pass that pill
And allow me to just dictate my dying will""
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

Jimmie was dreaming as she uncrossed her legs
He shuttered his eyes discreetly
And he thought of a drummer and considered a snare
But the beat of his heart said, ""Don't even start""
His conscience was bare, it said ""Don't even dare""
She's completely unaware

She forced a laugh or a sign
At every alibi
Once every crime was confessed
He buttoned up his vest

Said ""Hey gal, you're a pal, you've really been a sport""
And you don't get a record if you never get caught
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

It's a long way down from that high horse you're on
It's a long way back, 'less you cover your track
Or you bury your crime

Soy capas de cualquier cosa
Por un beso de esa boca

Dejaría el firmamento sin estrellas

Un día de estos por la calle
Con la nubes de la tarde
Te dibujaría aun te amo

Sueño que un día de estos
Te detengas a escucharme
Para poder decirte lo que siento

Porque una noche de estas
La luna me sorprendieras
Con tu cabeza en mi hombro
Yo daría la vida entera

Sueño que un día de estos
Te detengas a escucharme
Para poder decirte lo que siento

De tu sonrisa angelical
De tu forma de mirar

Elvis Crespo,"Mi regalito, mi regalito
Tienes la magia que me
Llena, cuando me das un besito
Why aunque me regalan

Flores why claveles, eso no me llena
Mi mayor regalo es volver a tenerte
Prefiero tus labios, mios nuevamente
Tu eres mi nina

Por eso te digo, veo en tu mirar
Una said de amor, que me arrastra a tus pies
Why hay en tu besar, fuego clestial
Que domina mi ser

why con tu ternura, why con tu dulzura
Conozco el placer, de ese regalito
Que dios me ha dado, hoy en ti mujer
Why no quiero nada, que no sea amarte, por ser

Elvis Crespo,"Ya no quiero darte amor eterno 
Solo quiero echarme al mar 
Y una boquita en cada puerto 
Ya no quiero atarme al 
Mismo cuerpo 
Pero estoy amordazado 
Entre los besos de tu huerto 
Yo no quise darte las dos manos 
Ni trepar por los tejados 
Recogiendo el fruto del manzano 
Raras veces mata los ladridos 
Pero tu callada me has mordido 
 
Dame tiempo y bésame 
En la boca 
Y déjame la lengua rota 
Es mi pasatiempo 
Que yo no quiero darte amor eterno 
Ni beber para olvidar los palos 
De este casamiento 

Yo no quiero ahogarme en el infierno 
Pero tengo que abrazarte y 
Juro que sin ti reviento 
Yo no quise darte tantas flores 
Ni subirme a los balcones 
Pero me baje los pantalones 
Raras veces mata los ladridos 
Pero tu callada me has mordido",Bésame en la Boca,2002

Si por mas que intento sigues en mi mente 
¿Cómo he de sanar la herida que quedó en mi corazón? 
Solo de pensar que te perdí, duele 

Ya sucedió ¿Dónde fallé? 
Si mi motivo en esta vida era quererte 
Cuando duermo en las noches me imagino junto a ti 
Pero cuando me despierto, veo que no estás ahí 

Dime dónde yo me equivoqué 
Dime en qué momento te dejé de amar 
Sólo quiero qué escuches mis palabras 
Que llegan desde el fondo de mi alma 
Y aún sigo refugiado a tu almohada 
Que lleva el aroma de tu piel 
Y en ella llevo tantos dulces sueños, como lo fue ayer

No ha muerto aquí dentro de mi,

Que tu amiga te tapa, clásico
Y hoy me visto de bandido 
Tomando tu mano
Llevándote conmigo

Aquí nadie sabe 
Que se el amor y el lo hace 
Poco dame un vehicle

Yo era un aburrido de la misma rutina
Buscaba algo diferente
Que no se encuentra alla en casita
Te hace fuerte la tentación
Por todas las esquinas
Ando solo, mamita
Y si te estiras, te llevo pa la mia

Mujeres, solteras, que eche temo el ambiente 
Huepaaa, echate pa ca
Vamo a darle un trago, trago, trago, trago

Pero que no sabes, eso es pa afuera 
Y van a romper con la carretera
Bajo a darla que si la vieras 
Dicen que la cárcel a nadie le espera

Pero callao, demasiado
Le voy a dar por el y luego chao 
Cuidado con la fiera
Canta otra y a una cualquiera

No soldier no lover
No father no mother

When fire my friend
Fire my villain

The ghosts of Cappucino and Zaza hover
In the hallway where the devil and his lover
Beg you for change on the slide

There's nothing really like a French blues
Blown by an unknown soldier in you
To all your regrets and you rouse
I'll meet you down there when I try

And do you ever wonder
Where you go when you die?
Emile's Vietnam in the sky

Well, I'd take better care of your heart
You'll be opening a Sswiss bank account
Let go, it's over now, play your part
You'll be swinging those milk clouds on high

And do you ever wonder
Where you go when you die?

And I'll fear no death
I'll give you my body
And I'll breathe your breath

No-one will harm you
Inside this song
We will be safe here
As the light is long
That makes way for Good Friday

Get out of your body
For there goes your blood
It falls on my secrets
And colors the flood

The time of our fathers
Is not ours to kill
Their sad cellared wines
Are not ours to spill
And won't be passed over Good Friday

Though this life
Is Ash Wednesday
It's Ash Wednesday
It forever approaches Good Friday

",Good Friday,2007

There is enough
Sadness for the
Both of us

Follow the sound
To the table underground
There will be plenty
Tears goin' round

And I would be happy
For you to stay
With me 'til tomorrow
Can become today

In a sad world
In a sad world

But when you leave
By powders and my teas
Will speak
Their heads off to me

Here everyone knows
Their own name
In a sad world
No two are the same

Real soon, assures the spoon
Watch out!, says the time
Water, give me water
Remember me, begs the rhyme

Of a sad world
Of a sad world

",It's a Sad World After All,2007
Elvis Perkins,"I heard a sound
When I was a child
Someone was walking through the pillow that night
The snow muted 
The pitch of night
A shadow approached across a field in white
It's only me
It's only me
And the sound of my heart it startled me
As I drifted
From the dark room
Face lifted from the paper moon
Reflected in the orbit bath
He manages to say before he starts to laugh
You can't always trust
The darkness and the dust
But me, I'm just a man
It's more than I can understand
It's only me

The white noise
Falls away
To reveal the perfect day
Where roses bloomed
Out of thin air
And music rose from down the buried stairs
It's only mine
It's only mine
I grew it in the shade
When the sun couldn't shine
And at times I don't know why
The tears come to my eyes
And what if I go blind
As they flow out of my mind
It worries me
It worries me
That there's someone on my mind
Who I don't see
I close my eyes to disappear
Into the fields of stars between my ears
The dark 
As they overlap
We follow one another 
As we fade to black

It's only night
It's only night

An ultrasound when I was alive
The shadows go spying on the ones in the wild
They dip their arrows
Into the sea
They wash their arms 
As they wait for me
They wait for me
They wait for me
Hey wait for me
Hey wait for me",It's Only Me,2007
Elvis Perkins,"Well, I don't care, your cameras caught me crying as I left your gates
Or that your maintenance men, they caught our last embrace
Well, you were on the verge of tears when I first knew I would know you
And now your ancient black tears, they stain your robe

Calypso will come with me on that morning April day
To the city of my childhood in a cage
On the broad back of the earth we will drive twelve hours straight
And we'll take turns feeling crazy and okay

On May Day, May Day, listen for the sound
Of the ambulances singing rounds drowning out the blue
Well the Captain of America he sings through his toothpaste
And the bubbles of his words will float away
As he gargles out a hymn in the funny fish voice way
And all the sorrow seems to go away

On May Day, May Day, listen for the sound
Of the Geiger counters counting down
To one and blast off baby to the inter-space of stars
Out to the star encrusted boulevard

On May Day, May Day, can you hear the sound
Of the megaphones calling out instructions
And I need your quiet empire where forgetful Persians roam
And with two hands full of silver I'll go home
Return me to my kingdom where my children wait for me
To build them flying saucers

On May Day, May Day, they are going down
Send the fleet of black-and-whites wailing downtown

May Day, May Day, May Day

Now that the sun has warmed the sky

No I can't sleep now, baby

It's true, I loved her then, yes
And you deserve far better than this mess
It's true, I loved her then, forever
But now it's you that I love always loved never

Now the night and the liquor coming on

Time flew the phone rang
There was a silence when the kitchen sang
Its songs competed like kids for space

They gave us picks said ""go mine the sun
And go gold and come back when you're done""
Uh oh

While you were sleeping you tossed you turned
You rolled your eyes as the world burned
The heavens fell the earth quaked
I thought you must be but you weren't awake, no
You were dreaming you ignored the sun
You grew your power garden for your little ones
And you found brides for them on Christmas Eve
They hung young Cain from the Adam trees
And danced uh oh
While you were sleeping I tossed and I turned too
I closed my eyes but the future burned through
The planet turned a hair grey as I relived the day

While you were sleeping the money died
Machines were harmless and the earth sighed
The wind you swept sound and gravity brought my love
Around
The oceans rose sang about decay
The witches flew and the mermaids stayed
Full of dreams you overslept
In keeping with the quiet through the walls I crept
I walked on tip-toes sent darkness swirling over all
The kitchen
In the early morning
Uh oh uh oh


I'll never catch up to you who sleep so sound
My yawns are useless my heart beats too loud
To go to sleep my mind's too proud to bow out
While you were sleeping the time changed
All your things were rearranged
Your vampire mirrors face to face
They saw forever out into space and found you dreaming
In black and white
While it rained in all the colors of the night
Uh oh uh oh

I watched the tv?s memories champion ships vanish to sea
Can it be my honey between you and me
So I waited for the riddled sky to be solved again by
Sunrise
And I made a death soup for life
For my father?s ill widowed wife
Did you have that strangest dream before you woke
'Cause in your gown you had the butterfly stroke
Did it escape you like some half-told joke
When you reached for your plume of smoke

And it'll haunt you my honey bee
Anyone who's anyone has that same dream
Were you falling were you flying and were you calling
Out or were you dying
But thank god you're up now let's stay this way
Else there'll be no mornings and no more days
'Cause when we?re dreaming the babies grow
The stars shine and the shadows flow
Time flies the phone rings there is a silence
When everybody tries to sing
Uh oh uh oh",While You Were Sleeping,2007

Without throwing your spine outta wack

Nothing happens that can tell the truth
Let's go out and find a telephone booth
Yeah that's a better place, I like more space

Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack

Elvis Presley,"Pedro the bull was a killer
King of the bullfighter ringer
He'd wipe up the floor with each brave matador
And have matador stew for his dinner

He heard the crowd shouting ""Olé""
But he met his master that day

The bullfighter was a lady
And it was true love at first sight
Her red cape was waving but Pedro was shaking (or shaving?)
He wanted to date her that night

Olé

Pedro the bull he was smitten
First time the love bug had bitten
He once was a mad bull, a wild and a bad bull
But now he was mild as a kitten

The people were starting to hiss
But Pedro just wanted to kiss

The bullfighter was a lady
And Pedro he liked what he saw
He floated on air with a rose in his hair
As he waltzed with that sweet matador

His fate was a bad one, his tale is a sad one
It's hanging right over her door

Olé!

Elvis Presley,"There's a legend of a famous matador
Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought as he had never done before
He could not beat, El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

They said time would never heal the many scars
Brought by the great, El Toro
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
Caused him to hate, El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

So one night, when no-one was on sight
The matador, went to finish the score
In the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight
He fought the bull...and they fought once more

When they found the matador and saw him dying
He'd never see tomorrow
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

To shoot her man if he was doin' her wrong

Will take.

Long as my bank books keep growin' fatter
Easy street is my favorite avenue
Who needs money? I do

Just pity all those millionaires they never can relax
Because they're always worryin' about their income tax
Why waste time on high financin'?
I'd rather spend it on good romancin'

What if my pockets are empty as can be?
Who needs money? not me
Tell me about it

Some folks save it, some folks lend it
But as for me I wanna spend it
Give me some green and my skies will be blue

Interest holds no interest for me
Who wants to sit in the lap of luxury
Who needs money? Not me

When I go to bed at night instead of counting sheep
I start counting dollar bills and then I fall asleep

Making money never thrills me
It's making love that really kills me
What can I lose with my philosophy
Who needs money? Not me
What do you want?

I want a big yacht I can cruise in
The kind that girls just can't refuse in
All it takes is a million or two
Who needs money? I do

Now that I'm broke I know for certain
She really digs my personality

Those picturesque cafes
Are scenes no-one forgets
And I'm enchanted, music softly plays
By dancing silhouettes

""Where you bound on such a cold, dark afternoon?""

And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you

Since a quarter after seven
I was down to my last cigarette
And the clock in the window
At a quarter to eleven

I was watching all the people
Passing by me going places
Just the loneliest guy in the town
Looking for a friendly smile
But all I see were faces

And then, just like the taste of milk and honey
I found the stranger I've been looking for
Like a wave, my cup of love was overflowing
I knew the stranger in the crowd 
And I would be stranger no more

The love that comes on the corner
At a quarter to eleven
I thought you were to good to be true
All my life I had believed 
That angels only live in heaven
But now, we share the taste of milk and honey
Each day is sweeter than the day before

My cup runned overflowing 
Because the stranger in the crowd
And I would be stranger no more

Or if your great romance should end,
And you're lonesome for a friend
Darling, you need never be
There's always me

I don't seem to mind somehow
Playing second fiddle now
Someday you'll want me, dear,
and when that day is here,
Within my arms you'll come to know
Other loves may come and go
But my love for you will be eternally
Look around and you will see
There's always me.",There's Always Me,1971

When all it ever gives to me is a pain in my posteriors

Time for me to be moving on

Now you've had your fun and you're running back to me

You've had me fooled now I'm wakin' up
I see right through your lies
You made me open my eyes

Elvis Presley,"Somewhere out in empty space
Long before the human race
Something stirred

A vast and timeless source began
Intelligence was born and then
There was the world

Powers filled the universe
Matter formed and broke the curse
Of nothingness

Love became an ageless soul
Nature reached her highest goal
And breathed the breath of life
Everlasting life

Well, creatures come from out of sight
Daylight came from in the night
And all was good

Life became a master plan
Love produced the perfect man
That understood

The image of the maker's word
Worshiped him with all he had
But then one day

From in the depths an evil seed
Grew and manufactured greed
That changed the way of life
Everlasting life

Oh, the loving power looked and saw
Inside the heart of man a flaw
Began to grow

Well, the fires of hell began to burn
And so he sent his chosen son
To let us know

That love had surely made us all
And hate would surely make us fall
So from the cross

Well, he showed the world that dreadful day
That love could be the only way
Or all is lost of life

For life is love
And love is life",Life [Single Mono Mix] [*],1971

When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet, hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

Lead me on, let me stand

Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light

See the silver wing on high

Where the mornin' rain don't fall
And the sun always shines

Here is where you'll find your destiny

Near to me and yet so far
Will I always be a lonesome cowboy
Am I only reaching for a star

Take a look around tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself a while
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
You could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart

So one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away

If I could I would tell you I'm lonesome tonight dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here

With dreams of yesterday

Elvis Presley,"Had a dream about you baby
Had a dream about me and you
Had a dream and woke up crying
Well, I can roll but I just can't rock
And the time's goin' by, tick-tock
For the heart, I just can't love no one but you

Well, I'm high and dry and lonely
I'm as lonely as can be
And I stare out of my window
Well, I can play but I just can't win
And the weather's looking dim
For the heart, I just can't love no one but you

For the heart

For the heart, I just can't love no one but you

Elvis Presley,"Don't look so sad, i know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need o watch the bridges that we're burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops fallin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time

For the good times
I'll get along, you'll find another
And i'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops fallin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time

Elvis Presley,"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
 
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
 
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend

Elvis Presley,"And I can't stop loving you
I said, ""I made up, made up my mind""
To live in memory
Of such an long lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
I said, ""It's useless to say""
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

Now those happy hours
All that we once knew
They're so long ago (so long ago)
They still make, make me blue

Ah they say, ""that time
It heals a broken heart""; oh yes, it does
Ah, but time has stood still
Since we've been apart

And I can't stop loving you
I said, ""I made up, made up my mind""

Elvis Presley,"Hear that lonesome winter bird
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry",I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,1977

For I just don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin

And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold

Won't you come on in
Miracles, I guess
Still happen now and then

Leave your cares behind

Built with you in mind

Knock and the door shall be open
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given

Waiting just for you

That's what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone, you can see

Elvis Presley,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird,1978

Elvis Presley,"There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true
oh why
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear

We're lost in a cloud
With too much rain
We're trapped in a world
That's troubled with pain
But as long as a man
Has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly
Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answer gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle

And while I can think, while I can talk
While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, please let my dream
Come true, right now
Let it come true right now
Oh yeah",If I Can Dream,1978
Elvis Presley,"To dream the impossible dream 
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear the unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To write the unwritable wrong
To be better far than you are
To try when your arms are too weary
The reach the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless,
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Whithout question or pause
To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will be peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world would be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star

",The Impossible Dream (The Quest),1978
Elvis Presley,"Known only to him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him

In this world of fear and doubt
On my knees I ask the question
Why a lonely, heavy cross I must bear
Then he tells me in my prayer
It's because I am trustworthy
He gives me strength far more than my share

Known only to him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future

Thanks for the miracle of Your Rosary

Elvis Presley,"The day that we wed
You blessed us and said
May heaven bestow you grace
There in that holy place

The palaces of the king

Our hearts were filled with spring

Padre, padre
What happened to our love's so cruel
Padre, oh padre
In my grief I turn to you

Then he came along
And sang her his song
And won her with honey lies
He of the fiery eyes
Now it's not her that cries

So I will pray
The hours away
And weary my heart has grown
Wondering where love has flown
Counting my beads alone

Who made the rivers flow to the sea

And who hung the moon and the stars in the sky

The flame of her faith

Slipped out of my hands
And my dreams ran away with the wind
Where did they go, Lord, where did they go?

You know sometimes I wish
I had lost her to another
Well, but, Lord, she just walked off all alone
But all that is within me is the bitter just ending
And bewildered because her love is gone

Oh, the passion I trusted
The truth that I leaned on
And the hope that would forever keep me strong
I cry out my questions
Oh, the answers are all gone

Elvis Presley,"When I think of how He came so far from glory
Came to dwell among the lowly such as I
To suffer shame and such disgrace
On Mount Calvary take my place
Then I ask myself this question
Who am I?

Who am I that The King would bleed and die for
Who am I that He would pray not my will, Thy Lord
The answer I may never know
Why He ever loved me so
But to that old rugged cross He'd go
For who am I?

When I'm reminded of His words
I'll leave Him never
If you'll be true I'll give to you life forever
Oh I wonder what I could have done
To deserve God's only Son
To fight my battles until they're won
For who am I?

Who am I that The King would bleed and die for
Who am I that He would pray not my will, Thy Lord
