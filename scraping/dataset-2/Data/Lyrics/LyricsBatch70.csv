Cliquot Club Eskimos,"My one and only,
What am I gonna do if you turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you

I'd be so lonely
Where am I gonna go if you turn me down
Why blacken all my skies of blue

I tell you I'm not asking any miracle
It can be done, it can be done
I know a clergyman who will roll lyrical
And make us one, and make us one

So my one and only
There isn't a reason why you should turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you

To show affection in your direction
You know I'm fit and able
I more then merely love you sincerely
My cards are on the table

Say there must be lots of other men you hypnotize
All of a sudden I've begun to realize
As follows

My one and only
If you turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you
I'd be so lonely
If you turn me down
Why blacken all my skies of blue

I tell you I'm not asking any miracle
I know a clergyman who will roll lyrical

Oh my one and only
If you turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you",My One and Only,1998
Clit 45,"I'm in over my head

They want to try and build me up so they can tear me down
I wish that I could be back there but I'm right here, right now
They've taken everything that I've had to give and
They say, ""It's over"", but man, I'm still here living

I don't know what to do, I think that maybe
I'm in over my head, stuck in the red
Something they said makes me think that
I'm in over my head, over my head, over my head

I've gotta get away from here and it couldn't be too soon
'Cause I see the stars are new with me like rockets to the moon
You take me everywhere that I've never been in
Show me the meaning of what life had to give in

I don't know what to say, I think that maybe
I'm in over my head, lying in her bed
Something she said it makes me think that
I'm in over my head, over my head, over my head

They've taken everything that I've had to give and
They say, ""It's over"", but man I'm still here living
I don't know what to do, I think that maybe
I'm in over my head, stuck in the red

Something they said, it makes me think that
I'm in over my head, over my head, over my head

Clit 45,"Smash the set, fuck what's next cause this reruns been one for a while
B-O-R-E-D got two fingers up your ass like it's going outta style

What's it gonna take to set us off?
Cause I'm still lost, and at what cost?
This shows went way too long, is this the swan song?

All the guitars want to be next in line
But it's still bullshit fucking waste of time on
Chatterbox punk rock, so cut the fucking talk
Speaking only in reality cause I refuse to fucking be
Just another casualty, because the truth will set you free

What's it gonna take to set us off?
Cause I'm still lost, suck dick till you cough
I'd rather light this match, burn it down and don't look back

What's it gonna take?
Question, seek and destroy",Set It Off,2006
Clive Anderson,"I think that you don't care, 
And its more than I can bare, 
I don't know baby, 
Maybe its all in my mind, all in my mind.

I know that I've been true, 
But honey sweetie baby what about you? 
I don't know baby, 
Maybe its all in my mind.

We've been going steady so long, 
I'd never dream you would ever do me wrong, 
I knew I was yours and I thought you were mine, 
And that every little thing was so fine.

Whoa darling Id hate to see, 
Someone else with you other than me, 
I don't know baby, 
Maybe its all in my mind, 
All in mind, 
Oh, hum, hum, 
Oh yes, its all in my mind.

Please tell me, tell me 
It's all in my mind.",All in My Mind,1996
Clive Anderson,"When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I told them all I had-a faith in you
I-I-I-I just kept on sayin'
Oh no, not my baby; oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies
My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to a-what she said
I-I-I-I kept right on sayin'
Oh no, not my baby; oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys
Well, you might have had a last-minute fling
But I am sure it didn't mean a thing
'Cause yesterday you gave-a me your ring
And now I'm glad that I kept on sayin'
Oh no, not my baby; oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies

Clive Bunker,"In the morning  gonna get my things together.
Packing up and I'm leaving this place.
I don't believe you'll cry, 
There'll be a smile upon your face.

I didn't think how much you'd hurt me.
That's something that I laugh about.

And let the bad times out.

And breathing the air you do, Heaven can wait

Clive Carter,"Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Once in a while
Please promise me you'll try

When you find
That once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way things might have been

Think of me
Think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me
Trying too hard
To put you from my mind

Recall those days
Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you

Can it be
Can it be Christine
Bravo!
Long ago
It seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me
But I remember her

Flowers fade
The fruits of summer fade
They have their seasons
So do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me",Think of Me,1992
Clive Carter,"You were once
My one companion
You were all
That mattered
You were once
A friend and father
Then my world
Was shattered

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Wishing you were
Somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed
Somehow you would
Be here

Wishing I could
Hear your voice again
Knowing that I
Never would
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed
I could

Passing bells
And sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem, for you
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Knowing we must
Say goodbye
Try to forgive
Teach me to live
Give me the strength
To try

No more memories
No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye",Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,1992
Clive Carter,"You ought to know about Mr. Mistoffelees the original Conjuring Cat. 
(There can be no doubt about that.) Please listen to me and don't scoff. 
All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis: 
He holds all the patent monopolies, 
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions.

The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.
And you'll all say: 
Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn.

[Chorus: x2]
And we all say: Oh! 
Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire,

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

Clive Gregson,"Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea,
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up.

Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall.

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up.

Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall.

Agree to disagree but disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of
The things we do for love, the things we do for love",The Things We Do for Love,1990
Clive Gregson,"Those backstreet women, watch what you say
You turn your back and they slide away
They run next door, they give it all away

Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

She's got no teeth, she's got no sense
You don't need much intelligence

Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

Slide over here, slide over there
Spreading that scandal everywhere
Stab you in the back and they just don't care
Doing the slide

Now slander is a loving tongue
They speak your name to everyone
Never is a curse left unsung
Doing the slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife

We were wild, wild boys on a wild weekend
We were down in the dumps and we didn't have to try hard

Oh rock and roll music coming loud and clear
The joint is jumping, no hesitation
We're all giving ourselves free invitation

So we crashed the party

There was Monks and Eddie, and Weasel and Freddy
There was the gang of four, we beat down the door

It was just like Stalag 17

So we got while the getting was good

At last
All too well
I can see
Where we all
Soon will be
If you strip away
The myth
From the man
You will see
Where we all
Soon will be

Jesus
You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've done
Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Nazareth's most famous son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah ah ah ah ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Tell ya sons and daughters
Behind the closed doors it's an old wise man
With the power of destruction at the palm of his hand

A blushing flower.

She rented by the hour.

""Well, that's what comes from
Too much pills and liquor.""

She was the happiest... corpse...

The emptiness that haunts my days is there when I close my eyes

My depravity has taken hold of all I am
It has consumed me to the point I cannot stand
it brings me to my knees
Still I find nothing is changing
God nothing is changing

I am asking myself if there is a point to all this searching?
I feel like there is something I've been missing

I am bearing witness to my multitude of sins; is there and hope left for me?",Wormwood,2011

Watching all of the hours with a bottle of wine

I couldn't see a way to go
I'm scared by failing
Just somebody alive ignoring all of the signs

To take a car out to the sea
With nothing ever in the shadows
And in nothing I believe

And now the lights are turning on here

And taken everything it knows now
About belonging
There's someone I would like to be if I could be but
The path is frightening
So when I fall away then I would like to see
I enter entirely

Cutting up pieces of life and reality

Nothing fancy, just new
I want something I can explore
Give me a bit of you
I want something to fill my time
I don't have much to do
I want something that I can hold

Something about the way you are
Is different to anyone else
You make me forget myself
I'm doing things I've never done before

Too big, too good to be true
I want something no-one else has

Ik gooi mijn jas waar hij vallen wil
En hoop vergeefs op verlossing
Bij het antwoordapparaat

Ik ril en draai de verwarming aan
En zie haar weer in gedachten staan
Zie de trek om haar lippen
Die haar onweerstaanbaar maakt

En ik vraag me af wie nu met haar eet
En haar koffie schenkt maar de melk vergeet
Wie de vaat naar de keuken brengt
En bij zichzelf denkt dat ze de mooiste is

Ik zap en laat een ouwe film staan
Muiterij Op De Oceaan
Wat is het leven simpel
Als je Marlon Brando heet

En ik weet niet wie nu in haar armen rust
En de bange blik uit haar ogen kust
Wie verdwaalt in haar labyrint
Maar voor altijd vindt dat ze de mooiste is

Ooh en ik hoor het graag
Dat de tijd uiteindelijk alle wonden heelt
En ik ooit zal betreuren dat ik
Iedereen met mijn ellende heb verveeld

Ik lees haar brief nog een laatste keer
En leg me maar bij haar woorden neer
Die me altijd opnieuw 
Naar haar stem doen verlangen

En ik vraag me af wie nu bij haar slaapt
En de spinnen 's nachts uit de kamer jaagt
Wie zijn hand op haar lichaam legt
En haar zachtjes zegt dat ze de mooiste is

En dat iedereen, elke man en elke vrouw dan

Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.

They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn

Well if you know what it's like a cold cell drunk frozen at night
You're prob'ly like me try'na gain control of life
But sometime it takes over that's when I grab a gun and just think
Yo' fuck life man I'm under the brink
Music escapes a parasite chooses his fate
Prior to gunfights you sign ya' will as soon as it breaks
And this is real I want rendezvous spots and prize money
Not lethal injection which manifest the equal intentions
Of them grime thunnys holdin down ya' local street block
That gave the notion of commotion cities open detox
The cleansing begins without trees the most paranoid yo'
Inflictin' in situations that most can't avoid
For sure caps have backfired bodies been caught
Quarterbacks is necropheliacs when shotties get cocked
And once ya' shit is cocked pull it
'cause if not you might see yourself goin' crazy
Thinkin' you can use your back to block bullets

With a spliff it don't take long to commence to a brain war Sonny
High when I'm writin' this shit like the sky
When it's lightnin' and thunderin' now my mind could adjust it
Public and toxic and seein' life in different degrees
If I want it I got it especially when hittin' this green
I ain't even gotta struggle my rappin' is kind of puzzled
Hard to get a grip chief smoke relaxin' my muscle
Sober niggaz hold it down I keep my actions above you
Below the ground I blow a pound and be excited as shit
It never occurred to me gettin' pissed and mad at the world
Could be a criminal with hot hands and nines in his grip
Not blamin' pitiful cats for the lame excuse for the packin' of tools
Open you up like a surgeon occupation nigga

And french fries they sell

Under the Boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my boyfriend's where I'll be

Under the Boardwalk, out of the sun
Under the Boardwalk, we'll be having some fun
Under the Boardwalk, people walking above
Under the Boardwalk, we'll be making love
Under the Boardwalk, Boardwalk

Club des Belugas,"Left New York this morning early
Traveling south so wide and high
Sailing through the wide blue yonder
It's that air mail special on the fly

Listen to the motors humming
She is streaking through the sky
Like a bird that's flying homeward
It's that air mail special on the fly

Over plains and high dark mountains
Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California
It's that air mail special on the fly

Watch her circle for the landing
Hear her moan and cough and sigh
Now she's coming down the runway
It's that air mail special on the fly",Air Mail Special [Cdb Remix],2011
Club Dogo,"Ehi mi avevan detto: ""Questo ghiaccio non lo scioglierai""
E invece brucia ancora frà brucia ancora zio
Eh si e allora
Bella Ax
Dogo, J-Ax: brucia ancora
Rap n Roll, Milano, D-O-G-O
Bella zio

Dimmi se brucia ancora
Ma già lo vedo quando suona e vivete una vita intera in un'ora
Non mi accontento mai di poco
Magari non lo faccio il disco d'oro ma faccio un disco di fuoco
Ed è un borseggio se invento una rima
'Fanculo quella la parcheggio e la scrivo peggio di prima
Milano è il capolinea come per Luciano Leggio
Te lo fa bruciare ancora come Greggio al provino di una velina

Questa dev'essere la musica perfetta
Droga che si inietta nell'orecchia raffinata in cameretta
Notti insonni penna e sigaretta
Lascio voi zombie fuori dalla finestra
Il suono dell'ingranaggio che s'inceppa
Teenager 'sta ceppa
È un virus che t'infetta
È consapevolezza in vena non è un assegno
E per guarirmi mi avvelena come la chemio

Mi avevan detto: ""Questo ghiaccio non lo scioglierai""
Le tue strade saran sempre più fredde
È un compromesso come il cash che non basta mai
Le tue tasche saran sempre più strette
Ma io mi sento come il sole che tra poco esploderà
E intanto brucia ancora
Mi avevan detto che: ""Sarebbe passata con l'età""
E, invece, brucia ancora

Questo dev'essere il mio film preferito
Quello che vivo che al cinema non è mai uscito
Anche se io e mio fratÈ, litighiamo per un grammo
Anche se io e mia madre litighiamo per il grano
Vieta il preservativo condanna il Dio denaro
Senza cash non ci vivo, senza il primo mi ammalo
E anche se stai navigando in un mare di guai
Sarà V di vendetta V di vittoria se vuoi lo fai!

Ancora Vivo, ancora Primo, ancora Divo
Brucia ancora come il culo, di chi ha detto che fallivo
Caro amico ti scrivo, la mia milionesima rima
Io non la passo 'sta torcia e verso benzina
La ragazzina pende su J-Ax, tira giù Hilary Duff
I nostri fans non hanno più un'età precisa
E stanno nei fiorini bianchi
La mattina con la V di vaffanculo al mondo, io vivo come prima

Mi avevan detto: ""Questo ghiaccio non lo scioglierai""
Le tue strade saran sempre più fredde
È un compromesso come il cash che non basta mai
Le tue tasche saran sempre più strette
Ma io mi sento come il sole che tra poco esploderà
E intanto brucia ancora
Mi avevan detto che: ""Sarebbe passata con l'età""
E, invece, brucia ancora

Leggo gli occhi dei miei frà, come un libro
Figli della follia che c'è in giro
La strada scotta ci cammino sopra fachiro
Brucia ancora come quando da bambino il mio scettro era una biro
Quando dicevano: ""Lui può ma non si applica""
Mò il disco dà fastidio ai tanti che sono in classifica
A chi è con me qua schiavo di 'sti codici
Mentali verbali, penali ma con la testa ai Tropici

Qua non finisce come i libri di Moccia
'Sto amore quando brucia manda sotto la roccia
Fusi da troppe invidie, vogliono farmi
Ma la musica non s'uccide non serve che vi accanite
Perché musica del demonio
Per chi l'ha sulla pelle, frà, il fuoco di Sant'Antonio
E brucia ancora quando appoggio sopra al foglio questa penna
E vi vedo che lo cantante a memoria schiacciate sulla transenna

Mi avevan detto: ""Questo ghiaccio non lo scioglierai""
Le tue strade saran sempre più fredde
È un compromesso come il cash che non basta mai
Le tue tasche saran sempre più strette

Questa roba è proprio ""Ciao proprio""
La trinità Jake, Guè Peq, Marracash
Senti bene, frà, see

Rimo da quando i frà, ti rubavano il Barbour
Gremo e cammino sui muri tipo parkour
Parlo di strada come un Tom-Tom o un Garmin
Non ho ancora imparato come comportarmi
Scandalo flow, Guerciopoli
Quando le spruzzo in gola, zio, Propoli
'Sto rap fa brutto come l'ultima corsa sopra la 91
E sempr, ""Io sì, tu no""
E se prendo il mic e se prendo il mic
Sono mani in faccia come tecktonick
E poi salti in aria, frà, te fai kaboom
Come giù a Kabul
Quando vengo lì
Scoprire la droga
E' stato anche più grande, frà, dell'uomo di Neanderthal che scopre la ruota
Alla festa ti scavallo il Moët e ne bevo un litro
Hai una testa di cavallo nel letto tipo Don Vito
Noi siamo il rap italiano, voi siete morto che parla 47

See, più passa il tempo e più sono il peggio
La storia è sempre chee più me ne danno e più me ne prendo
E non le sento più
Io e te sai che differenza c'è
A partire dalla faccia
Come spacco questa traccia
Dimmi, ""Si o no"" sono il boss del flow?
Questo è Marra e Club Dogo e tu dici, ""Ciao proprio""

Questi pischelli vogliono Don Joe, non il Nongio
Vieni sotto il palco mentre rappo e fatti una doccia di flow
Marra, Jake e Gué tipo che siamo il meglio di sempre
La trinità, frà, il fottuto presepe vivente
Amores Perros il vero riconosce il vero
Il falso riconosce il ferro tu riconosci il gergo
Ho detto, ""Non gridare troppo"" a quella troia
Sì, dove sto ora i miei vicini è gente che lavora
Non cambia la storia lo Stato arresta
Vuole eliminare il criminale solo perché gli fa concorrenza
Marra resta un pazzo con un piano in testa che tira avanti
Scavalcando i barboni e schivando i mendicanti
Chiama l'antitrust perché qua va così
E tu conti meno dell'indiano dei Black Eyed Peas
Il corriere fa carriera e gira su un Porsche Carrera
Questa è l'Italia mettimi assente e dammi 10 in pagella

Eh me ne fotto di tutti e sono sempre fuori
Perché la vita fa schifo, frà, e dopo muori
Zio, non dormo coi fantasmi che mi porto appresso
Però ho successo perché spacco non spacco il cazzo per il successo
Scrivo un testo con il cuore, la penna infarta
Scrivo un testo su un foglio, frà, e dopo è una bomba carta
Il flow me lo taroccano come le Nike ad Hong Kong
Sono il re dei synth, frà, chiamami King Korg
Sono un Cuba con la cala dentro, tu sei un bitter
Frà, ti ascolti il rap hai l'avatar con Adolf Hitler
Non hai mai visto un palco, zio, però quante scritte
Sei un MC, solo dentro casa con Twitter
Fai ridere come il popper
Se scrivo una notte, zio, schiaccio la tua carriera come gli Harlem Globetrotters
Perché se più te ne danno e più te ne prendi
Frà, te quando ti alzi scopri che adori il sangue tra i denti

Pensavo a fare feste su feste
col tempo si sono bruciate teste su teste
e riguardo alle tipe
ne ho collezionate mille come paia di sneakers.
Abituati a dire: “non ho nulla, tenente”
adesso sempre in giro con chi è nulla tenente
tutta la mia gente ha più di un precedente
voglio te ma so che hai più di un pretendente.

Ringrazia me se oggi fai il rap e ti metti qualcosa in tasca

Io ti chiamerò, chissà se hai ancora del tempo per me
Quando tornerò saranno tutti quanti in strada
Sentirmi come a casa, preparati a quando tornerò

Quando tornerò non ci sarai tu ad aspettarmi
Tutto quel che so è che mi sento in viaggio da anni
Uno come me quando ce la fa ostenta
Finché non avrà il culo su una Bentley Continental
Una come te, baby, non è mai contenta
Io schiaccio finché questa vita chiederà la cuenta
Ricordi quando ti dicevo ""non aver paura""
Quella notte chiusa in casa con la paranoia dura
Per te ho rischiato gli occhi neri come la censura
Io non credo più a nessuno adesso anche se me lo giura
Ora che sto tornando voglio i fratelli accanto
E quando son lontano vivono in quello che canto
Il cemento vivo in cui anneghiamo
Il cemento che non rinneghiamo

Io ti chiamerò, chissà se hai ancora del tempo per me
Quando tornerò saranno tutti quanti in strada
Sentirmi come a casa e vedere la tua faccia

Io ti chiamerò, chissà se hai ancora del tempo per me
Quando tornerò saranno tutti quanti in strada
Sentirmi come a casa, preparati a quando tornerò

Lì da voi dopo lo show, al domani poi ci penserò
Tutti i miei guai li lascio in box e se ci sarai quando tornerò
Casa mia è una città, qualcuno lì mi aspetta già
Qualcuno no ma ciò che so è che di sicuro starò bene

Gli occhi su di me come se entravo tardi in classe
Gli occhi su di me come ora che spacco le casse
Nato in inverno in cui per non aver freddo non cerco una sposa
Mi basta soltanto una nuova calda giacca di marca costosa.
Guardo in strada fuori c’è solamente miseria
Contro I nostri cuori gelo la siberia
E la cosa buffa è che volevo te
Mica tutte queste cagne come west
Dici che mi vuoi bene, vuol dire che non mi ami

Regalarti ancora quello che ancora non hai

E più soldi sono più problemi hai
Cercavamo l’oro come nel crondai
Pensavamo no di non farcela mai
Noi due soli con una marlboro light
Ci bastava così poco ora non tornerai

Volevo svoltare soltanto per non incontrare lo sguardo degli altri
Volevamo prenderci il mondo ma non c’era niente che potessi darti
Per farlo ho dovuto sporcarmi tanto che tu non riuscivi a guardarmi
Perciò oggi da grande faccio I soldi veri non faccio più finta di farli.
Per fare dei passi avanti ho perso un po’ l’equilibrio
Sta vita consuma sa di petrolio fai 2 con un litro
Ho corso così tanto dietro a tutto questo cash
Che ho lasciato indietro chi correva assieme a me.
Se avessi dovuto comprare la vita che vivo
L’amore saprebbe di niente e il successo mi farebbe schifo
I soldi non mi daranno indietro l’ultima volta che hai riso
L’oro del mondo non fonde per fare le chiavi del paradiso.
Schiacciami col tacco 12, spezza le carte di codici
Torniamo quelli che eravamo se non puoi amarmi almeno odiami
Stringimi forte fino alla morte e lasciami dire che ti amo
Poi tappami dentro una bara di soldi però con la tua foto in mano.

Francesco è cresciuto uno zanza lo stesso.
Papà mi ha dato la creatività
frate l'ho buttati dentro al cesso e ho fatto i soldi col rap
e tu non hai le basi giuste, peccato
per essere La Furia più zarro del booster specchiato.

Dimmi in quel tavolo di scemi cosa centri tu?
Vieni da noi so che ti piacciono i tattoo
e tu lo sai che bevo e fumo
e questa ganja è il mio profumo
sappiamo tutti che faresti per dei follower in più.
Io sono zarro, zarro, zarro
con tutto questo oro giallo, giallo, giallo.

Tifo per me fra non per una nazionale
in classifica per 52 settimane
la tua tipa c'ha un bel culo ma di faccia è un cane
me la faccio con in testa il sacchetto del pane.
Io non faccio bla bla bla, frà parlano i fatti
no pubblicità, gli haters me la fanno gratis
guardo i rapper nella vasca dei piranha
mentre mangio picanha con la più cagna.
C'ho l'oro in bocca peggio della comunione
collane con i santi, madonne e corone
tu vestiti da donna, da leader
con l'abito firmato non danno pure lo stile.
E frate sono zarro, zarro, zarro
lo vedi se mi fai uno sgarro, sgarro, sgarro
alzo bicchieri di cristallo
solo perché sono il migliore a farlo

Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt

Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil

Fühl ich mich im Kern wie'n Weisenkind auf der Suche nach dem heißen Sinn,
Der kleinen Ewigkeit nur is' das eklig weit,
Also beweg ich mich halt auf dem Lebensasphalt in Richtung FREIHEIT,
Die ein fürstlich empfängt, wenn man sich auskennt,
Dabei bleibt, seinem Schatten voraus rennt,
Nur brauch'ich auch mal Zeit um mich mal auszuruh'n, abzumatten,
Résume zu zieh'n den Rest der Welt laut auszubuhen,
Deswegen such' nach Beinen verkrampft wie'n Epileptiker,
Beweg mich tagtäglich und täglich wird es heftiger,
Ich bin nicht lebensmüde, nur brauch ich Ruhe vor morgen,
Wie kann ich für Ruhe sorgen wenn ich ständig umworben von Großstadtlärm und Musik bin,
Von Props ausgesetzt wie Kritik bin schweißgebadet wie'n fick bin,
Ich brauch' nen Tempel,
Nicht das Loch wo meine Sachen stehen ich mein zu Hause,

Dass das Wort dauerhaft für mein Domizil auf Dauer halt beschiss bleibt,

Ich bleib nun mal der Mann,
„deplaziert“ greift mein Gedankengang,
Nur schwer komm ich dagegen an,
Ihr seit der Meinung alles kalter Kaffee was ich sag,
Den nächsten Platz, die nächste Stadt seh ich am nächsten Tag,
Deswegen halt ich's nie lang aus, außer am Mikrophon,
Ich weiß, mein Refugium bleibt wie ich vorm Publikum,
Es gibt viele dessen Weitsicht ist so ausgeprägt,
Dass das momentane Herz nur kleinlich schlägt,
Sich alles peinlich bewegt, alles sinnlos klein scheint wie von oben herab,
Man nicht mehr Sinn für Ruhe nur noch Sinn fürs Toben hat,
Was ich sag wirkt verboten hart,
Aber ich sag nur was ich fühl'.

Dauernd sitzen ist für mich zuviel,
Will mich bewegen was bewirken,
Das mit Überschall,
Ich will von Stadt zu Stadt,
Denn zu Hause bin ich überall.

Sollte verbunden sein zum Meer

Und so erscheint das nichts so bleibt, wie es ist

Clutch,"Squinting from blinding rays of the sun
Deep in the heart of July
There to perform for children of corn
Whose crops stood well twelve foot high
Three knaves remained to the end of the day
We refused their vile entreats
Standing our ground 
We played for the ears between the harvester's teeth

Great plains, hardcore scenes
May not be the biggest but, lord, they're mean
And though my mind has been shot to hell
The details of that night I remember well

Gravel and locust, they swore to rope us
We did our best to steer straight
Trailer and hitch, straight into the ditch
Praying to Jesus and the holy saints
Despite the violence, sometimes I look back
A nostalgia begins to take hold
Wisdom of sorts is found in due course
In the rows of silver and gold

Look dude, why don't you try some old-fashioned PMA

Stalked by the fury of John Brown's eyes
And still the storm hasn't cleared

That come from the sea

And so my beloved
When red leaves are falling
The love bells shall ring out
Yes, ring out for you and me

I hear they are calling
The young loves and the true loves
That come from the sea

And so my beloved
When the red leaves are falling
The love bells shall ring out
Ring out for you and me

He said, ""Money, honey!
Yes, money, honey!

If you want to stay with me

I was cleaned and skinned and so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I love the best

She said, ""I'd like to know what you want with me""

I said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,

A-how could another man take my place?""

She said, ""Money, honey!

I'm wondering how all my feelings changed
Do you remember even half the shit we used to do
And how it used to be
I wish it was different
All these feelings inside me
But I still believe
(I mean what are you saying then, damn)

That it could be different
(You know I miss the butterflies, the look in your eyes, how they would shine)
It could be different
(And now it feels like it's over baby)
That it could be different
(If you would realize that you need to set aside just a little time to)
It could be different
I know we can make it better baby

No I can't keep living on memories
What if where this is turning
This isn't meant to be
We used to get lifted
The love we craved it so insatiably
And lately I've been missing all the little things

Maybe I got comfortable with the way you was treating me
Hot meals cooked up, way you would feed me
I'm selfish, how could I let my fear defeat me
Scared of something different, and I see you complete me
But ay I don't like to argue a bit
I promise I'll change if I ain't gotta hear your lip
Oh I'm sorry, I'm saying
But you don't respect
You don't listen you're no different
(Shit, Gotdamn it)
Save your breath

That it could be different
(I know you saying I should change, through out time I ain't the same in my ways)
It could be different
(And now it feels like it's over babe)
(I see you're feelings start to fade, it's all my fault huh' your feelings ain't the same)
That it could be different
(Ma, why is you mad, acting like everything I do is bad)
It could be different
(You got some issues too, listen it ain't nothing we can't get through)
I know we can make it better baby

You're high I'm low
And still this distance seems to grab a hold
I miss you so and making love still feels like coming home
We fuss we fight I leave
You might but then you make it right
But still at night I can't stand the sight of you not in my life

That it could be different
(You know I miss the butterflies, the look in your eyes, how they would shine)
It could be different
(And now it feels like it's over baby)
That it could be different
(If you would realize that you need to set aside just a little time to)

I know we can make it better baby

Lets take it back to the picnics at Tilden
Flicks with the children
Talks by the lake
Walks through your building
The feeling of fresh love
Can't dismiss this
I know that you miss it

Permanent kisses
The flirting and wishing
Before all the back and forth huffing and hissing
Hear me and listen
I remember our mission

 kizu tsuku dake kizu tsuite wakatta hazu no kotae wo 
 doushite mada toikaketeru ? 
 Am I wrong to be hurt 
 am I wrong to feel pain 
 am I wrong to be in the rain 
 am I wrong to wish the night won't end 
 am I wrong to cry 
 but I know, it's not wrong to sing THE LAST SONG 
 cause forever fades 
 ki ga tsukeba mata hitori yoru no sora wo mitsumeteru 
 sukoshi zutsu kieteyuku our memories 
 kizu tsuku dake kizu tsuite wakatta hazu no kotae wo 
 doushite mada toikaketeru ? 
 I see red 
 I see blue 
 But the silver lining gradually takes over 
 When the morning begin 
 I'll be in the next chapter

Peel his cap back
Run nigga ya best ta run, jog to the cluck,
Buckin on my way tossed the gun
And now I'm rollin like ain't nuthin went on
But I'm knowin I did that dirt
So I'm knowin I can't go home
Shiiit just a little trip
Puffin on a little endo
Lay low
Servin the cluckers and clockin a couple of see-notes
Park around the corner from the spot uh
'cause nigga we slangin rocks and the spot it got hot
So I bails up the block with that gangsta strut
Rememba the po po hot with my Cavi in my butt
Stepped on the porch gave my nigga some dap
Hatin at the see-o-p's

Me tienes a tus pies
Desde la primera vez que yo te vi me enamoraste
Me asombraste con lo linda que te vez
De los pies a la cabeza todo te queda bien
Desde que tu llegaste mi mundo esta al revés

Y contigo, solo quiero estar contigo
Yo quiero detener el tiempo
Cuando tu me miras y yo te miro
Y solo contigo, solo quiero estar contigo
Yo quiero detener el tiempo
Cuando tu me miras y yo te miro

Porque tu me miras y yo
Siento lo mismo que tu
Cuando te miro siento, que me estoy enamorando
Porque tu me miras y yo
Siento lo mismo que tu
Cuando te miro siento, que me estoy enamorando

Serán tus ojos, será tu pelo
Y ese perfume, que esta en tu cuerpo
Es como un sueño, de tí no despierto
Cuando te acercas te quiero besar
Es que no puedo aguantar, estas ganas de tí
No puedo aguantar, es que te quiero para mi
Todo cambio desde que te vi y junto a tí es que quiero estar

Y contigo, solo quiero estar contigo
Yo quiero detener el tiempo
Cuando tu me miras y yo te miro oh oh

Yo quiero que tus ojos me miren
Y que tus labios me besen
Para que nunca me olvides
Cuando bailas me estremeces

La baby multiplatino
Vacilon pasándola fino
Tu eres la jefa de jefas, yo soy el padrino
Lo mio contigo bebita fue repentino
Estoy seguro que tu y yo tenemos el mismo destino
Conmigo es que vacila
El Tigere la mira
El DJ puso un Dembow y un paso se tira
Me abraza y en el oído me suspira
Pero siente el ritmo y rápido se vira

Porque tu me miras y yo, siento lo mismo que tu
Cuando te miro siento, que me estoy enamorando oh oh oh
Porque tu me miras y yo, siento lo mismo que tu
Cuando te miro siento que me estoy enamorando (Que me estoy enamorando oh oh oh)",Tan Fácil [Remix],2016

Eres dueño de tu cuerpo 
Y yo sigo siendo el mismo que va en busca de tu amor 
Antes no podía ver 
Ya que me quite las vendas veo que mueres por él 

Y si te vas 
Quien me dará 
Todo lo que siempre soñé 
Quien le dirá al corazón 
Que jamás nunca te tendré 

Quisiera tenerte en cada primavera 
Poder amarte a mi manera 
Desvelarme la noche entera 
Cuidar tus sueños así quisiera 

Obsequiarte cada segundo 
Y a su guión borrar un punto
Para añadirme en él 
Y así por siempre estar juntos 

Cómo explicarte lo que siento 
Me estoy enloqueciendo
El doctor me recetó 
Un poquito de tu afecto y no estás
Eres la cura de mi enfermedad
El caso parece de gravedad
Y venga mi princesa que el tiempo no regresa
Y yo por ti pongo el mundo de cabeza
Rosas, chocolate quiero regalarte
Un millón de besos tengo para darte

Cada mañana recordarte que te quiero

Tengo la solución

Dale, que estoy yo bailando

I'm bout to put this HK, in your motherfucking mizzouth

Got em hooked like nicotine, in the cigarettes

Young rich nigga, hoes a dime a dozen
The older that I grew, I knew a ho ain't nothing
It's more than fucking that was high school shit
I moved my gurl in, it's me her and the pits
Six in the yard, I give thanks to God
For making it easy though they say it would be hard
And me and my gurl gone stack it up for a while
And when I wake up, first thing I see is her smile
And when she has my child I'll be the happiest on earth
And I'm a be there every second of it's birth
And it don't even matter, if it's a girl or it's a boy
Cause the last name is gone be Troy

Storms will come, this we know for sure
Tell me baby can you stand the game

Verse 3: Pastor Troy

Sometimes I wonder do you miss me how I miss you
Can't wait to get back to the crib so I can kiss you
It crack me up because you could have been but gave it up
But you stay with me cause no matter what you give a fuck
Therefore we stuck-together like paste and glue, hey baby its me and you
Forever we made a vow, so we gots to do it now
I know you believe in me, just say what you want to be
And we will have everything, if you can just stand the game

I don't pretend to know what you want

I am not afraid of the dark
Where your words devour my heart
And put me to shame, put me to shame

Whenever I am by your side
And dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone

You're still so young to travel so far
Old enough to know who you are
Wise enough to carry the scars
Without any blame, there's no one to blame
It's easy to forget what you learned
Waiting for the thrill to return
Feeling your desire burn
And drawn to the flame

When your seven worlds collide
Whenever I am by your side
Dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone
Dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone

Washed out in the flood

It made me laugh, and I just had to laugh.

That house, it took it's toll
For some of you this heartfelt
May be heartfelt, for me
I sold my soul

Have fun now back in the real world
all curled no one to hear your cries
and unheard prayers
I'm the one, you made me
Pirate, poet, kind of despair

All of the pain
and all of the games
I hope you all feel the same
I gave you the good
You gave me the bad
I'll give you the hurt today

Chorus(x2)

And they shall know no good or peace
Nor shall their suffereing ever cease

Until they humbly come to me and beg for mercy on their knees
Which I may grant, if I should please

This is the worst, yet the best
For my vengeance, for the rest
Vendetta

Chorus(x2)

Coal Chamber,"Let down through the breakthrough
I travel as I hunger for the darkness below me
When I'm praying for the light above
To save this soul inside me

Should I? Would I? Could I?

Outcast from my own kind never knowing
Soaring through my own mind never knowing
How could they live with what their doing
Twist of my spine

Oh god, fuck

I don't get it, breathe with me
Just breathe with me

It's up to me as I hunger
Lay slow and still as I wonder
Pray for darkness down in this hollow
But I try to grope

It's up to me as I sleep again
My body lays down as I holler
It's all inside but I confess in me
I like me

Coalesce,"So shallow, not even an infant
Could drown within this compassion
But I feel as if I've drowned just the same
But rather from my ignorance
That unconditional love might exist

I forgot the numbness, I forgot the frustration
That makes up my daily routine of just getting by
I am just barely getting by emotionally
Judgment, disappointment, a lack of patience for me
This is not security but such a pretty package

The guise is broken as the truth rears it's ugly head unto me
A drunken soul, I'm conscious again, I've weakened from my stupor
For the last time, so content caressed in rejection
For it's all that love has ever led to once again

The dying man lays down the law for this peon
It's his last grasp at control, a control that he lost
In infidelity from today, to you I'm dead
As an order accepting son, your searching and searching
But your family isn't at the bottom of any bottle

You're smoking us away, you're choking on your own
No place to hide other than my tears, they still give me away
