Feel me nigga, fuck with us nigga
Whattup?

If it's a gun I don't mind to pull it
Hit your son with the nine millimeter with the rhino bullets
Know S.P.'ll lose your peeps
Come through in a bullshit hoopty with the Gucci seats
With some Brooklyn bitches that'll boost for weeks
So you know I stay fresh for days
Tote the gun in your mouth, tell you death is just a breath away
You alone like The Castaway

Listen dawg, if you ain't pass a dude then you pass away
They ain't tell you that the Ghost was here?
You ain't seen me comin'?
Told your man that the coast was clear
Now I'm tearin' off both your ears
Kick in the door, load the shotty watch the sofa tear
Y'all scarface niggaz, Sosa here
So the army and the coke are here, we loc' out here

They ain't tell you that I Ryde or Die?
Thirty niggaz on your block, only five alive
Shit, they ain't tell you that I'm harder than Brillo
I'ma give your mother the wire, your father the pillow
I don't play too much, I weigh too much
And when it comes to the drugs, I weigh too much
And I don't say too much, I spray too much
Step over the dead body then I blaze the dutch, what? My niggaz

You know what?
I'm takin' over the game 'cause niggaz is lame and everybody's so butt
You know why?
'Cause I feel I could, I Ryde or Die and everyday I'm so high
You know where?
Right in they crib in front of they kids, I feel I gotta go there
You know when?
I ain't tellin' you niggaz so load up your guns or join up in Gold's Gym

I buy back haze just to get me weeded
One cornball nigga just to get me heated
Listen nigga I am not playin'
He gon' know, the .3 gon' blow and he gon' see the shots sprayin'
Wrong end of the barrel
Too bad but I'ma ring your bell like a Christmas carol
If I run out of bullets
The ghost is a sag and I don't ever miss with arrows

Got a old, old soul, I miss the pharaohs
I am too deep for you, street for you
Wanna fuck with S.P. I'll bring the heat to you
Five niggaz holdin' Tec's on a creek for you
Make the whole family weep for you
Too bad that, they was too sad but you was a scumbag
What? And that's why you fuckin' with dickheads
If they drive through the block I'm turnin' the whip red

Y'all better keep shiftin' ahead
'Fore I take your nose off, put your lips in the head
And all the fiends call me the pusher
But if you see my knife work then you call me the butcher
And it ain't no meat I cut
I'm S.P. listen dawg, I run every street I touch
And you oughta come fuck with the ghost
I got butter open your mouth, see if you could fuck with the toast

You know what?
I'm takin' over the game 'cause niggaz is lame and everybody's so butt
You know why?
'Cause I feel I could, I Ryde or Die and everyday I'm so high
You know where?
Right in they crib in front of they kids, I feel I gotta go there
You know when?
I ain't tellin' you niggaz so load up your guns or join up in Gold's Gym

You know what?
I'm takin' over the game 'cause niggaz is lame and everybody's so butt
You know why?

You know where?
Right in they crib in front of they kids, I feel I gotta go there

J. Lo
We off the block this year
Went from a LOW to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm goin' and I know where I'm from
You hear LOX in your ear
Yea, we're at the airport out decline from the block
Where everybody air-forced-out
With a new white Tee, you fresh
Nothin' phony with us, make the money, get the mansion, bring the homies with us

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)

From In Living Color and movie scripts
To On the 6 to J. Lo to this headline clips
I stayed grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real, I thought I told you
I really been on Oprah
That's just me
Nothing phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got

Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)

I'm down to earth like this
Rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing, kid
Love my life and my public
Put God first
Then can't forget to stay real
To me it's like breathing

It take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, now assets
You get back what you put out
Even if you take the good route
Can't count the hood out
After a while, you know who to blink with
Just keep it real with the ones came in with
Best thing to do is stay low, LOX and J. Lo
Act like they don't, but they know

Styles,"I'm standing here in my field of dreams,
Your love has passed me by it seems,
And the sun has hidden his face for another day.
I'm gonna take you by the hand,
And lead you through these precious lands,
And listen to the words you have to say.

Come on baby take hold of me,
Feel my dreams and set me free,
I know the truth and i know you believe,
You touch supplies my energy.

Come on baby take hold of me,
Feel my dreams and set me free,
I know the truth and i know you believe,
Your touch supplies my energy.

It's a matter of fact and its plain to see,
The love that burns inside of me,
I like to lead you back here by my side.
These memories might never last,
A broken dream held from the past,
And a passion that is lost within my mind

Come on baby take hold of me,
Feel my dreams and set me free,
I know the truth and i know you believe,
Your touch supplies my energy.

So full of sparkle and such light,

Styles,"Called back in time by the ancient winds
Can't you recall all the memories?
Walking the lost way of those who lived in loneliness 

Think of the joy and the endless days
One step aside and the skies were gre
why Is this a life or just a game to lose or win? 

Cause a day will turn into night
And the spirits will rise
There will come then a time to understand...
Deep inside 

Blessed by the rain falling from above
Could you imagine where life would take you 
Now that you're praying for everyone you hurt so bad? 

Still, don't you go, got to make a choice
Crying in silence, crying with no voice
Dare you to stay now and keep your strength up till the end?... 

Cause a day will turn into night
And the spirits will rise
Hold your breath, keep your eyes wide open 

Now you see: the night is so clear
And you feel: the spirits are here
Running free, running free without fear
You'll find a way to the brightest light... 

And now
Here I am, open arms
Thought your life was over when
There you saw in the sky
A ray of light,
So here I am 

Will the stars keep shining bright
Till one day they may ignite?
When you gaze at the sky above,
I'll ever come down
To ease your solitude... 

And now
Here I am, open arms
Thought your life was over when
There you saw in the sky
A ray of light,
So here I am 

There you saw in the sky
A ray of light
Always by your side
There will come a time to understand!!",Here I Am,2005

Alone tonight, 
Stars shining bright, 
And I dream that you're beside me, 
I wait for you...

Heaven knows if only he loved me

And my heart beats, 
Just like a drum, 
And my heart beats, 
It goes boom, boom, boom,

You started this desire,

We have begun, 
Won't you put your arms around me?

It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please cause we belong together

Haha, remix, Desert Storm

Uh, yo, show your respect whenever you hear me or see me
(This is the emancipation of Mimi)
Hot like the real fever (the real diva)
So successful yet still so eager
No matter what they say it's on forever
(It's our time right now) more than ever
(To the death) we are going to get it on together
And M-C, you know we belong together

I lost a part of me, when you left boy, can't you see
Boy come back baby please because we belong together
Who am I going to lean on when times get rough
Who's going to talk to me till the sun comes up
Who's going to take your place there is nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be wit you
Only you can make it right, make it right, make it right

We belong together like the sun in the summertime
Bounce in a lemon range (skip in a hummer lime)
(P and Kiss in and out) Mariah on the other line
Baby I'm a come back (believe it'll come a time)
(We belong together like peanut butter and jelly)
Februaries and skellies, after parties and tellies
(Feeling you in my stomach like you a part of my belly)
Baby I'm a come back with every part of you ready

I lost a part of me, when you left boy, can't you see

Who's going to take your place there is nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio singing to me
If you think you're lonely now, wait until tonight
Boy I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, crying, trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song is not even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (let's go)

You going to need a shoulder to cry on
Classic Mustang Cobra to ride on
Past is the past, just let it be bygones
Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on
Let's get it straight
If it's the six or the quarter to eight
(Then I'm throwing Baby face or Shy on)
Yeah and Kiss, ghost and MC
Get close and toast to the diva and MC
(Uh the trees will blow)
(Big cups, Pino Grigio) take it easy, you
(We belong together, we know that)
(Now I think that it's bout time we show that)
(Even though every moment won't be a Kodak) you
(Sometimes we argue, I spaz out, grab my bozak)
(Come back not because I have to, I want to)
(And no I don't just want to have you, I want you, uh)

Two twelve gauges take you threw the stages
Bullets running low but yours been there for ages
Cob web niggaz iced out slob like I'm on a fucking bob sled niggaz

It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone

You heard it from the P, you oughta know it's the truth
I get you kidnapped and raped and thrown off a roof
You could nod your head to this like it's only a rap
'Cause when these bullets hit yo' ass I'm like it's only a gat

I need a funeral to feel good, I'm hopin it's yours
Think he religious? Heard he got shot in the cross
Holiday Styles, bitch I broke most of the laws
Fuck with the Porsche or flip to the boots, stick to the truth

Do anything it takes just to get me this loot
And missin' a tooth, but both of 'em chipped, toaster is gripped
You heard about the trouble, I start most of the shit
When I squeeze ain't no controllin' the wrist

And niggas leave the room when they hear the P flowin to Swizz
I'm an ignorant and negative nigga
I sell crack, bust guns, pop shit, and say I'm better than niggas
You think not, I'll look at your man and level a nigga

If you think a rapper's better why don't you give me his name
So I can run up on him, tear him up and give you his frame
When it comes to the streets, I'm the nigga to call
Five eight and three quarters, but I'm bigger than why'all

If I left the gun home, I'ma give you the sword
I'm the devil in the flesh, I can't give you the Lord
It don't make no sense for you to pray for your life
I got my niggas in the crib, you oughta pray for your wife

Yo..
I do it all for my niggas, even ride wit a bomb
Get shot, die in his arm, and give him my last
It's a million dollar bail, I'ma get it in cash

I sell crack like it's '88, I live in the past
You know the P carry the gun, live in the Maz'
Tell niggas show me the money and gimme the stash
I like Malibu and pineapple, fifties of hash

Hundreds of 'dro, wear my clothes a week in a row
Sleep on the floor, catch me right next to the dog
I'm Holiday Styles, and that's what the weaponry for
And I probably won't blow for the fact that I'm hard

But I'm good with ten million in the back of the car
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard
Gettin' jewels from the old timers, stashin the cards
But jail ain't part of the plans

I keep weight on the scale 'cause I feel I get further with grams
In my last few bars, I run through niggas like my last few cars
And crash 'em up, the boy mighta went platinum but don't gas him up
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut

I don't deal with the snakes and fakes
But I deal with the comas and wakes, I don't make mistakes
Double are now bitch you oughta know I'ma ghost
Blow up your face, blow up the coke, and blow up the smoke

Yea it's the ghost Jada and Eve
I squeeze my shit, I don't wave it and leave
Y'all motherfuckin' extra lame
Here's the game, when I shoot seeds, your man can catch your brain
He looked a hero when he drove the taxi in the hallway
Shootin' niggas down if they clothes is tacky
Get an 18 or brick and my clothes is khaki
And the Porsche got a glass roof
The blunt got a live purple haze in it, little bit of hash too
See me when I pass through, fuck around and I'ma blast you
Do what I have to, tryin' to get my math too
I leave a message, ain't a phone I use
I call my niggas, bat 'em down, they bones I bruise
Leave 50 niggas dead, niggas know my groove
Another 20 more engine niggas know my tools
I got a gun, you need to stand fo'
Fuck you bring yo man fo?

I gave you the best flows
On top of that, I even made niggas set goals
I wanna know how many bullets can your flesh hold
Thirty-two, or whatever the tech holes
My dirty crew rather hawk you to death rather than talk you to
death
'Cause listenin' is like livin' when yo' talkin' is death
So y'all better start readin' before you start bleedin'
And the odds was against us before we got EVE-n
Niggas in the hood don't give a fuck if you rich
Or drunk with the Prince CD own, bumpin' a kiss
Nigga frontin' I get my you in the pump kinda hot out
Hit the button put the roof in the trunk

I'm a savage bitch
Ain't nobody gettin' close to this
And ain't nobody flipped and wrote the shit
And can't nobody sit and coach this shit
You feelin' lucky? then approach me, shit
I'm like the glass, you just the coaster bitch, Under me!
You wanna make it ugly, can't do nothin' 'bout it
Angry at the public, buggin' me
Rat bitch, pot bitch, hungover hot bitch
Wantin' all that money, fuckin' gettin' all that rock, shit
Scared of who? huh, we goin' get rid of you
Climbin' the walls wit' gimmicks, that shit is pitiful
Dawgs close by me, so why try me
They wan' cop me but they too sloppy
Damn, I gotchu stuck in a box
You feelin' trapped, got your stomach in knots
'Cause I ain't lettin' go
I keepin' it locked
I know you gettin' mad 'cause your luck's up
Plus I'm a pure bread, baby, I don't fuck with mutts
Come on!

See, she got trapped from the rear, Tiger Chan and Takbir
Slap em down, make em drown, in the muddy water slaughter
You oughta be able to pick up your pen and defend
Cause if you can't, me and my friend, terrorizin all
Revoke all my actions and still won't fall
Stab you all like rag dolls - time for voodoo
See we can do what you do - change your smelly diapers filled with doo doo
Then toss them and ??no scratch allowed ha??
You weak to Deac', your piece don't ever ever try to compete
I'm fat in cellulite, keep it discrete and delete
No longer will you exist in the war of the wack minds
Takbir, rollin on fools like Pathfinders
It's the grandmaster, ?? flash when I'm runnin
laps around those who can't adapt to fat sounds
Backgrounds and pots on stage is what you need and yo

Jaycee got sick with the tracks, so I flip with the rap
Enough dope, to make the world's biggest triple beam collapse
Jump up and get jacked
Collide like an avalanche and a haystack
Stay back, the will of force is aweseome
Tied em up to the pole with ropes and scorch em
Burnin with the flame and the match I aim
Shoot splat, uh oh, uh oh, what who's that?

Speak with RESPECT when you speak of the God

Tackle me who's the toughest, kid to get clowned

It was 11:33, just wakin up to write
Got plans to meet my man at the jam tonight
Got a call from Tiger Chan, he said, ""Whassup Tak'?""
Yo my car broke down, meet me at the bus stop
""What time?""  About five, I'll be ready when I'm done
4:22, turn twenty-one, so you know
Threw on my shades to block the rays from the sun
I stepped out the door and now my day's begun
So I'm walkin down the block, think about that girl Britney
Knowin that I'm goin to the club to get tipsy
If I step out of line, would she soon forget me
I don't know - I'm Dazed and Confused like a hippie
Waitin on the corner for the four-door Honda
Picked me up, with the switch seat recliner
Yo I hear the horn blowin from these girls behind us
I turned around to look and they got all obnoxious
They recognize the face, ""Can we get your autograph?""
Yo I turned back to Ryu and we started to laugh
""We got a show to do tonight,"" that's what I yelled out the window
They pulled up on the side, with a pen and pad for info
One had pretty eyes, with the buttermilk complexion
So I ran it down the line with the directions, yo..

	we make sure the beat knocks, we dig up in the crate

and trap a dame flat in nine seconds we take aim
Change to battle beast, that'll cease, any attempt
in petty offensive diss to my click
We move quick, you might not even recognize my presence
Thirty second assassination sedation weapon
Step into the club, all these thugs want to shoot me
Because I'm well known at the spot, they call me roofies
Hittin hard rocks when I travel through veins
and wake up in three days not remeberin thangs
The reign of the poetry prince of darkness the martian
Stompin, from California to Boston, Lost in Space
so take caution, face the facts, harken

Gotta be patient, gotta be calm
Just keep pacin, and move on

Verse One:

Yo gimme somma that - somma what?  Somma that
over there, yeah who?  Takbir
The one that makes you bump when it ain't hop enough
Don't trip, Tiger Legs, move your waist, put em up

With the bump and the Mickey's club, freakin Aeon Flux
in a black tux, so back up, Tiger Chan, damn
in the jam or in the flow, 90 degrees
with the Three's Company afro, crack the Newcastle

When it's down to the wire, and I'm ready to grab
Pissed off enough, with no other way to react
Another sense rap said to block the thought process
Dressin the bid on my conscious

Complex, gotta ?, my game face, in the same place
Wore my hat back, Ryu on my nameplate
Never waste, valuable brainspace, or thang chase
Chill, with the battle drill, that'll kill ? space

Verse Two:

Just keep pacin, and move on..
With the time tickin deadlin waitin to sneak
I got a, million and one things to do in the week
With the time tickin deadlin waitin to sneak
I got a, million and one things to do in the week

Besides doin the freak, I'm two deep in the Jeep
with the junkyard crew, gettin somethin to eat
We lose sleep to pay dues, at two dollar venues
Ten dudes, one tomboy, with attitudes
that refuse to have fun, but I don't give a {fuck}
These sparks runnin through the hands, up for $20 bucks

That's a little too much, to even toss in the back
especially when you broke, livin off the scratch
You see it all comes down to the love for music
Short fuse, determinin how well we use it

Guess who steps in the saloon with the platoon
of forty-five caliber bass cannon kabooms
Mechanical cartoon cocoons found to bust
to mute the crowd fuse the move ruins the crush

Plus detonator cordless mics are clutched
Fingertips tight around the invisible paintbrush
To the dawn of Egyptian musk, face the style
War trilogy way beyond ""Spies Like Us"" just

Chorus: repeat 2X

Gotta be patient, gotta be calm
Just keep pacin, and move on

Verse Three:

Yo, I grab the rhythm by the waist and shake my own sound
Droppin it with ?, but my actions tango
Feelin the melodic remedy of an narcotic
Dancefloor cuisine want to get - you got it
My ? allowed knows how we get down
to these audio effects burn a hole in the ground
With the time tickin deadlin waitin to sneak
I got a, million and one things to do in the week
With the time tickin deadlin waitin to sneak
I got a, million and one things to do in the week

Besides doin the freak, I got two in the Jeep
Half black Thai in the back Jew in the front seat
Pumpin loud beats, hit harder than concrete
Calm before tropical storm Chan can bomb peeps

What the plan - what the deal
If I can - then I will
	Flowin like grass with the mass appeal
What the plan - I'ma chill
	Why man, you feelin ill?
	Stop actin like a {bitch} and take an Advil
It's a plan

Yeah give me five minutes and I'll meet you in the truck

Styles of Beyond,"Yeah my niggaz, just spend a little bit of time with the ghost
Holiday, styles, pinero, well you listen to me
Real niggaz feel me, some real nggaz probably won't feel me
But as you know me, I don't really give a fuck
Before I leave I'd like to give a word to the shorties
Despite what I say, despite what you see in the streets
Despite what you influenced by, the life of crime has many downs
A little bit of ups, and everything you do got consequences and repercussions, 
So you're best bet better be to stay in school
Hit the books, stay off the streets if possble
To those on the streets, who feel stuck in the game
To those in jail, that's just how shit goes sometimes
We make do wit what we got.
To all mc's, poets, lyricists, people such as myself, ghostly individuals 
You should listen to my album, and listen and listen and listen
I don't know what I'ma sell or none or that shit
I would say I don't give a fuck but I'd probably be lying
I love to get money and break it down wit my niggaz
But in case I don't, the most important thing is respect and honor
And I got plenty of that, so until sheek lou child, next l.o.x. album
And all the mtherfucking rest of the albums we do from the double are
To the d block, to anybody else whose our motherfucking family putting down an 
Album, we gon crush why'all motherfuckers

Styles of Beyond,"You ready?! Let's go!
Yeah, for those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this y'all (c'mon)

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up

Who the hell is he anyway, he never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote; his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method, Name Of The Game
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
I like bleach, man, Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots
His stock's through the roof; I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

They call him Ryu he's sick, and he's spittin' fire and Mike
Got him out the dryer he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin' nihilist porcupine; he's a prick; he's a cock
The type women want to be with and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime; his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

He's not your every day on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?
No, he's livin' proof that he rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will

Everybody's searching for somethin'
But all they can find is a whole lot of nothin'
Back home
Ain't nobody hoping and praying
'Cause they feel like nothing can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact that
Life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
'Cause ain't a damn thing free
Back home

Back home they holler ""disciple"" and ""blackstone""
Some black they freebase yo we trapped on
Where our grandmothers marched the guns clap on
There's liquor stores, beauty supplies, and rap songs
I travel the world just to come back to it
The crib got a lot of soul like black music
I'm attached to it
In many ways this city raised me and gave me
The drama, honor, and bravery
The streets seem hollow when I go to Chicago
It's cheap wine and sorrow
Times hard to swallow
In search of God's tomorrow I borrow words from the
Bible and use them for survival gangs rival
Signs painted on the walls like hieroglyphics
I tell 'em that this is all tribal
Used to do dirt shorty's goin' through the same cycle
And trials like Michael tryin' not to stay idle

Back home it's not Compton but close
The same problems exist and the pain throbbin'
And folks are so common
It don't really bother us much we just swallow it uh
Crack the bottle and smoke hope tomorrow something
Magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
But the chances of it actually happening's kinda slim
Back home we get the good life at glimpse
In the form of a rap start, drug dealers, and pimps
I'm back home

Back home I try my best to keep it together it's cold
Like the Windy City streets of December
I pace back and forth looking for the courage to shine
But can't tap the source need something to nourish my mind
I know we all lose quite a bit in life
Only to gain some
Life or the dark winding roads we came from
But I move with the night so I'm used to the shade
And never lose sight bringing truth back to the game

Back home we've got a lot of shit on our minds
We're always behind on something 'cause there's not enough time
And we're non-stop bottom line doing what we gotta do
To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
Back home there's people calling us hopeless
People trying to tell us all we need is some focus
But focus
Focus is overrated
Cause you see very blemish and mistake and can't change it
Back home is Alvarado K-Town and J-Town
Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know
Where figures shiver living right in the litter
Where kids write nigga right inside the L.A River
On the concrete a symbol of out everyday way
It's that color and concentration over heavy gray
And by the time the ink dries on this page
I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay",Back Home,2005

Trying to make it all feel like home

Standing on the bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath
Trying to make it home without freezing to death
And my grandfather's face is stuck in my mind
And how seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time
I should've brought a jacket
Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill
I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
Thinking, laying in that box people look so still
At times like these you start thinking
Your first breath in and the clock starts ticking
I'm not trying to bum anyone out
Not trying to be dramatic, just thinking out loud
I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind
Some defence from the cold that I'm feeling outside
And for a minute, escape with some rhythm and rhyme 
And get away from the grey just a bit of the time

Yeah, kinda funny how this world can treat you
Like a freak in a sideshow, a carnival creature
Climbing outta cans, I'm a diamond in the sand
But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones
My life's like trying to swallow a pinecone
It's tough when you live fast, just to die slow
Talk to dial tones, my dreams are far fetched
It seems so I sleep underneath this park bench
I know it don't make sense
And I don't expect for you to know what it's like
Smoke, drink, piss, sniffing everything in my sight
Push rocks in a pipe
Liftoff, I keep puffin' 'til my lips turn white
And my chest gets tight, but who the fuck really cares
When you're so far left that even death looks right
All I can do is hope for the best and pray
That it gets a little better than yesterday

Pardon me I think I'm next to url
Too many problems going on that's why I left my girl
Packed my bags and I traveled with a pen and my notepad
Pissed that I was broke and all the things that I don't have
But still, I try to find a way to escape
From all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
But now I'm breaking the mold, see I was patient and calm
Many sleep in the rain, but I'm awake in the storm
Writing my life in a short film, The Rise and Fall
How I managed to scorch hills and climb the walls
Pound pavement aimless in this cold existence
Even though things are changing I'm going the distance
Overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
And put it all behind me 'cause life still goes on
Now I'm much stronger, I know where I stand
While lost souls search over and over again

These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they've lost their soul
And everybody's trying not to cry, trying to get by
And trying not to feel out of control
And if you look hard enough
Sometimes you'll find a place that might just remind you of home
But if it doesn't feel like home, you can do what I do
Just pretend you don't feel so alone",Feel Like Home,2005
Styles of Beyond,"I had a friend named Victor
The two of us used hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight that his whole life just changed
I know when his mom and his dad broke up it didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk and he gambled away the rent
Pretty soon Vic was seeing red, pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
Then he'd do it all again
The whole time smiling on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside all he was trying to do was get away

Yo, funny how things change color
Then fade to another shade, when you had it made
It was all good, but now look, just another day
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one, two, three
Lights out, which way to turn
Can't get a grip, all alone in a big white house
Every day gets worse and you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left, now you suffer
Should've thought of that one first
No family, no kids, can't accept what you did, now you wanna
Run away but you can't cause the past comes back again

Slippin' through the cracks, sip a little Jack
Go to bed half dead
What about a rent? Why does every cent gotta be a bet
When's it gonna end
Oh my God, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Outta debt, outta dodge, out of breath, out of this big problem
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
In a better place in his brain
But the medication he takes makes him wasted
So sick if he's gonna think the good Lord would come to take him
I'm shaking him
Wake up you son of a bitch

He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping through the cracks
Hiding himself away
Watching all the memories fade away
From red to black",Red to Black,2005
Styles of Beyond,"You ready?! Let's go!
Yeah, for those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this y'all (c'mon)

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up

Who the hell is he anyway, he never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote; his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method, Name Of The Game
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
I like bleach, man, Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots
His stock's through the roof; I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

They call him Ryu he's sick, and he's spittin' fire and Mike
Got him out the dryer he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin' nihilist porcupine; he's a prick; he's a cock
The type women want to be with and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime; his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

He's not your every day on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?
No, he's livin' proof that he rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Styles of Beyond,"Someone right now is leaving their apartment
Looking down at the street and wondering where their car went
Someone in a car is sitting at a signal
In front of a restaurant staring through the window at
Someone right now with their finger in their teeth
Who could use a little floss, right across the street
There's somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
But spent half the rent at a bar getting plastered
Now he's gotta walk fourteen blocks
Just to work at a shop where he's about to get fired
Someone right now is looking pretty tired 
Staring at a laptop trying to get inspired
As somebody living right across the street
Just wrote the best thing that she's written all week
But her best friend's coughing up blood in the sink
He can't even think what happened, feeling so confused
And he knows it looks bad but nothing he can do 
I wonder what it's like to be right there in his shoes but...

Yo, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom again
Tomorrow I'll be gone, I don't know when I'll be back
But in this world everything can change just like that...

Somebody right now is dropping his vote
Inside a box trying to not get shot in his throat
For the act of freedom, right now somebody's stuck in Iraq
Hoping that he gets shipped back breathing
In a war but he's not really sure the reasons
So we show our support when the press mislead him
Though we mourn, remain proud, salute the troops
Get some, I know you boys got some work to do

Meanwhile, right now someone's 25-to-life-ing
Standing on a corner with their thumb up hitchhiking
Scratching off a lotto ticket hoping for a real winner
Sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner
Right now someone wishes they were you and I
Instead of second-guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
But right now I'm staring out the window at a fiend
With holes in his arm and holes in his jeans
He pulled out a cigarette and sparked a light 
And walked right around the corner just out of my sight but...

I'm just taking it in
From a second storey hotel window again
The TV's on and my bags are packed
But in this world everything can change just like that

Yeah, right now somebody's sittin' in the darkness
Tryin' to figure how to put some heat in their apartment
But they got a little mattress, little carpet
And they appreciate it 'cause some people on a park bench
You see 'em rushing to get to the office
Wife ride by 'em when she up from the market
Right now somebody comin' out the pocket
Tryin' to dump that rock they runnin' round the block with
Same time the cops is raisin' the glock
With aim to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
Right now somebody's struggling to stop this man
That's kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors
Down the hall a child is takin' its first breath
The doctors ain't even passed him to the nurse yet
Yo, I wonder of he understand what it's worth yet
Life, the time spent while we here on the earth yet
The answers to the questions we all seek
Can be found, it depend on how free y'all think
Right now, it's somebody who ain't eat all week
That would kill for the shit you throw away in the street
I guess one man's trash is a next man's treasure
One man's pain is a next man's pleasure
One says infinity the next say forever
Right now everybody got to get it together man

I'm just taking it in
In another strange hotel lobby again
With my luggage on my back, I don't know where I'm at
I'm in a world where it all changes just like that
Like that

The audience closed in and they had a reaction
Similar to explosions off of battery acid

My rhymes a razor, to slash your neck with
So findin' my trip past your neck or exit
Into the dungeon, what you bringin' a bucket?
No one's hearin' your screams, so start playin' the trumpet

I'm outta your reach now, so give me some rock a few
Hookin' a beat down and do the impossible

Or rich or poor though it's all the same shit
I'm black even though my skin's kind of light
That mean my ancestors was raped by somebody white
I'm black so I like to sing, dance and crack jokes
Eat good food and be around black folks
I'm black so I like the oldies on Sundays
Drink all night and still go to work Monday

I'm black so I like my kids lookin' real nice
'Cause I been poor and I know what it feels like
I'm black and I'ma say it loud like James Brown
People be proud 'cause we all up in the game now
I'm black and I'ma hold my right fist real high
Might see my man and we might get real high

Do it for my peoples that went through slavery

Ninety percent chance, I get hung in the court

'Cause you don't really seemed to be scared of my sister
I'm black and I could ride first class too
Or buy an exotic car and might mirk pass you

I'm black and I don't need a tan in the winter
Mind strong and powerful, non-cipher can't enter
I'm black and I don't need jewelry to shine
Look at my skin color it's like the jewelry is blind
I'm black, they focus on the negative attention
Do something positive it never get mentioned
I'm black, listen it's a fact
Original man that wouldn't change it if I could and that's that

I'm black even with a caramel complexion
Look in the mirror see Malcolm and Martin in reflection
I'm black just like the Panthers lookin' for an answer
This prejudice shit is like cancer

Look at my cars they stay gettin' pulled over
I'm black, meanin' Public Enemy's number one
Government lookin' in the hood sendin' in the guns

I'm black, I grew up off 'The Good Times Show'
Drink liquor and some weed let the good times roll
I'm black, I live for my wife and my seeds
And my mind with a find only God could exceed
I'm black, I got to show my homeboys love

Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)

Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?

I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

High for a livin', gots ta, ride for a livin'
With my, real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you

Indubitably, too dust

Who you know besides 'Kiss take the piss in the bottle of Crist'
and then give it to a modelin bitch

Alligator bloodline trained to find coke and bite one time

I sell crack, bust guns, pop shit, and say I'm better than niggas

If you think a rapper's better why don't you give me his name
So I can run up on him, tear him up and give you his frame
When it comes to the streets, I'm the nigga to call
Five eight and three quarters, but I'm bigger than why'all

You know the P carry the gun, live in the Maz'

I like Malibu and pineapple, fifties of hash

Hundreds of 'dro, wear my clothes a week in a row
Sleep on the floor, catch me right next to the dog
I'm Holiday Styles, and that's what the weaponry for
And I probably won't blow for the fact that I'm hard

But I'm good with ten million in the back of the car
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard
Gettin' jewels from the old timers, stashin the cards
But jail ain't part of the plans

I keep weight on the scale 'cause I feel I get further with grams
In my last few bars, I run through niggas like my last few cars
And crash 'em up, the boy mighta went platinum but don't gas him up
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut

I don't deal with the snakes and fakes
But I deal with the comas and wakes, I don't make mistakes

If it means waving the hammer and leaving you there
If it means grabbing your kids out daycare
Somebody losing a seed, pay or bleed
It's Sheek Louch, I ain't got no heart
I shoot broad daylight right in front of the mark
I put 28 holes through the icy car
Fuck around, like the God won't squeeze
If I don't see the badge I'm clapping the D's
LOX motherfucker, the OX motherfucker
The reason why you shouldn't cop drops motherfucker
Like it's something for me to shoot your pops motherfucker, what

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Ayo the dopes and the rice, the cokes and the Pyrex
Over the stove and I'm bout to hit it with the ice
Runners love to pump the bomb
They know no fair ones, now niggas'll jump they moms
You god, minus the 12 disciples
I pop up, all you see is shells and rifles
If I don't like you, I'ma kill you not fight you
I bite a little piece of your ear off like Mike do
And everybody gon' follow me now
Down eighth and an Uzi mahogany brown
Fagots want you to kill 'em in a hurry
It fucks me up, like they aint got no money to get buried
You could flip, I'll survive m'kay, motherfucker
In my block still doing twenty-five a day
Know you work out, chest and your back all nice
But the twelve gauge'll have your six pack on ice, what?

Styles P,"Fuck the frail shit
'Cause when my coke come in
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with

Carlssons on the jeep, Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life

Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked

The house costs a million, sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know, if it's furnished I'mma take it

My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money then you rubbing the spot

Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands
On a yacht with our favorite albums

A bad ho and a plate of salmon
Smoking and drinking, nigga is you thinking that our fate is violent?

I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal

And if you facing capital pun', pass me a gun
And I'mma give you time to run while I rapidly peel

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

We gon' make it

I learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent
So when I fly now, I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case who's the loser?

Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger

Motherfuckin' niggas is back, Jada and P
We got water, X, haze
Plus weight of the D
And I'm tired of hearing about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted (Who cares)
Talk 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back

Gun work's official but niggas don't be wanting that
(Why?) 'Cause they puss and they mans is lame

We Soul for Real in the hood, we make Candy Rain

I could easily send you to God

But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
If you can't remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver the hard

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

Ja- da- muah, I'll kiss you, you bitch ass nigga
Bet the hood won't miss you, you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean

He be aight though

You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
'Cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eating right, getting good rest either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
""Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!""
And, y'all just talking, I'm doing it well
Jadakiss, motherfucker, I'mma see you in Hell

Styles P,"They usually hate her when she comes around
Huh, first lady mobbin' nigga hit the ground
Next break into that who we what a sound
Heads boppin', never fails once the doc's around
Hatin' the fact that she do things on both sides
But never disrespect two rings round both eyes, right?
Lady like in many ways
Because in trust I can be crazy like on any day
Some do they dirt but best believe in time they pay
Do believe in lettin' shit chill 'til the promised day
Huh, seems they just fade away
I love it 'cause them clowns they just paved the way
Left it wide open got no time to play
Mad 'cause shit changed got no time to stay

Considered sloppy to me you just need to give it up

This is holiday you need, you fuck with the scorpion
I don't stop poppin' till your body don't breathe
Clap more than the audience, after the show
Stab more than the butcher and I'm kinda righteous
So I'ma help you pray for the Lord when I push you
She, the first lady, I'm the ghost with the gun
Aimed at your son that'll love to burst crazy
Ruff ridin' the clique, come up outta your shit
Get clapped in the wig, sold a lotta records

Got to the back and the ribs

I don't even fuck around 'less your head strong
Ain't too many that's around that can match they mind blown
Can't figure her out
Is she street, sweet, gutter, I'm from the hood
A lotta y'all niggaz gold
This bitch two million sold
And I just figured that I'd make it known
Baby girl got the whole world in her palm, alone
Watch me rock, got my lip cocked
Spit fire, watch it better duck, you stuck, you crossfire
Thought you was the realest you said you caught, liar
Any time you at where I be, I'ma try you

Introducing, Jadakiss and Styles P, where you at?

[The L.O.X.]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
You know we still in the hood dog, in front of the store
With the work across the street and the gun in the stall
Soon as somethin happen niggaz want to run to the law
You know the code of the streets, never run to the law
That's why I can't even run 'less I run with a four
or I walk with a three, come and talk to 'em P
You can catch me down bottom with a bird and a glock
On the block makin money where they murder a lot
Or you can catch me up top shootin dice for a yard
I'm talkin six digits, niggaz bet the house or the car
You can catch me hittin the spliff, sick in the pit
On the fiend like I'm missin my shit, they think I'm crazy
Catch me hittin your lady in my Mercedes
Bird on your baby, fuck you I'm keepin it gravy
L.O.X. hold the hammers
like we waitin for screws
With Angie Mar' BLOWIN MOTHERFUCKERS OUT OF THEY SHOES, WHAT?

[Angie Martinez]

From Y.O. to Philly, from Harlem to Q.B.
And when it drops, game over, you'll see
Introducin, Beanie Sigel, tell me how you livin?

[Beanie Sigel]
Aiyyo, I've been kickin murder - since Adidas with thick strings
T.I. sweatsuits, Pumas with thick chains
Four finger rings, black belts with brass names
I was spittin flames since niggaz was pitchin change
I'm a hard knock kiddo, always played the middle
Threw flacks in the crack game, getchu if I can getchu
Since a buck, played the highway, dodgin the troop boys
Jumpin in and out of Coupes, wavin for Duke boys
Always chased a penny, copped quarter waters
Tried to make a dollar chased my pop's boss daughters
Tryin to make my name, global, in all four corners
Philly baller, gamin in all four quarters
Never worked, never will - all my hoes buy my clothes
I can't go broke, never will - all my bros buy my O's
I'm the best thing that linked up with New York since Sprewell
I murder, nuttin further - fill in the details

[Brett]
I'm here, it's over, fuck how why'all feel
When I drop, why'all gon' realize it's all real
Bein left for dead, tied up, smoke 'til I was dried up
So high up, seem like the sky ducked, high what?
Life was rough, but now it's nothin to hide
Used to click and be quick to put this gun to yo' side
Be like, ""That chain nice - I like that pal.
Matter fact {*click click*} I'd like that now.""
You've got game? Call the name, just spell the name right
Brett, one of the best rappers ever to touch a mic
It's prophecized I'd write, spit scriptures mind blowin
'til my coffin top close and heaven skies open
Fear no man's my slogan, I hope why'all believe
I'm just like you, fear nuttin human that bleeds
My mind breed two movies, six ab-lums, a hundred poems
Thirty R&B joints, I'm beyond the norm, why'all just mad
I'm just glad, got my time to shine
why'all the type to hit three hundred bars and run out of rhymes

[Angie Martinez]
Brett, from my ByStorm family, with Angie
Come live from the streets, from Harlem to Q.B.
And when it drops, game over, you'll see
Introducin, finally, the legendary cool G.

[Kool G. Rap]
It's B.G.S. kid so what you facin? Caps racin
Decapitation twenty buck-fifties and lacerations
Guerilla fam' camouflaged out in the grass waitin
to blass your nation slash like Jason and bash your face in
We ass lacin top bodies and half in the basement
Our style, cast you so bad you'll need plastic replacement
When gats is raised in, fascination blastin and blazin
Evacuation for your whole staff there's gas in the tank and
Gets back abrasions from cap grazin, defy gravitation
Pull my shit back squeeze bust it like masturbation
Hold fort, hold the blow torch, leave your soul scorched
with no remorse, the state of New York, get your shit caught
When niggaz hawk, let the fifth talk
So tell me who's the next man to flip?
I stop the beef shit, with rubber handled grips
Your candle get lit, guerilla shit feed us banana clips
The hammers hit, anything in our range we dismantle it

Styles P,"Evening, is the time of day
I find, nothing much to say
Don't know, what to do
But I come to

Here's why they call me the ghost, I'm half live half dead
And when there's beef I bring all of the toast
And I got more guns than most of New York
And I ain't got to say shit 'cause the toasters'll talk

Holiday Styles ignorant nigga
Tre pound four pound still tearin' off your ligament nigga
I'm the hardest rapper out bitches diggin' a nigga
And like anybody who beef can swim in the river

When I walk through the door all the children'll shiver
It's like, He's so gangsta, y'all so pussy
I murder y'all faggots so y'all don't push me
All I know is goin' through hell, blowin' a shell

I got, down so hard I thought no one'd tell
But I was damn wrong, I hold it down like my man's gone
I shoot anything I get my fuckin' hands on
To leave y'all coward niggaz bloody like a tampon

Evening, is the time of day
(Yo, E Nicks where you at nigga?)
I find, nothing much to say
Don't know, what to do
(Uhh, uhh, yo)
But I come to

I'm sick and tired of rappers talkin' 'bout, all this cheddar
And when you see them in the streets got a bullshit Jetta
I'm like dog stop frontin', you shouldn't be braggin'
And why the fuck you got rims if you push a Volkswagen?

I spit vicious, let my bank account switch digits
And if money was height, you'd be midgets
(Go on nigga)
I spit hard save it, sinner nigga affidavit
And next to God, I'm most niggaz mom favorite

Y'all talk gangsta but you notice the mob
And I could bring you to the hood and get, both of you robbed
You see I live in the streets, I sleep in the streets
Fuck it, I probably got, more guns than police

Niggaz say I'm too hard, them niggaz too soft
Straight pussy, I heard they suck dick up North
And it ain't so foul so, hold your breath
And you probably still real just a gangsta left

Evening, is the time of day
I find, nothing much to say
Don't know, what to do
But I come to

All I can say this the game I chose
For this European car and these name brand clothes
Get respect from these niggaz, spit game at hoes
Come down with a bounce and a strange-ass flow

I got bigger than I thought I would, I did shit that I thought I could
Act rowdy 'cause I fought that good
Them blocks is mine I bought that hood
They know I squeeze, smoke trees, and blow bo-dies

And your boss even know, that y'all niggaz can get it
Have y'all skeleton cracked, and some holes in your fitted
Have your body chopped up, in six different lakes
And you ain't even safe right in front of the Jakes

They call me Stan Still, 'cause I fuckin' just stand still
And most of y'all niggazs run, plus your mans will
Folded up in a corner, behind a van still
And your hoes can get it, then your mans will

Evening, is the time of day
I find, nothing much to say
Don't know, what to do
But I come to

'Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
'Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash

And not because I'm just a bunny with a fluffy tail
Had to prove that I could live hard and spit hard
Just a bonus that I'm cute and get ya dick hard
See, I ain't never lettin' mine go
I'ma be here forever with my dogs as the time go
And I know we makin' niggas sick
We in they face everyday every way and they can't handle it
Streets choosin' Double are realest niggas out no confusion
Cats don't want it over here--have you heard
S.P. ain't for games little boy lesson learned
I suggest you stay far from my nigga's face
Hop back go hard all day in a nigga's face
You see, you cowards ain't a threat to us really
Just figured that we let you know that testin' us is silly
Good luck, y'all, naw forreal, fuck why'all

I live by my pride, I could never be broke
I'ma Ruff Ryde or die catch me bein' with dope
Smokin' weed in the hoopty with the three in the coat
'Cause my ace boon-koon got a connect
Told me send a hundred bundles to the day room soon
If the shit go right, he know that it will
We'll be cash, he'll be movin' straight weight through June
But back to this rap shit who thug it the most
It'll take the whole coast just to fuck with the ghost
He done shut down the game, shit on ya name
If you ain't hold down the street or bust off ya heat
Then me and you is different, we ain't get it the same

I could even bust my gun and do some office work
But I still want to off this jerk (shit)
I can't leave it out my rhymes (why)

There's gotta be a better way
There's gotta be a better way yeah

P won't you help me find my way
All I really want
Is to live my life so we can just get high yeah, yeah

Ask God when he stoppin' the pain
A fiend got a shoelace on his arm and he poppin' his vein
And the needle look dirty but I'm close to reaching thirty
And the only thing I know it's a profit to gain
I might cry but I'm still cold
I might be cold but I still cry
And bottom line I'ma still die
I can see the doors openin' now
I can see the ghost floatin' around
That's why P come down with the potenest sound
Spit the shit that'll open the ground (crack the ground)
My third eye got a horoscope (see it all)
So if you want to know my horoscope, listen to the bars I wrote
Build and destroy
Come through the strip wit, bricks of the girl and keys of the boy
'cause all I really want (what)
Was a gun and blunt, a lil money and some keys to a toy

My whole life been a sacrifice
So if my nigga need my help he ain't never gotta ask me twice
I'm the nigga you could kick it wit
You gotta spot you want to rob I'm the nigga you could stick it wit
I'm in the studio, I'm droppin' pain on the beat
I'm famous indeed, but those is two differences
They tryin' to understand me, but I over stand 'em
I'm the flowin' phantom, til we blowin' random
And to my corner niggas holdin' cannons
That want the money and jewels and everything 'cause we so demanding
To the hoes that think I'm handsome
That know a gangster when she see one ma, yeah money that's the anthem
Callin' niggas like that's the ransom
You could take 'em you could leave 'em but your man ain't a happy camper

That she carry in the garter belt
No doubt I love her, I'ma tell you the truth

But don't' get it fucked up, and get fucked up

And she could sleep with another dude
She gon tell me where the safe at

And you still got the bomb ass, I pay the phone and the rent
But keep it real Boo, you pay the Conair

If I get knoced, she in the BI room
With some money on my books, give weed to a nigga
Don't worry about shit, cause I be out soon
No doubt that's my Booby-cat

She drop my bricks off right on Broadway
And she go and get a doobie wrapped

He still had to hit me, aggravate a little nigga

It was 1986 and I was twelve years old
That's right around the time when crack came out
It was the best thing that happened to me
I swear to God cause I was gettin everything that I was askin about

First we started off bangin up, me and golf
Then shit start addin up, we gettin smart
Now we on Broadway, coppin our own bench
Bring it home and put it in bottles, send us a rottle

Drink a old ease Grem like it wasn't tomorrow
I'm gettin kicked out of Junior High, thinkin I'm grown
God bust with the yellow rabbit
And I had every color dealt we was gettin it on

I was out robbin Mexicans six in the morn'
Mom said I'd had to ep again, rip it I'm gone
Nigga get a little loony and grown, soup in the dome
Bump me up worst when I went to the group home

I'm leavin out a lotta shit, nigga it's too real
My alcoholic backround, the welfare motels
Abuse that I had to take struggle at my mom's recruit
How the fuck I'm gon bomb wit you

And the cases I got up to date told you that I bust a eight
My niggas I can't name, outta state (My niggas fuck with weight)
Little brother gone but I got a baby angel
You fuckin with a dirty name, don't let these niggas change you

The present's what you get
And the past is what make the man future
I can't tell you I ain't God or lil' Superman
No there ain't a 'S' on my chest, but it's a 'D' on my block (D Blok)

And said life the deepest lesson is death
I'm determined and I'm disciplined and destined to rest
I'm a Gangsta and a Gentleman, Panero the best
When I pass I'm like gas, motherfuckers
'Cause I'm a leave a stain that you'll never forget

So I'm settlin' for seventy beamers
Somebody call Bill Gates, tell him meet with the streets
One on one so I can get some real cake
Tryin' to see my shit in the Forbes, Trump tower for 'self
So you know I'm still pitchin' the boy

That's why I keep the 45 government edition
Sofa costs a hundred, so do the love seat

P flows like no nigga, twenty-six but I'm a old nigga
Don't make me fuck around and show niggas
How to leave a room flat, twenty niggas dead
No money, no jewels, bullets in they head
Ain't a nigga you know could fuck with the god
I said that was just a hobby, gun bustin' the job
But the sickest niggas out is the bitchest niggas out
And I could take em on the street and straight whip 'em in the house

So go head and get your sons on me
Like I give a fuck, like I'm givin' up I got four guns on me
Get down and dirty, all by my lonely
I leave your brains on your block all around your homies
Live by the code of honor, stay holdin' armor
I treat beef like a album I promote the drama
Stay bustin' a hammer, sweatin' a smile
And I make sure these motherfuckers'll regret when I'm wildin'

Throw the gun to the chair try to open your chest
Get blood on the driver's face, window and dash
Burn the car with the body in it, bring you to ash
I get down on a hit like I'm Sigel the cold
That nigga sniffed up yo coat I could bring you his nose
If he stole money from you P could bring you his hands
The nigga talk too much I bring the ears of his fans
Need weed to calm down, need money to leave light

Fuck a chain I'm already hangin'
Fuck a gang I'm already bangin'

Lick a shot for the predicate felons
And gangster niggas that know that 
Doing their time is better than tellin
Don't tell dog, lick a shot for the graveyard shift
And all the hustlers on ninety-five for the graveyard prick
Lick a shot for this weed I need
Just to see clear, to tell the truth I can't breathe a Ki
Lick a shot for the stick up kids that twist up wigs
that's the shit that happens when you pick up bids
Lick a shot for the foreign car, American trucks
Old timers that'll throw a stack of presidents up
Got dice shooter slang, need a pistol to hang
But the P understand cause the ghetto is fucked
Lick a shot for the fiends 
That got to go see the minors on the block to get medicined up
Lick a shot for the sake of licking a shot
And every time I'm far away from home I'll be missing my block
D-Block nigga

Lick shots for the hood
Yeah nigga we good
Lick shots for the poor
We still gotta run from the law
Lick shots for the rich

Lick shots for the crew
My niggas'll ride and I ride too

Someone lick a shot for D-Block cause that's what I'm on
Lick a shot for the niggas that ain't survive the storm
Lick a shot for all my niggas on the run
And lick a shot for all my real niggas that got bodies on they gun
Lick a shot for my niggas cause I know they'll do the same
For my niggas that run through the flames and walk through the rain
Lick a shot for all the niggas growing up in the slums
Blowing they spliffs with they razor blades under they tongue
Lick a shot for all my niggas that be banging they hammers
Sticking up stores, taking the tape out the video cameras
Lick a shot at all y'all haters whether smaller or bigger
Lick a shot cause Hood ain't never been scared to pull a trigger
Lick a shot for all my niggas that be pumping they crills
When the beef start cooking they be bustin' they steel
Lick a shot cause I ain't scared to
And lick a shot cause I'm prepared to
Crack a buckle with the matching hair due

I lick shots for my niggas in jail
23 hours in the hole, on life parole
My jackmack niggas, octopus wildin'
Closest food they ever gettin' to is city island
I lick shots for C-E-O's that hit niggas off for weed and don't care if you bleed
Just mind they business and go the other way
For the right price they could get you the yay
I lick shots for my thug ass niggas that'll put something in you
From they car and hit your face through the diner menu
Your body get numb, you swallow your tongue
Cough up blood, that's the work I do, what
I lick shots for my niggas that's not on tour
And gotta hustle to eat its the motherfuckin' way of the streets
Pay attention

Lick shots for the little babies in the projects
Running around unsupervised with sharp objects
Lick shots for papi that give you the yay half price
And niggas that ain't ever been heard but they mad nice
Nobody tell when I squeeze at your men
Lick shots when your diesels at ten, I'ma see you again
Lick shots cause my record is clean
Middle of the street, broad day lettin' it scream
If I'm lucky they'll squirt through your back
And after that I'll make sure I lick shots for the purple and yack
Lick shots just to guard your grill
To my nigga T and Green and my uncle and Arthur Kill
Lick shots for the S-L 6
Cherry red with them chrome things on it with the x-l lips
Lick shots for the niggas who got shot and ain't here

Why my people gotta be so poor, feel me
And why's it so rough when you're young and black
They say you go to jail or get strung on crack

Why the girl have a baby she was twelve years old
Ask the state why the cell's gotta be so cold
And why these niggas here with so many years
Whole family in court crying so many tears

Can you picture us living with hope (hell no)
When the same ones hanging us is giving us dope
Shit, it's hard to get by
I pray to God it's still hard to get by

Just wanna hold my son (my man)
But I can't leave my house until I load my gun
I gotta grab my sword
And when I die I got some things I wanna ask the Lord

Like, why we dying from AIDS
And why on TV it's aight to be gay
Ain't that sorta like my gun got the right to be waved
If I could sit back and watch a whole cipher of slaves

Ask my man where the blacks at
Ask myself where the next Malcolm X at (I don't know)
Is he makin Salat, or upstate like a ape in a box
Am I a human or a fallen angel

Got to pray by myself 'cause I'm out of angle
I ain't facin the east, tell the brothers I was shakin the beast
Had the nine and the eight in the streets
Open your eyes, stay wise, 'cause even Satan is deep

I pray for a better living
Even though I think I'm better dying
Why, 'cause I'd rather hear the angels singing

I gotta think if the president is prejudice
And that's another eight years down
The 500 year warn, that's a eight year round

I don't really mean to sweat it
But the war been on before they came on your TV and settle
They don't need lead to shoot ya
Why would a man make a computer to head the future

I think about it in a weed session
They said better technology, all I see is regressin
Blew up our buildings in fact (blow us all up)
But if they live under the sun then them children is black

'fore the devil get more time I'd rather see the world cease
Hit the afterlife of world peace
Where black men don't die, the women don't cry
And the little kids get provided for and play in the sky, what

The darkest clouds, end up like the purplest rain
They say patience is a virtue in the game
Fuck it, I guess I died when my brother died
'Cause to tell you the truth, I feel like I'm the curse in the game
My vision is blurred, dreams is shattered, my heart is broke
Pain so deep I find it hard to cope
Missin' your smile and missing your style
I figured I'm the next one dead so we could kick it a while
'Cause your name lives on, the sun still shine
Every time your baby mom life up your child
I guess I gotta switch my angle now
Take a positive look, hit a blunt my little brothers with the angels now
Some of us fall and some of us fly
But at the end of the book baby all of us die
Word, my nigga

There's my brother
I could smile, 'cause I know he right next to Allah
Right next to the prophets and the soldiers that died
And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin the sky

I could cry, for the fact I can't hug him no more
But my tears go to heaven and I know the nigga feel me
And the good thing is he ain't got to worry no more
I said there's my brother, wit Allah
Best place he could be

Listen to me, I would bring my brother back in the physical form
'Cause the spirit still here, but the visual gone
And sometimes I gotta think if I'ma live to the morn
I guess it's no more schooling you
I know it's something in our blood, because us niggas in the street as usual
Left with a robbery charge, pack and a stash
Crushed a lot of niggas that it happened to have
But I'ma just light a blunt, look in the clouds
And I'ma ask my little nigga what's happening have
You died on mothers day, mom it's a gift
I know god took my brother 'cause his honor and strength
And we all gonna die Allah tally us up
While you there say what's up to Lil' Malla and duck
And I know y'all niggas restin' in peace
You might be gone, but your soul is still here and is blessin' the streets

I could see you when I'm all alone (I see you)
So I guess I'm not all alone, I know my little nigga callin' home

And watch over the rest of the slums (watch over us please)
Move the clouds so we could see the rest of the sun
You might've died, but you in heaven that's a blessing in one
Nigga Robert to the death, Gary died with a close friend
You and Allen together, smiling together
It's like now I could hear the world
I understand that, I'm in the physical you're in the spirit world
I see you when I get home
They can't separate brothers, so I still see you when the spit flown
You died, I died (you still here)
But I'm alive, you alive, so we gotta keep the shit going
Now I got a new ghost
And a baby brother angel I could feel, every time the wind blows

My money spoke to me
It said shit that if it wasn't for his ass there wouldn't be no hope for me
Money ain't everything, and then he laughed at me
And said the hammer oughta blast at me
He said I got you out of jail, paid for the lawyer and bail
Take a look at the cars and the crib
I keep the clothes on your back, food in your mouth
Even paid for the birds when you moved niggas south
Shit, I'm the reason why the block jumping
Let a nigga try to stop something, D-Block'll pop something
And I'm the reason why you ride or die
Keep a lot of me by your side, shoot niggas in the eye
I said money you the root of evil

I'm a go and celebrate and hop on the ass
That's one more chance, Dick Frank White ain't dead
Think you the shit, leave me your chick, the light ain't red
Matter fact just want to leave 'cause the fights is on
I'm a still be here when the lights is on
Got a fat ass in front of me, Dutch in my mouth
Wit a Corona in my left hand
You try to front I'll coma your best man
I keep a trick on my sleeve, more like a two fifth on my sleeve
Then I switch it to the trey-duce
In my back pocket, so me and love can stay loose
It's like thugs ain't partyin, I smoke 20 dimes
I seen 20 dimes I love they body and
P tryin to score for the night
And to tell you the truth, my shit blown if we war for the night

[Hook: x 2]
We gon' drink 'til we drunk, dance 'til we drop
And ain't nobody leavin 'til the music stop
Can I get a Soul Clap [gun clicks]
Can I get a Soul Clap [gun clicks]

[Verse 2]
Ah-yo shit is still gravy though
I keep a open case, the block hot I need a song for the radio
P at the club, niggas scared to let they lady go
Foot Locker 4 for 20's
Could a had her some jeans, Nike Airs, I keep all my money
Still slide out the club wit a gorgeous honey
I don't care if it's a hole in the wall, I feel comfortable
Violate P, that's a hole in your jaw
All I want is cranberry and Courvoisier
I'm trying to talk to a dime
Motherfucker, but I still take my time
Cocksucker, to rob why'all niggas for why'all Cardiers
I got a flow that you hardly hear
And a gun wit a silencer, why 'cause they hardly hear
I got honies flockin around, smoke in the air
Wit a cool ass bomb like Bob Marley there

[Hook: x 2]

[Verse 3]
I'm the gentleman to hold the door
I'm the gangsta that's lettin off the three while loadin the four
Rather get a Soul Clap than clap your soul
Honey askin how many blunts I have to roll
I'm a smoke til I'm high, drink til I'm drunk
I'm on my tour, shit and I ain't get a wink in a month
My favorite color is green
But I'm stacked for the moment so I'ma pick pink for the month
If you could take a hint, then after this party
If you want, hop in the Viper limo with the tints
Got the fifty Cal, so hold that
Tell 'em roll back
I show niggas the real meaning of Soul Clap

[Hook: x 2]",Soul Clap,2002
Styles P,"Yeah, Holiday, Gary
I don't want why'all to compare me to niggas no more
Unless they got a case pending
Unless they poke somethin' up
Unless they keepin' it real gutter, why'know

SP I'm the closest thing to poison it is
You think you hot, I'ma boil your kid
You think you cool, I'ma throw you in the river wit some cement shoes
You could sleep with the fishes
Niggas actin' funny so I gotta keep it movin' I don't speak to the bitches
We could handle this like gangstas
Dog, I'll kidnap your little man and send you to the banker
That money get dropped off, so do he
Right off the booth of his mama' building
Feel the drama building
Told why'all niggas don't fuck wit P
I said fuck rap and a verse
I get down like the bishops, wit the way you clap at the hearse
I get it crunk wit a blunt and a package of verc
I'm in the shottie of the Cadillac
Wit niggas that'll take twenty a body, the shottie will handle that

Pullin the three, cockin the four

We're closin' the windows and lockin' the doors
You could die today
Or you could die tomorrow, baby boy the option is yours, see'mon

I smoke weed 'cause the future is grim
I'm knockin' this ash off the dutch on the roof of your Benz
My lil man been runnin' since the shootin' begin
Why'all niggas talk about cases of Crist'
I talk about cases where niggas get life of the shit
And your girl visit two years, mom come forever
But near one of your mans ain't right wit his shit
But like corn I'ma flip, smokin' weed influenced by the fix
And old timers with the toolies by the hips
So come and creep wit me
And I ain't lyin' when I tell these motherfuckers
That I got the streets in me
One felony, wit two cases beat
So be about your business when you come and beef wit me
I got coke for sale and I got dope for sale
If you want to cop some work you oughta come and speak wit me

[Chorus:]

Why'all niggas know my name, but you don't know my style
What make it all ironic is the shit is the same
Keep a milli in the coat, puffin on the chronic
In the hood wit my niggas that's distributin' 'caine
If your man get bodied, number one rule is you body somethin' back
Then live with the pain
Young guns of this shit, so when I get hit
I'ma yell Sheek and 'Kiss let's finish the game
I got discipline and dedication
I'm the boss of the S N F, that's the Shootin Niggas Federation
Light a blunt and get cloudy wit me
Go get your gun and get rowdy wit me
It's a Holiday dog, mouth big, you could swallow the four
Don't you ask me what I'm robbing you for, what
'Cause you was talkin' big money
And I'm a little broke and I'm a firm believer in equality dog, what

This is motherfucking beautiful
Talk to 'em baby

This for the cold D's that won't snitch
For the murderers that won't miss
For the hustlers that'll front bricks
For the hoodrats that want chips
For the stick-up kids creepin with they Pump's ripped
For lil' shorty with his rhyme books
Black girls going to school, carrying like 9 books
For the hood niggas
That go to work because parole, but they tryin to be good niggas
For all the poor mothers
That's always goin' through the struggle, still screamin at the Lord ""Love us""
For the ghetto life
For having to hold your medal tight lookin' for a better life
For the family
For if I'm rich you rich and that shit's a guarantee
For the best of life
For if I ride you ride the motherfucking rest of life

We thugs, my niggas
Ride to the death with my man cause I motherfucking love my niggas
We ghetto, my niggas

We gangsta my niggas
You oughta keep your mouth shut
Watch what you sayin cause we shank you, my niggas
We D-Block niggas, we don't play games
We just hit you in your frame cause we pop niggas

Hey yo, yo, I'ma shed blood for mine, that's one ritual
That's how you keep the love unconditional
That's why we the only one the thugs listen to
Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do
I know a few dudes doin' life bids in jail
And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale
But that how life is
And that how the gun and the knife is
It's a shame but it's real when your enemies like ya
When ya come through and fishtail in Hennesey Viper
Listen, it ain't the rappers it's the rats that worry me
Double R for life, D-Block til they bury me
Scared niggas shed off
Or stand in the back and aim they gat up in the air and
Let off
Through niggas tear nigga head off, then let the blood keep drippin'
And just wipe the sweat off

[Chorus]

Fuck with P, the thug'll come out
The slug'll come out
You don't put in enough work, I got chu
No doubt
They don't want Sheek to wild
Betta cover ya child
With two guns out the sun-roof
Salt fish style
Who that kid?
Black mask on with the latch on, the AK
Swing on my shoulder like a Louie bag
You get it in a hurry
All up in your Burberry
Through your assistant
Through your fucking secure-tary
All y'all do me a favor
Walk with me
If you want money or drugs
Talk with me
Know I got my niggas my guns
The hawk with me
Guess who? Jada, P, and The Sheek
Three bricks
Three whips
Three motherfucking ouies a week
Ten spots OT
Two blew off late
My niggas cop
Pop and talk, and we applying the pressure
So when you address us
It's Boss
Boss
And Boss

Get an 18 or brick and my clothes is khaki
And the Porsche got a glass roof
The blunt got a live purple haze in it, little bit of hash too
See me when I pass through, fuck around and I'ma blast you
Do what I have to, tryin' to get my math too

I ain't just up here, rappin' and tappin'
Spittin' and skittin' and shit, naw, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you rapper, I'm not you, Pusha

I keep that ziploc bustin' at the stitches, culinary chemist
I serve the malicious to break the fiends fixes
One give you the sniffles, the other leave you with the itches
Transport, airport with the vaseline

So I can fulfill my dreams of passion as green
More cash then ya seen within Ashton it's green
Me drivin' up fast with the lean, zonin' family
Keep youngin's in them rented Camry's

Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Naw, bitch we don't believe in air bags

Cars turn tricks like them Ringling brother skits
Whether bitch hop out or the glock pop out
Ya know, what I'm about
Blow to ya sinus 'til the snot drop out

Whoever said birds fly south for the winters, a damn lie
Got 'em right here and if I don't like you the grams high
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend, taste it, they need it
They could smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it

Prolly think, I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lota shots, A I style
Jada, the name is filthy but so what
The motherfuckin' game is filthy

You know, what? My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the Cane the built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker

When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin' you love, ya own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

I'm far from a noodle, nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sex
Nigga, that's funny you say you a killa, how?
What is it the return of the killer clown?
You don't put no fear in my heart

I make ya people say, 'wow', that didn't look like my man
They flipped upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit wit ten rounds at pointblank and pointblank
Coldchian left that nigga stankin'

Half static and face I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and I didn't give 'em
A chance to blink when I dodged up on 'em
Pressed the forty up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby I rocked 'em

The Coffin, the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end and you a thug that pretends
Carl Coldchain, suit the nigga, I got a great vision I see through men
And squeeze triggers wit' bullets that go through men

Fuck wit S P, that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll grape ya chest, no sleep like I hate the rest
I'm in the hood like it's my fate to rep
I hold it down any place I step and I love gettin' slept on
'Cause I'm rawer than dope fresh outta Africa that never been stepped on

Dog, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the ghost the main reason why ya set gone
Why I love riffin', the war you wouldn't understand
'Cause my God is different than yours

If the world spin in a circle, I want 'em to learn move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for creepin' through the hood
And shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a baller
Want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

Rappers is talking to me as if, come on
We in the same boat, I tell them quick, no, I move Coke
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms, no

It shames me to no end to feed poison
To those who could very well be my kin
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs at the same time cry

Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the street
I see them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat, so sorry

And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit, I ain't shit
My heart bleed but that's aside from the fact
I live from my kids and their's and them youngin's after that

I Get High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)
Highhhh (In background through out song)

[Verse One- Styles]
Everyday I need an ounce and a half
S.P.: the only flow'er that you know with a bounce in a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get, high 'cause I'm in the hood, the guns in around
It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humble me now
And I'd rather roll somethin up
'cause if I'm sober dogg, I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin up
I get high as a kite
I'm in the zone all alone, muthafucka 'case I'm dyin tonight
So I roll em up back to back, fat as I could
You got beef with Styles P, I come to slide to the hood

I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)

[Verse Two- Styles]
Ayo, I smoke like a chim-in-ney
Matta fact I, smoke like a gun
When a killa see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did
Add to that, that I smoke like the Hippies did back in the 70's
Spit with the finishing touch
Get this, that I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush off the blunt and the walls, you understand
Like the M-5 pedal when its touchin the floor
I get high 'cause fuck it, what's better to do
And I'ma neva give a fuck 'cause I'm better than you

[Chorus]

[Verse Three- Styles]
I'ma smoke til my lungs collapse
I'm from a era where 
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dolla bill is powerful
I smoke weed 'cause time seem precious, and I know what a hour do
High for a livin, gots ta ride for a livin
Wit my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin
Shit I get as high as I could
'cause if you see things like I see things
'cause I'ma die in the hood
Muthafucka understand its full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die
This is S.P. dump it in, you bitch I get high

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now, won't budge me
'cause where I come from, so often
People you grew up with, layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain in spite
It's my time now, my world, my life
My life

Is based on, lightin' blunts, loadin' guns
Tellin my lawyers to get the case gone (uh-huh)
I need the bills that the presidents got they face on
So I can switch my residence, get a truck and a Lex
Fuck a check, I no longer have to wait for 'em
I made a couple ends, lost a couple friends
I light a blunt 'cause never will the struggle end
So you can judge a nigga, but you ain't got it, you ain't in the role
So you really can't budge a nigga' you oughta love a nigga
For the fact that it's my world and my life but still I'm a rugged nigga
They say you buggin' nigga, fuck it, I'm a thuggin' nigga
You talkin bullshit then kick it with another nigga
I got a bigger bed and I need a cover nigga
And I ain't got friends - I got enemies
So if they with me, then that means they my brother nigga

[Chorus]

Is a blunt to the head, a prayer for the dead
Run around hustlin', scared of the feds
They said death is eternal sleep
But the only thing is you ain't really sure if you prepared for the bed
So often we get merked in the head, instead of big money
They got big momma hurtin' instead
My life is makin' the verse, but the handcuffs
The bullpens, the jail cells is makin' it worse
Tell mom I don't go to the church, tell Oc' I don't' go to mas
I blow blunts, hold guns, and I'ma be right there when the soldiers'll march
I play the part, and my heart seem colder than March
But on the flipside of things, it's still warmer than June
I have talks with the Lord and he'll be callin' me soon, what
And my life is all I have, my family, my niggas, my flow, my grabs what

Body is finished, maybe they can save the tooth
Call me Kiss or call me the black Babe Ruth

Yo, I don't give a fuck about pull out, cock back
Spin a motherfucker out, empty his chest
Leave your motherfucking whip a mess
All over the dashboard, in backseat pieces of flesh
Send niggas to the grave with they face half gone
Stomach ripped open, the beef back on
That nigga Sheek rude, I'll spit in your food
Tell the women in ya family to suck my dick
No respect, fuck that, I'll murder you quick
Mad weapons in the trunk, bitch, take your pick
Stick a grenade up under your fender
Stick a pineapple bomb in ya blender, I don't care about you
You say fuck Sheek Louch? Well, fuck you too
Your father, your mother, the hole you came through
Niggas don't learn 'til they're kerosene-d out
Lighter to their face, they'll spit gasoline out
You want me dead, I'm right here, do it bitch
Make me bleed 'til I'm motherfucking fluid-less
I ain't new at this and don't give a fuck about you
Sheek'll run up and smack the shit out you
I live this shit, it's never gon' stop
Open niggas' face with a octopus top
Face all ripped up, catch me on the block
Shells all loaded up, catch me wit the Glock
Pussy motherfuckers don't want no beef
Trip niggas down to their platinum teeth
Chase you in the house with the all black heat
Leave you just boxers and slippers on your feet

You niggas talking like y'all can't get stuck up

As we continue on, your hood you finish
Write a suicide note and get a window on
Nigga, that's the type of shit we on

Take a cold heart to twist your mom
But it's wintertime, shotty under the snorkle
Flip when it's dinner time
Strange days without Angela Bassett
Middle of the hood, niggas handling plastic
Gotta watch ya head and not get popped with lead
And watch ya bread, not get popped by Feds
Anyway we gonna be in the hood

All I gotta do is puff some weed then listen to B.I.G
Then come back and level the city
I got my money up, my band is thirty, my bezzle is fifty
My vest weigh fifteen, banana hold sixty
So I can run slow and hit you up swiftly

More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body is a technicality
Other than that catch 'em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening and catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it

They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick

Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked

Then snatch the moon out the sky, and blow the sun away 

Me and my brothers play hardball 

Strictly hardcore, lyrics til I'm finished breakin God's laws 

My job's raw but I gotta do it - I'm feelin high then buddhaed 

so you might get shot and lose a lot of fluid 

The spot I blew it at an early age, ever since the curly braids 

I would earn a wage with the thirty gauge 

There's dirty ways to get paid if you got the balls 

Just load the glock and cause the hardest cop to drop his drawers 

Don't stop or pause, let the shotty go up his butt 

to finish up, punchin body blows and uppercuts

You best run son, I'm sendin emcees up shit's creek 

So don't sleep, cause I creep, on New York streets 

like I'm a big fat dick, wack emcees is ass-cheeks 

Yo, I'm that nigga that'll kidnap yo' kids 

Take em home, fuck em good, then send em back to you in bandages 

You lose, cause I got, the ill street, and still keep 

the toast close, and rep-a, resent-a, the East coast

If you ever fake jax, I'll slit yo' throat like O.J.

Lemonade, if it's beef, then the chrome blaze
You could make the newspaper, get ya own page

We wear masks so you can't tell, who's who
And for the cash, we'll blast at you dudes too
Wit the lead pipe, so get ya head right
I'm in the Benz, rims, spin at the red light
I'm comin for cash, gun in the dash
And I'm on 21 and a half's (for real cannon)

So they won't find you, or your Jordan's again
Take a boss to be ordered the men, give them a call
If you don't have my money, in 24 hours
Then the cocksucka won't see his daughter again
It's like the movie that you seen, I'm the star of the screen

And take six to the face, I dug a hole for you today

I came for war, you know what them thangs is for
Slug make ya blood stain the floor
It ain't a game no more, niggas gon' respect me

Metal lungies you spit, the grungiest shit
Hungriest shit, seventeen dummies a clip
Tell them rap niggas to suck my dick, fuck the industry

Now I'm headed to the county,
Gotta do a bid here, im used to living luxurous,
I don't wana live here, the walls is gray the clothes is orange,
The phones is broke, the food is garbage,
A lot a niggas is livin with these circumstances,
Sp's the same i still murk ya manz'z ,

Niga got popped for a murda attempt,
Knocked me on d block when i was burning the hemph,
Had a brick in the stash hope they don't take to a further extent,
Locked up and they wont let me out,
When i hit my cell block, niggas know to get me out.

Lift weights; get straight, 'til it's time to ball

With the light turned down and the beat down low
Throw the 40-cal and K's out the window

You blew up wit the hood rat
The fuck you break the code fo!?
God damn I think that I'm high
Too much haze
But I see my ghost pass within the blink of a eye
And my ghetto niggas know how it feel
I smoke more than a building on fire
Roll more than the wheel
I get stuck like a car in the mud
And blow my greens out
And call my nigga t pain and ball us some buds
And choke till I think I'ma cry
Oh I think I'ma die
Nah dog I just think that I'm high

So I'ma take two hits and I'ma my mind away

Now its on me again
So I take another pull
We in the Cadillac, floating like the ocean
Suddenly everything was moving in slow motion

So I take another hit
And try to relax
I'm beating on my chest
CJ beating on my back
Somebody help me I think I'm about to die
But I got it

So I pass the blunt and it came right back to me
But I know this smoke is still running through me
I don't think I'ma ever open my eyes

Damn I'm in love
Hit it from the house to the club
Keep my mind on her 
Spend my last dime on her
She bring me to cloud nine when my ass climb on her
Can see she make the picture clear
Just like Time Warner
Treat her like the car
The way that I ride on her
She helped me focus in 
Get my rhymes right too
And my mind right too
That's why she shine through

I gotta quit
I gotta get this chick up out my system
She's no good for me
All of my dogs wanna hit her
Right after I'm with her
I eat then I fall asleep
And it's gettin' costly 
Lately all I've been banging is the chicks that come to see
But shorty she's a dime
In fact that girl's a dub
And I think I'm falling in love
She gets me all chocked up
I can barely catch my breath
Don't want to pass her around
I keep her to myself
You see she's gives me stimulation
And nobody's messing up our rotation
Although I think it's big
And you better believe 
Nobody's blazing it up but me

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean
Just call me a fiend
I'm just a addict for your love, I've got to have it all your love
I can't let it go
I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I twist her up, pull her to me real slow (so slow)
Let the taste of a chocolate make my eyes get low
But she burns through my paper so fast
Gotta make it last
Hate to watch them Swisha sweets walk past
When my personal stash get low
Then it's back to the block tryna find her
Surely she's a dime
In fact that girls a dub

Styles P,"She's more than a dime, she's a dove
Damn, I'm in love, hit it from the house to the club
Keep my mind on her, spend my last dime on her
She bring me to cloud 9 when my ass climb on her

Can see she make the picture clear just like Time Warner
Treat her like the car, the way that I ride on her
She helped me focus in get my rhymes right too
And my mind right too, that's why she shine through

I gotta quit, I gotta get this chick up out my system
She's no good for me
All of my dogs wanna hit her, right after I'm with her
I eat then I fall asleep and it's gettin' costly

Lately, all I've been banging is
Them chicks that come with seeds
But shorty she's a dime, in fact that girl's a dove
And I think I'm falling in love

She gets me all choked up
I can barely catch my breath
Don't want to pass her around
I keep her to myself

You see she gives me stimulation
Ain't nobody messing up our rotation
Although I think it's big and you better believe
Nobody blazing it up but me

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean
Just call me your fiend

I'm just a addict for your love
I've got to have it all your love
I can't let it go, I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I twist her up, pull her to me real slow
Let the taste of a chocolate make my eyes get low
But she burns through my paper so fast, gotta make it last
Hate to watch them swisha sweets walk past

When my personal stash get low
Then it's back to the block tryin' find her
Shorty she's a dime in fact that girl's a dove
And I think I'm fallin' in love

She gets me all choked up
I can barely catch my breath
Don't want to pass her around
I keep her to myself

You see she gives me stimulation
Ain't nobody messing up our rotation
Although I think it's big and you better believe
Nobody blazing it up but me

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I'm not talking nicotine

Nigga drop the top, come through the hood, 
Put a hundred on your three or your foul line shot

Lending outfits all in the bus cause none of us could 
See a summer without trips (none of us can see it)
Mad hoops so the little boys might bark at you

Let's go

We in too deep to turn back now, D

Sure is

Watch yourself
Before you get
Blown away

You know where I come from
The place where your fate is a mic
Or a bull, or a dum dum
A jail cell, a pine box
And brothers is dumb young
Young boys
Still bustin' guns for the slum
That they come from
Cops is the only ones they gon' run from
That's it
They puttin' they hood up
But nine out of ten of us ain't got good luck
You gon' ride on a man and catch twenty-five
Or get hit and get sent to the other side
You lose both sides of the coin
So me, I play the hood, baby
Not in the
Mama got a little church I could join
But I didn't go yet
Man got a mosque I could join
But I didn't go yet
Cool with the devil on my back
I'm in cold sweats
'Bout to do some dirt
In some dirty black old sweats
If you known, you should've shown the way
Most of the hood 'bout to get blown away

'Cause I was raised up to show no fear
Cowardly hearts'll never last long here
If you ain't man enough to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
'Cause I done seen the block break down tears
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years
Tryin' not to get blown away

See, I ain't never shot nobody
But I'm known for fightin'
So when I strike, man
You'll think you been struck by lightning
Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga
Even a child could take a life by pullin' the trigga
Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion
So you target in the distance and keep on blastin'
They say guns don't kill people, people do
So when you're hit, man
You feel that shit the evils do
Can't see myself get beat down
My eyes swollen
Mom's cryin', they don't know what happened
My pride's stolen
If I ain't got my heat, then I got a blade
That hit ya off

Keep my eye out for jakes
Ears to the streets
Other eye out for snakes
And these scandalous freaks
If we ain't on good terms
Don't bother to speak
Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me
Same thing'll make ya laugh will make ya cry
And while this nigga quiet nigga, he'll take ya life
Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice
If somebody else could travel
Through the tunnel of life
'Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there
When you're ridin'
But I'll stay to myself
So if you see me out there
With a bear we fightin'
Then, nigga, go help the bear

Where I stood around to fight when it was better off to run
A message to my daughter, daddy ain't make you
But sometimes in life blood ain't thicker than water
A message to my wife, I gotta say I love you
And thank you for makin shit better in my life
A message to my moms, don't worry about your kids
Cause love is always love when we in God's arms
A message to my pops, my head's on my shoulders
And I'm takin care of family and never will it stop
A message to my sister, your big brother got you
But never in life let a coward nigga twist you

Cause it's hard for me to say keep your head up through the mail
A message to the poor, stressin the life
What we don't get now we get in the second life
A message to the kids, stick to your school
Cause if you fuck with the streets that's jail or a bid
A message to the wild, you should calm down
Cause everybody rattin and you probably blow trial
A message to the ladies, depend on yourself
So if daddy walk out you take care of the baby
A message to the rich, you should spread love
'Fore niggaz like me go ahead and spread clips

But we gon' be aight, cause it's soon to be good

Many ways they can send you a message, like a word from the wise
Or a 45 that send you to heaven
Some'll throw you a look, others a book
Like the king gettin killed by the rook, straight-forward
Some'll grab they soul when they feel like the Lord's callin
Some see it before it come
My nigga, one is all and all is one
I wanna see us all rich before all this done
But it's really God call cause we all his sons
Some I'ma play my role, hope God save my soul
Let me slide for them sins I owe
Pain and more pain's the only change I know
Brain stay in the frame, I'm in the game I blow
Either my watch broke or my lame-ass slow
But I'ma count my blessings 'til I get to the essence
It's all good just send me a message, what?

Still tryin to fill the void of Biggie and Tupac 
We on them avenues with the red and the blue tops 
Dudes hot to shoot cops from the rooftops 
Too many snitch niggaz TESTIFY 
Warrior kings sent to the bing and left to die 
Girls confuse sex with love so they extra dry 
And got birth control stuck to they necks and thigh 
Whoa, it ain't a game, they want the blacks all killed off 
Our caps all peeled off, nigga this real talk 
What's ill is y'all niggaz still caught up in them battle raps 
There's beef in the hood, +Escaladin+ like Cadillacs 
Monkey on your back livin like a junkie 
Addicted to a dream, wanna die for your country 
Tear down the prison walls, set everyone free 
From freedom fighters to Askari X to Pimp see 

[Chorus] 

[Talib Kweli:] 
Yeah... kids slip in the clip and aim 
For the fortune cause the fame ain't shit to gain 
They get stuck on whips and chains, so freedom slip they brain 
And psychologically that shit's insane 
Now that's crazy, a function of raisin the crack babies 
Sell it back to them cats freebasin back in the 80's 
(C'mon) Disco shit, nigga cock the toast 
Hi-Tek on the track and we rock with the Ghost 

[Styles P:] 
Damn right I make gangster music 
But I still spit poetry like Langston Hughes did 
Pressures of the ghetto might make you lose it 
Grab AK's and go and make the news kid 
Might lose control, but not my soul 
Won't sell for the white man to buy me some white gold 
Sell for the black man, to buy me control 
P, Tek and Kweli, the shit come from the soul why'know?

They want me to cock back and blow their chest out

So I'ma just give you the summer to tread water
Way they wrote it down in the paper it said slaughter
Found him in the tub with nothin' but red water
But anyway, back on track
Honey in the black on black, ass all fat
What up ma? You feel like winnin', feel like spinnin'?
Lil' Jimmy Chu footwear, antique denim
Shh, you do the math to that, six months
For these Louis and these jeans is a half a stack
What more could you ask than that?
Whoever got a problem get all of the desert and half the mac

Who want a problem ha, ha?

Who want a problem ha, ha?

Styles P,"Since back in the day 
We've been close friends 
You would call on me telling me your problems 
I'd been feeling things, things I never said 
When you said that you were in love 
Wish it was me instead 
I'd treat you like an angel 
He treats you like a fool 
When you were hurting baby, I was broken too 
And I can't go on this way 
I need you baby 

[Chorus] 
Tired of being the shoulder you lean on 
Wanna be the one you hold on to 
More than just a friend 
Let me be your everything 
Wish I knew the way to make you 
See that I've fallen in love with you 
Can't you see I love you baby 

If I sit you down, tell you what I'm going through 
Will you leave him? 
Will it be too much for you? 
Don't wanna be an addition 
To your situation 
I never wanna be a complication 
But if I see you cry 
I'm stepping in 
I can't keep watching you get your heart broken 
(I can't go on this way)

[Chorus] 

I ain't never said that I loved you 
More than the friend that put nothin' above you 
And I could be more than the shoulder you lean on 
I could be your king little lady, you'd be gettin' your queen on 
It hurt me everytime I seen him hurt you 
Thinkin' 'bout these feelings got me runnin' in circles 
(I can't go on this way) 
I love your mind, body and soul, and even your perfume 

[Chorus: x 2] 

Whenever you're down, a mess (trouble)
I will be there baby 
I will lift you up when (trouble)

I seen cats go out like suckers
I seen cats get down like, ""Yo, them some bad motherfuckers""
I see fake niggas and the games they play
Aiyyo, I deal with that bullshit e'ry day
But that ain't gon' stop me from doin what I'm doin
I got things beside bullshit to be pursuing

And you ain't around chemicals, just around generals
Who spend, passing they time, blasting they nine
Rather die with my man then the five for ya livewire
Spend half of ya time, smashing ya spine

These niggas ain't nice, they nice clowns

Nas been doin' just fine without you (esco)

I never did understand why they always told me to smile
Shit
It ain't too much shit I gave a smile for
Real talk
Yo still a asshole by nature
Peep game

I remember comin' up able to love nigga watchin' niggas fuck over 
They over sea I kept it reala
But bein' real ain't really always what niggas make it to be 
I never thought we'd make it and I'd have niggas hatin' a G
I got enough shit that I deal with on the day to day
Penitentiary's the life after death don't seem to go away
Even though I never know the outcomes it's always safe to pray
And try to do my best to understand he write a rhyme away
I got a call from Mr. Rogers just the other day tellin' me he by my side
I'm like what the fuck you talkin' 'bout 'til he told me Lorna died
It f***ed me up so much I couldn't even go to the wake
But if her family called I'm gon' make sure that they straight
It's like this part of my life I live is damn near mastered
The more people I love the more they get took away faster
Sometimes I feel I talk to God a lil more than the pastor
Prob'ly been livin' to make sure my son never become a bastard
I've never been the one to quit I've always been the leader
But I feel this world is like a bitch and I know I don't need her
If I ever had this I never took the time to meet her
So I feel a frown across my face the only way to greet her
In the process of bein' Trae I missed out as a child
Prob'ly 'cause reality must stop
And they told my cousin death before he thirty after checkin' his pile
He died at 28 so how the fuck am I supposed to smile shit

I don't know my nigga
I ask myself the same shit everyday
How the fuck am I supposed to smile
Life's real over here though
Ya know

Styles don't smile 
The hood too foul
The lil' niggas is wild
Men lost trial
Hit 'em with some numbers he ain't eatin' doin' chow
He ain't even sleepin' he been thinkin' 'bout his child
It's real fucked up but he won't see him for a while
Same bullshit try'na get you a money pile
You don't see the reefer or the jail doors locked
I keep a tech with the air holes cocked
Now I don't wanna shoot or get shot
But Pinero's not
Gon' fuck with these fuck niggas or air those Lox
It's real hard to sleep when its money on the mind and
Murder on the mind 
Puffin' on the dutch with a fist full of iron
Somebody mom cryin' 'cause somebody boy dyin' 
It's the same ol' shit
Wait till the funeral
Same ol' trip 
Crack money rap money
The same ol' grip
As Trae could've smiled out in Texas
Livin' reckless
If the cops gon' get you but niggas 'll leave you breathless
shit I'm a winner
More like a sinner
Try'na make it to dinner
Then live after breakfast

How the fuck are we suppose to smile

Answer me that
Maybe I'll fuckin' smile

Nothin' to smile about
These lil' niggas is wildin' out
Do somethin' to 'em they dialin' out
Everybody lookin' at you like you foulin' out
Every hood everywhere that's what it's now about
The shootas is half your age
Give you half the gage
Daily news half the page
Known as a thug now he ain't just fly
Couple months in the group home in D-F-Y
Truthfully what could have been pended but never did
And he slid
As a youthful offender 'cause he's a kid
Problem is
The person he shot was connected
He comin' home thinkin' he's sweet and don't expect it
Big but he's still young
To him it's still fun

Pain... pain... pain...

[Verse 1]
All I know is pain, all I seen is death
Couple homies and brother gone, when I'm gon' step
I ain't suicidal, damn my brain need rest
Think about my childhood, pain in my chest
Past is the past, future ain't great
All right in the hood when any day could be my last
Pop somethin' back, they wanna sue me for my math
Hawk some back, they wanna sue me for my math
Hard bein' a gangsta rapper, you don't know the half
You ain't got to condone it but you was never homeless
And you ain't never fast, so you don't know the wrath
To takin' a long walk, down the wrong path
All I know is pain - everything I did wrong
I did it in vain, that's why I'm tryin' to change
Live for my seeds but the game ain't change
Only the strong survive, I will maintain

[Chorus Styles P (Alchemist)]
All I know is, pain! all I give is, pain!
All I give is, pain! all I live is, pain!
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
(It's no love, ice cold blood runnin' all through my veins)
All I know is, pain! all I give is, pain!
All I give is, pain! all I live is, pain!
Only thing I know is mad years in the game

[Verse 2]
What you know about pain?
Blood, sweat and tears where I'm standin' in the rain
If I don't blow Mary Jane I'm goin' insane
Before I had a car I was in the fast lane
Drug dealer stick up kids for the neck game, a lot that I regret
But I made it as a rapper, and it's not what I expect
For a fact, this business is more crooked
The boys'll sell they souls to the devil, the Lord lookin'
See in you hell just in case that we all cookin'
I got sins too, lot of foul shit that I been through
The world is God house, I'm just a window, pane
Tryin' to maintain up to the end yo

[Verse 3]
All I know is pain, I feel so drained
Rap niggaz is insane, they on procaine
What they call hot, I would call so lame
They don't care about the art, and they show no shame
If you ain't gettin' spins, then you ain't gon' win
But if you came from the bottom you should stay goin' in
The Ghost don't make it then the phantom gon' win

As long as I give my soul whenever my story told
I don't know how you roll, all alone in the zone knowin' damn well my little brother home
Still feel him in the passenger seat
I can't see him and I wish that he can chatter with me
In due time until then, you can say I got more than a few rhymes
Thought I'd be there to see him like more than a few times
Tryin' to stay away from beef, but shit is gettin' deep
I ain't restin' right, it's like I'm on layaway for sleep
I think I shoulda been a author or somethin' 
Disappear like Hoffa or somethin', came back when they offer me somethin' 
My word I, got a little crust in my third eye
Headache's why I be meditatin'; thoughts is devastatin' 
Could this be my last life? Maybe my past life?
Is the future when I'm sleep? So what was last night?
I'm goin' in deep - and you know the Ghost

Have I thought about my life as a bad guy?
Made a little money sellin' rocks that was capsized
Robbed a lot of people like I never was baptized
Yeah I was a very young teen when I took my shit harder
But got right off my dean when I could book the Ramada
Cause I'd rather be a robber or a midnight marauder
There's a part of me that love bein' gangster, all of me
I couldn't help but get inthe game, the shit was callin' me
And I think that I was callin' it back
But you can't help buy trip when you fall in the trap
If the Lord call, who got the phone for callin' him back?
Things are man-made, why don't you tell man to do that?
Buy he can't, so I'ma stay on the spiritual flack
Cause it's a uphill battle when I'm dealin' with that

[Chorus]

Consider this a sermon, start to burnin' 
Never said you was hard, I ain't give you the permit
I might think you vermin, better yet vomit
Alone in the streets with the gun by the armpit
Can't put a shark with a pawn fish, it's conflict
Sorta like mixin' boy scouts with the convicts
Somebody goin' pay if somebody goin' play
Cause the streets cold-hearted on a hot summer day
If you goin' rap please stop, run away
Go home, flush ya crack then, give ya gun away
Cause the rules is written down, in invisible ink
Just consider what the critical think
Don't rat, do your bid in the clink; stand tall lil' boy
Get yourself a shrink if you're feelin' you're paranoid
But real talk, fuck jail talk, I know home's sweet
Even locked down in a cage is where your dome be

Pass the dutchie on the left, whoever's suckin' on the L
I'm a need candy cause I know my breath is gon' smell
I don't get sleep but some good restin' off a L

Missed my exit on the highway I ride on

Lovin' the smell, feelin' the texture
And we got a whole lot but we still gettin' extra
Guess what's on the menu for breakfast
Roll with the Ghost if you wanna get messed up

Grams to the bricks, O's to the pound
And the strap and the clip is for, holdin' it down
Get a hole in your shirt, or your hat knocked off
Cause them shorties got gats and they thirsty to pop off

They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labeled as a troublemaker; who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb ‘cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me; what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family; what else could I do
But be a thug? Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club!
Got my mind on danger; never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang bangers and drive bys

My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin back to court, so fuck what you thought!

Get in trouble everyday in school, act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin' off for the bitches, ‘cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop, pop, pop, and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo, currency kept passing me by, but I didn't cry, broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke
And now the money's looking lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick 'em the game, it's all the same
I kick it back, yo; give 'em slack, yo
And now they label me the mack, yo, people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit
You know you get your ass twisted, so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust
So if you're on, nigga, look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game

Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards want to kill me in my sleep
I'm real they cannot see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin', loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried

Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy

Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word

(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down
Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round
I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south
Carolina had the milli down there
Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks
In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom
I did, and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness
I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin'

I'm a let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie

It's sure about does that you heard me
And I dropped in effect since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon
That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11
Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law
So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know
I had that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights
While your boy bypassing fare light
But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right
Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae
Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up
But at the pull up, come, I say my crew run run, boy

Soldier, say K-L
These fake ass rap niggaz thought I lost it yet
I'm bout to let these old bitch ass niggaz know I got a game in my vein

[Verse 1:  Mac]
Murda murda I wrote it in braile
Uncut, lyrical dope, certified by my scale
The homicide rapper, there'll never be another after
The Mac's rapture, I represent, that's what I'm on the map for
Who the fuck gonna fuck with the scandalous
1-8-7 on these mothafuckin amateurs of rap
Feel the wrath of a nigga who bust
Makin my clique the shit, bitches want to discuss
?Platonic?, the lyrical killins don't got no motives
In this, in my vein, ain't no way I can control it
When this inside of me is as deadly as them niggas
You know the ones who killed them boys and dumped the body in the river
I enter the place, ski mask covered my face
If they pass me the mic, I'm gonna catch a case
In this mothafucka ya heard of me
T-T and herb hit the spot?
All the niggas I know is Shell Shocked

I got the game in my vein

I got the game in my vein
Won't change
I got the game in my vein
Won't change
I got it, I got it

Verse 2:  Mac
I was born in it and represented
The sinister words of murder was the sons of bitches who was wit it
Never die, my motto, fatigue my sheet
Big Wise that's my nigga, Psycho Ward is my clique
Affiliated with cash, got my foot on the gas
Tailgatin real fast, through my sun roof my verbal gun shoot
Them scriptures, paint the pictures
We believe was cops tryin to catch me like receivers
Scream my name, to all these bitches who be hard to tame
Momma said it's a shame, poppa gave me the game
Experience a soldier, my heart pumps battle fluid
You want to go to war let's get to it
Mac-a-don, put you on teflon style of murder
Deadly as the killer kyle in your hamburger
Till they bury me black, wrapped up in street camo
I rock the microphone strapped off with street ammo

I'm the bad nigga from the bricks
Blood on my kicks
Camoflauged niggas never die, we drop hits
I spit the gospel, to all of my mothafuckin apostles
Mac as potent as the coke snortin in your nostrils
I minister, words of a mothafuckin sinister
Transform into Liu Kang and finish ya
Nigga put me in the game I'ma show you my sports
Witness the street level on the be	-ball court
Bitch I'ma die wit it, cause it's a part of my vein
Hear that word camoflauge when you hear my name
So tell them niggas I'm back affiliated, enemy lines are penetrated
My niggas wit me
You cook me up, put me in the pipe, hit me

Blindin' staring at lights till they cryin'

That's when I first got the Naughty goose

I know what you better do, stop talking bout what you outta do

Funerals are still affordable, I'm better than all of you
I'm in the hood scraping 'em, Jadakiss, Rae and 'em
Ya'll lame niggas, come uptown, spend a day with 'em
Bigger ones, bootleg liquor runs, blow something, nigga
Let the Earth smoke hit your lung, get your guns
The economy is down, so you already know
It's gon' be a lot of homi's in the town
That's why I'm still bringing the seed back
The sneakers that I can't pronounce, that cost a G stack
Niggas in the yard, got this on repeat, black
Fuck saving hip hop, we bringing the streets back, what?

Player spit snipping, different color wallies on
Bliffen had to take 'em off, they fucked up the soles, flipped it
I'm forever zooted, crushed up glass, I'm just flashing through it
Nine times out of ten, suede down at the Jumer
Maybach bloomers, playing rumors, card shark
Getting cash money, take a loan, hit this tuner
We onion head niggas, the gun gooners
Put us together, he run sea, I run land, with one ruger
Stop playing, you know we run rap, you know we done that
Stop fronting, son, put the gun back
We came with the containers, besides having the flamers
My Mexican mans is famous
Running through the streets, the bulldog
Conehead hoodies on, eighteen five for footballs
Maxed like I'm under a good wall, good G
Good recipe, good status, a hood broad

I used to move brown rectangles
Roll you a blunt, then smoke you with death's angel
Chrome trey pound is making your neck dangle
Blue trey eight is leaving your chest mangled
It's math but the gun could kill you at all angles
Leave the toast home, I'm leaving you all strangled
Louis loafers on the Jaguar, gas peddles
You got the cops with you, you ain't even half ghetto
(Not even half) We neither here nor there
But if, you was over here, you would of been got aired
(Been got aired) Like a pair of white Nike's on a summer day
Pointing the gun away, I could kill you niggas a hundred ways
Mine's in a place that yours ain't, so I'm wearing war paint
For the day that I see the Lord saint
Blowing the purple haze, playing The Purple Tape
Fuck with Chef or the Ghost, get left with a purple face

Now I got a clip full of hollows in the.40
Louis, Guccis, every now and then Mauris
I take too long to come back, send for me
Know how to work it, big things pop on the underground circuit
Maintain 'til it surface
The nerve of these peasants
Treat a rap budget like a bird how I stretch it
Think they get the message
Waters, Dutchies, lot of herb in a session
So-called tough guys, herbs with aggression
Put your thoughts all over the curb with the Wesson
What used to be superb now is depressing
Negative energy
Generated from the snakes and the centipedes
You will remember me
I just get the storm started
Cold-blooded, warm-hearted
Either way you on target
Move to the side, let the lane merge
The gun's like fried rice, who want they brain stirred?
Enter the limelight, lemon drop-top off of crime life
Always see the crew in the hindsight
Yeah!
American sedan, the shooters got Berettas in their hand
This is Mafia, veterans'll plan
Word to the tape on the brick, this is raw
I'm in the 4x4, 8 plus 8 in the clip
The hustling Harry Potter, shaking the brick
Ice in the bracelet give the Matrix a glitch
And my car's like a spaceship
Got gold in my Nike checks
Jordans got ice in the laces
Pants got a gun where the waist is
It's basic, shirt smell like herb smoke
Chirp, yo, Chirp back
Let me know who getting murked, though
Yeah, we getting money, nigga
Who getting work, though

We gonna make it to the top, just one more step

We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
To the family, friends, whole life is set
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step, one more step

Yo, living my life, what's left of it
Don't try to go to jail but if you do make the best of it
If you crash into a bullet then it ain't no estimate
It's a money-back guarantee, my nigga
Death's a definite
This is audio crack, guess who's cheffing it
Jadakiss and SP, do this effortless
Gun play make you do whatever son say
If the Lord send you a flight, the ticket is one-way
Put that work in when you young, you get power
The money don't match the running it get sour
Still rep the hood to the death
A promise is only good if it's kept
Niggas'll kill you for less
Silence is golden, go 'head, keep dozing
The window of opportunity keeps closing
We gon' see if you really a clutch baller
A cell is small, but a casket is much smaller
Burn out 30 a set shit, 60 a Key shit
That's street shit, Jada & P shit
Lambos, hoopties, shooters and groupies
Montclair, D-Squared, Emilio Pucci
Long trips, short trips, making me nauseous

Made a couple mil for the small shit

Ain't touch it, ain't see it, ain't hear about it
If it's money gone, believe we gon' care about
Send some niggas to your crib, take the air up out it
Leave some blood up in it
Listen, fam, the Lam's the color of toast
The seats is like butter in it
No hammers in the club, box cutter in it
Long money and big checks

Still remember how the pigs at

Makin a mockery of the music that B.I.G. Pop stars
And they say I'm a saint

Got a nickname Sheek now you startin to speak (Sheek)
Said you want to fuck wit all three if that's ok (ok)
I'm like cool, once I hit it it was that anyway
A couple years gone passed, still havin a ball
A million times got the pictures on my wall
When I first hit it, I was like Sheek the man (you the man)
I stopped givin you the attention I originally planned
Then you stopped fuckin wit me (oh)
And left me alone
And people only seen you with Jada and P (That's my mans)
You even went around town and started doggin me bad (Damn)
But it was my fault ya know, I couldn't even get mad (Ok)
Had to grab the pen and pad and get right back
Write some more poems to your ass and get back on track (Whoo)
I ain't go no problems telling you I love you to death
And that I'm whipped
And my shit'll be blown if you skip
Let's go

(Chorus)
A'yo I had to hit the streets, they said you be out there a lot
And I can find you around any nigga out that's hot
Every club, every whip, every gambling spot
You know you'd rather be with me, you like to bug out
Love to bring the thug out
Plus I be keeping it tight
We even go to work together, let you play all night
Mad loud while I sit and I write
Haha
We gon' see the world together
But not on cable
All your friends lovin me, you even got me a label
Got the magazines lovin our relations
People love to hear us talk, DJ's record our conversations
You good around other people, 'specially kids
You make them happy, even brothers doin their bids
And I ain't jealous at all (uh uh), go out and spread your wings
And you can hang with Pop, just pick up the phone when it rings
Let's go

I ain't gon' lie to why'all, I'm whipped (whoo)

Over here it's all the way gully 
In the morning, answer to God's calling

Did lot

Stone cold shooter, let the heater blow
Gun that a just main Twitter, follow the leader though
Up in the hood, homie askin, I got my Nina on
Just stood his eyes on some niggas that he needed gone
It’s like that recorder, life ain’t normal
If you die to shine then ice ain’t for you
If the sky fall then the sky can’t warn you
When your head crack the base don’t warn you
Lightin up weed, pour that sour
In the streets in the mix like Kool Aid powder
Ride on them niggas, show em you ain’t coward
Yea you got family but you ain’t ours
Get popped up, oxed up, or boxed up
Think it’s a joke then bitch nigga done up up
Cuz I’m ghost and I’m still OG
This time I’m with Statik and it’s real OG, wuddup?

Livin rich or livin poor
Funerals stay on schedule
This not season, can’t stop the heatin
Funerals stay on schedule
All the G’s is getting money and relaxin
But funerals stay on schedule
And I don’t even care about the charges, invade federal
Funerals stay on schedule

I walk the cold streets of the city with big heaters
Ready for cats, there’s no one up, they dick beat us
Yea it’s Big B, the trill OG walkin
So keep yo mouth shut when the OG talkin
If I want your opinion then nigga I’ll beat it out of you
I’m real for the gunners bitch, I do on what I gotta do
And that’s got a lot to do with where I was raised
Reach and old man in the trill where they roamin with K’s
Always round with the gauge and they lurkin with meaners
Who will serve to get paid, committing more than misdemeanors
Once the while the shit you see my nigga do in his life
The average shit, there’s no one on here every night
You can go to PA, til they beam all the yonkers
The young niggas wilin in the streets, going bonkers
Best thing I could do right now is pray for you
Just to narrow that pistol nigga to lay on you, hold up

Livin rich or livin poor
Funerals stay on schedule

All the G’s is getting money and relaxin
But funerals stay on schedule
And I don’t even care about the charges, invade federal
Funerals stay on schedule

For every nigga that say he proud of me
It’s a nigga that’s out for me
Feelin like Martin Luther, I’m standin out on the balcony
Niggas used to be tough but I cut em off, call em equities
Niggas was in the fam with me, only niggas that dance with me
Bitches ain’t wanna fuck, now they on and this for a chance with me
If you knew what that bass meant this is my fuckin rhapsody
Feel like I’m a rhapsody, killin it with my faculty
High up above the ground, I swear I’m defying gravity
Yea I be younger but when I grow up I’mma buy me something
I always knew I’m like the psyche bluffin
Miss clear where the hustle, watch where I could see the future
We got bigger guns than dreams, little niggas will shoot ya
For no reason other than colors, he looked up to his brother
Now we layin beside him, too many tears for a mother
Too many story of hunger but fuck ya
If I must so I be out here in the streets tryna teach my niggas to come up, word

Styles P,"I go with it,I'm so with it
First class flight overseas, I'm low with it
Stretching out the chair, wearin' low in it
Thinkin' of a house in Cali, can I grow in it?
Throw a booth in the place, imagine how I'd flow in it
Outer space bars, Ozs to the face, y'all
Bowl by the hottub in case, y'all
Plush life, laugh and I smile a lot
Light it up, bottle pop
Blowin' kush from San Diego to Ottawa
A long way from the days I used to bottle up
Keeping all of my feelings bottled up
Keeping all of the guns hollowed up
Now we gettin' rich, gettin' twisted like Oliver
Money, pile it up, yeah
The first go around, then again when we follow up

Block's my office, no days off it

More fun than festivals
Audemars and oysters perpetuals
Goon niggas that turn niggas to vegetables
Long as it's coke, being broke's unacceptable
Word to the zero that go after the decimal
May I double the way I bubble
Them ballers, the shit that brought AI trouble
If rap had a Dave Stern, believe I'm him
Think not? Bet the money in your Levis, then
Digital analogue
Always had catalogue, the bulls for the matador
But if I see red like the Bulls do
Somebody's gettin' shot and won't pull through
Got more animals than a zoo do
Yeah, it's Ghost The Grand

So I ain't constantly relying on these strangers
Trying to get my pace off one off before my anger

I never hesitate ??? like my resume
First words come to my brain I keep i set it scrape
I said its fake, i said its bait
I said I laid the worm on the hook and set a fucking state
My center space is my center of crime
Im descended from a list of those who center they mind
And setting a and sighting my prime

Tat his iPhone, the animal Ock I box bears
Got those quotes to Glock pop folks
Two times in the head and laugh, that's the knock-knock joke
Shots flying, I nail ya
Shots fly I nail ya, one eye open scopin I’m Popeye da Sailor

Used to get money off a cassette tape

Don't watch roots with white niggas
Bullets [?] when the eight's spitting
Blow this shit out of proportion, the race in racism
A degree for my declaration
When saying Sean P say da P with exclamation
Motherfucker

Let me tell you 'bout this story of a young'n
Raised in a ghetto that he was brung in
Round the drinkin' and druggin'
Had to box it out in backyards
So I put my Nike Airs on
And dug in the dirt and I started sluggin'
I lost some, I won some, but I fought them all
Trying not to be another name upon the wall
Lots of murals that's been painted in memory of
But I'm still here so before I'm gone gimme the love
Imma take my flowers now when I can still smell 'em
Then roll up the strongest trees and inhale em
The world is getting worse everyday I try to tell em
As long as you keep buying the lies then they gon' sell 'em
Y'all niggas is mad and they tired, ready to act out
You can't keep killing them and not expect them to black out
You locked the front doors on 'em and they take the backround
All your shit will leave your face with the shit smacked out

I’m fraying but I’m saying that I’m spraying cause I am if I have to
Salute the niggas laying on the land like a statue
If I say I’m staying where I stand I'ma vanish
If I say I'm out, I'm playing with the menace
That's like beef or vendetta
You wouldn't understand the goals without a mask on your face
Shoulda really feel somthing, when they blast in your face
If you playing in the jungle feel the wrath of those apes
But I'm positive and negative, ignorant and conscience too
Listen to the angels, but watch what the monsters do
You addicted niggas sponsor you
Tell you have another one, watch that shit conquer you
Even the wise do foolish shit
Even the cop kill a kid that go to school and shit
Believe it or not, stand still and you can move with it
Open your eyes and I ain't even got to prove this shit

Oh my god
How I humble myself
As I bow to your throne
I pray for love, peace and happiness
To be present in my home
Yes, I do

To forever provide
What's the meaning of living
Since you barely survive
If you came from the dirt
Now you touching the sky
You keep fucking wit me
You must be rushing to die
So you better decide
'Cause it's better to ride
I'm 2 slots after the 3rd dead or alive
You can give me the racks instead of the shine
'Cause I been doin' what I'm doin' ahead of my time
If you ain't hearin' what I'm doin' you better rewind
The only thing I'm scared of doin' is federal time
I sold crack out the building several dimes
And I done counted up a million several times
Gold plated desert eagles incredible nines
Better flows better fabrics better designs
Family and loyalty
Then the cheddar behind
I put some money on ya head
Or some bread on ya mind
We ya problem alone
But we better combined
Do it for those not here
And forever confined
And we ain't promised tomorrow
So lets treasure the times
And we ain't givin it away
So lets measure the lines
And keep killin these niggas
The pleasure is mines
We get better with time
So you better resign

They say love is a funny thing
But what's funny is the company that money brings
Every year my circle's getting smaller
Not Ben Baller but never had a thin wallet
I got dollars in different forms of currency
I got problems, but ain't nothing that worry me
And I ain't saying that I'm worry-free
I'm just saying nothing's fucking with me currently
Shit, I'm my own worst enemy
I make bread just to spend it like it's ten of me
It's Evidence and people call me by my government
Call me for weed, but don't call me for that other shit
Absorb the game that was meant to be sold
Not told, I heard good fortune favors the bold
So I'm standing in the rain, gambling the game
In the circle rolling dice with a hand full of gold and we go

They'll try to catch me when I'm slipping with the toolie, yo
I just want a Gangsta's Paradise like I'm Coolio
Told my nigga Evidence, I don't leave no evidence
Not a trace, but they gon' know the Wraith was in their residence
The revenant, comes for the settlement, niggas is so irrelevant
They gon' try to use you, they gon' want your watch
And your chain and your shoes too, niggas will straight abuse you
They gon' stand there and act like they paid dues too
If you're right, then stay right
If you're wrong, then get gone, my nigga, then so long
Do you really want the best for me?
Are you happy when niggas' testing me?
You just trying to figure out my recipe
You will never get it, just bounce, nigga, you're stressing me

Would you love me if I didn't have 9th or Alicia's number?
If I wasn't with the Roc, would you run and tell your friends

Would you hit me back or see me later and tell me you forgot?
If I wasn't in that flick standing in front of the ride
Would you wanna make up if we had failed like you had thought?
Would you by my single on iTunes and pay $1.20-something?
Are you like the rest, sheep, blind leading the blind?
Would you praise me even if I didn't have a Dre co-sign?
Tell me what you want: new shoes or free tickets?
Don't ask me again, hit Dave if you want Kendrick
I know real love, I listen to Mary J
I can't carry you too, baby, ain't none of you marry Jay
Every breakup don't make up—the rest of you, Mary Kay

No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around
Nobody x5
Humpin' around babe

When you love someone
And you want to love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
And you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you
Say that you love someone
Why are you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl you don't love no one
You don't know what love's all about
You lose the game, (if you) if you play that way

[Chorus:]

Nobody x7
Humpin' around babe
Girl if you trust someone
You don't call on everybody
Ain't nobody foolin' around
And the more I think about it
You lose all your clout and
You lose the game, baby, if you play that way

[Chorus:]

Girl you said you love me
And you said you trust me
Why do you think I'm foolin' around
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, humpin' around

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]",Humpin' Around,2002
Stylz P,"You know
I never did understand why they always told me to smile
Shit
It ain't too much shit I gave a smile for
Real talk
Yo still a asshole by nature
Peep game

I remember comin' up able to love nigga watchin' niggas fuck over 
They over sea I kept it reala
But bein' real ain't really always what niggas make it to be 
I never thought we'd make it and I'd have niggas hatin' a G
I got enough shit that I deal with on the day to day
Penitentiary's the life after death don't seem to go away
Even though I never know the outcomes it's always safe to pray
And try to do my best to understand he write a rhyme away
I got a call from Mr. Rogers just the other day tellin' me he by my side
I'm like what the fuck you talkin' 'bout 'til he told me Lorna died
It f***ed me up so much I couldn't even go to the wake
But if her family called I'm gon' make sure that they straight
It's like this part of my life I live is damn near mastered
The more people I love the more they get took away faster
Sometimes I feel I talk to God a lil more than the pastor
Prob'ly been livin' to make sure my son never become a bastard
I've never been the one to quit I've always been the leader
But I feel this world is like a bitch and I know I don't need her
If I ever had this I never took the time to meet her
So I feel a frown across my face the only way to greet her
In the process of bein' Trae I missed out as a child
Prob'ly 'cause reality must stop
And they told my cousin death before he thirty after checkin' his pile
He died at 28 so how the fuck am I supposed to smile shit

I don't know my nigga
I ask myself the same shit everyday
How the fuck am I supposed to smile
Life's real over here though
Ya know

Styles don't smile 
The hood too foul
The lil' niggas is wild
Men lost trial
Hit 'em with some numbers he ain't eatin' doin' chow
He ain't even sleepin' he been thinkin' 'bout his child
It's real fucked up but he won't see him for a while
Same bullshit try'na get you a money pile
You don't see the reefer or the jail doors locked
I keep a tech with the air holes cocked
Now I don't wanna shoot or get shot
But Pinero's not
Gon' fuck with these fuck niggas or air those Lox
It's real hard to sleep when its money on the mind and
Murder on the mind 
Puffin' on the dutch with a fist full of iron
Somebody mom cryin' 'cause somebody boy dyin' 
It's the same ol' shit
Wait till the funeral
Same ol' trip 
Crack money rap money
The same ol' grip
As Trae could've smiled out in Texas
Livin' reckless
If the cops gon' get you but niggas 'll leave you breathless
shit I'm a winner
More like a sinner
Try'na make it to dinner
Then live after breakfast
Ya know

Trae 
S.P.
How the fuck are we suppose to smile
Man
Answer me that
Maybe I'll fuckin' smile 
Why'know

Nothin' to smile about
These lil' niggas is wildin' out
Do somethin' to 'em they dialin' out
Everybody lookin' at you like you foulin' out
Every hood everywhere that's what it's now about
The shootas is half your age
Give you half the gage
Daily news half the page
Known as a thug now he ain't just fly
Couple months in the group home in D-F-Y
Truthfully what could have been pended but never did
And he slid
As a youthful offender 'cause he's a kid
Problem is
The person he shot was connected
He comin' home thinkin' he's sweet and don't expect it
Big but he's still young
To him it's still fun
360 waves new gear blue steel gun
They say you ain't promised tomorrow
They got the drop and hit him right in his head with a hollow",Smile,2007

you whisper your good-byes

there's nothing I can tell you

before you slip away

after you leave me
where can I go?
after you leave me
what will I do?

I get next to her

should I let her go

Your smile has turned to clay

Far beyond these castle walls
Down by the bay where the
Moonlit water falls
I stood alone while the minstrel sang his song
So afraid I'd lost my soul

There in the fog his song kept calling me
Leading me on with its haunting melody
Deep in my heart a voice kept echoing
I knew I'd soon be wandering

Far beyond these castle walls
Where the distant harbour meets the sky
There the battle raged like hell
And every dove had lost its will to fly

Far beyond these castle walls
Where I thought I heard Tiresias say
Life is never what it seems
And every man must meet his destiny",Castle Walls,1977

Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness
I'm a lonely soldier off to war
Sent away to die, never quite knowing why

But they can't see the way that I feel
Nobody even cares to try
I spend my life and sell my soul on the road
And I'm still in the dark
'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone

Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness
I'm a lonely soldier lost at sea
Drifting with the tide
Never quite knowing why
Sometimes it makes no sense at all

(I'm alive)
Looking for love I'm a man with emotion
(And my heart's on fire)
I'm dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean
I'm alive!",Man in the Wilderness,1977

All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To the magic and mystery they bring
To the music in their story

All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To the magic and mystery they bring
To the lands of ancient glory

In the year of the Lords
The message came from above
The heavens opened with their mighty sound
that shook the people in the town

And so we came from everywhere
The young and old the rich and poor
To hear the legend of the magic ring
and of the powers it could bring, they sing

All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To the magic and mystery they bring
To the music in their story
All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To the magic and mystery it brings
May we someday wear its glory

And now the message is clear
For I became a Lord this year
And though the legend was pure fantasy
We still need the hope it brings, so let's sing

All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To believe is a wonderous thing
May we always sing their glory

All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To the magic and mystery they bring
To the promise of their story",Lords of the Ring,1978

Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Te despiertes recordando
Que a pesar de mis errores tuvimos hermosos días

Que frecuento los lugares donde me abrazabas fuerte
Que no soy nada discreto cuando alguien te menciona

Yo disfruté sus caricias y su primer beso
Fue mío y fue mía
Yo, yo entré sus brazos dormía
Yo le arrancaba sonrisas
Mientras le cantaba canciones bonitas
Yo, no supe lo que tenía, me acostumbré a la rutina

Beside an apple tree did grow

Long long ago

The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find
The branches of the two trees were intertwined,

Hit the dho baby
You ain't got to go home but yo ass got to go baby
And that for sho baby

[Chorus 2X]
(MJG)
I saw yo naked ass
Peekin out the curtain of yo mini shirt
Shadow of yo pussy close behind
Telling me MJG
Run with me through fields of flowers
We can fuck for hours
Come and she you anytime 
You say no
How you gone say that when you dress say yes
A saddle on yo chest I expect nothing less
Than nuts on yo neck dick on yo chin
Just like we done then last time lets do it again
It looks as if to me you got some handles bout yourself
But everything you struggle to reach is up on the shelf
In homes of pimps who done done it
Some play around with your mind we run it
Gin sippers Orange Mound, Tennessee nigga
We deliver all up and down the Mississippi river
Fuck a check bitch 
No ID no income and dividends
Ain't got nothing but space now fill it in

I'm the MJG pimp tight 
Put it to the floor 5 0 swang a right 
In a pina butta guts is a must 
Drivin' in the shop take a mile grab em up 
Paint a ten clear coats to make it shine 
Make me circle through the neighborhood 55 times 
With my gas tank full, drank a boor 
Fall up in the park after dark try to pull 
Me a young, stout woman, sumpin' pretty 
Nice round hills, with them wear shaped titties 
As the sun goes down, I'm gettin' dirty 
Fall up and press a word get cleaned in a hurry 
In my 77 Chevy, ass tight 
Pull off cuttin' rubber, disappearin' in the night 

Just like candy (candy)

Its the same feeling (looks good to me) 

10 o'clock in the morning, his A got up 
Chief and Haywood some cool-Aid in my favorite cup 
Comb my hair, get my grill right so I can feel tight 
Havin' starch in my jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes 
As I strike, out the door, to my superb 
Parked by the curb, candy coated bird 
The sun got my candy lookin' good enough to eat 
You can tell by the way the girls act across the street 
Hit the horn, but no stallin', keep ballin' 
4 o'clock Sunday, I gotta hit the mall and 
Fall in full of them green trees 
Hurry up so I can catch Martin Luther King 
Fools all in the way with that econo-spray 
Need to take a few classes, learn about Manassas 
Pressure got me beamed, I'm talkin' on the phone 
Tellin' Penny that's the way to do it, baby represent ya home

And in the summertime we got the whole block blind 
Some busta in a primed out Pinto poppin' game 
Lying sayin' he goin' get the same thang 
If you ain't ridin' wood, and leather, your ride ain't hittin' 
A plane dash for a crush, forever got you itchin' 
99.95, 30 day paint jobs 
Got niggaz ridin' round lookin' like a junk yard 
You need to pull a check, wheeler check, wheeler check 
Stack up on your grip, get your shit sprayed wet 
See most of these new paint jobs they don't do 
But if it ain't candy then the job ain't true 
 
Its reserved for them ballaz, who make that cheese 
It ain't candy if it didn't cost a couple of G's 
On your Jeep, your truck, your Chevy or your Lexus 
5th wheel on the grill like them playaz do in Texas 
My folks gettin' sideways in Vallejo 
Ballaz in Memphis slammin' shut the Cadillac doors 
Full of ink so blinked I could fly 
To a world where you have to roll candy or you die

Intro/Chorus:

lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down

Verse One: Thorough

He's got his head tilted back on his face is a frown
Who's that nigga there it's Thorough bitch
So don't you clown, the sound and style, of Swisher after Swisher
Oh how I wish ya would step so I could hit ya
With wicked shit slick and swift
As I slaughter quick, oughta flip with fluents
To show you how we be doin in the Suave House federation; that is cat
You don't know how it's comin cause you don't where it's at
A mack of all trades, low cut, tight fade
We all get paid, so gets sprayed, so buster behave
My flavor's deep, please peep, I ain't soft
I represent at all cost and always got my niner out
So eeease back cause you marks can't hang with me
I got to much game in me, killin ain't no thang to me
Give a nut check, and I see you outta place
And I say that to say you're a BITCH, and you ain't got what it takes
To stop the funk mutha from freelance jackin
Brushes up on yo skills, cause fool I ain't lackin
With my hands on my dick, my click is thick so don't clown
Bitches we ain't playin you hoes lay it down

Chorus: repeat 2X

Verse Two: Eightball

It's Sunday morning, I'm stil yawnin from the night before
So much sess in my chest from the Swishers I smoke
OH NO!!!! Who is this hoe in the bed with me?
I remember the pussy but I don't remember her name G
Grab me Swisher cut it up and fill it with weed, hit that hoe
In the head, and tell her get out of my bed you damn freak
Hopped into the shower for an hour, it was hot as hell
Got dressed and ran a gold comb through my curls
Walkin out of the house slow, tellin that hoe come on let's go
First I crack up the music then, hit the switch on my six-four
Candy coated paint, got the bitches at the bus stop sick
But at the same time on my dick, thick
Beat a bitch quick I'm sick, full of Swishers and malt liquor
I'm a killa on them sticks, aggivated hallucinatin
Tryin to let go of my frustration
But some my luck, nigga gonna be a med patient
I gotta nine uzi AK, but that shit don't really matter
Cause if I gotta I will rat-a-tat-a
To splatter the guts of nigga with no nuts
And if you step to Suave you will have to lay it down

Chorus: repeat 2X

Verse Three: Crime Boss

Here comes the spy, that fry, get high, and get head rushed
The number one gangsta you can't touch or bust
So steppin is the wrong that you gots to come against me
You best to do a driveby and be prayin that you hit me
Cause nigga if you miss me I'ma have to draw my gat
And take yo ass way back, cause way back way back in the days
I used to beat dope fiends down just get paid
Live my life as a hustler, sellin drugs was my only J
My moms was a trick hoe I had nowhere to stay
And nigga that's fucked all my homies are loners
I've been on this for ten years so I'm known on corners
With bitches and prostitutes, pimps and killa thugs
Five-oh harrassin me, so Crime Boss is feelin slugs
A good guy gone bad, devious fuckin kid
Victim of ?, shit that my momma did
These dope beats comin up, I'm servin those clucker bitches
My beeper still goin off, I'm thinkin of addin riches
For dollars and sense, see I gotta have it goin on,
Or be trapped in this hole for too motherfuckin long
IT'S ON!!!!

Verse Four: MJG

Thirty buster in yard talkin shit bout a bitch
Claimin to be that bitch's family but they look like dirty tricks
Talkin about why did I meet that hoe, fuck the hoe
Charge the hoe, break the hoe, bust her inside her shit and go
Suckers how the fuck you think that MJG was gonna slip
On the only reason you mad cause you sister couldn't pussy whip
A back breakin, check takin, pimp nigga constantly makin
Money off you and your lady, nigga I ain't tradin
Why don't you niggaz understand I'm the pimp she's the hoe
Now that Itold you now you know, break that chain and let her go
Back on the track shake that ass, make my money
Make it fast, get yo head swoll bringin me checks bitch bring me cash
Drop yo panties, to let you start
To open your mouth, slurp and slob
On this dick you, he's the trick you's a bitch, do ya job
When you through, get up and go, get the cheese, hit the door
Catch a cab, back to the lab, bring my motherfuckin money hoe
Don't you ever front me with a lame lie about my bank
Oh shit, look out bitch, dump a bitch catch a plane
Yeah hoe now you know, I'm a pimp, and I'ma clown all upside yo head
Yeah bitch, I'ma lay it down

Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckers go 
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well 
How the hell you been since I had no job 
Hum, why don't you give me some 
 
'Cause you know I flow and run for Suave 
Nah, all of that was on the couch 
No doubt why y'all records spin, why y'all shippin' in gold 
It's cold On The Outside lookin' in (brrrr!) 
 
You'd best a make yourself worthy 
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their johnson very dirty 
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit

Now you down for them habits 
Put your numbers on them naturals 
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom

Niggas in love 
Can't stay out the club 
All in the hoe's face 
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased 
 
I see him in the back 
Countin' up that cheddar 
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd 
I think I know one 
 
I remember you, oh yes I do 
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo 
What time the club close, at 3 
What's up, you comin' with me 

We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees 
You want some cheese 
Hoes don't stay at the suave house 
Hoes around my nuts like knots

Wants to get close to me

Lookin' for, confidants, and tickets to my next show 
Check yo' bitch 
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses 
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses 
 
Oh yes it's very true 
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you 
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do 
Let her loose or let her remain 

'Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame 
A bigger name 
Look, this thang with bigger game 
And she claim she ain't heard my music 
 
Tryin' to trick me

She still hit me 
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I

Ooh that girl, that girl, that girl, oh talk about that girl that girl
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That girl, that girl, that girl...

Say look at me baby, I've been looking at you too
Trying to understand the thing that you want MJ to do
Ain't it funny how the time easily slips away
I've been thinking about you sugar every moment every day
And we lay upon the beach we can each get cosy
On the other end where the people don't know me
Show me, any little thing that you feel like
Let me know the spot that gets you hot and make it feel right
Introduce some plans, to the elementary game
We can be connected with a number and a name
Strange how women make you chase them for awhile
Then when you approach them they get timid like a child
Ain't no sugar in my tank, no deductions in my bank
Never never, mad mad this steels to clever
But I'm trying to get her on a trip of my world
Seven days, six nights -- that girl

That girl, that girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl)

Take a nigga baby can we get out, go oversea
Don't mind at the house bring you body with me
I've been really taking notes on the way that you maintain
You're one out of akind entitled to the same thing
Opportunity knocks for you girl let it be
Yet it don't stop to the ?
I know you've wondering how long could it last
But trust in the future and let the day be the past
I'm taking you dancing, you've just got good legs
But all I vision is some real good times
That we could be having in the blink of an eye
Impossible dream we can achieve if we try
It's the brother who cut for youMentally and physically
What would it take for you, do you really want to get with G's
My mission to hold my angel my pearl
But we still live as strangers -- that girl

That girl, that girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I should surely be her man (that girl, that girl)

You look marvellous in your jeans, that queen
Thinking about the entrance you made at the club scene
You know you're looking goodSo I just let it ride
Too many in the hood that have already tried
They said you be looking for things I can't produce
Like a fast life, and quick dreams
To tell you the truth, competiton is blowing my hustle about position
Concidences keep us apart
It's hard to listen to somebody that you don't even trust
you don't know
Places that I want you to come, you don't go
Half all playing the game of cat and mouse
But before you start running your mouth or getting out
You don't want a man, you want somebody to play with
Knowing it's impossible for you to stay with
So real don't forget that I said
Probem is went to her head

That girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl) x2

I want you (I want you)I want to see you (I want to see you)
I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
Girl if you don't want to (don't want to)
I won't force you (force you)
I want to find someone who wants to be right here right in my world
I want you (I want you)I want to see you (I want to see you)

busted in the door and stuck the guard wit' a shank 

ran up to the counter pull the gun out wit' the quickness 

shot the bank teller so it wouldn't be a witness

ran to the hide-a-way knowing they was after me 

burned out my id stole a jeep Cherokee 

couldn't be late for my trip to Jamaica 

heading to the river skeeming up on how to take a 

boat from a victim, rush right up and stick him 

with a sharp object making sure that I get him 

put it to the river, see, nervous as a lunatic 

jumped out of the veichle as borrowed me a boat quick 

jumped on with the gun, soughter on the break and run 

shot with the gat, in the back, like in Vietnam 

quickly making waves in the river as I ran fast 

got a mile in the boat ran out of gas

of people dying rapidly, trying to imprison me 

just because I took a little money in a robbery 

landed in Jamaica chilling with the dreads 

smoking on the gunja messing with my head 

the feds came behind me hit me with a billy club 

I fell to the ground, turned around pumping slugs 

jumped up quick, ditched the gun as I ran away 

ran to the hills where I hid for a few days

You know what you got to do I'm here to do it  
How about you?  

Our age five years old 
We were young bucks 
Scrubbin' each others backs in the bathtub 
Babysitter would send you to bed 
But she would make me stay up 
So she could give the young playa some viscious head uh 
Early symptoms of 
Time of nightway 
Gigantic factor from the 
Caukenis bitch tamer 
Some had it all though 
But less unfortunate 
You had an alloy spoke Mongoose 
And I had a Huffy 
You owned a green machine 
Three different lunch pails 
I had a go-cart that I built from a bunch of used nails 
We grew up in the church together nigga 
Sunday school 
Now I heard you off into jackin' nigga 
That ain't even cool 
I used to be conned, racked, fucked around, 
And ripped bad 
Barking up on the wrong tree 
Talking about runnin' up in my past 
Niggas have hateful thoughts 
But they stop me from strivin' 
Suckas be shakin' salt 
All in his gameful so find 
Some fools be gettin' crossed 
Victims of 40-ness 
Man all that drama you come with 
I swear you on some shit 
Whether it's morphine or cocaine 
Doja or dog food 
They had these marks for Tre and Max 
Fuckin' off my high breakin' rules 
You got ya P's mixed up 
You ain't no pimp 
You's a forty 
I spit for major mix 
While you make tapes for ya homie 
And then you work up tha nerve 
To speak fair words 
The pimp, a traitor, we instigators 
That's why I wrote this verse 
For every youngster with his mind on his meal 
Young playa just chill 
And take a look at what these fakers call real 
Nigga 
I trust no man, 
'Cause man will let you down every time 
That's why I take it upon myself to thank god in every rhyme 
'Cause I've seen better times 
And I've seen worser days 
When some of my so called friends 
Wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say 
I quench my thirst today 
With righteous thoughts of mine 
'Cause righteous thought of mine will leave mark ass niggas far behind 
I seen it every time 
They come and go 
That's why I drop to my knees 
And ask god to distinguish friend from foe 
And what do you know 
By the time morning comes I can see the light 
And then I'm thanking god once again for making everything all right 
He made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene 
Countin' greens 
Straight from H-town to New Orleans 
New human beings puttin' it down like a mic or not 
Replace the slot open up shop 
We 'bout to make it hot 
Stop 
With ya devilish doins 
Because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin 
Friend or foe, you just will never know 
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold 
Playa hatin' is everywhere I go 
Friend or foe you just will never know 
Listen 
I'm tryin' to tell you my nigga to watch cha back 
And trust few 
Cause ain't no nigga goin' watch ya back for you like you 
When someone is broke and down and out without no clout it's rough 
At least you know who you can and who you cannot trust 
See let me explain myself and clear up the point I'm tryin to make 
Don't want no bustas around me 
Playa hatin' or actin' fake 
Don't ever be wantin' nobody to get to close 
I don't know if it's effects of 
From the marijuana that got me more than trippin'
See nowadays tha nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot 
But if my loot was gone would I be all alone? 
See, my partners who used to ride with me 
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes 
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll? 
Maybe they will, maybe they won't 
Who is to say what a nigga will do 
Who is to say if you help someone it's guaranteed that they'll help 
You 
See what I'm sayin', listen to me and see if you can dig this 
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people receive ends 
Now all of a sudden I'm actin' funny because my moneys loaned 
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home 
But I'm not tellin' a nigga nothin' you don't already know 
Personal business, you got to watch who you friends is 
I'm thinking about hard times 
Freeing my mind 
Who in the fuck goin' be my crutch? 
Holdin' me up, helpin' me out 
Makin' sure that I stay in touch 
Where do I sleep, who do I turn to? 
When I be low on my cash 
Who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin' bout kickin' my ass? 
Who is my friends who is my foes? 
Who do I ask, when I want to know 
Somethin' about somethin' but I don't know nothin' 
My ignorance be keepin' me out in the cold 
Who do I call when I'm in need of a ride? 
In somebody elses car 
How do I get from point A to be	 if be is just to far? 
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone? 
Who's goin' to give me the permission to make a decision 
To come up in they house and live 
When will I drive a BMer takin' my clothes to the cleaner 
How can I know 
Will I forever be payin' my dues, will I forever be singing the blues? 
Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin' to lean 
Know what I mean? 
When I be needin' some justification 
Stuck in the fuckin' same location 
Who is the friend that is helpin' me? 
Who is the busta that's hurtin' me? 
Who can I trust? 
Will you be there when the goin' is tough? 
Will I be hangin' with dick in the dust? 
Who want to share my load when it's too heavy to carry? 
Or will I go crazy pullin' the load alone? 
Constantly gettin' my hustle on 
When will I finally see, kinda suspect 
Or even actually know 
Who is my real friend thick and the thin? 
And who in the fuck is the foe?

Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold

Suavehouse,"mic check one two
you know when you lose somebody 
somebody that's close to you
somebody that's probably not even that close to you
you might have just knew him
it's hard to put it into words you know
it's hard to say what you feel
it's hard to say what you feel....
I guess all wounds heal over time
you know...but uh
all i can do now is reminisce

(Verse One)
Look at my homeboy lying there dead in the street
His eyes wide open and it's fucking with me
I can't believe this shit it really seems unreal
My streetwise ass dog ended up getting killed
We used to laugh but now this shit ain't funny at all
Thinking about when my dog first started to ball
Telling me I was blessed use my gift
But it was hard to stay away from that gangsta shit (so hard)
Young eyes attract glitter like glue
Running with a crew doing everything they do
Smoked out drinking mad dog and thunderbird
My momma screaming but I swear I never heard a word
My homeboy's momma cool but she smoke crack
Now getting high is how she bring her son back
Imagine that so many kids are living this
One day my son will lose someone and reminisce
I hope it's me when I'm a hundred and three
Your homeboy getting killed that's some bad shit to see
I hope you agree and make it better for the young ones
Cause these momma's can't take no more dead sons

Chorus

Can't you see the way we live 
The world wouldn't spin without gangsta shit
I don't know what you've been told 
But baby somebody told me
(Only the strong will survive)
If I die press play to bring me back to life
(Only the strong will survive)
Hey yo if I die press play to bring me back to life

(Verse Two)
Riding around in a hoop smoked out behind tent
Serving all day hitting corners getting bent
Time went by quick when we was kicking it
I wish that there was a way I could have predicted this
Somehow thought the shit but I can't blame myself
I just wish that death would have took somebody else
That niggas' shorty looks just like he did
So in a sense I guess my homeboy will live again
In the eyes of his seed forever dad
No one to call on when momma is doing bad
Mad at the world for the pain he feels
I pray to god that his momma shows him what's real

Chorus

(Verse Three)
Every day I thank god for watching over me
If I didn't have rapping I don't know where I would be
Trying to move a key strong armed robbery
My destiny could have been an early death of me
Just to be alive pushing twenty-five
I lived to talk about the shit many didn't survive
All I ask is that we think about the lives passed away
Never to see another sunny day
>From rocks in the hand to keys in the van
No more being broke waiting on the postman
Cost more than the time that you put into it
Now you got the cheese why the fuck you still do it
Greed a need to speed away your precious time
Playa use your mind find yourself another grind
If not for yourself... for the kids sake 
Cause they'll all be where were all at today

Chorus

Man oh man
It's wild what these streets are doing to us 
You know what I'm saying?
I was thinking I was telling my homie
If I were to name all the people that I knew
That was not here with us no more
It would take a whole album 
You know what I'm saying?
So i want to say rest in peace to my homeboy pinkhouse
Rest in peace to my homeboy dice 
Who showed me much love in the short time i knew him
Rest in peace to my homeboy Nino
Much love from the hood we still ride with ya",If I Die,2001

I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.

""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,

There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

Subhumans,"Ever since they put you away
Things haven t been quite the same
They cut off all your lovely hair
And gave you a brand new brain
Sent you to university
Cause that was the next step up
Studying sociology
They gave you a plastic cup

What happened to you with your brand new brain?
What will they do if they get you again?
Animal! Coming to get you!
Animal! Cause you went insane!

Your new brain was working really well
And they were satisfied
They thought they'd done a miracle
But you had something to hide
They left a bit of your old brain
Stuck inside your skull
That bit screwed up your culture
You became an animal

One night you were drinking
In the student bar
Two pints blew your animal mind
Your brain just went too far
The laughter turned to slaughter
You took all you could get
Now you sit alone in a disco
Smoking cigarettes",Animal,
Subhumans,"Out in the garden there is a little white rabbit
Like Revlon torture for your clean little habits
As you wash your hair to keep it clean
You get to wonder why VosenesT green
And forget about the silent animal screams

Out in the garden there is a little white dog
Shampoo in your eyes like a burning fog
But it's tried and tested so you won't go blind
Animals killed for the good of mankind
For your shining hair so many have died

Out in the garden there is a little white cat
And you're catching cancer as you smoke that fag
""When will they find the cure?"" you choke
When enough cats have died of smoke?
And they say that animals go for the throat

And the monkeys in the zoo they look so tame
In the name of science they removed their brains
To think that man evolved from this beast
Civilized savages down from the trees
The animals who run these laboratories",Evolution,
Subhumans,"Here we are in a new age
Wishing we were dead
There's a TV in my front room
And it's screwing up my head
There's a scanner in the toilet
To watch you take a bath
And there's a picture of Hiroshima
To make sure you never laugh

[Chorus:]
And somebody told me
""Big Brother's watching you""
And somebody else said
""You know it's not true""
Who do you believe?
Well the police have all gone crazy
You never had it so bad
They take away the dignity
That you never really had
They know all about you
They even know what you drink
And if they thought you were worth it
They could sus out what you think
And think your crazy

[Chorus]

Well they asked me how to prove it
And there was nothing I could say
I said ""Watch out for Big Brother""
And then they put me away
They said I was paranoid
Because I wrote this song
But they didn't need to read it
Because they knew it all along

[Chorus]",Big Brother,1982
Subhumans,"Silence - is no reaction
""Violence"" - that one-word caption
Can you say it with just one word?
Unspoken - the sins that go unheard

Look though this broken window
From normality into the ghetto
Broken through madness, hate, and boredom

Faceless, empty illusions
Reasons are always pushed aside
Remember the day the country died

Subhumans,"Well they took you from your mother's womb and put you in a school
Told you how to run your life by following the rules
Told you not to pick your nose or disrespect the queen
Scrub your teeth three times a day keep mind and body clean
Save up all your pocket money, nothing is for free
And you'd better trust your parents 'cause there's no one else you see
And then they send you off each day remember what you're told
""You may think you don't need teaching but you'll need it when you're old""

And if you're too intelligent they'll cut you down to size
They'll praise you til you're happy then they'll fill you full of lies
'Cause intelligence is threatening and genius is sin
If you could ever see through them they know they'd never win

So they channel your ability into the right direction
If you're good enough and rich enough you can be a politician
On the other hand if your too thick they'll tell you that you're lazy
They'll put you down and wind you up until it drives you crazy

They'll say you ought to learn a trade to help you in your life
Success is written in three parts: A job, a house, a wife
They'll say that school prepares you for the awesome world outside
Well it certainly gives you bigotry and patriotic pride

Racism, sexism teacher to class
From school to work remains the same, are you white and middle class?

You'll learn that bad men dress in black and good men dress in white
And the pamphlets in the playground say that's right
And that girls were made for housework and boys were made to fight
And the naughty pictures on page 3 make everything alright

And so from school to the outside world these morals you will take
And unless you can reject them you'll have your mind at stake

They'll give you a decision when you get to 18, too
The right to vote for someone else who says he cares for you
But the only thing he cares about is getting to the top
By conning you with empty words that promise you a lot
But the end result is slavery to a false set of ideals
You'll be tempted to believe them 'cause they'll seem so very real
The slavery of attitudes that make you keep in line
Subconsciously devoted to the morals of our time

And when you end up on the dole which you very likely will
They'll offer you a brand new trade: Learning how to kill

Why don't you join the army? Be a man and not a fool
There's someone else to think for you just like there was at school

They'll promise you absolution from the murders you'll commit
In the name of god and country they can get away with it
They fill you full of orders and promise you rewards
Like busting up your family by sending you abroad
A holiday in Germany or Iceland or Hong Kong
Making money being useless well it seems it can't go wrong
But then it's off to Northern Ireland where you'll practice what they preached
You'll shoot to keep yourself alive and kill to keep the peace
And then it won't be so much fun as you hear the wounded crying
'cause before they couldn't speak English and you didn't know what they were saying
But when the children call you ""Bastard"" it will make you think again
When you cannot tell the difference between animals and men

Animals don't wear uniforms but they kill as much as you
But the army kills for money and animals kill for food
It's the basest degradation in the name of what is right
Become something you never were and regret it til you die

'cause your father will tell you ""Sonny, you must do as you are told""
And you'll say the same thing to your kids when you're 32 years old
And unless you can react against the brainwash from the start
Your government will rule your mind and your mind will rule your heart
You'll conform to every social law and be the system's slave
From birth to school to work to death, from the cradle to the grave",From the Cradle to the Grave,1983

Faked deprivation
""Well I got no money""

[Chorus]
Are you depressive? or depressing?
Obsessive? Or obsessed?
Someone or no one?
Are you alive or dead?

Do you take your ideas
From other people?
Surrounded by boredom
You get boring

And then you start to enjoy it

Subhumans,"We live we die
And in between we sit and wonder why
Why must we someday die?
Tried and tested
We live our lives like our dear parents did
Tied down and restricted
Of gods and guns do we need to die
For Christ's sake or for anyone?
They call it religion
And so we pray
For god to save us from our evil ways
They call it self-decay
We live we die
In fear of gods and guns and never knowing why
Why must we someday die?
So live your life
In fear of no one
We must have our say
Before we fade away",Fade Away,1985
Sublime,"Down in Mississippi where the sun beats down from the sky
They give it up and they give it up and they give it up

He rolled away one day and he never came home

You only see what you want to believe
When you light up in the back with those tricks up your sleeve
That don't mean I can't hang

I'm a backward-ass hillbilly
I'm Dick Butkiss

I get mean, I'm a thief in the dark
I'm a ragin' machine
I'm a triple rectified ass son of a bitch
Rec-tite on my ass and it makes me itch
I can see for miles and miles and miles
My broken heart makes me smile

In my mind, in my brain
I go back and go completely insane

Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot

Well, life is too short, so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start static I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity

Love is what I got
Within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deserve

People listen up don't stand to near
I've got something that you all should hear
All lies, all the lies she told to me
Make a little part of history
I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love, get married and forget the world
Nine months later, the sweet baby's on the way
Kiss 'em on the cheek and life's okay
I don't feel, no pain. I don't have, no time
To listen to conflicting points of view
Oh it's a crazy world to live alone
A ball and chain I call my own

People listen up don't stand to close
I've got something that you all should know
Holy matrimony is not for me
Rather die alone in misery
I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love, get married and forget the world
Nine months later, the sweet baby's on the way
Isn't that what they used to say?
With a girl that you knew,
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain
I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own

Crazy world to live alone

With a girl 
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain
Oh, I step into the great unknown
With a ball and chain I call my own

Because marriage doesn't work in the world today
It's an institution that is in decay
And if I have love I wish to portray
I will surely find another way

Because I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love, get married and forget the world
Nine months later the sweet baby's on the way
Kiss 'em on the cheek and life's okay

Sublime,"Let me tell you about a girl I know
Had a drink about a hour ago
Sitting in a corner by herself, in a bar in downtown hell

She heard a noise and she looked through the door
And saw a man she'd never seen before
Light skin, light blue eyes, a double-chin and a plastic smile
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
""My brand new car is parked right outside
How'd ya like to go for a ride?""
And she said ""Wait a minute I have to think""
He said, ""That's fine. May I please buy you a drink""
One drink turned into three or four and they left and got into his car
And they drove away someplace real far

Now babe the time has come
How'd ya like to have a little fun?
And she said ""if we could only please be on our way, I will not run""

That's when things got out of control
She didn't want to, he had his way
She said, ""let's go""
He said, ""no way!""
Come on babe it's your lucky day
Shut your mouth, we're gonna do it my way
Come on baby don't be afraid
If it wasn't for date rape I'd never get laid

He finished up and he started the car
He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said ""now baby don't be sad, in my opinion you weren't half-bad""
She picked up a rock, threw it at the car, hit him in the head, now he's got a big scar
Come on party people won't you listen to me
Date rape stylee

The next day she went to her drawer, look up her local attorney at law
Went to the phone and filed the police report and then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge he screamed, ""she lies that little slut!""
The judge knew that he was full of shit and he gave him twenty five years
And now his eyes are filled wit tears
One night in jail it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries

That's when things got out of control
The moral of the date rape story, it does not pay to be drunk and horny
But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind

And I'm sorry when I say that straight to this very day

She took a hike it don't matter if I like it or not

Sublime,"Let me tell you about a girl I know
Had a drink about a hour ago
Sitting in a corner by herself, in a bar in downtown hell

She heard a noise and she looked through the door
And saw a man she'd never seen before
Light skin, light blue eyes, a double-chin and a plastic smile
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
""My brand new car is parked right outside
How'd ya like to go for a ride?""
And she said ""Wait a minute I have to think""
He said, ""That's fine. May I please buy you a drink""
One drink turned into three or four and they left and got into his car
And they drove away someplace real far

Now babe the time has come
How'd ya like to have a little fun?
And she said ""if we could only please be on our way, I will not run""

That's when things got out of control
She didn't want to, he had his way
She said, ""let's go""
He said, ""no way!""
Come on babe it's your lucky day
Shut your mouth, we're gonna do it my way
Come on baby don't be afraid
If it wasn't for date rape I'd never get laid

He finished up and he started the car
He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said ""now baby don't be sad, in my opinion you weren't half-bad""
She picked up a rock, threw it at the car, hit him in the head, now he's got a big scar
Come on party people won't you listen to me
Date rape stylee

The next day she went to her drawer, look up her local attorney at law
Went to the phone and filed the police report and then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge he screamed, ""she lies that little slut!""
The judge knew that he was full of shit and he gave him twenty five years
And now his eyes are filled wit tears
One night in jail it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries

That's when things got out of control
The moral of the date rape story, it does not pay to be drunk and horny
But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind

There was a riot on the streets
Tell me where were you?
You were sittin' home watchin' your TV
While I was participating in some anarchy

First spot we hit it was my liquor store
I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford
With red lights flashin' time to retire
And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire

Next stop we hit it was the music shop

'Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here
It's getting harder and harder and harder each and every year
I go in the store where their mother and kids 
And I saw her when she came out she was gettin' some pampers
They said it was for the black man
They said it was for the mexican, but not for the white man
But if you look at the streets, it wasn't about Rodney King
It's bout this fucked up situation and these fucked up police
It's about coming up and staying on top

In a tight mini short in a short mini skirt, 
it feels so wrong and it feels so right. 
the more I think about it you're a pain in the ass, 
I told you many times, this time it's gonna last. 
Want the kind of woman who can make me feel right, 
not sloppy drunk sex on a Saturday night. 'cause, 

I am a Romeo, am a Romeo with no place to go 

Pull up your honey if you gotta one see, 
because your down with the style, 'cause your down with me. oh, 
rig the selector when your on the mixer, 
along with Peter Mitchell upon the echo chamber. Two, one, 
no they must see but no, they can't test me. 
Two, three of them come and say you can't test me. 
Because me rock the reggae music in a different stylee. 
Me rock the kinda reggae music right on time, because your down with the 
band that they call Sublime, right? 

Don't take it too slow, don't take me wrong,

Take away your privacy and take your guitar
Then take your woman and impound your car

My beginning of wisdom I won't take you too far

Your money don't concern you that's a natural fact

Shut up your mouth before you get knocked down
We're gonna listen to your voice upon the speaker box
First you get a manager but what does he do
I'll be the first to tell you baby that I don't have a clue

We're gunna make a phony image for the MTV
Hear it on the radio say damn that's me
Whenever I get over on a 3 piece hog
Jesus and her mom are gonna break your arm

Put your ass in the john to be a superstar

Before your eyes this shit just come back to me
Oh my God I take a rest on the side

Had a drink about a hour ago
Sitting in a corner by herself, in a bar in downtown hell

She heard a noise and she looked through the door
And saw a man she'd never seen before
Light skin, light blue eyes, a double-chin and a plastic smile
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
""My brand new car is parked right outside 
How'd ya like to go for a ride?""
And she said.""Wait a minute I have to think.""
He said, ""That's fine. May I please buy you a drink""
One drink turned into three or four and they left and got into his car
And they drove away someplace real far

Now babe the time has come
How'd ya like to have a little fun?
And she said ""If we could only please be on our way, I will not run.""

That's when things got out of control
She didn't want to, he had his way
She said, ""Let's go""
He said, ""No way!""
Come on babe it's your lucky day
Shut your mouth, were gonna do it my way
Come on baby don't be afraid
If it wasn't for date rape I'd never get laid

He finished up and he started the car
He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said ""Now baby don't be sad, in my opinion you weren't half-bad.""

Come on party people won't you listen to me

The next day she went to her drawer, look up her local attorney at law,
Went to the phone and filed the police report and then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge he screamed, ""She lies that little slut!""
The judge knew that he was full of shit and he gave him twenty five years
And now his eyes are full of tears
One night in jail it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries

That's when things got out of control
The moral of the date rape story, it does not pay to be drunk and horny.
But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind

Tell me where were you?
You were sittin' home watchin' your TV
While I was participating in some anarchy

First spot we hit it was my liquor store
I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford
With red lights flashin' time to retire
And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire.

It's getting harder and harder and harder each and every year
Some kids went in a store with their mother
I saw her when she came out she was gettin some pampers
They said it was for the black man,
They said it was for the mexican
And not for the white man
But if you look at the streets
It wasn't about Rodney King
It's bout this fucked up situation and these fucked up police
It's about coming up

Had a drink about a hour ago
Sitting in a corner by herself, in a bar in downtown hell

She heard a noise and she looked through the door
And saw a man she'd never seen before
Light skin, light blue eyes, a double-chin and a plastic smile
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
""My brand new car is parked right outside 
How'd ya like to go for a ride?""
And she said.""Wait a minute I have to think.""
He said, ""That's fine. May I please buy you a drink""
One drink turned into three or four and they left and got into his car
And they drove away someplace real far

Now babe the time has come
How'd ya like to have a little fun?
And she said ""If we could only please be on our way, I will not run.""

That's when things got out of control
She didn't want to, he had his way
She said, ""Let's go""
He said, ""No way!""

Shut your mouth, were gonna do it my way
Come on baby don't be afraid
If it wasn't for date rape I'd never get laid

He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said ""Now baby don't be sad, in my opinion you weren't half-bad.""

Come on party people won't you listen to me
Date rape stylee

The next day she went to her drawer, look up her local attorney at law,
Went to the phone and filed the police report and then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge he screamed, ""She lies that little slut!""
The judge knew that he was full of shit and he gave him twenty five years
And now his eyes are full of tears
One night in jail it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries

That's when things got out of control
The moral of the date rape story, it does not pay to be drunk and horny.
But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind

Had a drink about a hour ago
Sitting in a corner by herself, in a bar in downtown hell

She heard a noise and she looked through the door
And saw a man she'd never seen before
Light skin, light blue eyes, a double-chin and a plastic smile
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
""My brand new car is parked right outside
How'd ya like to go for a ride?""
And she said ""Wait a minute I have to think""
He said, ""That's fine. May I please buy you a drink""
One drink turned into three or four and they left and got into his car
And they drove away someplace real far

Now babe the time has come
How'd ya like to have a little fun?
And she said ""if we could only please be on our way, I will not run""

That's when things got out of control
She didn't want to, he had his way
She said, ""let's go""
He said, ""no way!""
Come on babe it's your lucky day
Shut your mouth, we're gonna do it my way
Come on baby don't be afraid
If it wasn't for date rape I'd never get laid

He finished up and he started the car
He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said ""now baby don't be sad, in my opinion you weren't half-bad""

Come on party people won't you listen to me

The next day she went to her drawer, look up her local attorney at law
Went to the phone and filed the police report and then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge he screamed, ""she lies that little slut!""
The judge knew that he was full of shit and he gave him twenty five years
And now his eyes are filled wit tears
One night in jail it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries

That's when things got out of control

Sublime with Rome,"Well this is how it starts, Two lovers in the dark
On the run, from the one That they called Sheriff Spark
Six guns by their side and bullets around their waist
Two shots to the sky
Signal sound for the chase
The safe was nearly empty and They were nearly free
But were seen by the Good eye of the mean Billy Green
And he screamed at the top of his lungs They're on the run
It's the two outsiders Grab your horses and your guns

I said I wish that
We could stay here,
But I fear our time has come
We could ride out in the darkness
Chasing the rising sun
We gotta pack our bags this instant,
We're heading south-bound to the next town
And if we all arrive there so safely,
Baby you can

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Well it's the story of the two
Always on the move
They got nothing left to lose
'Cept their guns and their wounds
Now they're crossing borders
Sheriffs posse on their tail
They'd rather die together
Than be stuck up in a cell
They drank up all the whiskey and They partied every night
Like it could be the last The bounty said shoot on sight
So they chased the endless summer Though it came with the pride
They wouldn't stop running till They found a paradise
But the sheriff finally found them with his eyes seeing red
So the lovers had to shoot him down and fill him full of lead
They were finally free To find a place to lay their head
And when they finally did he looked at her and then he said

I said I think that we can stay here,
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean,
And sit with the rising sun
So unpack your bags this instant,
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely,
Baby you can

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Well you're my green-eyed girl And I've been running around with you
It's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do
So wipe the dirt off, or Take your shirt off,
And we should go hit the cantina, We got work off
I said it's hot outside Let me go swimming in your eyes
We've been running for a while
Why don't you lay down and make smile
I could never ask for nothing better than this
It's just tequila and the beach, that's why its salty when we kiss

I said I think that we can stay here,
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean,
And sit with the rising sun
So unpack your bags this instant,
No more running from town to town

Electricity flows with the very first kiss 
Like a break in the clouds and the first ray of sun

And it's taking control of my body and mind 
It begins when I heard I love you 
For the very first time 
 
This life this love oh what sweetness I feel 
So mysterious yet so incredible real 
 
It's an uncharted sea it's an unopend door 
But ya got to reach and ya gotta explore 
 
Even thought you're not sure 
Till the moment arrives 
The he is and you know 
You're in love 
For the very first time 
 
And baby when I met you 
Every feeling I had was new 
I don't think there are words to 
Describe the sensations, oh no no no

Only then do you know you're in love

Submarine Funk,"Go down this dirt road about a half a mile
You'll find an old brick church still sitting there
With it's hold oak so burdened with Spanish moss 
That its very limbs seem to bow in prayer

And there's Jesus in the air 
Pass the cemetery where all the young people go
'Cause there is no where else that they can drink
Where the law won't bother them and no one will know

'Cause sometimes a young woman just needs to think
Talk to the old black man who will make the observation
That we're still grouped into the haves and have-nots
Yeah, it's been a long time since integration but it seems some folks here, they forgot. 

It's every virtue and every vice
It's a big fat Americana slice
But there's space down here in this little town
And I can spread my arms and spin round and round

Well you don't have to be Baptist to escape hell's flames
But it wouldn't hurt to have one as a friend you know
We all go to bed early, don't take the Lord's name in vain
But if it's good beer and food you better believe we go

If you're in the mood for a scare tonight
There's a topless bar just up the interstate
Otherwise I'll see you in bowling shoes 
Or in 3-D glasses, or on roller skates
