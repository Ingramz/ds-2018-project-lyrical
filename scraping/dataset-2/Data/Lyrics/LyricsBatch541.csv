Ken-Y,"Como hipnotizados por esta costumbre 
Hemos decidido vivir la rutina 
De seguir durmiendo 
En la misma cama 
Pero la verdad es que tenemos miedo 
Y sin darnos cuenta estamos compitiendo 
Para ver quien dice 
La ultima palabra 

Y no queremos ser sinceros,
Y aceptar que ya no queda nada 
Que ya no existe la ilusión de despertar 
Juntos cada mañana 
Y que los días se nos van 
En no mirarnos a la cara 
Para poder disimular 
Como si nada nos pasara 
Pero no es verdad!

Que se apago la llama!
El fuego que quemaba 
Ya se acabo la magia que nos envolvía 
Nuestro amor se termino 
Así como si nada 
Y tanto que te amaba 
Ya se apago la llama 
Ya no hay ni cenizas 
Nuestro fuego se extinguió 
Y todo se acabo!

Te quiero decir 
Que no quiero vivir 
De esta mentira 
Y que yo merezco 
Un amor de verdad 

Rakim!
Baby deja a un lado la agonía
Y el incomodo silencio cada día 
Si esto no es culpa tuya 
Ni tampoco mía 
De que serviría intentarlo 
No funcionaria!!
Si aunque estemos juntos 
Tu y yo no nos hacemos compañía 
Dime desde cuando no nos damos navidad?
Enamorada, ilusionada, apasionada 
Si hasta por la noche 
Cada quien duerme en su lado de la cama 
Que triste  se nos apago la llama!

Que se apago la llama!
El fuego que quemaba
Ya se acabo la magia que nos envolvía
Nuestro amor se termino 
Así como si nada
Y tanto que te amaba
Ya se apago la llama
Ya no hay ni cenizas
Nuestro fuego se extinguió
Y todo se acabo!",Se Apago La Llama,2010

Tengo la formula perfecta 
La música que te alimenta

Suena dembow Ratatata, siente mi voz

Suena dembow Ratatata, siente mi voz 
Como yo no hay dos  

De la Ghetto 
Yo sueno el dembow pa que reviente la bocina 
Para to’ las discotecas y lo party e’ marquesina 
La mujere’ se sueltan como si le hechara una yombina 
La formula perfecta con la que ella se motiva 
Pero con este dembow tu sabe no fuimo po’ encima 
El bajo solito duro pa que se ponga agresiva 
La agarro por la cintura y la subo para arriba 
Y pa cuando ella baje ella sienta el encaje 
La pongo a dar vuelta como machina de feria 
Con el juguetito pa que ella se entretenga 
Haze paltelo, Haze revientalo 
Haze paltelo, Haze revientalo 
Ella ta bucando que le den mucho sex 
Mucho placer, satisfacer 
Dale en la cama duro duro como eh 
Oh, no bebe, Okay 

Suena dembow Ratatata, siente mi voz 
Como yo no hay dos 
Suena dembow Ratatata, siente mi voz 
Como yo no hay dos 
 
Como yo no hay dos 
Eso es seguro 
Te lo juro que este flow es sin corte muy puro 
Esta noche tu no sabes lo que te espera 
Ya que lo pago yo, invita mi billetera 
Tranquila mami no te me desesperes 
Que por la noche tu y yo andamos con otras mujeres 
Yepp, se ensendio la demonia 
Sera por la feromonas o el olor de mi colonia 
Mi fashionista le encanta lo Guicci 
Todo original y si no Versace 
Y brilla sola con su resplandor 
Y no se pone nada si no es de diseñador 
Y disfrutando de Cristian Cors 
Tiene la colección completa de michael kors 
Así que no te confunda 
Que pa ganarla tiene que tener la funda 
Y yo tu no y me quedo atrás 
Mucho gusto Arcangel

Ken-Y,"Hoy vienes a pedirme perdón 
Que no quisiste irte así 
Que aunque ya es tarde 
Quisieras explicarme 
Que el miedo te ataco 
Y preferiste huir 

Yo nunca supe que te paso 
Pasaron muchos días 
Sin una explicación 
Las noches eran siglos 
La soledad me hizo 
Ahogarme en dolor 
Y algo en mi cambio 

Y hoy te digo que no vuelvo 
Yo tuve que empezar de nuevo 
Me tuve que olvidar de ti 
Tuve que levantarme 
Del suelo en donde me caí 
Y aprendí que yo solito puedo 
Que no necesite de ti 
Pude ser feliz de nuevo 
Y hoy no se que haces aquí 
Yo no se cuanto llore 
En mi cama sin poderme dormir 
Esperando a ver si regresabas 
Yo no se cuanto te ame 
En cambio se que nunca 
Nunca olvidare, como te marchaste 
Sin decirme nada

Hoy vienes a pedirme perdón 
Después que te marchaste así 
Dices que yo tenia la razón 
Cuando te dije, que nadie te amaría 
Como te amaba yo 

Pregunto si te ah ido mejor 
Que si encontraste un nuevo amor 
Me dices que lo sientes 
Dices que te arrepientes 
Que la melancolía 
Te acorrala y te alarga los días 

Y hoy te digo que no vuelvo 
Yo tuve que empezar de nuevo 
Me tuve que olvidar de ti 
Tuve que levantarme

En cambio se que nunca 
Nunca olvidare, como te marchaste 
Sin decirme nada(sin decirme nada)

Yo no puedo recordar 
Lo mucho que yo te ame 
Solo se que entregue todo 
Y yo mismo me lastime

Kenan Thompson,"Oh! Its been a long time coming.
Two of the worlds greatest.
Americas sweetheart, Ms. Reba McEntire. (Yeah, yeah. How ya doing Andy?)
Were about to take it to the top. (Hoo hoo hoo hoo.)
Hit em Reba.

Haters in my face trying to keep me down
But you know we keep on shinin. (Here we go!)
Two crazy big stars from opposite worlds
Bout to set this track on fire. (Yeah!)

Shes the queen of country
Hes the comedy prince
Making something out of nothing. (Ha ha!)
We hooked up in the studio to make this song.
But as usual we ended up fucking. (No doubt.)

Flash back to when I first met Reba
Sitcom dressing room, puffing on Cheeba
Said I was a fan, she said prove it
Dropped her denim skirt and said, hop to it.

Made love all night. (More like we fucked.)
Kids banging on the door trying to interrupt
But them autographs can wait, cuz this is way too strong
I cant leave it alone, because her pussy's the bomb.

Well my pussy is the bomb and that's a fact
But these N words keep on trippin'(OK)
So I stay on my prime and drop these hits
Cuz I cant go back to stripping (I'm Reba!)

You're my undercover freak
And your my best friend, but our families don't approve.
That's right, cuz I'm a city boy
And I'm a country girl, and I'll never leave your sweet balls blue.

That's because a girl like Reba got just what I need
With big broad shoulders and a red ass weave (And a penis.)
Hot damn, she fly.
All she wanna do is bump me
I'm a lucky guy (I'm a guy too)

My friends think I should dump her
They say shes a man who found a wig in a dumpster. (Your friends are smart.)

Nah, Rebes, they're just jealous
Cuz I'm dating a star instead of hanging with the fellas. (Hanging like my nuts.)

Word up. They're just liars.
They cant believe I can pull Reba McEntire.

Ever since I came out of my mamas butt
I knew I was destined for greatness. (Yeah!)
I looked in a dumpster and saw a wig
And thought, hey brother, I'm gonna take this. (Tell em, Reba!)

So I put it right on and took a stroll
Right over to 30 Rock (SNL!)
I saw Andy Sandberg and he thought I was Reba
And I made him suck my dirty cock.

So there you have it
Two worlds collide
Were the new Bonnie and Clyde (Reba.)
From haystacks to maybachs our love will survive
For Reba Ill ride til the day that we die.",Reba (Two Worlds Collide),2011

All that noise from my Maseratti
All that noise turnin' up the party
All that noise young nigga with a whole bunch of rubbers
All that noise young nigga gon' catch a problem
When a nigga say no, nigga come and jumpin out the Porsche
With a bag full of 50 same court
Nigga still I try to fight a gun charge
Try to fight a brick charge
Lawyer ain't show up in court
When a nigga say trial, nigga comin' down with life
That’s how a nigga really earn his stripes
When them niggas say
You’ll fuck with me like I fuck with him
He ain’t finna do something right
That nigga finna snitch
I knew that nigga was a bitch
Man I don’t owe that nigga one shit
Ain’t got no heart, man I knew that nigga wasn’t rich
Should've killed him when he went up that lift

Shawty you ain’t got to be so defenseful
Niggas say you bad
That’s a compliment, not literally
Half naked pictures, but you lookin' for a gentleman
Instagram your whole life after the pull of trying to get your followers up
Sold your soul to the internet
Damn, damn right it's a cold world
Losing sleep, I'm a little girl
Them are right and we gonna like the right
Damn sure, ho be do me like oh girl
True when a nigga say it like you
Niggas sayin what he gon' do?
Tell a nigga he a lie, tell him that a real bad bitch get his own so that money can’t buy
When a nigga say he ballin and someone’s title in the desert
Not worth closing, it’s teasin
Ask him if he ring
Tell him that your daddy was a real baller
He was blowin' money by the seasons
Let him know you good, left a couple mil and a whip for you
Big burner rays right that’ll kill for you

But here I am sweeping, pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never, ever play, to crowds
But I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now

Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow

How's life in your comfort zone?
Out here on sacred ground I'm doing swell

But if you've got the guts to join me leave your sandals at the door

Gonna see him once again

Who'd have guessed this horrid fate?

Have to be perfect by Thursday
Perfect by Thursday

I rarely get to see him
And his name is all I know
He smiles like a king
And that's all he'd dare to show
I'm faithfully attending
My motive almost pure
Reckless in my thinking
But it's his that I'm not sure

Perfect by Thursday
I'm planning the evening
I know what I'm wearing
And what I'll be singing

And it's not looking very good
I haven't seen much progress
To perfection like I should
But now I cannot quit
Because today could be the day
That all the effort
All the work decides to finally pay

And then you will fall in love
I smile when you walk by
I laugh even louder
You don't even bother

I hold every memory
As sweet as a lemon
As loose as a fire

He's catching for some man
Moved away and left me here

I fear that I am correct

Hey, Alice are you completely

Satisfied with Wonderland

And all it's wonder?

Cause if you're not, you know I

Heard that they're handing out a

money-back guarantee at the door.


Going blind to the pain,

Going deaf to the sight,

Going down to the cry,

Of the innocent life.


I read the paper,

And I drank all the juice

In my refrigerator, now I'm

Starved for knowledge,

Thirsty for the truth.

And in the pages I could

Sense all the longing in the world

I close my eyes, cause I'm longing too.


Going blind to the pain,

Going deaf to the sight,

Going down to the cry,

Of the innocent life.


Who knows your name,

anymore, anymore?

I'll say your name,

forever more, forever more.


Blind to the pain,

Going deaf to the sight,

Going down to the cry,

Of the innocent life,

Of the innocent life.

Kendall Payne,"The moon's worn thin 
Succumbed to the pressure
Her silver dress 
Hangs in the sky like a rag

Her coat her cloak
Her cover of darkness
It fails to hide 
The tears that she's cried
Oh she cries

But she still shines
Though the night falls around her 
And by her light
I find my way
When I fear the path laid before me
I look to the light of her face
And thank her for being so brave

The moon remains
In fullness or frailty
A faithful climb
And I stand amazed at the way",The Moon,2004
Kendall Payne,"I am not a perfect girl, nor are you a perfect man
But we have found each other here
Inside this wild and crazy world
And somehow make a perfect match

You bring out the worst in me
But it’s the side I need to see
And through the conflicts and the difference
And damage done
We are strong and still are one

You will fail me, you will fail me
Again and again and again
And I will fail you, I will fail you
Again and again and again
Again and again and again

But we will learn to love in spite of failure
Yes we will learn to love because of failure
And we will stay together

We are broken human fools
We are selfish, we are cruel
But there is hope for the exception
To someday become the rule
Let it start with me, let it start with you

",Fail,2007

Kendall Schmidt,"I've been watching the phases of the moon
From my window pane
I've been talking to to corners of the room
For too long, too long

Meet you when my heart was somewhere else
Outside in the rain
Saw you smiling, the stories you could tell
Have you moved on, moved on?

It's so hard to get a cab in midnight on Friday
Where you going?
Downtown
So am I
Sit right here where it's dry
And if said you're going my way
Well maybe we should share a ride

I could feel my heartbeat
Electric to my fingertips
Oh woah oh
I could feel anticipation
Through my veins
Oh woah oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips
'Cause anything could happen on a night like this
On a night like this

Wouldn't mind if we caught every red light
You're someone I can get close to
You're a stranger but there's something in your eyes
Like you know me
Could I know you?
Well I never fell in love at midnight on Friday
Standing outside
Of town
In the rain
Well this night is almost over
But if I had it my way
We would just stay up all night

I could feel my heartbeat
Electric to my fingertips
Oh woah oh
I could feel anticipation
Through my veins
Oh woah oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips
'Cause anything could happen on a night like this
On a night like this

Our hands fit just the right way
Our legs tangled up in this small space
The world outside feels far away
As I get to know you

I could feel my heartbeat
Electric to my fingertips
Oh woah oh
I could feel anticipation
Through my veins
Oh woah oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips
'Cause anything could happen on a night like this

Être plus heureux qu'hier
Cette main tendue quand je tombe
Les cœurs ne s'ouvrent qu'en hiver,
N'attend pas l'été pour te paumer
Y a des jours comme ça où tout va de travers

Un sourire, un soleil quand tout s'assombrit
Abîmé, harcelé

J'irai là-bas, là-bas, au sommet

C'était un phénomène, elle n'était pas humaine
Le genre de femme qui change le plus grand délinquant en gentleman
Une beauté sans pareille, tout le monde veut s'en emparer
Sans savoir qu'elle les mène en bateau
Hypnotisés, on pouvait tout donner
Elle n'avait qu'à demander puis aussitôt on démarrait
On cherchait à l'impressionner, à devenir son préféré
Sans savoir qu'elle les mène en bateau

J'aimerais devenir la chaise sur laquelle elle s'assoit
Ou moins que ça, un moins que rien

Mais les hommes ne pouvaient que l'aimer

Synonyme de magnifique, à ses pieds, que des disciples
Qui devenaient vite indécis, tremblants comme les feuilles
Elle te caressait sans même te toucher

J'ai passé des heures à chanter tard dans la nuit
Pour m'amuser un peu ou pour tuer l'ennui
Pour le fun, pour draguer les copines
Pas pour passer dans les magazines
Je bossais pas pour pouvoir toucher le cœur des gens
Mais le destin en a décidé autrement
Je suis là devant vous sur la scène
A vous donner mon amour et ma peine

Y a eu les plateaux, y a eu les photos
Y a eu les télés, et les bilans chaînés
Quand ça s'arrêtera, je ne sais pas
J'ai même chanté la sérénade à Eva Longoria

Tout a changé, je suis passé
De l'ombre à la lumière

Et je roule, roule, roule

J'ai passé des nuits à jouer sur ma guitare
J'ai rêvé de concerts, jamais de la gloire
Pour kiffer, passer des soirées folles,
Pas pour devenir une star ou une idole,
La chance a décidé de s'venger sur ma vie
Depuis je passe mon temps à jouer de ma voix
J'pensais pas un jour être à la une
J'me sens prêt à décrocher la Lune

Y a eu les tournées, les gens par milliers
Les vues par millions, par la télévision
Si par le destin, tout finit demain,
Je ne sais pas où j'irai mais je sais d'où je viens

Tout a changé, je suis passé

Et la familia à la table

Venez chez moi, je vous convie
Dans ma piscine au bord de l'eau

La vie n'est pas un fleuve tranquille
On ne choisit pas sa naissance
Qu'on soit d'ici ou bien d'une île
Le vrai problème, c'est l'ignorance
J'ai voyagé dans mille villages
Des visages collés è mille fenêtres
Je n'ai gagné que le courage et le plaisir de vous connaître

C'est dans la bonne humeur que nous nous reverrons
C'est la main sur le cœur que nous vous accueillerons
Nous parlerons de tout, de nos souvenirs
Si vous avez besoin, vous savez chez qui venir

Au ralentis je t'ai vue t'avancer
Devant ta beauté j'reste planté

Car tu ne veux pas d'une menteuse (allez)

Et je sais, et je sais, et je sais
Qu'elle te donne tout
Mais chéri, je ne pouvais pas te le donner

Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
Sans toi, plus rien ne brille
Plus aucun rêve ne me tiens debout

Alors une dernière fois
Je dois être celle qui te ramène à la maison
Une fois de plus
Je te promets qu'après ça, je te laisserai partir
Bébé, je m'en fiche si c'est elle que tu portes dans ton cœur
Tout ce qui me préoccupe c'est que tu te réveilles dans mes bras
Une dernière fois
Je dois être celle qui te ramène à la maison

Si de ta peau tu me prives

Kendji Girac,"On a pas tous eu la même chance
La même vie ni les mêmes souffrances
Je suis pas là pour juger ta peine
Mais je voudrais qu'on se comprenne

Pour voir derrière les apparences
Derrière les sourires et les silences
Je voudrais que tu te souviennes
Ma vie aurait pu être la tienne

Souvent j'ai eu peur de m'exprimer
Juger avant même d'avoir parlé
Et si on savait se regarder on saurait

Mon frère je sais qu'on est tous les mêmes
Avec nos rêves, avec nos problèmes
Et si tu regardes à l'intérieur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs

Des mots d'amour et des simples gestes
Quand tu perds tout c'est ce qu'il te reste
Toutes ces richesses qui nous viennent du cœur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs

On n'a pas connu les mêmes ambiances
Chacun ses rires, chacun son enfance
Il y a mille choses qui nous séparent
Mais on caresse la même histoire

Devant la douleur on se ressemble
On a tous eu le cœur qui tremble
Derrière tes peurs regarde bien
Je pourrais être l'un des tiens

Souvent j'ai eu peur de m'exprimer
Jugé avant même d'avoir parlé
Si on apprenait à s'écouter on saurait

Mon frère je sais qu'on est tous les mêmes
Avec nos rêves, avec nos problèmes
Et si tu regardes à l'intérieur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs

Des mots d'amour et des simples gestes
Quand tu perds tout c'est ce qu'il te reste
Toutes ces richesses qui nous viennent du cœur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs

Et quelques fois je dois l'avouer
La différence est lourde à porter
A l'heure où les peines reviennent,
Reviennent, reviennent, reviennent, reviennent

Même si le monde n'est que beauté
Par la colère on se laisse emporter
On oublie qu'on est tous les mêmes

Mon frère je sais qu'on est tous les mêmes
Avec nos rêves, avec nos problèmes
Et si tu regardes à l'intérieur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs

Des mots d'amour et des simples gestes
Quand tu perds tout c'est ce qu'il te reste
Toutes ces richesses qui nous viennent du cœur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs",Les Richesses du Coeur,2014

J’te fais pas la morale mon frère mais
Tu passes tes journées à t’enfermer
Le monde continue de tourner, tourner
Et tu veux pas bouger
J’te fais pas la morale mon frère mais
Par la vie j’te sens pas concerné
Tous les démons en toi t’ont cerné
Et tu veux pas bouger

Tu parlais d’avenir, de projets
Si tu veux réussir, te poser
Va falloir arrêter tes excès
Prends le temps de grandir, d’avancer
Tu dors dans la journée, vit la nuit
Tu traînes dans les quartiers, tu t’oublies
Tu t’fais baratiner par des amis
Soi-disant amis qui t’laissent à l’agonie

T’as laissé filer ta chance tellement d’fois
Repoussé les gens qui t’aiment si loin d’toi
T’a laissé passer tes rêves, dis-moi pourquoi
Pourquoi? Pourquoi?

A le cœur qui devient opaque
Ô drame, otage de la culture du meilleur

La nature nous maudit
Des missiles, des soldats, des débris
Le climat s’échauffe comme les esprits

Et on détruit même nos forêts
On s’est perdus très loin des choses simples
Plus rien n’soulage
La mer est polluée par nos forages
Le matériel nous commande
On n’a pourtant besoin que de choses simples
De cyclones et de tonnerre
Quand la nature est en colère
On a détruit nos forêts
On ne sait même plus qui on est

Comme un soleil dans l’existence

Quand je ris, elle rit aux éclats
Mes chansons sont souvent pour elle
Elle sera toujours ma merveille
Quand je n’suis pas à la hauteur
Elle m’élève plus haut que le ciel
Elle est la splendeur des splendeurs
Elle est la sève, elle est le miel
C’est son sang qui coule dans mes veines
Et des souvenirs par centaines
Bercent mon cœur de mille étoiles
Elle est ma quête, elle est mon Graal

Mais pas la douceur de ses gestes

Elle me porte encore chaque seconde
Elle m’emportera avec elle
Je lui serai toujours fidèle

Quand je me blesse elle est douceur
Comme une caresse dans l’existence
Quand j’abandonne elle devient lionne
Et me relève avec patience

Kendji Girac,"Catalan, Gitane y a la jolie, jolie
J'te comprends pas, j'suis pas d'la francophonie
La fleur de l'âge a fini par faner
J'suis souvent seul, dis-moi ou sont mes amis
À l'hôtel le soir, fatigué de la tournée
Je signe des feuilles, et que sueurs font que couler
La fleur refuse, si je tire dans la foule
Souvent tiraillé, je pense que vous me voulez
J'fous tout en l'air, heureusement y a la meute
Qu'es'j'ai dit moi, qu'est-ce qui va pas
Pourquoi tu m'chies pas sur Insta
Le monde à l'envers mais j'suis à l'endroit
Le solitaire, je ne vois qu'devant moi 
C'est pas ma vraie vie, les photos qu'je publie
Aime-moi comme je suis, mi corazón
J'suis dans ma folie, j'suis dans ma solitude
Pleine lune, mon chant résonne

Au chant des sirènes j'ai pas succombé
Si on s'approche, je serai déjà parti
À l'hôtel le soir, le deuxième de la journée
Je dors d'un œil, des images pour me saouler 
J'crie comme un cave, ah, l'vois-tu, re-prête à rouler
Souvent tiraillé, je pense que vous m'en voulez
J'fous tout en l'air, heureusement y a la meute
Je les ramène à la raison, ils me ramènent à la maison
Des fois solidaire, un instinct fait sa loi
Loup solitaire, je crois pas tout c'que je vois

On a perdu des gens, c'est vrai
Mais le temps d'une nuit, ton mal aurait le mien
Et pour tes confessions, tu sais
Elles resteront sur le sable fin

Y a des mélodies qui résonnent
Autant de prières qu'on fredonne
Un peu de chaleur qu'on se donne

Temps de s’apprendre, apparence pour réalité 
Pourtant j’y croyais tellement

Les aléas d’la vie 
Décrocher les étoiles mais la lune me l’interdit 
Elle sait qu’j’le prendrais mal si j’revenais à la vie 
Pourtant j’y croyais tellement

Tu m’aimes pour tout ce que je n’ai pas, j’laisse tomber

Papada, papada 

Rire instant chaleureux, ivre de joie sous tant d’peine 
Je chanterai à qui le veut 
Du coup je t’aime à la bohème 
Vivre de ça pour un temps, pourquoi rester content 
S’aime sans vraiment s’aimer 
Les bons, les mauvaises années 
Les aléas d’la vie 
Des bouquets de fleurs fanées 
Des relations, n’a pas prix

Dis-moi à qui la faute, qui devra tout pardonner

Pa virarme los ojos como el exorcista

Y aunque no me acuerde cuándo y dónde
Fue que el mundo se aprendió mi nombre y es que

Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú, justo antes de que yo tocara fondo
Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío
Y cuando todo mi mundo se ahogaba en lo hondo
Llegaste tú justo antes de que yo tocara fondo, ooh
Tocara fondo, ooh

Siempre hay un amor, que sin ser el primero
Te hace olvidar todo lo que no es
Ese es el amor verdadero

Esta es una historia sin final, un cuento sin terminar
Y al caminar, al fin entiendo con quien debo estar
Siempre solía aparentar entre mis lujos y la fama
Pero la soledad, me acompañaba aquí en mi cama
Eres mi guía, desde que llegaste todos mis días, se arreglaron
Ya mis noches no son frías, eres todo lo que quería 
conversando con mil estrellas fugaces
Sin conocerte pero deseando que llegases
En mi armario, tengo guardados cartas e itinerarios
¿Quién dijo que un hombre no tiene diario?
Para escribir lo necesario, ¿cómo?, ¿cuándo? y ¿dónde?, fecha y horario
Aparecías en mis pensamientos involuntarios
Si me pides una estrella yo muevo el cielo y la tierra
Cuido el suelo donde pisas y voy removiendo piedras
Porque solo te mereces lo mejor
Entraste en vida en tiempo de blanco y negro a darle color

Entre lujos y dinero me arropaba el frío
Entre cámaras y fama me sentía vacío

Llegaste tú, justo antes de que yo tocara fondo

Mi polli te confieso, mientras estoy parado en este altar 
Esperando que tú llegues, no paro de suspirar
Y de pensar en que te adoro, eres mi gran tesoro
Y de que no te cambiaría, por la fama ni el oro
No me gustan los tatuajes, pero me marqué tu nombre
Soy capaz de muchas cosas, mai bebé yo soy tu hombre
Es que tú me complementas, si no sabes te las inventas
Eres la calma, en medio de toda mis tormentas
No me olvido, cuando te vi por primera vez
Es la mujer que rondabas mi sueño desde la niñez
Casi te pierdo, pero nunca perdí la fe
Me lo propuse, trabajé duro y te conquisté
Ahora o nunca, por ti nadaría los sietes mares
Prometo estar contigo hasta que la muerte nos separe
Es mi deber, cuidar y proteger esa mujer
Que dios puso en camino y es un nuevo amanecer

El príncipe",La Boda,2016
Kendo Kaponi,"Hay veces que ser yo no lo es todo
Cuando tienes tanto y sientes no tener nada
Caminas por la vida solo
Yo callo pero aveces es así que me siento
Aprendes a aceptar que las cosas mas grandes se acaban solo con un momento
Aprendes a vivir en un mundo de traición
De fuego y mas caras con valor
Te acostumbras a llevarlo a todos los extremos
Somos de la calle y así es que todo lo hacemos

No se mide mal ni bien
Ni se valoran cosas que convienen
Todo va tan rápido, hasta que llego a casa y te miro a los ojos
Te abrazo y todo se detiene
Y me arrepiente de haber hecho tanto
De por tanto tiempo de haber caminado ciego
Y haber perdido el sentimiento en miedo

Kendo me dijo que me metiera a la cabina y me concentre
Que la música es eterna y por eso estoy aqui diciendo esto,
Para el día en que yo falte lo guardes para siempre

El orfanato!
Ángeles Y demonios

Me siento y saco números un octavo en dos mil quinientos
entre mes y cocina se van doscientos
veintidós paquetes de cuarenta y dos y viran tres mil novecientos
en semana y media, el negocio es super lento

Recupero, los veinticinco de la pieza voy y los entrego
y de ganancia quedan uno, dos, seis, cero
se tiraron y al que se llevaron fue a mi socio
cojo mas fianza en verdad que no es negocio

Mi nombre suena
y los problemas van en cadena
el case no es mio pero pronto mi sello se estrena
el dinero fue mi eclipse en luna llena
y el doctor le diagnostica, cáncer a mi nena

Bueno
Syko me estoy volviendo loco

Que paso escucho tu voz como ajora

Yo he guerreado tres veces por el case y con necesidad

Pero yo cabrón. No tuve el ticket ni pa' navidad

Donde vea al flaco papi se la voy a dejar pegar
y que se muera!

Kendo dale cuerda antes de meterle al flaco
Hay que darle al del B M el es la mano derecha

Naa, el bobolon no es ni la izquierda
Y después que le demos Syko arranca mierda

Anoche me visito un ángel pregunto que precio tiene
no poder ser feliz y no ver crecer a tus nenes
dijo que el diablo encuentras a vivir detrás del reca
recuerda que la loca fue quien se llevo a tu vieja

Deja atrás to, recoja busca rumbo tienes tiempo
no confíes ni en ti mismo no hay amigo en el infierno
Sentí una paz inmensa cuando aquel ángel me hablaba
De repente otros en la puerta tocaban

Me dijo no andes solo no te envuelvas no te dejes
tu naciste pa' eso saca pecho no te quejes
no sueltes la pistola que es tu única garantía
de que mañana te alumbre la luz del día

Piensa en la familia, en la renta, la comida
la nena esta enferma ya tu mai murió de SIDA
contéstame cabrón vas a dejar que el destino por ti decida?
o vas a cojer la ley en tu mano y buscar la salida?

Donde te parquiaste?

Afuera del case frente a casa de Nindativa
a hablar de una vía pero ya no se si sirva

Olvídate de eso, hablemos sin dar lata

Pues vamos a movernos que detrás del cemento oyen las ratas

Somos dos dentro del carro los cristales no pueden bajarse
si nos ven entrando juntos el chisme va a regarse
no puedo tirar de afuera hay que entrar y asegurarse
la cuarenta tiene problemas con el peine y va a trancarse

Tas loco tienes que matarme
yo si que voy a bajarme
yo he guerreado por este caserío y no voy a dejarme
el kisko es mio, las reglas van a cambiar,
si ganamos si le metemos, si perdemos hay que mudarse

Me baje yo creo que me vieron
un par corrieron
Kendo lo tengo de frente, me dieron

Hirieron a Syko le enganche el clip de veinte a la nueve
el que mata es en este caserío hoy es el día que lo pruebe

Entre detonaciones y sirenas
la voz de mi nena
dice papi es mejor que te quedes
no salgas me duele
lo que mi nena no sabe es que su papi se debe
a una guerra de calle, un bato se muere
que el dinero nunca se regala y del cielo no llueve
que por ver crecer al primer cabrón ya le di nueve

te falle mi amor quizás nuestros sueños se troyaron
pero a este otro hijo de puta le di los once que quedaron
los guardias llegaron, me rodearon, dispararon
trate de ganarles pero como quiera me cazaron
te escribo desde la cárcel por si no te contaron
o por si lamentablemente fallecí y me enterraron

Anoche me visito un ángel pregunto que precio tiene
no poder ser feliz y no ver crecer a tus nenes
dijo que el diablo encuentras a vivir detrás del reca
recuerda que la loca fue quien se llevo a tu vieja

Deja atrás to, recoja busca rumbo tienes tiempo
no confíes ni en ti mismo no hay amigo en el infierno
Sentí una paz inmensa cuando aquel ángel me hablaba
De repente otros en la puerta tocaban

la nena esta enferma ya tu mai murió de SIDA
contéstame cabrón vas a dejar que el destino por ti decida?
o vas a cojer la ley en tu mano y buscar la salida?

Ángeles y demonios oo
hablándome a mi y no oo

Ángeles y demonios oo
hablándome a mi y no oo
No quise escuchar

El día en que mi barrio conozca y reconozca
que sangre llama mas sangre
nunca vamos a terminar con las drogas
si no que ella va a terminar con todos nosotros
que los asesinatos suben cada día mas
y que somos todos y cada uno de nosotros
los responsables de que nuestras comunidades sigan en porvenir
progreso pueblo, Puerto Rico tu puedes

El cambio nunca va a ocurrir
si no empezamos por nosotros
para un entendedor con pocas palabras basta

Meet The Orphans
Estos son Meet The Orphans
DJ Lobo La Zona toma uno
Te toca

Diagnostico detienen enfermedades oportunistas
Si tu me das un virus encefalitis la primera en su lista
Síndrome de inmuno deficiencia querida
En su etapa terminal decide ya perdió la vida
Yo lloraba lloraba pidiendo entendimiento
Padre amado ayúdame con esto de la forma en que se pueda
Porque de tanto desde quinto no volví a la escuela

Sin familia sin un techo sin nevera
Lograr cumplir un sueño en un cielo sin estrellas
No era algo coherente y hasta pensé que dios se había
Olvidado de mi y me demostró que siempre me tuvo en su lente
Mataron a menor en la autopista Martinena
Alguien en el nombre lleva su alma se pudo salvar
Mama descansa en paz no te tienes que preocupar
Tu nene suena entre los grandes Yankee Don Omar

Kendo enfoca la cámara de tu vida
Hacia los objetivos que de verdad tienen importancia en la vida
Vas a tomar la mano al fuego del éxito
Pichaer a to' estos bobos
Nunca falta el drama para quien vive en un teatro
Nosotros estamos en la real
Echa pa' adelante pídele a dios que te bendiga
Que te sabiduría sabiduría de lo alto
Como la que pidió Raymond Ayala

La vida es una rueda
Ayer me encontraba en silla de ruedas
Hoy voy a cien y no esperes que retroceda
Con lagrimas de sangre jure que me quedaría con el canto
En el nombre del padre del hijo y espíritu santo
Agarre su manto y seco todo mi llanto
Dejo que pusiera en alto la isla del encanto
Me han tirao con balas con chilla con versos
Pero yo soy imparable voy a mi contra el universo
Mi destino esta escrito por orden divino
El camino es duro pero el duro se queda en el camino
Aja digan lo que digan yo disfruto mi trabajo
Tienes dos opciones quererme o irte pal carajo

Así de sencillo ando con los pies en la tierra
Y mi autoestima en las nubes D Y
Yo soy imparable mi hermano
Con temor a dios y sin miedo al hombre
Te arrodilla busco a dios y después me mato
Con los hombres D Y desde el orfanato tu casa
Y el Cartel la mía Los Insuperables
Eso somos tu y yo y el sobreviviente Baby Rasta

Reporte de fiscaliza tres de marzo y doce y una de la madrugada
Un auto 108 impacto dentro Baby Rasta
La prensa se aferra a publicarla pero en algo erra
Mientras wilmer alicea en su odisea se aferra
A la promesa celestial que hiciese algún buen día
De consagrar a dios su vida si del hospital salia
Decisión del duro Rasta no se iría
Y lo dejaría vivo pa' que cantara algún día

Tranquilo voy pa' adelante cante quien cante
Po' encima mi misión la cima
Un par de balazos y el duro me echo el brazo
Y me dijo Rasta hoy no es tu día
Yo sigo mejorando mis fans siguen rezando
Y sobre la brea mis lobos están cazando
En mi a mi lado vela por mi vida
Y pa' los que se rieron llego su pesadilla

Vieja dijo Kendo esta maldito 
Y la j dice que es mentira, 
Un asesino no piensa en 
Los muertos ni se acuesta sintiendo los gritos yo de
Chamaquito me encerraba dentro 
De un gran bombo tibio porque la
Sombra del closet solo hablaba del suicidio, 
Nunca conteste porque
Mi abuelo me contó sobre 
Las trampas los demonios y los anzuelos,
Hay algo debajo de mi cama y me desvelo, 
Por eso desde aquel

Transportar los muertos, pa' que los panas que no han muerto , miren

Concierto

Sera verdad que moriré y subiré sin alas al cielo a morar, 
O mi alma vagara sin descansar poder 
Y seré un alma en pena que en la oscuridad, 
No se si sea real que el infierno veré, 
Si no confieso mi pecado mortal, 
Donde fueron a parar los que dijeron que, 
Jamas solo me iban a dejar, 
Tu me puedes contestar si existe quien, 
Que venga pronto necesito conversar nada se ve bien todo anda mal, 
Cae la noche y le temo a la soledad y a la oscuridad
Y a la oscuridad

Pensamiento erróneo de un cerebro enfermo quien hablo de reencarnar,
Ya abandono la opción los cielos y el infierno, 
En ocasiones siento cosas dentro de mi casa
Como sombras ruidos y reflejos, 
Siempre pregunte que pasaría si
Llamo la muerte siete veces de frente al espejo, 
A veces pienso tanto que me puedo confundir, 
Sera verdad que hay gente que presiente
Cosas antes de morir, 
Si hay algo de lo que yo tengo claro es que
Todos

Vivimos bajo esta duda realmente habrán otros seres con vida en el
Universo o que significa 
La luna cuando alumbra el triangulo de las bermudas, 
Buscando el sueño me acuesto en la cama el cuarto gira y
Me pongo a pensar si algún día me decido por optar tratar de
Renunciarle a la vida podre llegar al cielo perdonado y sin pecar
Un pastor me dijo imposible hijo agárrate de dios mantén la fe y
Camina fijo desde que hablo directo con el ya no tengo intermediarios
Y me quite del cuello el crucifijo

Sera verdad que moriré y subiré sin alas al cielo a morar, 
O mi alma vagara sin descansar poder 
Y seré un alma en pena que en la oscuridad, 
No se si sea real que el infierno veré, 
Si no confieso mi pecado mortal,

Y un poco de limón pa' que después te pongas biónica

Ma' quítate tengo lo que quieres
Por donde tú lo quieres
Y como tú lo quieres
Relájate eso no duele
Cierra los ojos, abra la boca
Voy hacerle que vuele

Donde kaponi parta no hay doctor pa cocerlo
John travolta no me fronte que partí torta
Que yo si tengo el guille que nadie lo soporta
Un jefe millonario y un combate de torta
Mami no te trinque lo duro es chambearte la torta
Tú quieres! que kaponi te pegue al muro
Que te lleve pa' lo obscuro
Esa quiere comer duro
Quieres! perreo no
Tu lo que le metes en doble turno
Una baby pasa turno

Mai' yo sé lo que tú quieres
Un ritmo nasty de fornaris
Que tiren don y el kaponi

Tú quieres, que se te note ese escote
Que syko no come mierda y con la música se bote

Kendo Kaponi,"Gente que se ama por pena
Gente que se ama por interés
Hay amores que condenan
Por darle fuego a un corazon de papel
Hay amor sencillo
Que tan solo un detalle le arropa
Y hay amores viciosos que solo se buscan después de unas copas
Amores que son tan frágil que tan solo una palabra le hacen pedazos
Y hay amores en guerra en campo abierto y si nadie ah muerto
Pienso yo que tal vez ese sea nuestro caso

Ha ha ha
Don oye

Te voy a decir como es que se vive en casa
En guerra pero rico atiende

Vivo en casa con mi enemigo
Y nunca conversamos si no hay discusión
Un día de estos se matan dicen los vecino
No entienden que en guerra se vive mejor
Vivo en casa con mi enemigo
Y nunca conversamos si no hay discusión
Un día de estos se matan dicen los vecino
No entienden que en guerra se vive mejor

Yo no se si gritar o en timbre normal
Ala hora de hablar pero se que le da
Ese toque especial ala casa
De una academia militar
Quisiera que yo soy el del cuidado
Por que ella se acuerda demasiado
Sera que siempre esta llena la luna
Por que no me deja pasar ninguna
Eso queja tras queja la grama esta alta
O ta la basura avece me arta y me para en tribuna
Ami me respeta y me bajas el flow
Vecinos alerta que comienza el show

La cocina se ve puerca por tres semana
Yo puse mi truza en el sofá de la sala
El fregadero es un vertedero lleno de platos
Yo llamo ala j y llego borracho
Ella llama alas amigas y le hacen coro
Yo voy al baño y no bajo el inodoro
La guerra esta en pie y yo tiro a matar
Pero siempre al final me gana
Por que son tres semana y no hay nada de nada en la cama
La guerra de casa ya como que pasa
A ser algo mas que un problema interno
Le digo gritando me voy de este infierno
Me ignora en celo viro con atacaque y cuelno
Me la tiene monta bien monta (wow wawa wow)
Me lleva del tingo al tango las amigas
Tirando en fango yo siempre enfrentando (wow wawa wow)

Vivo en casa con mi enemigo
Y nunca conversamos si no hay discusión
Un día de estos se matan dicen los vecino
No entienden que en guerra se vive mejor
Vivo en casa con mi enemigo
Y nunca conversamos si no hay discusión
Un día de estos se matan dicen los vecino
No entienden que en guerra se vive mejor

No eh conocido a nadie que sea capaz
De aguantar en casa media hora de vista
Si no con calle seguimos en paz
Y pa buscarme tiene que hacer cita
Mi nombre no estoy en depre y me siento down
Me paro en la mica y que empieza el segundo round
Vecinos alerta me bajo del carro y le tiro la puerta
Le grito en la cara
Ami no me importa y voy a joderme estos chavos e la renta
Y quizá y yo me dijo dos o tres yo la rete me quito la gold
Y yo el reloj que le regale
Y hablando claro la guerra esta en pie
Pero siempre al final me gana
Por que son tres semana no hay nada de nada en la cama (oh)
La guerra de casa ya como que pasa
A ser algo mas que un problema interno
Le digo gritando me voy de este infierno
Me ignora en celo viro con atacaque y cuelno
Me la tiene monta bien monta (wow wawa wow)

Kendo Kapponi,"Hay veces que ser yo no lo es todo
Cuando tienes tanto y sientes no tener nada
Caminas por la vida solo
Yo callo pero aveces es así que me siento
Aprendes a aceptar que las cosas mas grandes se acaban solo con un momento
Aprendes a vivir en un mundo de traición
De fuego y mas caras con valor
Te acostumbras a llevarlo a todos los extremos
Somos de la calle y así es que todo lo hacemos

No se mide mal ni bien
Ni se valoran cosas que convienen
Todo va tan rápido, hasta que llego a casa y te miro a los ojos
Te abrazo y todo se detiene
Y me arrepiente de haber hecho tanto
De por tanto tiempo de haber caminado ciego
Y haber perdido el sentimiento en miedo

Kendo me dijo que me metiera a la cabina y me concentre
Que la música es eterna y por eso estoy aqui diciendo esto,
Para el día en que yo falte lo guardes para siempre

El orfanato!
Ángeles Y demonios

Me siento y saco números un octavo en dos mil quinientos
entre mes y cocina se van doscientos
veintidós paquetes de cuarenta y dos y viran tres mil novecientos
en semana y media, el negocio es super lento

Recupero, los veinticinco de la pieza voy y los entrego
y de ganancia quedan uno, dos, seis, cero
se tiraron y al que se llevaron fue a mi socio
cojo mas fianza en verdad que no es negocio

Mi nombre suena
y los problemas van en cadena
el case no es mio pero pronto mi sello se estrena
el dinero fue mi eclipse en luna llena
y el doctor le diagnostica, cáncer a mi nena

Bueno
Syko me estoy volviendo loco

Que paso escucho tu voz como ajora

Yo he guerreado tres veces por el case y con necesidad

Pero yo cabrón. No tuve el ticket ni pa' navidad

Donde vea al flaco papi se la voy a dejar pegar
y que se muera!

Kendo dale cuerda antes de meterle al flaco
Hay que darle al del B M el es la mano derecha

Naa, el bobolon no es ni la izquierda
Y después que le demos Syko arranca mierda

Anoche me visito un ángel pregunto que precio tiene
no poder ser feliz y no ver crecer a tus nenes
dijo que el diablo encuentras a vivir detrás del reca
recuerda que la loca fue quien se llevo a tu vieja

Deja atrás to, recoja busca rumbo tienes tiempo
no confíes ni en ti mismo no hay amigo en el infierno
Sentí una paz inmensa cuando aquel ángel me hablaba
De repente otros en la puerta tocaban

Me dijo no andes solo no te envuelvas no te dejes
tu naciste pa' eso saca pecho no te quejes
no sueltes la pistola que es tu única garantía
de que mañana te alumbre la luz del día

Piensa en la familia, en la renta, la comida
la nena esta enferma ya tu mai murió de SIDA
contéstame cabrón vas a dejar que el destino por ti decida?
o vas a cojer la ley en tu mano y buscar la salida?

Donde te parquiaste?

Afuera del case frente a casa de Nindativa
a hablar de una vía pero ya no se si sirva

Olvídate de eso, hablemos sin dar lata

Pues vamos a movernos que detrás del cemento oyen las ratas

Somos dos dentro del carro los cristales no pueden bajarse
si nos ven entrando juntos el chisme va a regarse
no puedo tirar de afuera hay que entrar y asegurarse
la cuarenta tiene problemas con el peine y va a trancarse

Tas loco tienes que matarme
yo si que voy a bajarme
yo he guerreado por este caserío y no voy a dejarme
el kisko es mio, las reglas van a cambiar,
si ganamos si le metemos, si perdemos hay que mudarse

Me baje yo creo que me vieron
un par corrieron
Kendo lo tengo de frente, me dieron

Hirieron a Syko le enganche el clip de veinte a la nueve
el que mata es en este caserío hoy es el día que lo pruebe

Entre detonaciones y sirenas
la voz de mi nena
dice papi es mejor que te quedes
no salgas me duele
lo que mi nena no sabe es que su papi se debe
a una guerra de calle, un bato se muere
que el dinero nunca se regala y del cielo no llueve
que por ver crecer al primer cabrón ya le di nueve

te falle mi amor quizás nuestros sueños se troyaron
pero a este otro hijo de puta le di los once que quedaron
los guardias llegaron, me rodearon, dispararon
trate de ganarles pero como quiera me cazaron
te escribo desde la cárcel por si no te contaron
o por si lamentablemente fallecí y me enterraron

Anoche me visito un ángel pregunto que precio tiene
no poder ser feliz y no ver crecer a tus nenes
dijo que el diablo encuentras a vivir detrás del reca
recuerda que la loca fue quien se llevo a tu vieja

Deja atrás to, recoja busca rumbo tienes tiempo
no confíes ni en ti mismo no hay amigo en el infierno
Sentí una paz inmensa cuando aquel ángel me hablaba
De repente otros en la puerta tocaban

Me dijo no andes solo no te envuelvas no te dejes

contéstame cabrón vas a dejar que el destino por ti decida?
o vas a cojer la ley en tu mano y buscar la salida?

Ángeles y demonios oo
hablándome a mi y no oo

Ángeles y demonios oo
hablándome a mi y no oo
No quise escuchar

El día en que mi barrio conozca y reconozca
que sangre llama mas sangre
nunca vamos a terminar con las drogas
si no que ella va a terminar con todos nosotros
que los asesinatos suben cada día mas
y que somos todos y cada uno de nosotros
los responsables de que nuestras comunidades sigan en porvenir
progreso pueblo, Puerto Rico tu puedes

Diagnostico detienen enfermedades oportunistas
Si tu me das un virus encefalitis la primera en su lista
Síndrome de inmuno deficiencia querida
En su etapa terminal decide ya perdió la vida
Yo lloraba lloraba pidiendo entendimiento
Padre amado ayúdame con esto de la forma en que se pueda
Porque de tanto desde quinto no volví a la escuela

Sin familia sin un techo sin nevera
Lograr cumplir un sueño en un cielo sin estrellas
No era algo coherente y hasta pensé que dios se había
Olvidado de mi y me demostró que siempre me tuvo en su lente
Mataron a menor en la autopista Martinena
Alguien en el nombre lleva su alma se pudo salvar
Mama descansa en paz no te tienes que preocupar
Tu nene suena entre los grandes Yankee Don Omar

Hacia los objetivos que de verdad tienen importancia en la vida
Vas a tomar la mano al fuego del éxito
Pichaer a to' estos bobos
Nunca falta el drama para quien vive en un teatro
Nosotros estamos en la real
Echa pa' adelante pídele a dios que te bendiga
Que te sabiduría sabiduría de lo alto
Como la que pidió Raymond Ayala

La vida es una rueda
Ayer me encontraba en silla de ruedas
Hoy voy a cien y no esperes que retroceda
Con lagrimas de sangre jure que me quedaría con el canto
En el nombre del padre del hijo y espíritu santo
Agarre su manto y seco todo mi llanto
Dejo que pusiera en alto la isla del encanto
Me han tirao con balas con chilla con versos
Pero yo soy imparable voy a mi contra el universo
Mi destino esta escrito por orden divino
El camino es duro pero el duro se queda en el camino
Aja digan lo que digan yo disfruto mi trabajo
Tienes dos opciones quererme o irte pal carajo

Así de sencillo ando con los pies en la tierra
Y mi autoestima en las nubes D Y
Yo soy imparable mi hermano
Con temor a dios y sin miedo al hombre
Te arrodilla busco a dios y después me mato
Con los hombres D Y desde el orfanato tu casa
Y el Cartel la mía Los Insuperables
Eso somos tu y yo y el sobreviviente Baby Rasta

Reporte de fiscaliza tres de marzo y doce y una de la madrugada
Un auto 108 impacto dentro Baby Rasta
La prensa se aferra a publicarla pero en algo erra
Mientras wilmer alicea en su odisea se aferra
A la promesa celestial que hiciese algún buen día
De consagrar a dios su vida si del hospital salia
Decisión del duro Rasta no se iría
Y lo dejaría vivo pa' que cantara algún día

Tranquilo voy pa' adelante cante quien cante
Po' encima mi misión la cima
Un par de balazos y el duro me echo el brazo
Y me dijo Rasta hoy no es tu día
Yo sigo mejorando mis fans siguen rezando
Y sobre la brea mis lobos están cazando
En mi a mi lado vela por mi vida
Y pa' los que se rieron llego su pesadilla

Donde kaponi parta no hay doctor pa cocerlo
John travolta no me fronte que partí torta
Que yo si tengo el guille que nadie lo soporta
Un jefe millonario y un combate de torta
Mami no te trinque lo duro es chambearte la torta
Tú quieres! que kaponi te pegue al muro
Que te lleve pa' lo obscuro
Esa quiere comer duro
Quieres! perreo no
Tu lo que le metes en doble turno
Una baby pasa turno

Mai' yo sé lo que tú quieres
Un ritmo nasty de fornaris
Que tiren don y el kaponi
Dembow y empezó el party
Tú quieres, que se te note ese escote
Que syko no come mierda y con la música se bote
Tú quieres, tu wiskysito con tónica
Y un poco de limón pa' que después te pongas biónica
Quieres, una pastilla maravilla
Que prendan una varilla pa' coger orbitar la milla

Ma' quítate tengo lo que quieres
Por donde tú lo quieres
Y como tú lo quieres
Relájate eso no duele
Cierra los ojos, abra la boca
Voy hacerle que vuele
Des-contrólate, doblate no te dejes
Jalate el pelo grita
Duro pa que te despegue
Revélate la vida es una sola
Y uno se lleva lo que le bailo la bola",RX,2010
Kendo Kapponi,"Gente que se ama por pena
Gente que se ama por interés
Hay amores que condenan
Por darle fuego a un corazon de papel
Hay amor sencillo
Que tan solo un detalle le arropa
Y hay amores viciosos que solo se buscan después de unas copas
Amores que son tan frágil que tan solo una palabra le hacen pedazos
Y hay amores en guerra en campo abierto y si nadie ah muerto
Pienso yo que tal vez ese sea nuestro caso

Ha ha ha
Don oye

Te voy a decir como es que se vive en casa
En guerra pero rico atiende

Vivo en casa con mi enemigo
Y nunca conversamos si no hay discusión
Un día de estos se matan dicen los vecino
No entienden que en guerra se vive mejor
Vivo en casa con mi enemigo
Y nunca conversamos si no hay discusión
Un día de estos se matan dicen los vecino
No entienden que en guerra se vive mejor

Yo no se si gritar o en timbre normal
Ala hora de hablar pero se que le da
Ese toque especial ala casa
De una academia militar
Quisiera que yo soy el del cuidado
Por que ella se acuerda demasiado
Sera que siempre esta llena la luna
Por que no me deja pasar ninguna
Eso queja tras queja la grama esta alta
O ta la basura avece me arta y me para en tribuna
Ami me respeta y me bajas el flow
Vecinos alerta que comienza el show

La cocina se ve puerca por tres semana
Yo puse mi truza en el sofá de la sala
El fregadero es un vertedero lleno de platos
Yo llamo ala j y llego borracho
Ella llama alas amigas y le hacen coro
Yo voy al baño y no bajo el inodoro
La guerra esta en pie y yo tiro a matar
Pero siempre al final me gana
Por que son tres semana y no hay nada de nada en la cama
La guerra de casa ya como que pasa
A ser algo mas que un problema interno
Le digo gritando me voy de este infierno
Me ignora en celo viro con atacaque y cuelno
Me la tiene monta bien monta (wow wawa wow)
Me lleva del tingo al tango las amigas
Tirando en fango yo siempre enfrentando (wow wawa wow)

Vivo en casa con mi enemigo

Un día de estos se matan dicen los vecino
No entienden que en guerra se vive mejor

No eh conocido a nadie que sea capaz
De aguantar en casa media hora de vista
Si no con calle seguimos en paz
Y pa buscarme tiene que hacer cita
Mi nombre no estoy en depre y me siento down
Me paro en la mica y que empieza el segundo round
Vecinos alerta me bajo del carro y le tiro la puerta
Le grito en la cara
Ami no me importa y voy a joderme estos chavos e la renta
Y quizá y yo me dijo dos o tres yo la rete me quito la gold
Y yo el reloj que le regale
Y hablando claro la guerra esta en pie
Pero siempre al final me gana
Por que son tres semana no hay nada de nada en la cama (oh)

Noise from the boys with the rocks in their fists

Just a funeral for a guy with time that he borrowed

She's got your number she got your code

Blue is the color your skin fades to when there's no pump of
Blood through your veins or your heart or when you got no love

The rattle does roll when there's something to gain
Was it the shove that done did that man in
Or the lady who came and blew in with the wind

Hold on to something, hold on to something
We about to take the road less travelled
You ain't gotta go home, but you can't stay here
Let's go

I get lonelier each time
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake til you come and make things right (yeah yeah)
I get lonelier each time you go away (come on)
So baby won't you stay with me tonight? (yeah)

Check it out
There's this lady I'm in love with (yes there is)
Living inside this woman unknown
But she's scared to let it show
I know it sound like some bug shit (yeah it do)
It's just she come with
Hang-ups and
Insecurities they gotta go
She always nervous around me
But see this lady inside
She's ready to be my baby tonight
And ever since this lady found me
This woman think I'm dangerous
And ain't ready to put her safety aside
I try to tell her that I got her back
And no matter where we at
In our lives
I'll treat her like she my girl
I asked her ""what's wrong with dat?"" (what's wrong with dat?)
She like ""it just ain't right
There's so many more women and men in the world""
I have to admit the girl got a point (true)
Maybe my ambition's made to make me want something I just can't have
So now it's time for me to blow this joint
I still know I'm in love
I just stay focused
And true to my path

I got to get away
Ladies you ever felt growing away
By your man
Asking ""baby, won't you stay?""
He chilling with his crew
He should be building with you
He got you feeling the blues
Cause the children to glue
He willing to do
Whatever it takes
To save 'em
From a fate he can't see when he misbehaving
Brave men don't let they ladies
Raise they children theyself
You're so busy trying to save 'em
That you you're killing yourself
With the
Stress and strife
And the fights and the advice
From the ladies of the night
Who can't run they own life
Up in your air
Nothing is fair
Why do you care?
Why do you always take it there?
The crying, the tears
You ain't prepared for the jewels
That I'm trying to share
Flying there
Dying inside
Hot in the fear
The writing is clear
On the wall
For you to read the sign
Ayo the fine is the way we design
To be fine
But still

I get lonelier each time (i get so lonely)
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake til you come and make things right
(mmm make it right, make it right, make it right)
I get lonelier each time you go away (la la la la la la la la)
So baby won't you stay with me tonight?

Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta, gotta
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta, gotta

Yo
You can tell when people wanna spend they life together
Despite the weather
They treat each other like a treasure
Can't fight forever
You got to give it up
I ain't got a lot of time
We got to live it up
I make my music like I make my love
People use it like they take they drugs
In the morning
When they waking up
This music got me out late but
I holla at you when I'm done
Don't stay up
Will love play with us?
It sting like paper cuts
Doused in alcohol
But if it's real
They ain't no greater rush
I got faith in us
It's only you who really know me
I be surrounded by people
And still feel lonely

So baby won't you stay (why won't you stay?)
Baby won't you stay? (why won't you stay?)
Baby won't you stay with me tonight? (oh)
Stay with me tonight
Stay with me tonight

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black

And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that

I'm the biggest hypocrite in 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean it's evident I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt

I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Dareous

I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell because it's threats when I see you
I can tell because your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!",The Blacker the Berry,
Kendrick Lamar,"YOLO

YOLO, you only live once

The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy
It's not worth the risk

You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
Don't trust anyone
Cause you only live once

Ugh, you only live once
That's the motto
So take a chill pill
Ease off the throttle

Never go to loud clubs
Cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry
When they can't hear

And stay the hell away from drugs
Cause they're not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard
Like a beagle

'Cause you should never trust a bank
They've been known to fail
And never travel by car, a bus
Boat or by rail

And don't travel by plane
And don't travel at all
Built a bomb shelter basement
With titanium walls

And wear titanium suits
In case pianos fall on ya
And never go in saunas
Cause they're crawlin' with piranhas

And never take the stairs
'Cause they're often unsafe
You only live once
Don't let it go to waste

You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat 'til it's done
Cause you only live once

Yeah
And here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids
Cause their hair is filled with mad lice

There's no such thing
As too much Purell
This a cautionary tale
Word to George Orwell

So don't 1980 force
Any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt
And triple lock it

Then hire a taster
Make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy
Then destroy him

No blankets or pajamas
They can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture
Killing machines

Board your windows up
The sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straight jacket
So your safe from yourself

Take no chances (no chances)
Stop freelancin' (right now)
Invest in your future
Don't dilute your finances (uh huh)
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?)
4.2% thirty year mortgage
That's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it
Don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings
And you'll retire with money in your account
Beast

YOLO, say no no
Isolate yourself
And just roll solo
Be care-folo
You oughta look out
Also stands for YOLO

You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue

Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die

Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky

You oughta look out",YOLO,

I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You've ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react

If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father,
That's ironic see a block away from Lueders park, I seen the El Camino parked
In her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat

Her anatomy is God's temple, and it's quite simple
Her castle is about to be destroyed, she's always paranoid
Watching the law inside the streets undercover the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide,
Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise,
To no surprise she took the ultimatum around the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome to fill him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat

She suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
Of the black man, white man, needed satisfaction, at first
It became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
This muthafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that
Block away from Lueders park, I seen a El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
And caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street Keisha's song

Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking lie
When I lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away

I give em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wildin' a youngin' with lack of guidance

My mama is stressing, my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour and second, ministers tried
To save me, how I'm gonna listen
When I don't even hear God?

You think about it, and don't call me lyrical
Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words
To make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worry some individuals that live life critical
So won't you bare witness while I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break, eating in the parking lot
On 'Wanna Be Heard,' probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me, getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for
The world that minute

And drop grams in it, he'll probably be

Take it vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightening bolts hit ya body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write strong enough
To stand in front of a traveling freight train
Are you trained, to go against Dracula
Dragging the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips and gold chains

Up and down, get 64 better know how to drive it

1987, the children of Ronald Reagan raped the leaves off your front porch
With a machine blow torch
He blowing on sess, hoping to ease the stress
He copping some blow hoping that it can stretch
New born massacre, hoppin' out the passenger
With calendars cause your date coming
Run 'em down them he gun em down
I'm hoping that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin' because

Everytime we bark
She pay us no mind

Matter of fact Tyrone
Was on speed dial, so when she got home
It was going down, she go

When she tired of her nigga

To holla, she gon' resist
In her man she trust
So when I walk by her

She checked his pockets
Found condoms by Magnum
And the moment they was acknowledged
She popped his eye
Then ran outside
Then started driving
On the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she go

These vulnerable girls
Took they men up
Put em in their world
Their vulnerable world
And just like that it was
Only getting they feelings hurt
Tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the
Biggest question mark
They curious now
Cause when women get sick of men
They think of a big helping hand
To lend each other under cover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over
It'll be alright
The minute she hit the block
And turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go

Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I’m feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I’m in the matter of man arm wrestling hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when you're my type
And you're winning from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all 'cause the audience, one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks

I don’t call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say we in the area cruisin' in Toronto, hit me on the cellular
Thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can’t see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality living in the Matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as, myself
And it didn’t help 'cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I’m breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said,

In your pocket I wanna see your fuckin resume
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole: I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smoking that chronic just to meditate
I'mma give em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweights, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me, shit, I was selling weight
Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performing in front of millions, nigga every race
64 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
4th album, no 5 mics? Then let 'em hate
But I'm not stopping 'til I'm the fucking king in every state

Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell 'em

That's the motherfuckin West side, you test me, you test God
I'm his son, it say in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun, you won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em

Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waiting for
I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for? I love you cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor, walk up on you
Like ""what's going on baby boy?"" Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more
But I still owe Jimmy one more album

Drank until I can't no mo'
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
I'm with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
‘Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it’s necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with – look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I’m drug-free, but shit I’m with the homies

It’s 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I’ll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren’t from ‘round there
‘Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn’t like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the funk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That’s ironic ‘cause I’ve never been violent, until I’m with the homies

(Just ridin’, just ridin’)
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin’, actin’ a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin’, really trippin’)
Me and the homies
(Just ridin’, just ridin’, just ridin’…)

Bragging 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn’t make me feel that bad
I’m usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain’t got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you saying""
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want

Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called – ""Hello? What you doin'? “Kicking it”
I should’ve told her I’m probably ‘bout to catch my first offense with the homies

But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I prayed he hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan luv. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission,
Drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight

Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too

That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin' I'm holding my scrotum imposing
This voice here is golden so fuck y'all I goes in and

Respect my mind or die from lead shower

So I can fuck the world for seventy two hours

Damn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga

It's go time
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, ""K, you goin' marry mines?""
Beeotch! (no way) Beeotch! (no way)
Beeotch! (no way) Beeotch!
Okay, I'm never living life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind

To sell ya game right on time

This is king Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant at 5 in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got

Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

(Ay, Dre what's happenin' wit' it my nigga!)

Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthin' this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from

Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats

Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll

And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
(Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)

Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby

Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:

I make 'em holla""

Kendrick Lamar,"Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby

Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is just me playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city

Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby

All I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
And grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
With the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say roof
And you ask, ""Lift up your shirt""
Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: ""He's probably young but I know that he's down""
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know he'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city

Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby

All I see in this room
20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in the same society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt

Where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""
""This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga""

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was Me, O-Boog[?], and Yaya[?], YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window. Check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where hang out
Now this is not a tape recording saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin up you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump
Pickin' off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
AK's, AR's, ""Aye y'all. Duck.""
That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces
BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

How we do

Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice

Cocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds
Make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis
I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spray can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where motherfuckers stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
And the price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects

You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word ""but"", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

Sing my song, it's all for you",Real,2012
Kendrick Lamar,"When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, ""Get em""
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope --

When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it section .80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
Whats crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'mma get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga where the fuck is u going nigga, this bullshit...

When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'mma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""it need to be told
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her"" so
Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?

When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets
AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back
Who got the footage?
Channel 9
Cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams are balled in like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst

What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live right just by how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is viewed
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""Fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed was my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
""See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""","Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst",2012
Kendrick Lamar,"Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

Now I done grew up
Round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Back stroke every day in Chicago

Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in the dark room
Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me:

Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank

Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize
This is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me

Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

Hop out. Do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang

Hop out, do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

Aw man, what is she taking?
Where is she taking
All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got Hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open
I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough",Swimming Pools (Drank) [Extended Version] [Version],2012

Making my conscious ask me

I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym
We was living in sorrow
Total envy of him
He made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly

Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy

I used to jealous of Jayceon
I used to jealous of Jayceon, Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game they line in front of the store
Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordan's and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly

Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy

My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
A boy touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top forty
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
Only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical
Three niggas making it out, that's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I can do
I wasn't jealous 'cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly
Out of Compton

Thank God
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly",Black Boy Fly [*],2012
Kendrick Lamar,"We on?
Aight
One, two, three, go!

Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin' how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

I'm so high,, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth 
'Cause the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin' outlandish, I’m gonna show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
A record sold for me, it’s just mo for me
And you’re here for you too here, Kendrick, persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off, I ain’t takin' off these pistons
I’m takin' off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but four times two plus yours

I see myself performing at
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's, winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
'Cause my dream ain’t far away

I'm so high, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’m a take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down, in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I wrote 
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin' to you, I was walkin' it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello, we here

And I’m so happy I cry
'Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I could wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you know, that is the time for you to lift your bar
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me

I'm so high, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

I'm so high, I can touch the sky

Kendrick Lamar,"Lord God
I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians
Push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello my name is Kendrick""
She said ""No, you're handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now (cool)
""Where you stay?""
She said ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well is it Compton?""
""No,"" she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
""What you trying to get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well

The summer had passed and now I'm liking her
Conversation we having probably enticing her
Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
It's deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb
Its never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius' reputable
Family history of gang banging did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from getting a nut
I wanna come over, what's up?
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off
I'm trying to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy

So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinking bout that sex, thinking bout her thighs
Or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang",Sherane aka Master Splinter's Daughter,2012
Kendrick Lamar,"I don't read the XXL
Tote the .45 to church, think I'm destined for hell, oh well
Blood tears off the face of my Jesus Piece
It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets
I'm from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets, born in Blood nigga
In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga
Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plugged the nigga
Used to pull the gun out, just because of 'cause niggas
Five shots to the head 'cause I'm a Blood nigga
Nothin' brewing but suwoo'ing where the fuck I'm from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin' down Green Leaf
No peace so don't get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger, we cooking that real beef
Momma's mourning they sons, I'm talking real grief
Real funerals of them lost Juveniles
Trying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh
Say it's a blessing when you die in ya sleep
'Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capishe
I'm sayin', stop playing, wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms, now a caskets what he pray in
Compton streets raised me
Can't tell my grandma nothing bout her baby, you crazy

I said she see no evil
She gonna knock it at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'ma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then?
What happened then?

I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a jag
A cut for my dogs with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried, even when discouraged
Skirt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon' is gone
Shirt off when precesure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic 'cause rats is what I'm talking about
I'm hearin' the sonics of gun fire
The whispers, the silent cries even though I know it's an eye for an eye

I said she see no evil
She gonna knock it at all

So Heaven can you heal, I'm only just a man

You want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there
Hub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh
Niggas can't hear you talking from the sky
And only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
2 Dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though
Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmother's prayers saved you niggas I never wanted peace""

He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky made off everything I deserved
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga

It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We ain't never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn
'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked

I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me
My future's so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle

May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine

There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas, lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle

I'm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
I'm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
Probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about

Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a bilion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, where it hurt you
Life in the power circle

Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggas
I tried to warn you niggas
It's too late now
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga, ugh!",Power Circle,2012

I like to swim in it like Olympians YSL
And some Timberland's high as hell

Fire hoes then re-hire hoes

Plenty priors of a fuck nigga, nigga I suppose
I can fly her, put her in attire of designer clothes

What hair you got left is graying
You're out on my porch yelling, waking the neighbors
Wanting me to come and save you with your aggressive behavior

You're stumbling all over town
You drink till you drown
You keep on threatening to bring me down
You don't make the rules
You drunk old fool
See, you don't scare me, you're just crying wolf

Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy

Breaking my door down when I left the lock open
There ain't much left to be broken
Your flies are wet, then you're soaking
It's like the devil just jumped up in your clothes
he put on your shoes and rolled
Thanks to you, I'm scared to be alone

You're stumbling all over town
You drink till you drown
You keep on threatening to bring me down
You don't make the rules
You drunk old fool
See, you don't scare me, you're just crying wolf

Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry, cry, boy
Cry, cry boy
Cry, boy

Nobody knows what you're saying (I mean, you need to)
I know the game that you're playing (I mean, you need to)

Don't forget about us
Don't forget about trust
Don't forget about the kinkiness of playing with the 'cuffs on the bed spring
Penetrate the loud screams, echoing the hallway is the must
I could never let go if I wanna whore
Duck away from your anatomy, the agony is such a pain I could never endure
Even if I had the cure with the pure, sweet morphine touch
I mean, I cannot deny my demise
To lies, that interfere our future
I mean, if I compromise, will you improvise?
Please don't pin no lies
I'm used to you forgiving and then forget the truth
I promise that I'll commit
Vamoose to all of my old ways
I'm done, I live today
A full moon will never exist, I swear

You're stumbling all over town
You drink till you drown
You keep on threatening to bring me down
You don't make the rules

Kendrick Lamar,"Ay, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She want to hang with us, we want one thing
Just penetrating that throat dog
She choke on it like Smoke Dog
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefa'
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can pay to put a ""69""
And I know what time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
""Why you always give your ass up?
I mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid, this shit don't add up.""
She said, ""Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
Then never call back, I still fuck""
And that's fucked up, she's so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds till' it goes down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name because she married now

When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back then

She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kick it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watching just to see if the police coming
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was going back and forth with these flights
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her ""hurry up, meet me at the room""
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
And my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know
I got a text that said ""I'm pregnant""
And you can almost bet she kept it
That's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested, damn!

When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back then

Wait, hold up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 3-0-5 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv'
But no freestyle I never do
You looking for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlooking every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like about to break a levee
Hold up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas
Fuck you and Mitt Romney
I’m grown now I’m on my own now
I’m po'ppin'
Change my phone now
When I get home now
I got o'ptions
Fast forward, wait is that you?
With them big old thighs after school?
And your 3 kids and 3 baby daddies
And car note that’s overdue? I know

When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back then",Memories Back Then,2013

Kendrick Lamar,"Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip (boom)
Little sip
Took a little sip, took a little sip
T-T-Took a little, took a little, took a little sip (uh)
Uh huh

Ey yo, I walked through the valley of the shadow of death
When niggas hold tec's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check?
And if so, you gotta expect to sip juice
From the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee ""the finisher""
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit
And who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip (boom)

Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all in my mind
All in my line like caller number nine
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-
Seven, way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
At 12, trying to get that taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home ""baby, don't yell""
How many record do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the double X L
Or Fader, fuck ya magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest
I ain't talking about later
I'mma drop the album the same day as Kanye
Just to show the boys the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what next the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and the pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this the kiss of, death
Blah

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip (boom)

Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

Don't shit last, and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt

All these other niggas is below me

Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night

As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die

Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type
Same shit different nights, till I live a different life
Sean you looking tired, damn homie that's all
I've been stressin' so hard I'm surprised I aint going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into ya'll, hatin'
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, buddha love
Niggas sleepin with that mac and I aint talkin' bout computer love
All the wrong people you a price tag
Now you pray to god hoping that you got a christ tag
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, say nay my son
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there too

Wont keep my heart beatin'

Bout all of this muthafuckin' money

I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection at the same time
I'm accepting the fact that there'll never be nothing perfect about me

Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin
We are 6 mile bred, that's why you see our sick style yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chick is yonking, imagine this yapping at me
5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I'm cali swaggin'

You number 1, I'm 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin' with lames, we aint rollin' the same
I'm the best out in this muthafucker
If I could get a check out of this muthafucka big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this muthafucka, with no regrets

I gotta do something that's innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with tia and tia's momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of carne asada (I gotta)
I gotta find me a wife to elope (I gotta)
I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like yall, but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
Need to know every detail about this earth, the devil controls it
So before you scrutinize how I feel ask god if those polls important
The end is near!

You either crash landing or planning on flyin' with me
Misery loves standing behind his company, well,
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that it’s appealing to pop a pill, that's a downer I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love, the drop is steep
I heard when you see a dove, that's what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings but I’m still free
'Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray, I'll look you in the eye and say

Two lips to kiss, 22 other nuns
God blessed my tongue, God need it for life
Awkward like car rides, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

I really want it I need it
Break bread or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out ""little Johnny is dead!""
You wish me well, I wish you hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, simply got 'em everywhere you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
And if my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell that to me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't

Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 other nuns
God blessed my tongue, God need it for life
Awkward like car rides, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?","Solo Dolo, Pt. 2",2013

Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago
If he dies he dies, like Doughboy to Tre
If he rides he rides, Throwing punches in the room
If he cries he cries, we don't drink away the pain
When a nigga die we add a link to the chain
Inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playing on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills who's gone fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fucking with my sinus
Nigga this is Simon says, Simon red
Blood on your diamonds til you dying, dead, yah!

You better change what comes out your speaker

You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my mama's Christmas party
Troubles on my mind, I still smell crime
My little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Oh wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten
Back when nine ounces have got you ten
And nine times out of ten niggas don't pay attention
And when there's tension in the air nines come with extensions
My daddy dumped a quarter piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat land on his gold
I said ""daddy, one day I'mma get you right with 36 zips
1000 grams of cocaine then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter""
He said ""son, how come you think you be my connect?""
Said ""pops, your ass is washed up with all due respect""
He said ""well nigga, then show me how it all makes sense""
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga
Please reap what you sowed, nigga
I was born in '87, my grand daddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession

Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Turbo charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to yo muhfuckin self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
‘Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

When you a man, action is what’s expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em
It’s carpe diem hey (hey) yeah

Quick sand and mistakes

I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days

Like kindergarteners
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in-
To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing by my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga

Niggas all talk, it'll never change
Keep on choosin do your thang
All them favors, I call her like a driver
Drowning in that pussy, and I’m a soul survivor
Vodka, hunned flavors, GT watermelon
She always do me favors, and I don’t never tell her
GT yellow mango, I love to drink juice
Owe her 100 favors, I call her my 100 proof
Man I heard about an angel

Prices with the life, rollin on them dice
Spent a mill on a flight
Flew back and she bounced back

You was a college student abusing the credit union
The music was way too loud, the tuition was fuckin stupid
And me I was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' Buick
Confusing, you like my style even though I was broke and doing
Stick em ups, you wanna pick em up
Inside your Civic Plus the difference was
I wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us
And I missed the crush that we had every time winter December come
And we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, end up shootin' himself
And the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself
And I'm losing now too looking at you boo hoo from what's dealt
So as I reminisce the coupon that we used to split at Baileys
On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
You say K. Dot your page got that pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day you'll reap what you sow, now I reap for us both
That's one hunnid

Now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka
And all I ever see is your face

I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
I'm so hip to it tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And yea, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (Mm) we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seas that's inside this wall

Come to me
Come, come to me
Look at what you've done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me

Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience
Only cause you are timeless

And this chemistry is infinity at a million

I see thermometers boil as you lay in the desert
Of eternal fire hate ya then deny yourself of a blessin'
Meanwhile I'm on a new cloud chunking the deuce uh
Renewed vows with sinners, homies, enemies too uh
Gold towel under my feet clicking the fluke
With a thousand troops, Crip and Piru, nigga, woop, woop uh
Love I depend on, white dubs I depend on
They flying through this endzone that meant on to vent on

I keep my distance, homie, I am on a higher pulprit
You cannot visit, homie
I mean the beauty of heaven is far for me not to exit
It's like an anti-depressant, you see the vision, homie?
I mean this godly advice, fucking right
Even if you pinch me twice, yes I, keep dreaming

And loads of clouds beneath my wings and in the skies

Within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and, real talk, and

This is why they fuck with me
Real talk nigga, believe it
This is why they fuck with me
Do what I do, y'know?
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hol' up
Where you from? (I don't bang)
Where you stay? (Westside) that's a piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but

This is why they fuck with me
I told you, nigga
This is why they fuck with me
You fake, nigga
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
'Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, y'know?

You tellin' me the kush make you think on level 4?
I'm on 5. You sayin' that I can level more?
In high school my teachers thought I was smokin' stress

Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote

40 nights - off the chain like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I'm talkin' bout
You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me like my son's about to win
Somehow some day and I don't care when
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale, like an atheist

Uhh, I'll take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
That's my nigga he a street nigga
Probably in your hood fuckin' up your street, nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you
I didn't listen
I was floatin' like the Rose Parade, swear to god a nigga seem some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fuckin' monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this motherfucker ponders
Just underline every letter capital K-D-O-T layin' it flat out
Like a tire with slow leaks now what you bout?
Nothing huh
Am I a square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt?
Yeah

So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts – brace
Hope it ain't, ""Here we go, yo""
‘Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario
Though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate

First, ""No (slurp) you don't (slurp) under (slurp) stand (slurp)

Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fucking feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fucking eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day."" Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fucking with me
You cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killing him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talking cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing, ""I hope she's good enough""
Meanwhile you're chasing her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the…

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasing me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding
But just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fucking brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt
Hit a fucking tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried this stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state, in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's laying next to me in bed
Directly aiming a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like
""Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checking into rehab.""
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fucking dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, ""Hit the road"" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text
I said, ""Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident""
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling, ""Rape!""
'Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of, (*Message sound*)
""Wait, dinner at eight?""
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of

Then jump back in that mini van, double back to his block

I'm a back em down like Shaq with this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam, like a radio single, man
Police radio signals sayin' that a 187 land on your corner,
Coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead,
The next morning high toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumpin' on enemies I'm head hunting
No sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something
Protect ya neck cause they comin' for set respects split your onion
Then chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics
Cause ignorance is bliss

This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off
We all tryna ball and when I got the rock I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol whip you posers till ya'll pissed off
Then peel off, in a hooptie
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably I'm too street
Indubitably I'm a do me
Better than your bitch would
But you niggas too weak, but just give me 2 weeks
And I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
Cats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently you a parrot
Mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves, that ignorance is bliss

And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hit so hard
I'm so-Cal, you so called
Rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters to shoot busters I'm Casper when I go off
I show up, to show out to show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
I remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down boggins
Backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin
You gon' tip her

I never felt the feeling of euphoria
Pain forever, prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
Wake up in the morning and I gotta win
Not taking the victory, that’s my only sin
And so I send a message to your messenger
A warning shot to let em know I’m serious
I’m ready for a war
When I roar it can break a glass window
The only thing for sure is the perfect way
To bend you on your back
Even if I gotta slither through the cracks
I can crack every code you deliver I attack
Every hole with a bomb squad sittin’ on the tripod
Even if he try hard, he can still die hard
Run but you can’t hide
White flags, you can pull ‘em out fast
And tell me your last goodbye

I will, I will, climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I gotta lose? What I gotta prove?
I guess, war is my love

Make sure your next move is slick
Your best move is nothing
You know I take risk, dark clouds, I love it
Cause I can hide in the mist
Hop out and crushin’ every soldier you’re with
So I’m 6 for 6
I’m sick with determination, I’ll terminate ya quick
I lead the pack, I follow no rules, I see the traps
I know you’re close to fallin’ on your face
Unload, reload, hand me another case
Explode, explode
The fire of my eyes
Is waiting on your demise
I know you hope your help is close by

Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular

Let the smoke burn
Lets the smoke burn in your vein
When it’s your turn hit it twice then say my name
Say my name say my name

Dark chocolate vanilla
I tell you this is Candy Land
This is candid camera there’s no pauses allowed
They don’t understand us because we wont turn it down
Middle fingers in the air
This is truth and double dare

Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling

And we'll be screamin' out no rules, no rules
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you
My vision of the unsocial, it's so cool
Look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the game
How I see it this is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to
I refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya
Out your power position, my army head-on collision
Can't harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
Every time that I zone in, nothing is more convincin'
Than tellin' you that I won't bend, break or fake partition
I can't, this is my life design, this is me taking minds
This is what I live for, this is me takin' yours
This is more than C4, this is what happens when
We ready to build and destroy, I hope that you enjoy

It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling

I live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld, undertakers won't catch me
System ain't no system for justice if you would ask me
I'll tell you everything is corrupted, don't you walk past me
With the condescended look I can tell you're pretendin'
Like you my friends and you just a henchman, I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it I'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
Trespass on your property I am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy
This is me changing faces
'Cause I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The victory of fight is all in my eyes
The night is young and I can see your demise, I'm waitin' for it
You can’t ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell you feel defeated
The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce?

Kendrick Lamar,"I woke up this morning, I had a boner
I went to sleep last night with no bitch, nigga, I was a loner
I be going through shit, losin' bitches and homies
If I don't make it with this rap shit, nigga, I might be homeless
My moms don't got a job, my pop's checks ain't enough
If ain't bringin' home that money, my whole family is fucked
I swear I move like the mob, I'm watchin' movies too much
If niggas wanted you dead, what would you suggest?
They wonder why I do drugs and hang with thugs
Since I made it the city hated, wait, where is the love?
I ride around with my gun, this is not for fun
I stay protected cause my homie just took one to the lung
Had him on life support, where's the family support?
He knew who shot him, but he ain't even show up in court
Yeah, that's a real G, nigga, he on a kill spree, nigga
The homie popped him so I hope he don't kill me, nigga

With a bitch that's irritatin' from all these questions she askin'
Like what bitches I fucked, when, how and where
You ain't my main bitch so why the fuck do you care
That's why bitches get fucked, then turn around and get left
Somebody need to teach them less talk, more sex
I'm pressed when I'm stressed, my granny tell me I'm blessed
Well, why the fuck do Jesus Christ got me goin' through this shit?
Everybody need favors, what happens if I go broke?
Or say I ain't got it, then buy my lolo some new spokes
Right up in your fake setup, fuck you up like some mace
So fuck your handout, give a young nigga some space
Give a nigga some Ace, give me a blunt that's laced
Sprinkle some molly in it, watch me take this shit to my face
The snitch is the shooter, they took time away from his case
Holy shit, oh lawd, where is the world today?

I walk inside of a buildin', tell the A&R nigga strip
Tell 'em I need all of my chips, my life been known Section 8
I've been a welfare case, AFDC pump fake
Meanwhile I'm grindin' cause drug money ain't like rap money
Four white kilo snow bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up, I got a bad call, they killed Braze
They killed Chad my big homie Pup
Puppy eyes in my face, bruh, and I've really been drinkin'
Why the fuck I've really been smokin'?
What the fuck, I'm the sober one
When I'm so stressed out I can't focus
Hideout when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
Speed past in the Cutlass-me and little Ocho
And we young nigga hop out
2 tears in a bucket, I feel like fuck it
That's the price of fame, recognize my pain, that's all I know
All alone, but I'm out here though

Kendrick Lamar,"If you leave this time I feel that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and
He said he'll be back with that same
Song that you just said you'll stay forever with

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
It's safe to say you're the only reason for it

I've been bleeding in your silence
I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God
He must be mad with me, it's coming
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do

So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it
And I poke and I poke and I poked at it
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more, some more
And in my notepad, man I wrote and I wrote
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last
I'mma hope, I'mma hope so the iceberg don't float
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit
It'd be grand, it's ten grammies or my granite still standing
With a note, a note that read ""granted, don't you panic""
When you make mistakes the most, the most
One day it'll make you grow, you grow
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God you shall consult, consult
When the bright cameras are still cramming
In your face and it provoke, provoke
You to act manic, just stay planted
'Cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just know, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, what the fuck would you do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when doves cry do you hear 'em love? (Do you hear 'em love)
Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live even when we mustard the gift
When it gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me
Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling

Kendrick Lamar,"I can see the darkness in me and its quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and you'll find
Curiosity, animosity, high philosophy like the prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder yah
Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this fear and then embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations don't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now
Tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing songs and I can unite with you that I love, you that I like
Look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the instillation
This that consciousness sharpening and fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you gon' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones
This that life beyond your own life, this say this go for mankind
This that outer-body experience, no coincidence you been died
You are dead

Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no",Never Catch Me,2014

To driving some of the hottest cars LA has ever seen
People been telling me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though I've been this way since 17
Tryna get finances poppin', man I thought that was the object
To some of my niggas lost they life and then that goes the team
My only dream was holding us down like fuck who tryna stop us
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm young and black
Killing them softly, don't ever call me fortunate
You don't know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me homie
We ain't even talking fuck that energy, fuck up off me

I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin
How come my attitude piped down?
I'm fuckin' with Ice now
I'm fucking with shit you can only get on an oversea flight now
You scare of my heist now
But still I got enemies giving me energy I wanna fight now
Subliminally sent to me all of this hate
I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up
I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video?
But really no clue you idiot
I just can't help myself
Even when that record spin
Every now and then you hang yourself
Cause I got that green and gold, with a million sold
Like 19 more, from a dollar fit
But without all the diamonds though

That's when I realized, banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga this is life in my aquarium
(Don't get it fucked up)

Been away from home
Been away from home
All night long

Where you from? Where you from?

Hotboxin' rentals in front of Centennial
Remedial thoughts, never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin' shit

To dishraggin' bitches that was hard to fuck

Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called, they said, ""The enemies done cliqued up""
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, ""What it do?""

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera back at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said ""it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game""

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting
A continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one",Hood Politics,2015
Kendrick Lamar,"How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
Twenty on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend 'em a ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
Twenty on six, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion
Asked me for ten grand
Stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, beat it
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, my son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car and tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened to Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin'
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin'
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal
'Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
You looked at me and said, your potential is bittersweet
I looked at him and said, every nickel is mines to keep
He looked at me and said, know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God

I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs",How Much a Dollar Cost,2015
Kendrick Lamar,"What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Who ever thought?
Master take the chains off me

Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down

And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down

And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse

You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all share bars, like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell

I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' ""Compton""
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina

We don't share the same synonym fall back

Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home

We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

I know everything, I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's Ornery
I know everything, the highs the lows the groupies the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit
The day I came home

We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin'
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are
I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick go catch a flight or two
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially
To come back home

This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere

Tell me something got me losing my mind, AH!
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway

I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is",Momma,2015

When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:

You think she gon’ stick around if them twenty-five years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it’s mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say

As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you ridin' with me nigga

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analyzing, that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy’s Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex?
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit
Pause, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y’all, it’s respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it’s Michael Jackson, oh

Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message

And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mines
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga

Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call another nigga but, it ain’t really a poem,
I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you,
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa
About a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground
What you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent?

The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
That’s how I see it, my word is bond.
I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people,
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetizing,
You know what I’m saying, wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor and hungry
You know what I’m saying it’s gonna be like
There might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich

Aight so let me ask you this then,
Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
Or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?

I see myself as a natural born hustler,
A true hustler in every sense of the word, I took nothin’
I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody manage me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years
You know what I’m saying I made myself a millionaire
I made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself,
You know what I’m saying
I made millions for the record companies,
I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us

And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

By my faith in God, by my faith in the game,
And by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true
You know what I’m saying, and it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I’m saying, I was noticing,
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it’s no problem, you know I mean it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know
I’m finna go straight through

Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart
Or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

I like to think that at every opportunity
I've ever been threatened with resistance it’s been met with resistance
And not only me but it goes down my family tree
You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back

Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like,
We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win and I wanna lay it all down

In this country a black man only have like five years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that’s right now while you a teenager
While you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights,
While you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn thirty it’s like they take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man in this country
And you don’t wanna fight no more
And if you don’t believe me you can look around,
You don’t see no loud mouth thirty-year old muthafuckas

That’s crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind
I can truly tell you that there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on
So I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?

I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it’s a riot there’s gonna be bloodshed for real
I don’t think America can know that
I think American think we was just playing and it’s gonna be some more playing
But it ain’t gonna be no playing
It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying,
It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen

That’s crazy man. In my opinion only hope that we kinda have left
Is music and vibrations
Lotta people don’t understand how important it is
Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic
And I don’t know what type of energy I’mma push out,
Or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes

Because the spirits, we ain’t really rappin’
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us

Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It’s actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world
It says

""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots
Such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same""

What’s your perspective on that?

Kendrick Lamar,"I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

If these walls could talk

Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to forget it
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them
I’d rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room",These Walls,2015
Kendrick Lamar,"Loving you is complicated

I place blame when you still
Place shame when you steal
Feel like you ain't shit
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself
Breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special
What can I blame him for
Nigga I can name several
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager where's your patience
Where was your antennas
Where was the influence you speak of
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it

I swear loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof
I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me
Yes I hate you too

!Disculpe!

Are you the reason why mama and them leavin'
No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend
Little brother, you promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven
You even faced time instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover, well
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say ""you fuckin' failed""
You ain't try

I know your secrets nigga
Mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga
And if this bottle could talk I cry myself to sleep
Bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you I'm bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say ""you gotta go""
And if I told your secrets
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness",u,2015

Hello I would like to tell you about my love affair
With my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other
And find out about each other
We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building
And he would help me with things and I would see him and think ""what a cute guy""
And he was a cute guy
And it was just little by little we got to know
Just to say hello
One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him
People respected him, and he was good to everybody
He knew people he worked with all adored him
And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody
For me was the most important
Being attracted to him and being, finding people respected him and I respected him
I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were
And I learned to understand and respect
And see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time
So it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together
And our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other
And the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other
After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding
With just family and very close friends
The friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys
And, my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys
And I feel I just gave him a wonderful life
A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too
And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other","God Is Fair, Sexy, Nasty",2016

Kendrick Lamar,"Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby

I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our believe's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, they paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""he's alive""
Backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
""What have you did for me""
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly 'fore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tied for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church

Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go

Just take it all back before the light switch",untitled 01 | 08.19.2014.,2016

Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And this I know

I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular I'm drunk
How can I make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' sobriety
Fuckin' up the system I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the end of Section Park
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain
I'm gone

Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle

Lit off henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loop holes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king

The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is father time
I fall behind my skeleton they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligence, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tape worm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple drinkers they seein me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleep walkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or is this just a mirage or a facade

Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If yan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces

And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad

Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies
Somebody yell ""Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy""
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said ""nigga you fucked up""
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I paid my way through, praying to Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town

In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad

Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?

""Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?

I would like to help you find it""

Just to remind you sweetheart that my—

Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts
Children listen, it gets deep
See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable, gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and joking made life easier
Hard times, momma on crack
A four-year-old telling his nanny he needed her
His family history pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman workin' for his big homie
Small time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten thousand dollars out of a project housing
That's on the daily, seen his first mil twenty years old
Had a couple of babies, had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun
They assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back
And they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parkin' lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrasing the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed them off and walked back
To the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son hoping that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine to five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects
Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives telling us, selling us devilish works
Killing us crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with nines
Ducky was well aware, they robbed the manager
And shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him, in fact it look like
They're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time, reverse the manifest
And good karma and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers
And put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can
Make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later them same strangers
You make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reaping their benefits
Then you start reminding them 'bout that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper
Would be from coincidence
Because if Anthony killed Ducky
Top Dawg could be servin' life

Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you

Wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club, or your mama house
Whatever you doin' just make it count
I need some water
Wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touchin' yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heart beat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?

Ooh, I don't want more than that

I promise just a touch

I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings I did, what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money, call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and the feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs
Stuck in our ways, lust

Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately my lust been hiding (Lately)
Lately, it’s all contradiction
Lately I’m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb

Cold as December, but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point, nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service

When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor somebody that's holdin' my checks?
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out
And just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal
If my reputation would miss me
What they see from me
Would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings
With me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap

Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we

Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the earth
Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities

Until you come back to these commandments
We're gonna be in this place, we're gonna be under this curse
Because he said he's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites according to the Bible
The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities
For our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods
That aren't his son, so the Lord thy God chasten you
So just like you'll chasten your own son
He's gonna chasten you because he loves you
So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments
And do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us

Look at the crowd, they (nah, I don't like that)
Look at my smile, I'm smirking

They say it has magic powers, even Magic ain’t die
Wake you up out ya sleep to take a 3 a.m. car ride
He said the booty the only thing between him and God
They love the booty, sacrifice they family and job
Badge make police feel powerful in the hood
Guns make us feel powerful but they don’t do no good

I got it from my God
He said a good shephard don’t trip over what they heard
Let em talk the talk until the night you choose to go and purge
I came up when the rest of you struggled and failed to flourish
Conversations with florist
She said I'm good as herbs
Get em high, get em high from the hood to the suburbs
No one can take your power even if a storm occurred
It ain't man made, but whether or not you paid don’t help or hurt
It's a perk
Jamla Squad written on my shirt
I got a lane but all the lines around me dotted I can merge
I can do what you can but you can't do the same with words
As I, now watch my street cred go multiply
They say the streets respect a real one
No one’s as real as I
It's just me and young blood this where I get all of my power
The night I got a chain from Mr. Flowers
I gave it back when I got done rappin’ the same hour
I ain't Five Percent, ‘less we talkin the top emcees
And I'm in the top of that the rest beneath me all cowards
When I spit, look around, it’s meteor showers
I watch the stars fall, fall, fall, see this what you call Power

Let's talk about your and ours that paid the allowance
Let's talk about hundred-thousand kids ravin’ and bouncin
Cravin’ and drownin in words the day I pronounced it
Let's talk about Power
Let's talk about do'ers and dont'ers
The house I built when I was homeless and sleepin' in corners
Sharin’ Coronas and black and milds
Donuts in el caminos
Talkin’ loud, Scrappin’ corners
Residue every mornin’
Talk about legacy
Let's talk about the life of celebrity
Verses integrity
Curse the first one that thirst for necessity
Searching for equity
Verses the earth that birthed us indefinitely
Verse the verse I wrote in jeopardy
Surfin’ the laws of the universe and destiny
Church and a God is the only thing that’s ever been ‘head of me

Ashes I'm dumping out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas

Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace

What do you stand for?
Are you an activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you an accident, are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradicting what your body language say
Are you a king or you joking, are you a king or you posing?
Are you a king or you smoking bud rocks to keep you open?

Shoutout my hustlers, I mean
Everybody hustlers
You feel me
Look, look

I said, wake up, open up shop, get your hustle on
Selling pills straight out her crib, and break into another home
Tryna get in and out, get my double-double on
This ain't my story that I'm singing my nigga, but this is another song
This probably your uncle song
Probably your big brother song
Your father or your mother song
I understand your circumstance so in your head there's nothing wrong
How you could blame how you behave?
If we paid and we ain't getting loans
You don't know what's going on
If you ain't live to see this shit I can't describe
Taking chances so they survive
This all happens just to take a life
In the end it was all for bread
And use the heat just to make it rise
Not sure how to raise a daughter
But they know to raise the price, so what you goin' through
Tell a nigga what you going through
I could probably relate
I could probably be late
And still be on time for you
I could probably spit mind for ya
If you don't wanna tell your story
It's the same as yours, I hustle early in the morning

I said, wake up, open up shop, get your hustle on
Selling pills straight out her crib, and break into another home
I understand your circumstance, so in their heads, there's nothing wrong
But they don't know what's going on
They don't know what's going on

Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
If I can't lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely

Yeah you got your car, yeah you got your gold
Your money don't fold but your mama is at home
Fam don't want your dirty money
You look clean, but your mother sad
Your girl felt neglected, now your daughter got another dad
Local block hustler, my father was a customer
Mom's used to watch him buy his weed then she would cuss at him
Only for the weed, he felt free from that subtle bust
Moved back and it was primetime
And now I'm on my prime time
But hustler turned pimp, doe
He was getting pimp dough
Now only selling his dope
But now he selling nympho's
Not so cautious about how he sells
Made his way to county jails
Now he lonely in them cells
How he feel
It was probably hell
He got out, but on that same shit
I guess when you lawyer to yourself then you can't switch
But how can you blame kid
Don't know what he was goin' through
Cause hustle is his bread and butter
He don't want any other fool

But I wake up, open up shop, get my hustle on
Wake up early in the morn'
Make a couple records, getting reckless on these records
Til' these fuck niggas respect it
Go and get it, make a difference
Wake up with a new perspective, motherfucker

Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
If I can't lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely

Justify the love of mine
For life of crime, my life and times
Is hard at times
I fall a time, like all the time
And then I dream for baller time
And then the clock rewind, and I
Wake up
I know homie
I know homie

Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
If I can't lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta bring out with the streets I feel lonely

For life of crime, my life and times
Is hard at times
I fall a time, like all the time
And then I dream for baller time
And then the clock rewind, and I

We ain't chose this type of living, it's what we gotta do

This is anti and temptation
This a real nigga celebration
This a don blonde declaration
Fifty-Ninth and Fifth Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the seperation

Blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
Before I run up in your bank just for recreation

The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin', dedication
It's dedication, look

I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies 301, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life staring at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss, shit don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said you do a song with Nip, K. Dot he a better Crip
I said he a man first, you hear the words out his lips?
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?
Level four, y'all live and give in to false imprisonment
Listen close my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours my nigga
Since elementary we close my nigga
You're straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Ams
I'm at the premiere politicking with Top, Nip, and Snoop, damn
Pac watchin' the way we grove, dedication

If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look what Nipsey? (Hol' up)

Look, this ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals, I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to their amazement
I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be stay safe, now it's stay dangerous
'Cause ain't no point in playing defense nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end nigga
Without a life jacket
Couple mil, tour the world, dogg my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heights backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

The sacrifice it takes just to pull something from the land

Our whole town lined the streets
Waitin' on the big parade
From the curb in their lawn chair seats
And one old man always the first to stand
And snap a sharp salute
And one by one the crowd around
Would rise and follow suit

For the streamers flew like eagles
And the battle banners waved
For all the ones who fought and died
To see Old Glory raised
To each and every hero
Who has ever come and gone
The flags of our fathers carry on
The flags of our fathers carry on

Marching bands and the motorcades
Paper flowers and the floats
The beauty queens and their pageant waves

Was that one old man always the first to stand
With his hand across his heart
And how his eyes welled up with pride
When he saw the color guard

As the streamers flew like eagles
And the battle banners waved
For all the ones who fought and died
To see Old Glory raised
To each and every hero
Who has ever come and gone

Told his family he?s gonna go fight for his land

Mama lost her little boy, but a country gained a hero

The desert air hit him square in the face, and boy you were right
Somewhere in between the fight he finally new what it meant to be alive
He was just 3 years shy of 21, and they gave that boy a gun

Yeah, well, some say a hero is born to be brave
But I?m here to tell you that a hero is a scared man that don?t walk away

And she says, ?Son, I know you had to go?

They scarfaced my race  some support hate 
Lifes a court date  some die to escape so hold your weight 
You niggas brag too much  fuck wit us we bag you up 
And use the same clique that you thought would back you up 
It's nine eight eliminate bait and open gates 
Enough with chains and whips lets make brains eclipse 
We all claim we rich, hold thugs in crypts 
Forgot about the seeds growing up seven to six 
Fuck a Benz wit tints I got the razor prints 
Y'all rappers love idols there it is I'm convinced 
Burn my contract, mental combat 
And stomp your battle rap wit a Vietnam track

With your three degrees forty below nothin but recipes 
Tight jeans, hype and don't know what nuthin means

And the big apple it ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled she's a queen 
From out of town wagging her swing 
All around with she glasses and women asses is what made men jack asses 
Everything including your company jacket 
And niggas asses for your ransom 
And next thing you know they got a nigga dancin 
Chancin him out of his advancements 
And how y'all gonna pay back these back taxes? 
This ain't healthy for your assets 
It's like your face done been bashed in your career ain't happning 
After the monkey wrenches and forks done been stabbed in 

Intruiging to the ear but bitter to the heart

Starring the Wu-Tang swordsmen 
Raindrops fall the block remains hot 
Steam rises from the street which forms the clouds that I move through 
Renew my stainless sword style

Another target on your market style is garbage 
You get bombarded whole clique slapped retarded 
Pussy harded mcs bleed slugs to the body

If it wasn't for the way that we live
Too many single mothers raisin' our kids
Too many brothers caged in the Pen
Engagin' a bid, enslaved by the pigs

If it wasn't for crooked cops that pop shots grazin' our wig
That sends slugs reckless, plus these thugs with a death wish
That take your life for the ice that flood in your necklace
The blood of the helpless and innocent (and innocent)

If it wasn't for so-called friends that turned Benedict
Snakes in the grass and crabs in the lake
'Cause I'm black and its late, getting' harassed by the Jake
Blasted with eight times five, plus one

Lethal deposit, reach for your wallet, they bust guns
That's why I trust none and I keep to myself
I can't blame cats that pack heat in they belt
And quick to clap, never givin' in

If it wasn't for this and that
It'd be a better world that we livin' in

[Hook: x 2]

[Asheru]
If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
Nowadays you can't live that way
The markets way too unstable, there's too many pimp labels
Playing rappers like a ho, manhandlin' the dough

Demandin' them to go on a track to bring the loot back
Now you playing for the team and the captain, that's cream
You got the dream to push a mean two-seater
With a diva riding shotgun, just to say you got one

You make the songs, but labels only want the hot ones
Send you back to the drawing board, until you got some
Now I guess we got problems
Even your all-creative mind ain't enough to try and solve 'em

The doors revolvin', younger cats are starvin'
They want it more than you, might go to war with you
To reap the heap of dough that's at the end of the rainbow
You can't be mad, man, that's how the game go

[Talib Kweli]

(yeah, see'mon!)
(yea, here we go, yeah!)

I'm about to show you what this black power is
Red, black, and green on the wrist how I live
In the cold world where we bust off the black llamas
Every winter where we lose more son to black mommas

If hip-hop got seasons, right now its spring
Like when everybody selling death, ""kiss the ring"" (yeah!)
You know how it goes, people change color like autumn
Kids learn through experience, fuck what a teacher taught 'em

Puff a relief for boredom; rough will release a quarter
And the parents who paid enough attention to at least ignore 'em
Blowing up mics, throwin' up signs
To help niggaz you confusin' it with cryin'

The winners write the history books
Mystery looks past prisoners of war, that's what my listeners are for
Turn the tide on this fuckery, ride on this fuckery
You should a never let me in the industry, you're stuck with me

The two of us used hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight that his whole life just changed
I know when his mom and his dad broke up it didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk and he gambled away the rent
Pretty soon Vic was seeing red, pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
Then he'd do it all again
The whole time smiling on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside all he was trying to do was get away

Yo, funny how things change color
Then fade to another shade, when you had it made
It was all good, but now look, just another day
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one, two, three
Lights out, which way to turn
Can't get a grip, all alone in a big white house
Every day gets worse and you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left, now you suffer
Should've thought of that one first
No family, no kids, can't accept what you did, now you wanna
Run away but you can't cause the past comes back again

Slippin' through the cracks, sip a little Jack
Go to bed half dead
What about a rent? Why does every cent gotta be a bet
When's it gonna end
Oh my God, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Outta debt, outta dodge, out of breath, out of this big problem
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
In a better place in his brain
But the medication he takes makes him wasted
So sick if he's gonna think the good Lord would come to take him

I'm going at it the hard way

Get everything inside out of my brain that claims
I'm going at it the hard way

Come with me
Let me walk you through the world that I currently live in

Understated the power of politic
Wish we could rewind all the rhetoric

While the fools rule in praise
The globe has warmer days
I lift my fist to find the solace
Fight twisted tongues with stardust
And hope that love will save us

Donc moi et ma bande on met a l'amende on vient clasher la France
Ils comprennent pas oukoi
On les fait flipper comme un braquage
Les flics me collent à la peau comme un tatouage
Je représente les gars de la rue
L égalité je n'y crois pas comme un suicide en garde a vue
C'est pour les bon et mauvais garçons la main dans le caleçon

Change de pute comme de voiture de location
De Paris a Marseille du shit dans les baskets

Qui veut me couper les vivres alors que j'ai rien vu de la vie
Qui veut m'empêcher de faire du cash et mettre bien la famille
Tu sais se que je pense a mon âge on est tous barge

Les jaloux parlent comme leur mères dans les cuisines
Faudrait leur mettre du scotch sur la bouche a ces Miskine
Je leur souhaite même un longue vie qu'on se retrouve le vendredi
Devant la course divine qu'on l'élimine
J'ai voulu faire un lâcher de colombes
J'en trouvais pas alors j'ai pris des pigeons que j'ai repeins a la bombe
Le commercial ou le bon
La bouteille pleine ou le fond
C Alonz ca bégaye pas un daron
Ça veut des ronds et pas de chèques car je meurs demain
Je crache pas le venin
Car la musique m'a soulevé en cours pour le matin
Mon parcours appartient au passé
Mon discours terre a terre amour appartient au quartier
Ne crois pas tellement (?) l' Afrique 
Qui se sont enfoncé deux doigts dans la gorge depuis que j'entends chanté leur rejets
É oué ils ont construits des paranoïaques dépressifs sans résine qui ne savent pas aimer
Soigne le chagrin a l'aspirine c'est l'époque
Non non t'a pas rêvé tu as bien entendu chanté lé coq papé

Qui veut me couper les vivres alors que j'ai rien vu de la vie
Qui veut m'empêcher de faire du cash et mettre bien la famille

Qui veut me couper les vivres alors que j'ai rien vu de la vie
Qui veut m'empêcher de faire du cash et mettre bien la famille
Tu sais se que je pense a mon âge on est tous barge
On veut tout ce qu'on a pas pour ensuite prendre le large

J'ai des coudes planté dans le dos
Le quartier mon bras droit parle pas marche droit comme un rail de coke
Fils posé sur le ciment les doigts plein de Glock
Les journées sont longues 
La night est hallucinante
On tient les murs potos putin c'est nul
Alors on fait des tunes en manque de sexe on se tient les burnes
Pendant que nos mère sont aux arrêt de buis en tchador

Kennedy Brothers,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1998
Kennedy Brothers,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1998
Kennedy Rose,"Some say it's just the nature of the beast
When you love somebody so passionately
Time has a way of stealing
That raging fire feeling
Leaving the ashes laying at your feet

Those fools of little faith will never know
That higher place two hearts can go
Where time is standing still
And love will burn until
The heavens and the earth have come and gone

This fire inside for you is constant as the northern star
And you will be forever in my heart
As long as there's a river searching for an endless sea
I will always love you
Faithfully

Tonight we'll raise a glass to lovers
Across the ages
We'll hold each other
And toast to the day
When history's said and done
And we still stand as one
Some things were never meant to fade away

This fire inside for you is constant as the northern star",Faithful,1989
Kennedy Rose,"A king would trade his finest crown for love, love like this
And warriors have laid weapons down for love, love like this
Hearts will break a thousand time for love, love like this
And arms will wait a thousand nights for love, love like this

Love may come and love may go
But here inside your arms I know
That only you will ever show  me
Love like this

You and I have finally found love, love like this
A place to lay our burdens down love, love like this
Hearts to speak without out a sound love, love like this
What makes the world keep turning round is love, love like this

Love may come and love may go
But here inside your arms I know
That only you will ever show  me

Making love in the green grass

A healthy, grown-up, busy-busy bee
Whiling away all the passing hours
Pinching all the pollen from the cauliflowers
I'd like to be a busy little bee
Being as busy as a bee can be
Flying around the garden, brightest ever seen
Taking back the honey to the dear old queen

Bzz-bzz-bzz-bzz, honey bee, honey bee
Bzz if you like but don't sting me

Toying with the tulips, tasting every type
Building up the honey-comb that looks like tripe

Being just as busy as a bee can be
Flying all around in the wild hedgerows
Stinging all the cows upon the parson's nose
Oh, what a wonderful thing to be

Visiting the picnics, quite a little tease
Raising little lumps on the maiden's knees

Whooppee, o death, where is thy sting?

To be a good bee one must contrive
For bees in a beehive must behave

But when bees die, you really should see 'em
Pinned on a card in a dirty museum

Gives us children, makes us wine
Tells us what to take or leave behind

Are the stories to be told
Of the feelings more precious than gold

Pray for you
And when another day is through

Kenneth Carten,"Lord Elderley, Lrd Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
With every virtue, every grace,
Ah what avails the sceptred race,
Here you see-the four of us,
And there are so many more of us
Eldest sons that must succeed.
We know how Caesar conquered Gaul
And how to whack a cricket ball;
Apart from this, our education lacks co-ordination.
Though we're young and tentative
And rather rip-representative,
Scions of a noble breed,
We are the products of those homes serene and stately
Which only lately
Seem to have run to seed!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
How beautiful they stand,
To prove the upper classes
Have still the upper hand;
Though the fact that they have to be rebuilt
And frequently mortgaged to the hilt
Is inclined to take the gilt
Off the gingerbread,
And certainly damps the fun
Of the eldest son-
But still we won't be beaten,
We'll scrimp and scrape and save,
The playing fields of Eton
Have made us frightfully brave-
And though if the Van Dycks have to go
And we pawn the Bechstein Grand,
We'll stand
By the Stately Homes of England.
 
Here you see
The pick of us,
You may be heartily sick of us,
Still with sense
We're all imbued.
Our homes command extensive views
And with assistance from the Jews
We have been able to dispose of
Rows and rows and rows of
Gainsboroughs and Lawrences,
Some sporting prints of Aunt Florence's,
Some of which were rather rude.
Although we sometimes flaunt our family conventions,
Our good intentions
Mustn't be misconstrued.
 
The Stately Homes of England
We proudly represent,
We only keep them up for
Americans to rent,
Though the pipes that supply the bathroom burst
And the lavatory makes you fear the worst,
It was used by Charles the First
Quite informally,
And later by George the Fourth
On a journey north.
The State Apartments keep their
Historical renown,
It's wiser not to sleep there
In case they tumble down'
But still if they ever catch on fire
Which, with any luck, they might
We'll fight
For the Stately Homes  of England
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Though rather in the lurch,
Provide a lot of chances
For Psychical Research-
There's the ghost of a crazy younger son
Who murdered, in thirteen fifty-one,
An extremely rowdy Nun
Who resented it,
And people who come to call
Meet her in the hall.
The baby in the guest wing,
Who crouches by the grate,
Was walled up in the west wing
In fourteen twenty-eight.
If anyone spots
The Queen of Scots
In a hand-embroidered shroud
We're proud
Of the Stately Homes of England.
 
Lord Elderley, Lord Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
Behold us in our hours of ease,
Uncertain, coy and hard to please.
Reading in Debrett of us,
This fine Patrician quartette of us,
We can feel extremely proud,
Our ancient lineage we trace
Back to the cradle of the Race
Before those beastly Roman bowmen
Bitched our local Yeomen.
Through the new democracy
May pain the old Aristocarcy
We've not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance what will be- will be.
Our heads will still be
Bloody but quite unbowed!
 
The Stately Homes of England
In valley, dale and glen
Produce a race of charming,
Innocuous young men.
Though our mental equipment may be slight
And we barely distinguish left from right,
We are quite prepared to fight
For our principles,
Though none of us know so far
What they really are.
Our duty to the nation,
It's only fair to state,
Lies not I pro-creation
But what we pro-create;
And so we can cry
With kindling eye
As to married like we go,
What ho!
For the Stately Homes of England!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Although a trifle bleak,
Historically speaking,
Are more or less unique.
We've a cousin who won the Golden Fleece
And a very peculiar fowling-piece
Which was sent to Cromwell's niece,
Who detested it,
And rapidly sent it back
With a dirty crack.
A note we have from Chaucer
Contains a bawdy joke.
We also have a saucer
That Bloody Mary broke.
We've two pairs of tights
King Arthur's Knights
Had completely worn away.
Sing Hey!
For the Stately Homes of England.
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Tho' rather on the blink
Provide a lot of reasons
For what we do and think.
Tho' we freely admit we may be wrong,
Our conviction that we are right is strong
Tho' it may not be for long,
We'll hold on to it
We might as well hold the bat
Till they knock us flat
Our dignity of race may
Retire into its shell
Our Minister of Grace may
Defend us none too well
But still if a child
Becomes too wild
And we're forced to use the rod,
Thank God
For the Stately Homes of England",The Stately Homes of England,1996
Kenneth Cope,"Long before morning without a warning
Annie came calling to little Louisa
Wearing the moonlight but wanting the sunlight
She stood at her bedside and poured out her heart
""Get up and tell mama all that I said
Because I can't move ahead unless I can get a white dress""
Charlotte O'Grady, a dear hearted lady

She seemed nearly eighty years coming and going
One night while she's dreaming
Her mother comes pleading
""Charlotte, I'm needing your help to move on
Now, don't wait for nothing, the moment is today
Take up my name and see that I get a white dress""
Mothers and daughters are shedding a tear
Heaven's rejoicing as Jesus draws near
And it's like this

They're getting their white dress
In Wichita, Kansas, Neddie and Frances 
Bow over breakfast to start out the day
When the voice of the spirit pays them a visit
Says, ""it's time to get with it, there's family to save
Your fathers and mothers are biding their time
They're waiting for you to help them get dressed up in white""
Neddie and Frances are filled with desire

They're searching through records and feeling the fire
And after each day's acquired
It's up to god's mountain where white is applied 
And he in his robe and she in her gown
They're doing their best to turn it around
And they won't rest until all are in white dress

Walking with Jesus in white, wearing their white dress
Walking with Jesus in white, wearing their white dress
Walking with Jesus in white, wearing their white dress
Walking with Jesus in white, wearing their white dress
Before the lord's coming, Elijah's been stirring
And fathers are turning to you and to me",White Dress,1996

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?

In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure a year in the life

How about love? How about love?
How about love? Measure in love
Seasons of love, seasons of love

Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand journeys to plan
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure the life of a women or a man?

In truths that she learned or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned or the way that she died
It's time now to sing out tho' the story never ends
Let's celebrate remember a year in the life of friends

Remember the love, remember the love
Remember the love, measure in love
Measure, measure your life in love
Seasons of love, seasons of love

Oh, shine your light

For me when I'm out in the streets
Ends justify means when you making a meet
When you losing the sleep that you saying you need
But what good is rest when it's family to feed
When it's money to get, when it's dollars to count
Fuck a job, you never raised for larger amounts
Keep the lights on, front door locked
'Cause the villains in the wilderness, lotta George Zimmermans
Damned with some innocence
So that mean he still out on the prowl for a black child
While the judge and jury crack smile, Lord
Keep the lights burning

The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light
For me

For me when I'm out on the creep
Do whatever to get a meal when you barely can eat
I'm determined to fight the power to further the peace
Mama scared the police might make a point out of me
'Cause it's hard to sleep living life in a daze
When kings wanna be niggas, I hope it's a phase
Queens down to be hoes as long as they paid
Chained to our oppressor, unknowing we slaves
Who wants to be saved
When they claim that the prayers that we pray go unheard
In these God-forgotten days, just in case
Keep the lights burning

For me when I barely can smile
And the sun refuse to shine when I'm out in the wild
And the raindrops tap the window pane on my room
Scared I lost faith, pray I find God soon
In a world full of alt-rights I was left field
Black man born poor, I was black steel
Black man born free, this how blessed feel
Because my dreams are dreams, don't make them less real
Nightmares are still the same thing
I've fallen from grace, wishing I had wings
Like a dunk in the Summer but I ain't had Spring
'Cause all that running from trouble'll give you bad knees
Now how can I make a move without a play
I got freedom of speech but with nothing to say
'Cause all that working for something but they barely can pay
What the glimmer of Heaven giving me every day
So I wade in the water
Filled with the sharks, snakes, gators, and piranhas
Till the higher, higher ground of the mountaintop
Away from the shooters that's down for shooting to take a shot
'Cause they believe in everything they ever heard
From the bigots and racists that twisting every word
So, a hotel balcony could be the end
Or a podium speaking to family and friends

So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burning for me
So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burning for me

I got a story to tell, here we go

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way

One night, he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his bubblegoose

Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect caller from Jeff
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""
""Yo, I got bad news""
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the I'll street blues
""The friends will make you, them too can break you
They plan an execution like Fu Manchu""
""Who?""
""You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)""
""Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you""

""Saying what?""
""A million and a half or he won't be back""
""So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp""
""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?
I jumped into my car, there's gotta be a joke
Traffic's backed up, who's in town, the Pope?
S-s-s-s-someone blew the horn, I turned and looked left

On your wig transition?""

But all you screwed mugs got me wearin' black gloves
You up in my face, I see the fear in your eyes
You gonna feel the pain like a grown man gettin' circumcised

But my right hand's on your throat, massaging you to death
You provoke the cycle, call Michael
You're lookin' in the mirror, well, I'm in your window, oh oh
You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple

Now you got your knot wocked with your very own Glock

Kenny Baker,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Kenny Baker,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird,1973
Kenny Baker,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.

Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

Farther along we'll understand why

Kenny Baker,"Once in my youth, I stood on this mountain 
And planted some pines in the sand 
Every day I looked their way 
But just couldn't understand 

Why they never grew like I thought they should do 
I just couldn't understand why 
Now, I've rambled around this wide world through 
And today I just happened by 

Tall pines, tall pines 
Reaching up for the clouds 
Tall pines, tall pines 
I bet you wouldn't know me now

I'll never forget the morning I left 
The hum of the bees in the hay 
The farther I walk, the harder they talk 
How silent it seems here today 

There's an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch 
Surrounding the old family graves 
And there's one gravestone standing all alone 
There waiting to join me in the shade 

Tall pines, tall pines 
Reaching up for the clouds 
Tall pines, tall pines 
I've come home to sleep beneath your boughs",Tall Pines,1991
Kenny Baker,"The wind is blowing 'cross the mountains
And out on the valley way below
It sweeps the grave of my darling
When I die that's where I want to go

Lord, send the angels for my darling
And take her to that home on high
I'll wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die

Our names are carved upon the tombstone
I promised you before you died
Our love will bloom forever, darling
When we rest side by side

I hear a voice out in the darkness
It moans and whispers through the pines
I know it's my sweetheart a calling
I hear her through the walls of time

Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth
But her soul has been called up above

Body and soul, body and soul
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

Her eyes were as blue as the sea
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose

For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven,1998
Kenny Baker,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,1998
Kenny Baker,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish Upon a Star,1998
Kenny Baker,"I had a love and my love was fair
Fair as a summer's dawn
I lost my love, I never knew where
Suddenly she was gone
The west wind's purple meadow
The night she slipped away
And I seem to glimpse her shadow 
When the west wind brushes the day

West wind, can you waken my true love
West wind, can you restore a new love
Speak to her softly of the dream we lost
The theme we lost, the gleam we lost

West wind, can you call back an old love
West wind, can you kindle a cold love
West wind, can the magic of them become out once again
Breathe on the amber
If I try to remember
Then some day at last we 
Can recapture the past",Westwind,2000
Kenny Baker,"The weather is frightening.
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day. 
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter 
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't This a Lovely Day?,2000
Kenny Baker,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",2001
