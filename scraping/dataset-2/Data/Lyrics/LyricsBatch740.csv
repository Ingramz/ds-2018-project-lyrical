Mister Biggs,"In the fog lights
There was tear gas floating through the twilight
And he wondered what life would be like
With a giant screen TV, a fridge full of beer
And a conscience that's clean

See lately
She'd been thinking about her little tiny baby
And the boy who had gone to defend me
She's a good friend of mine
But I can't take the place of her man anytime

And it won't be long till he's coming home

You gotta bring your soldier home
When all those stones have all been thrown
Gotta give, get a chance to get a look at his kid
And hope he can live with whatever he did

Now meanwhile
He was reading magazines on the front line
He was trying not to think about her life
And what he might have done
'Cause it seemed like neither one of them
Were having any fun

See lately
She'd been acting kinda crazy lately
Oh man, I thought she was gonna hate me
'Cause I couldn't watch her little one
I had so much to do, I was so high strung

And it won't be long till daddy's home

You gotta bring your soldier home
When all those stones have all been thrown
You gotta give, get a chance to get a look at his kid
And hope he can live with whatever he did

And lately, all the hate escapes me
And lately all the hate just escapes me lately

So he phoned her
He said, ""Darling, I've been feeling so alone here
Am I making myself perfectly clear
And I'm on my way back just a couple more missions
And I start getting packed""

You gotta bring your soldier home
When all those stones have all been thrown
Gotta give, get a chance to get a look at his kid
And hope he can live with whatever he did

Lately I was wondering if she heard from him lately
Oh, lately I was wondering if she heard from him lately",Lately,2000

Mister Cee,"[Kane]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Attention to the whole crew
Scoob Lover, Scrap Lover, I don't need your dancin
Mister Cee I don't need you on the turntables
Ant Live I don't need you collectin the dough
And Little Daddy since you my brother
get yo' ass on in here
Cause we gettin ready to take things down the line
Here we go one time
Prepare yourself for MC terror
And don't make the error of tryin to come near a
rapper so smooth and swift with the gift of gab
to grab the mic, cause I'm sorta like
Vincent Price, but you never been so nice
So back up off me, I'm seperatin men from mice
Kickin ass in every committee, city to city
Until both shoes are city
The regulator innovator dominator creator of data
Plus an imitator assassinator
Lyrics don't display a too don sweet
Hard as concrete, and always on beat
Steppin to this, you're not allowed
You keep frontin on the stage like you're rockin the crowd
Snatchin the microphone real proud
But your rhymes are so booty you should write em on White Cloud
So next up down the line, Scrap Lover
[Scrap Lover]
Aiy-aiy-yo, the microphone's mine
But I prefer peace, so the road'll get rough when
a toy MC, gets the heart to pull a bluff and
there's no laughter, cause the one that I'm after
is smashed, for that reason you have to
make sure each and every lyric is harmless
Cause if not, you won't be able to calm this
Brother from Brooklyn, made to fit a groove
And prepared for the unexpected, to make a move
So put up your girl, and let's see who's in trouble troop
And if you got a sister, then make it a double scoop
The capital S the see, the are-A-P
stands for me, cause I'm the
only MC with an original rap style
You disagree, you get put on the Scrap pile
So stay off the set, with George and Jet-son
You never seen a dancer who rapped well you met one
Now spin the Wheel of Fortunes or be wise and stay back
Co-host my show, like Pat and don't Sa-jak shit
or get ate like oats and barley
Save your Sweat for Keith, and the Beef for Charlie
So next up, goin down the line, Scoob Lover
[Scoob Lover]
Yo, the microphone's mine
It's the S why'all, to the see why'all, double-O be	 why'all
Well god damn it's me why'all
Jump back, kiss myself, I'm so fly
Sip a brew or two, cause yo, I don't get high
I might wave hi..
.. at a pretty young girl that walk by
But yo, you all that, you can't stop?
A-with the weave in your head like a mop?
You must know karate, cause your face look chopped
Now back to the subject of the matter
I eat a lot of food, but I won't get fatter
Let me see I'm slim, my hair is well trimmed
And when I'm low-key I throw on a brim
But I'm not conceited, when hangin out I need it
For when trouble comes then I never have to meet it
I'm intellectually spoken, I'm not jokin
What are you, smokin?
You be hopin wishin and prayin
to be like Scoob but what are you sayin?
Well it takes style, charisma, class
Fuck up on the Lover, and I bust your ass
So next up, movin down the line
Mister Cee
[Mister Cee]
Yo, the microphone's mine
Mission, to make DJ's feel the wrath
So here's a paragraph, written on behalf
of the ruler, dictator, DJ ambassador
Makin a massacre, you couldn't last through a
round of combat, where my left arm's at
My mouth with the mic in my hand, when I attack
I shake and bake or fake a snake
Take em and make em ache and flake, I break like an earthquake
When I erupt, MC's I corrupt, to be blunt
I'ma tear shit up
So next up goin down the line
The Little Daddy Shane
[Little Daddy Shane]
The mic is all mine
MC's crawl by when they see this tall guy
Six foot three huh, nobody's small fry
The Little D-A double-D why
The S-H-A-N-E, yes it's me
You better believe there's no comp and I'm certain
So if you try to battle me, then it's cur-tains
I'm no joke, the wrong one to provoke
One false move and KERRRRRR-ROAK!
So take it easy and slide on greasy
Cause I'm more rougher than hair when it's peasy
I'm more rougher than steak when it's raw
So keep that in mind, mon cherie amore
Cause I'm a lover you find quite young
And Brooklyn New York, is where I'm from
So keep it on and you don't quit
That supercalafragilisticexpalidopeshit
So next up down the line, Ant Live
[Ant Live]
Yo, the microphone's mine
Yeah I took it, I ain't gonna give it back
And it's a fact that I can swing, I'm not a new jack
Got the mic in a chokehold, you won't hear a peep
Then I put it to sleep
I see a lot of brothers got raisins in the place
Not Al Pacino, I don't need a Scarface
But I know, if some shit goes down
I'll turn the whole New York into Bucktown
A 'Face ain't real Scar'red, cause I real hard
And I ain't no bullshit bodyguard
Walk the streets to New York and stay alive
All I need is my loaded four-five
And sweet and deadly like a killer beehive
And I can stalk in Fort Greene park and survive..
And my name is Ant Live
[Big Daddy Kane]
Now that's what I'm talkin bout
That's EXACTLY what I'm talkin bout
Put your weight on it fellas
Anyway you can get back to work now
Get back to your god damn jobs
And we outta here, love peace and hairgrease",Down The Line,1990
Mister Cee,"Hmm yeah, this sound kinda funky, this sound real funky
I'ma get busy on this, man, with em, let's see
Like 8 bars, then I want you to come in with a scratch

What? nah man, we ain't havin that!
Just trip, I'm tired of every record we do
I got to be jiggin-jiggin this, jiggin-jiggin that
You know what I'm saying? 
Yo, it's time for me to get busy on the mic by myself
On the solo tip, you know what I'm sayin?
So yo, step back and let me show you how a real DJ rocks
As I kick it like this

A DJ gets no damn credit
Don't look at me funny, Kane cause, yeah, I said it
I'm always in the background
Supplyin' the sound, but my props is yet to be found
Besides, when you're kickin' a rap
The only other people you can see is Scoob and Scrap
So y'all get the girls, okay
But I bet you wasn't gettin' skins scratchin' for Shante
And the first time a record skips
You catch an attitude and always tryin' to flip
Now ain't that a bitch
I swear one of these days I'm gonna pull the power switch
Cause I'm always breakin' my neck
10 in the mornin' you were sleepin' on my sound check
And when it's time for the show
I'm supposed to go (Big Daddy) (hell no)
Am I a man or a machine?
Or just a fat kid who don't supposed to be seen?
Don't you know you wouldn't be so amazin'
If I wasn't helpin' you out, you black raisin
And you got the nerve and try to complain
Makin' a record sayin' 'it's hard bein the Kane'
Hmm, but all you gotta do is rap
Try carryin' some console cases on your back
Well, I'm through with breakin' my neck
Until you learn to show your DJ some respect
Because without me you'd be butt-naked
So from now on, spin your own damn records
Now put your weight on that shit here
Yeah
I'm outta here",D.J. S Get No Credit,1991
Mister Cee,"[Mister Cee:]
I be the cruddy one that they call the DJ Mister Cee, 
With the whole Wolf Pack in the place to be. 
Better known as the Chocolate City. 
So Scoob Lover, huh, are ya with me...? 


[Scoob Lover:]
Yo, I break punks up like a fight. Give me the mic, I'm hype. 
(Damn kid, you're starvin' for life) 
'Cause people be tellin' me, brothers be gellin' me, 
Tryin' to get fame from my name but they chumps and they but soft. 
They know I'm wilder than a dog with hot sauce. 
A mic, a stage, a crowd, and I won't stop: 
I set it off and get live like an alarm clock. 
People thought Scoob and Scrap was just a nickname; 
Now that we rap, we sell more records than cocaine. 
Awww, shucks, now I'm back from the down-low, 
Here comes Scoob with the curly afro. 
No chemical reaction, no need for askin', pure satisfaction, 
My last name's Jackson. 
You slip up, I get ill - my boot to your grill, 
My nine kills, I'm Big Scoob from Brownsville. 
The world's greatest lover, the chocolate brother... 

[Chorus:]
Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!)
Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!)
Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!)

Scrap Lover are ya with me? 

[Scrap Lover:]
Yo, I drop science kinda like a pigeon
Over rough tracks I tax any midget with a small digit. 
Smooth and mild but complicated, 
I put the crowd to to smashed like a driver that's intoxicated. 
Rappers write rhymes, and talk about guns and jail, 
But wouldn't squeeze a lemon in a cocktail. 
Don't say ""huh?"" or ""what?"", and don't ask who, 
'Cause if you hear me, I must be talkin' to you. 
You probably thought I couldn't steal it, 'cause I was a dancer, 
I didn't have a chance, but ya'll can kill it. 
You gotta be off your rocker, 
I'm lettin' suckers know that Scrap got more soul than Foot Locker. 
And if you heard I got skills, believe it's true; 
Suggest for Pete Rock, for reminiscin' over you. 
It's not a threat, it's a bet, 'cause hey, 
The last sucker who tried woulda been 25 today. 

[Chorus x3] 

Big Daddy are ya with me? 

[Big Daddy Kane:]
Yo-yo-yo-yo, look out, get out the way! 
Here comes the K the A the N the E - huh, ya better flee. 
'Cause I don't need no hoodie to be hard, shoot: 
I'll kill a nigga in a three-piece suit. 
I don't be havin' it so the rear I'll attack, 
A size-15 to the buttocks, a-matter-fact. 
A hard-core blow to the face I'll provide, 
To give you a Crooked eye, just like St. Ides. 
Leave you home and you must be screamin' and yellin'; 
Not even cool Moe Dee shades can hide your swellin'. 
I bring it rough, tough; 
I said that I was Browner than Bobby, so you know that it's good enough. 
I'm untouchable to rappers my size. 
You dreamed of beatin' me, you better wake up an apologize. 
Some claim to be a Daddy or Poppa, 
But with me, you'd have no Ranks if your name was Shabba. 

[Chorus x3] 

Now you know you'd too like to be with it... 

[Li'l Daddy Shane:]
Shane, I cause pain, I make it rain. 
I'm wearin' and tearin' down to the last grain. 
Ha, I'm not a chocolate brother, but I don't' mourn, 
'Cause I swear this vanilla kid got it goin' on. 
So don't even step to me if you're worth nothin', 
Because I just might hurt somethin'. 
My competition thinks twice, 'cause yo, for a young nigga, I'm kinda nice... 

[Laree Williams:]
Ooohhh! Chocolate City are ya with me?! 
Scoob and Scrap and Mister Cee! Kane and Shane and Lare! 
Kane...would your black ass sing it for me?! 

[Kane:] Ohhh, ho, shit yeah!",Chocolate City,1993
Mister Cee,"Where Brooklyn at?, Where Brooklyn at? 
Where Brooklyn at?, Where Brooklyn at?
We gonna do it like this
Anytime your ready, check it!

I got seven Mac 11's, about eight
38's, nine 9's, ten Mac 10's, the shits never ends
You can't touch my riches, even if you had
MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
That's how I got the weedspot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lamb spread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give mc's the runs drippin'
When I throw my clip in the AK
I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God, I'm droppin shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin' babies at they christening

Motherfucking Biggie Smalls
What you gonna do with it 2Pac?
Yeah where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw your motherfucking middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this

I thank the Lord for my many blessings, though I'm stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nuttin separatin us from a MacK 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, hold up
A straight soldier, bucking at the busters
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me striking down the block, hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I - wanna
And ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug Life motherfucker crime, pays!
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me nigga
Zig zaggin through the freeway, race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law

Mister Day,"Do me wrong, do me right
Tell me lies, but hold me tight
Save your good-byes for the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
 
Say good-bye and say hello
Sure 'nough good to see you
But it's time to go
Don't say yes, but please
Don't say no
I don't want to be lonely tonight
 
Go away then, damn you
Go on and do as you please, yeah
You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees
I'm undecided and your heart's been divided
You've been turning my world upside down
 
Do me wrong, do me right, right now baby

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid

Send back my love

Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super-futureesque style
The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath
From emotional stress
With special effects
And a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly

Mister Hahn,"You know me
I used to get caught up in everyday life
Trying to make it through my day so I could sleep at night
Tried to figure out my way through the maze of rights and wrongs
But like you used to say
Nothing feels like it's really worth it
Forget perfect, I'm trying not to be worthless
Since I last saw you I've been looking for a purpose
Well, I met this kid who thought like I did
He had a weird way of looking at it
This is what he said

Slip out the back before they know you were there
And at the worst you'll see nobody cares
Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down
Even heroes know when to be scared

Now, I don't remember where I met him
Or remember his name
But he walked funny like he was just too big for his frame
Just over five foot but he weighed a buck fifty
And what he said seemed so right it stuck with me
Listen, it's like poker, you can play your best
But you gotta know when to fold your cards and take a rest
And know when to hold your cards, hold your breath
And hope that nobody else is stacking the deck

Because I don't need to tell you that life isn't fair
It doesn't care, it arbitrarily cuts off your air
And like you, I want someone to say it's okay
In the truest part of our hearts everybody's afraid
We're just under-appreciated and overwhelmed
Fighting so hard to hide our fear that we're scaring ourselves
You understand what I'm saying, cause you always did
But it's different in the words of a cowardly kid who said

And I'm no hero
You remember how it was, you know
All I ever did was worry, feeling out of control
To the point where everything was going end over end
I'm spinning around in circles again
This is where you come in
All of this to explain to you why I had to
Separate myself away from yesterday's life
Please remember, this isn't how I hoped it would be
But I had to protect you from me

That's why I
Slipped out the back before you knew I was there
I know you felt unprepared
But every single time I was around I'd just bring you down
And I could tell that it was time to be scared
That's why I
Slipped out the back before you knew I was there
And I know the way I left wasn't fair
I didn't wanna be around just to bring you down
I'm not a hero but don't think I didn't care",Slip Out the Back,2005

(Good), look at her, (good), time out
(Good), I think I'll give the game a try

Hey yo, my rose was good, plus my face was good
The way I wear my jeans up over my boots is hood
And my cash is good, the grass, spread it out, over the hash is good
The grasp who be hypecast is good
That's the bird that fucked the game up
Cut the head off lames and platinum niggas, your boy done came up
Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains
Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings
With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes
You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though
Cause I'm good, she's good, so you should be good
Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood
And we don't love those hoes, with they flat butts caked up
And tipped up toes, need an ill plastic surgeon to fix they nose
Cause they shit is too fat like an Adidas sole
Don't even touch my gold, I'm good

I know you heard it a thousand times
Not quite like my design
You say that's what you looking for
Gator boots walk through the door, now

Goose over ice cubes, pass the O.J.
Two light skinned wizzes, want Ghost, on both ways
Come here, sit on my lap, it's not a gat, sugar
Have a seat, don't be afraid to move back
Feel that? You'se a nasty girl
Big butt, slim gut, I'll crash your world
It's not polite to bend over in Starkey face
Sheer lace, fat ass, got want me to taste that
Lodi dodi, with a coke shaped body
And my jewels hang low like my balls in the potty
And I dare ya'll to try to rob me

When we on the block bubbling rocks, watching for cops
Holding glocks in and out of the spots, (it's all good)
When we overseas, getting that cheese, whipping the hottest V's
Blowin' exotic trees, player, (it's all good)
When I'm in the whip, sunk in the six, drunk off the liqs
Pull up, stunting, fronting for chicks, (it's all good)
When we on stage getting them Grammy's, snatching them panties
Jet skiing off the shores of Miami, (it's all good)

Mister Miami,"As the dark clouds move in on me
Stealing the sunshine again and again
And the night is falling down
It felt so great living in this world
I fear the things that are yet to come
Living in fear day after day

Every fucking word you said
Why did I trust you I thought you were
My friend but you stabbed me in the back

Mister Mydas,"I remember, wasn't so long ago
We had a one room shack and the livin' was low
And my mama by herself raised me and my bro
Wasn't easy, but we did it with the little that go
Worked hard while got us off of school everyday
And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray
Gave us pride to survive, really showed us the way
Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say

She said, ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up,"" uh-uh

And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up

And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on

Boom-boom, couldn't have made it alone
I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own
With a strong foundation that was carved in stone
And my mama for the love that made my house a home
Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be
All this for a humble little guy like me
And all I ever really wanted was a family
To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me

She said, ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up,"" uh-uh

Never let yourself be overcome by the pressure

Got nuff sleep and I am a expire

Elle vient en privé pour que je la ken
Toi tu l'lé-lé sur ses photos
Et la vie va si vite
Mais la route est longue demande à Yvick
Une plume et un flow totalement chimiques
Ton cadavre est caché dans le pacifique
Si tu n'es pas fraîche, tu n'es pas ma go
Moi j'suis d'jà rappeur, je n'ai pas besoin d'abdo
Les concurrents m'détestent
Où sont ceux qui lâchaient des vrais textes?
Si je m'marie ta daronne c'est ma maîtresse
Je vous attends je suis posé sur l'Mont Everest

J'ai percé frère comme quoi tout arrive
J'leur tire la langue Christophe Dugarry
Si j'hausse le ton j'réveille tout Paris
Ils m'attendent au tournant comme un rallye
J'ai l'bras tellement long qu'j'me crois dans Space Jam

On dépense le double de ce qu'on encaisse man

Mister V-Lo,"intro - Prince Teddy]
What is time? Time is when a man is trying to make time with your
woman,
but your doing time behind bars and your time is standing still. Yo
Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?
[verse 1 - Frost]
Time, sits through the hour glass, through night and day
and I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
and if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
so why can't I confess what I see on a drumbeat
like just last night (yo what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
one of them was quick to pull a knife
he stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
in prison at the age of 21 (yeah)
living on death row cause he couldn't let go
caught in the web of violence (damn)
roll deep when they creep, and move in silence of the lambs (yo)
a tattooed tear dropped as the iron gates slam
[chorus - Bill Withers & Frost]
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Anytime, hey - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine, Anytime - Bill Withers
[verse 2 - Frost]
Damn, damn ain't that a shame?
you're lost so take the caution don't play the game
should've listen to the Frost when I was trying to come across to you
but no you didn't think (sucker)
you just keep getting yourself more deep until you sink
so there's no one else to thank but yourself
so go ahead take bow for a job well done
but you'll never see the day of the sunshine or the fun times
just the old days and your old ways
corrupt and wicked
out there doing dirt, instead of just kicking it
pow pow bang bang and all that noise (yeah)
yeah you and all your homeboys
take time to read between the lines
cause ain't no sunshine
[chorus]
[verse 3 - Frost]
(yo kid) I know about being macho
callin' the shots the big time head honcho (yeah)
but here's something even more gacho
one of my homeboys is your old lady Sancho
yo shit happens
I know the lights of all these people right as I'm rapping
while you sit in a cell writing a letter
saying when you get out, your things will be better (right)
but man she couldn't wait
so she's going out on a date
with every Tom, Dick, and Harry
and if you ask me, your shit's getting scary
so how you gonna handle this
when your home's in Los Angeles
acting so scandalous
yo, you can't blame her you didn't take the time
and now, ain't no sunshine

Damn - Frost
[interlude - Prince Teddy]
So if you don't want to do no time, you better take time to try to draw
the line you know what I'm saying? Or you're gonna be the next fool in
line
doing time, you know what I'm saying? Like my man said...

Amène ta clique: on les couche tous
On arrive dans l'rap tout schuss
Lourd comme la patate à Mouss Diouf
Drive-by en pouce-pouce
Ajoute du caviar dans l'couscous
Nous on porte nos couilles sans coup d'pouce
On a l'vent en poupe quand toi tu pompes dans l'vent
Rassasie les poucaves à coups d'pompe dans l'ventre
On vend pas l'chocolat d'Genève, mais de Ouarzazate
Le rap game: dis-lui que ma zézète veut voir sa chatte

La concurrence, on la baise, la rabaisse, mec
Passe, passe le pèze, c'est tout c'qui nous apaise, mec
Pousse le volume du son qui t'agresse dans ta caisse, mec
Tu trouveras pas plus lourd, pas plus vrai, pas plus tess, mec
Encaisse le clap comme une claque sur ta fesse, mec
Personne nous teste wesh, tout l'monde nous respecte, mec

La gloire suce pour un kif, dans un J9 dégueulasse
Température absolue quand le quartier se glace
Ouais M.C: ton rap ne casse pas des briques
Donc laisse pas traîner ta serviette hygiénique dans les chiottes du Quick
Reste reur-ti, meurtri par les échecs
Coquards et grosses lèvres lendemain d'un jour de fête
Dans chaque tiex', c'est la hass
Jure pas sur la Mecque, tu veux m'la mettre: je te baise

Neuf-Cinq, S.O.A., Banlieue d'Paris: c'est là qu'on est
Ma ville tu la connais, par ici la monnaie
J'veux la daronne assise a la son-mai
L'khalis il doit tomber
L'raciste on va plomber
Pas d'cinéma, pas d'carte UGC
Barbare oui je sais, j'ai ma capuche baissée
J'arrive zgègue de Galsène, j'baise de la chienne
J'reste moi-même: Nourou, say my name

Un truc spécial pour mes cailles que j'étale sur mes cahiers

Zes' mec de tess, nous on fait trembler ton palier
J'débarque, Vitry, Neuf-Quatre, on a l'talent pour t'braquer ou freestyler
J'suis dans un hall, gros j'suis calé
Avec l'équipe, dans une allée
Mange du bitume toute l'année
Veulent voir nos rôles ici: caner
On a choisi, on s'est cramés
Par les soucis, gros j'suis gavé
Viens pas m'check si t'as trop parlé

T'as trop parlé, bâtard?
Nique ta mère, la chatte à ta grand-mère, bâtard
On va t'niquer ta mère
On va t'jeter dans une cave dans l'Neuf-Cinq

Hé, Tonton Seth, j'ai huit mesures en or si tu m'l'autorises
J'arrive plus lourd qu'une orgie d'sumotoris
À mon mariage c'est moi qu'j'aurai l'plus beau jogging
Le plus gros bolide: une R19 avec un turbo d'Boeing
Les MC encaissent mieux les pruneaux qu'Tony
Zekwé chie des rafales d'obus
Le F.C. Porto va droit au but
Ouh caralhou, teste pas les cailleras d'nos rues
Ou l'addition sera salée comme un accra d'morue

J'arrive en balle, mon excursion sera expéditive
Écoute: je ne mens pas, c'est bien pour ça qu'j'obtiens l'respect des p'tits
Toujours au top moi, j'ai la bonne recette
On prend les mêmes et on recommence
J'te mets en transe sur l'album de Seth
En une phase, le ter-ter subit un tremblement
J't'ai vu dans l'angle mort, tu kiffais pas, au final t'en redemandes
J'suis une bombe à retardement
Ça fait ""brrraaah"", ""zdedededex""
Ouvre pas tes fesses, j'te la mets tendrement

On a des têtes comme dans le ""Dernier Gang""
Oufs à la Spaggiari, on est des barbares
Que des ""7"" sur le code-barre
Ambiance Audiard ou Tarantino, touche pas à nos bambinos
On t'aura, comme dans ""Gomorra"": cache pas l'butin sous l'Dunlopillo
Demande à Al Poelvoordino: wanted pour murder
Nique ta mère la Police, nique ta race Fox Mulder
On y croit tous comme Ribéry, fout l'dawa comme au Bayern
J'baiserai la France jusqu'à c'qu'elle m'aime comme Mac Tyer

C'est pour les malfrats, les ghetto youths
Entre la mosquée et la muscul', ou sur Neptune via d'la ppe-fra Absolut
Insolents, on sait vi-sèr' des sons lourds
Prêts a salir
Coûte que coûte on veut les salaires
Coups d'couteau dans sa mère
L'rap crève, arme, guerre
Micros en l'air

On roule dans des caisses d'occase
La marijuana vient d'Tijuana
Les balles qu'on tire, wallah, viennent du Caucase
La fumée s'propage comme des phéromones
Starfoullah l'héritage qu'on a offert aux mômes
Avec classe, on s'échappe par l'vasistas
Face au fisc on balise pas
Vu qu'à la douane les valises passent
T'façon on a jamais aimé Rambo, Tarzan
Nos idoles sont ceux qui vendent des kilos d'pavot afghan

J'suis le côté diabolique de Serge Gainsbourg
J'connais le diagnostic mais j'espère que les médecins s'gourent
J'festoie fils: serre-moi un verre d'vin rouge
J'm'esquinte, j'souffre, j'suis quelqu'un d'louche
Je fatigue Satan
Crois pas qu'la Police arrive à temps
Ou qu'ça tire à blanc dans la galerie marchande
Je fabrique l'argent, la famille attend
Qu'j'ramène entre les dents le string de Fanny Ardant

Envoie les clefs du TT, j'me transforme en virtuose
J'mets des grosses fessées sur des p'tits culs roses
Vote pour moi sur ""chien-d'la-casse.fr""
J'te regarde de travers si tu cherches moi les vers
J'pue l'Jack Daniel, j'suis l'fils caché d'Gargamel
J'm'en vais danser l'disco avec deux-trois chattes d'Asnières
On s'entraîne au tir au bois d'Achères
Ambiance murder, pas d'voice au vocoder
C'est Giorgio Moroder

Sur moi, ne lé-par pas
Car chez nous la trahison ne se répare pas
On prend les sens interdits
T'rentre dedans comme la vachette d'Intervilles
Crois pas qu'chez nous c'est fantastique
À mettre la cagoule, les gants en plastique
Les 'tasses de tess', c'est pas ma tasse de thé
Pour les p'tis gars du Seize: fais des traces de C

Quand on était p'tits, les anciens nous envoyaient acheter des canettes
Aujourd'hui ils nous sucent la bite pour qu'on leur avance une galette
C'est la galère ouais, mais nique sa mère, on a l'feeling
Investir dans un calibre c'est mieux que d'faire d'l'haltérophilie
À la mairie, on leur a demandé un terrain d'foot
Ils ont refusé, on s'est mis à bicrave et on a ouvert un terrain d'chnouf
Bouffe pas la galette des rois, tu trouveras pas la fève
J'ai vendu la galette darwa, j'ai fini au Quai des Orfèvres

Laissez passer les têtes de cabochards
Enfouraillés au 79, rue Quentin Bauchart
Donne toujours une pièce quand tu rencontres un clochard
Wesh, éteins ton char
Échange pas des années d'liberté contre un bon-char
En bon couche-tard, j'ai la gueule du Capitaine Caverne

Ensuite j'le glisse dans une feuille, et l'fume avec mon pote Maurice
Les faux j'les terrorise, ils m'font golri d'ces humoristes
Moi, passe-moi moi un 11-43 et j'te fais danser même Chuck Norris
On triomphe sans gloire à vaincre sans risques

Jeudi 30 juin 2011, 21h27
Cette heure-ci je suis sur la côte, je suis rhabta je vais faire la fête
Je repense à l'année dernière au chtar avec Youssouf et Seth
J'appelle le barman et je commande un whisky sec
Là je suis avec Najet, avec Khaled, avec Hayèt et j'aperçois les strass et paillettes
C'est fini les rehkéyèt, Kore on se check tout à l'heure faut que j'aille chercher mes trophées
Deux Soixante à l'heure, c'est dans la Féfé que ça va chauffer
Direction le bled, man t'inquiète c'est pas pour faire un go fast
Le rap français je viens de l'écraser, il m'arrive sous la godasse
Matte mes semelles, guette le sang des concurrents, il est dégoulasse
Des haineurs, des haineuses, des counards et des counasses
Bref rabewe l'étéye, raljo l'bierra
Woo Gataga l'yoma l'guerra
Je serais bien entouré matte mes potes que des tarés
Un pour tous, tous bourrés, on va se finir au cabaret

Enéya, rouya, j'me verrais bien à Pattaya
Entrain de rouler des gros sbar, faya, à al playa
Aïe, aïe, aïe, toujours autant de paranoïa
Là je suis à la recherche d'une femme aussi chéba que Zarouania
Je suis au quartier, je suis posé
Je suis entrain de causer avec Chakir et Rifché
Passe le micro, je vais l'exploser
J'aurais aimé être un fauteuil dans un salon de coiffure pour dames
Car je sais que la chaise électrique dahwa elle est pas confortable
Ah- tends minute, je prends mon portable
J'appelle une bête de meuf, tellement canon qu'il faut un port d'armes
Elle est trop mcheneuf, je sais pas comment la gérer
Ici c'est pas comme au Maroc, c'est pas comme en Algérie
Ah nan Dahwa, c'est la Cefran
Ici tout le monde il est beau mais personne il est content
Chouf tout le monde il est vénère, tout le monde il fait la tête
Mais je veux voir toutes les mains en l'air, aujourd'hui c'est la guerre

Seuls les vrais reconnaissent les vrais
Qui aurait pu croire hein
Et ouais ma gueule

Qui aurait pu croire qu’au bled
Je serais coté comme Cheb Khaled
Je connais l’histoire de Hinde
Et celle de Marie Antoinette
J’ai une éternelle reconnaissance
Envers celle qui m’a fait naître
Les erreurs sont comme des gosses
Faut les assumer et les reconnaître
L’argent, certains en manquent
D’autres le jettent par les fenêtres
J’ai vu des mâles dominants
Se faire dompter par des femelles
Je sais bien que quand il y a embrouille
Ce n’est pas tout le monde qui s’en mêle
Je voulais m’engager pour la vie
Mais ça a pas duré une semaine

Je voulais vivre ma vie de tous les jours sans que personne me reconnaisse
Je voulais connaître la fraîcheur, les grosses caisses et les Rolex
Je voulais faire d'elle ma princesse mais elle est devenue mon Ex
Wougataga tout ce que je voulais c'était me mettre à mon aise

Wougataga tout ce que je voulais c'était me mettre à mon aise

Je voulais pas de crème de cassis
Mais du sirop de groseille
J’avais des kilos de problèmes
Je voulais des tonnes d’oseilles
J’ai fais disques d’or et de platine
J’étais même pas inscrit à la SACEM
Je suis la preuve qu’il faut croire en soi
J’ai vu le mal comme un Zazen
Je peux plus déclarer ma flamme
Allez le dire a cupidon
Moi si j’offre la lune a ma femme
C'est que ma mère a déjà pluton
Faut rester simple et humble
Faut être fier comme Marta pan
Va pas gâcher ta jeunesse en galérant sur un banc
Comment se fait il qu’en si peu de temps
Les mœurs aient tellement changé
Comment se fait il que dans certains bleds
Y a toujours pas de quoi manger
En 2013 bref
Je sais bien qu'il ne faut pas tenter le diable
Mon album s’appelle le prince
Il sortira chez Def Jam

Je voulais vivre ma vie de tous les jours sans que personne me reconnaisse

Mister You,"J'suis dans mon quartier, j'galère, j'regarde en l'air
J'suis en train d'cogiter, j'suis défoncé sa mère

J'arrive chargé, comme une porteuse à Tanger
Après mon passage au ter-feu il te reste plus grand chose à manger
J'roule un sdeh pour me percher, rejoindre l'étoile du berger
C'est plus des couilles que j'ai, eh non, c'est des gros œufs de Fabergé
J'suis overbooké, OK zoogataga
J'ai appris une chose chez Ruquier
C'est le mot rutabaga
J'rêve que d'pouvoir, et comme vous avez pu le voir
Bah le rap français c'est pas vraiment l'truc tah Audrey Pulvar
Mon point commun avec Natacha c'est mes chicos d'devant
Que moi-même sans mes 32 dents, j'leur faisais du rentre-dedans
Ouais, bien sur que l'avenir est inquiétant
Pour des barrettes ils nous mettent 8 ans
Wesh, monsieur le président, dites leur bien que
J'représente les 3arbis et les niggas
Moi j'suis plus riche qu'eux, donc pourquoi j'irai fouiller leurs caisses
En pleine crise, moi j'suis en plein dans les 30 glorieuses
Mais j'sais que ma liberté bah, fait pas grand chose à leur yeux
Demande à Lacrim quand j'étais à l'école
C'est pour gratter les remises de peine
Du dispatching au disque d'platine
De l'affiche de recherche à la fiche de paye
J'ai pété tous les barrages, mais je n'ai jamais été odieux
Comment idolâtrer la vache, quand l'univers est à Dieu
Dites leur bien que, m'en bat les couilles de leur baratin
Que la j'suis en promenade, 3ème tour, Rabta dans un bar à tinp'
Nique l'État, ces schmetats rêvent que de nous mettre dans la de-mer
J'vais m'branler et même cracher sur leur putain système de merde
Woogata (ekh tfou) rap tah les fous
Ils préfèrent s'acheter une Rafleuse que d'faire du kung-fu
La Mecque, j'suis de ceux qui se baisse et Allah yaafo
Je t'ai déjà dis, nous on cotise tous pour la retraite à Clairvaux
Ils nous mettent des peines de pédophile pour des histoires de barrettes
Autant vendre de la cocaïne butez-nous pour qu'on s'arrête
Les 3ineurs montre pas l’œil, dites leur de niquer leur mère les chouettes
Moi, m'occupe de la vodka, woogataga gardez la schweps
Hey, d'après mon entourage moi j'reste un brave, 
J'reste un vrai c'est pour ça qu'il m'encourage
Après la pluie, y'a pas le beau temps y'a l'orage
C'est vrai que les petits sont hardcore, on était pareil à leur âge
À deux sur un scooter on vivez que de vol à l'arrach'
Puis on a connu la crave-bi et on a vite tourné la page
J'me suis mis à couper des barrettes, ensuite à vendre des plaquettes
Puis d'la coke et des galettes, jusqu'à ce que les keufs nous arrêtent
Un jour j'étais dans le 19, l'lendemain un hessess fermait ma porte
Un soir j'étais avec une meuf, l'lendemain elle était avec mon pote
La vie c'est dur, pas de peine nous tout ce qu'on porte c'est des flingues
Et y'a pas de vice de procédure gros c'est la loi de la jungle
C'est pas d'ma faute, darwah, j'crois bien que j'suis taré d'naissance
J'me reconnais pas moi-même des fois j'suis ravi de faire ma connaissance
Et quand je pars au shtar, bah t’inquiète pas que j'reçois des mandats
Et j'ai toujours la frappe, tah hollanda et bellanda
J'suis rabtah, zoogataga sous ma véranda
J'glisse mes doigts dans les cheveux tah Esmeralda
J'emmerde l'Etat, j'emmerde les stups, j'emmerde les gendarmes
Trafiquant de rimes, trafiquant d'stups ou trafiquant d'armes
Je suis, comment vous dites? 
Paranoïaque, ouais
Je m'en bat les yeuc', madame la juge baraneyek
J'te l'avais dit que j'avais des projets
Là j'graille des brochettes, j'insulte ta mère et j'touche des gros chèques
J’achète des trucs qui valent chères, rien qu'avant hier
J'me suis acheté 3-4 t-shirt, j'ai dépensé ton salaire
J'me suis roulé un gros sdeh, puis j'ai repensé à la misère
A cet été, à cet hiver, quand on était au val-d'Isère
Au mitar tah la Santé, les promenades en camembert
Au mitar tah Fleury, j'revois les toilettes j'me dis beurk!
A les bâtards, comment ils ont pu me faire ça?
Ils me l'ont mise j'leur est remise woogata vice et versa
Yaa zéh obligé de se faire remarquer, pas obligé de se faire embarquer déféré au parquet
Direction les grillages, bon, trêve d'enfantillage
Yeah, I speak a little English, motherfucking biatch!
Ould l'kahba what you gonna do Ok j'continue tout doux j'big up le rott' Mamadou
Yoogata yoogata gangz to gangz
Ouais, tu connais la musique, celui qui veux teste j'le baise

Ban-ban-bandit j'fait que du propre, j'effectue les sales tâches
Ça sert à quoi de jouer le pirate, si t'enquilles pas à l'abordage
Ils dopent en dopant, co on t'laisse le dos en deux
On est nous-mêmes en (?) exorciste avec un joint d'beuh
Tous les soirs j'dégrise, nos combines se développent
Mais des fois les quis' débarquent et dans les comptes ça fait des flops
Du crime ouais y'a la crème, Sta-ive c'est du vécu
Mon gros, chez moi le sang c'est vidé à cause du manque d'écus
Pas de X que t’achètes avec alcool et abus
De plus, j'baise ces nabots qui croient contrôler la rue
Les yeux cernés au poste, menotté à des barreaux de chaise
J'rêve d'Îles Vierges m'en fumer avec des barreaux de chaises
La nuit j'dors mal, éternellement tourmenté
En pensant que j'vais prendre cher si les keufs arrivent à tout remonter
Ceux qui sèment le vent, récolte du ons dans le ventre
A-L, futur ex-braqueur reconverti dans la vente

J'aimerais partir tranquille, les pieds d'vant
Un monde de fils de pute, j'suis obligé de vendre
Ah bon? 
Ça suffit pas alors on braque sa mère
M’en voulais pas dans le rap y'a trop de Zehmel
3 Quart, belle coupe, chico cassé
La vie c'est speed même mon ombre veut me dépasser
Oh, le sky est classé, j'suis chaud
Menacé ne sert à rien, j't'envoie 2-3 balles l'affaire est classé
Ramassé du biff, voilà dans quoi j'me suis perdu
J'sais c'que c'est d'avoir la dalle, j'en connais ces vertus
Hyper dur, fréquentation malsaine
Chiale pas sur mon sort, tu sais qu'ici personne nous accepte
On connaît le respect, Les valeurs et les principes
T'es le plus grand des hommes si tu te lèves pour bosser à Rungis
Malheureusement pas mon cas, au fond de moi je les envies
Nos vies, c'est faire du biff, mais resté en vie
Donc faut marcher armé, puis avoir la trique
Aujourd'hui t'allume demain t'es matrixé
C'est la vie du western, la vie d'moi j'suis réel
La tranquillité frérot est bloqué dans mes rêves
Impossible de l'avoir, je ne prend jamais de rotte-ca
Mais Belek au feu le couz si tu mets trop de bois
Beaucoup de salopes font les voyous, wallah que c'est pas une fierté
Dit moi qui sera là le jour ou t'auras vraiment merdé
J'ai l'orgueil d'un bébé, je m'énerve et je pète tout
J'assume les conséquences khey dans mes bras je prend le mektoub
Oui j'aime pas les poulets et je ferais recette sans eux
Une impression même jaloux de ma mère à 700E
Ils m'inventent des vies, le mythe ils veulent casser
Hum j'en ai assez, les traquer, les chlasser
Quand j'allais tu revenais, dans ta tête ça ne rentre pas
Je le ferais tout les jours, je compte l'oseille me dérange pas
Bien sur qu'on s'est fait tout seul, je sais très bien que tu sais
J'ai braqué des bijouteries quand les autres allaient sucer
Sans t'manquer de respect, dans l'rap dit moi ce qui est facile
Frérot on viens de la rue c'est des filles faciles

J'ai roulé ma bosse, j'en ai marre d'bouffer d'la merde
Coup d'crosse la vie t'assommes pire qu'un joint d'herbe
Tout ce qu'on a on finit par l'perdre
Étoile de mer 10 000 kilomètres
Perdu sur la lune verte
J'sui tellement loin des ""je veux être""
Berad d'aatay j'allume un Jaabouq à la fenêtre
T'es dans l'paraitre moi j'vais disparaitre
Les kheys passent au dispatching, une mère qui pleure c'est la faute d'un traitre
Y'a plus que des bras cassés dis-moi à qui serrer les coudes?
Six pieds sous terre quand j'me ferais bouffer par l'doud
Noyer dans le doute, j'suis toujours dans le hood
Les yeux rouges, oui dead casa negra j'suis pas un l'blood
Passe moi des feuilles ce soir j'fume mes dernières illusions
Sers moi un verre que j'tourne cette tragédie en dérision
11.43, Mortuaire sera la saison
Maintenant j'marche avec des rétros, dis qui va m'sauter l'caisson
Y'a y'a y'a plus d'rage que d'la fashionnerie
J'enterre l'espoir dans un parloir à Fleury
Ghetto youth langage, du whisky, les chicos pourries
Bonbon sauvage 0.4 roya sourit

Heh-hep-pep, Dieu seul est maitre de ma destinée
Moi j'me verrais bien à La Mecque avec mes rents-pa et ma dulcinée
La vie c'est pas un clip ni du ciné ou une bande dessinée
On va peut-être finir à Clairvaux, on va peut-être s'faire assassiner
C'est clair gros qu'on peut tout perdre sur un coup d'ker-po
J'te parle d'une boite ou pour rentrer y'a même pas besoin d'se faire beau
Le cercle est vicieux bienvenue dans le cerceau
Quand j'ai fêté mes 16 ans c'est pas du plomb que j'avais dans le cerveau

J'ai 28 ans j'habite dans l'zoo je m'appelle Eddy Chabard
J'veux réussir, j'veux m'en sortir depuis que j'suis tout petit je chabarde
J'ai bicrave, j'ai fais plein d'conneries dont j'suis pas du tout fier
Comme les aller-retours à Fleury pour battre le fer faut du fer
Pour faire du flouze faut du flouze, des couilles et d'la gamberge
Surtout quand t'es seul contre tous y'a personne pour te tendre la perche
Moi Alhamdulillah j'suis pas comme ça j'préfère aider mon prochain
Car j'sais que Dieu me l'rendra ici bas ou dans un monde prochain
Lah yaalem bi kolchi, hata tkoun labes Gucci
Lmout tji ou tadik

J'arrive dans l'game avec You pour écraser tous ces chiens
Même s'ils sont plein on les baise tous kalachnikov à la main
Ca va péter dans l'quartier, dans tous les ghettos d'France
Ayat-al kursi 11.43 pour me souhaiter bonne chance
M'en bas les couilles de c'que tu penses, depuis ma tendre enfance
J'laisse la concurrence en transe lourde sera la sentence
Brulux on the flux toujours dans les bacs
Hier ils m'boycottaient maintenant ils veulent faire mes bacs
Prochain clip j'appelle Fredo il m'prépare le Maybach
Cette fois ci j'ferais pas l'gamin promis j'cacherais tes blacks
Ils m'ont pris pour une blague, des mesures il m'en reste quatre
Pour ma mère j'veux du 2.4 pour moi qamis, un RS4
Dédicace l'Algérie, le Maroc, la Tunisie
Faudra bientôt retourner chez nous car y'a trop d'crapules ici

Parce que tu manges du lion le matin devant moi tu veux rugir
Approche j'te mets une claque de roumain tu vas rougir
Plus tu vas monter plus les rumeurs vont surgir
Personne ne se fie d'personne écoutes bien tout ce que j'vais te dire
Tout ce qui est autour de moi, j'vais te l'exploser
La j'pète les plombs j'ai retiré la goupille j'fais exploser
A ma droite les frères mus' débarque pour nous faire des rappels
Pas la quand j'suis (?) les appelle
En primaire j'te frappais ouai j'me prenais pour l'king
A 10 ans au comico voiture péta dans un parking
Le quartier c'est une plaque tournante, ça défouraille de partout
Dans mon escalier j'tombe sur un sac remplis d'billets j'garde tout
Assis sur un banc toute la journée sa bibi
Dans les bois ça fais bep-bep ou cric-cric bim bim!
Au collège, lycée voilà les (?) moi j'casse des dents
Avec (?) ou pas leurs uppercuts te rentre dedans
On sais que la police nous surveille mais elle ne sait pas tout
Les malins savent très bien que l'argent ne fait pas tout
On a des avocats mais ils n'arrangent pas tout
Les médecins sont la mais il ne soignent pas tout
Pas de chance cette nuit la juge s'est fait mal baisée
Donc forcément des chance d'être acquitté on baissées
T'es pressé, t'accélères risquer sont les raccourcis
Kazou dis leur que cette est pute est plus de soucis que d'surcis

Posé à la tess j'ai rien vu, rien entendu
J'ves-qui les histoires tendu
Des fois c'est tes potes qui t'enculent
Avec du recul
J'ai fini par devenir solitaire
Pour l'Etat on a pas les critères
Donc on a fini sur le ter
J'vois des pères, des mères qui travaillent dur pour ceux qu'ils aiment
Wallah ça m'fait de la peine d'les rentrer pour rien dans nos problèmes
11.43 c'est le thème
La c'est Tirgo sur l'antenne
Poto dès l'début de l'enquête c'est possible que tu perds la tête
Envoie la frappe de Ketama dédicace à Khadama
J'suis obligé d'faire du sale y'a toute la cité derrière moi
Y'en a qui braquait des tabacs nous on bicravait du taga
Ouai continuer à taguer nous on à pas l'temps on tabasse
On va t'laisser aux aguets dé-ter comme l'armée du Hamas
J'savais pas que sur ce banc ouais j'allais fumer des kamas
Toute l'année tu fais des phases poto, c'est pas comme a-ç
Dans l'arène j'ai toujours la faille, flow qui tire comme un Fa-mas
Nous on est comme des hommes, on va toujours à la chasse
Y'a du biff' et des liasses obligé on s'déplace
Sa bicrave au fond de l'impasse
Désolé si ça dépasse
Dans ton bigo y'a les vrais et les boloss que t'effaces

We-wesh la racaille, les raclures la police en a ras-le-cul
Ma vie c'est un texte de rap remplit d'ratures
Nerveux l'sourire aux lèvres doté d'pouvoir céleste
J'ai perdu l'nord ma direction à moi c'est l'est
J'écris des textes de fou, beaucoup métaphorique
L'histoire d'un braqueur qui finit par taffer au Ritz
Rosny-sous-Bois, la Sambuy, les braquos, les sous-salles
Les sous-sols, les mouses, ceux qui moussent et qui s'débat ainsi qu'les douzes
J'rappe, je pense comme un mec de la ur
J'aime la pure qui branche les clients sur mon terrain tout les jours
J'ai pas d'bonnes habitudes j'descends et j'traine
J'truande j'ves-qui la justice dédicace à Fresnes
Les sirènes retentissent, les criminels se repentissent
La pisse du sheïtan, mes repentises, ma hantise
C'est vraiment pas la mort mais c'qui s'en suit
J'aime quand ça va que dans un sens (Oui!)
Quand c'est classé sans suite
Moi j'ai ramé, ramené la merde à mes rents-pa
Et j'donne tout à mes frères marlich s'ils me le rendent pas
La justice on s'la fait nous même, I'm so Hood!
Un dialogue de sourd entre moi et ma bouteille d'Absolut
Me parle pas d'la gloire n'y même du sommet (Nan, nan, nan)
Pour l'instant j'me bas pour finir la semaine
Mais guette moi j'suis la j'rappe sale vas-y acquiesce
De nos jours tu peux rater l'grand amour si t'as pas d'caisse

Sta-ive c'est du vécu
On comprend que chez moi le sang c'est vidé à cause du manque d'écus
Oui c'est l'cercle est vicieux bienvenue dans le cerceau
Ça va péter dans l'quartier, dans tout les ghettos d'France

Dans mes poumons c'est Chefchaouen
J'sais pas c'qui s'passe dans ma tête, j'crois qu'j'suis en coloc' avec moi-même
Si tu fais l'malin p'tit fils de pute j'te baise ta mère toi et ton équipe
Ensuite j'te baise et j'te re-rebaise, te re-re-rebaise puis la on est quitte
Il est trop tard pour prendre la fuite, j't'attrape, j'te fracasse en huit

Chargé comme la chatte à leur mère quand elles s'font ken le week-end
Chargé comme le crâne d'un taulard après l'parloir, yes we can smoke

Char-charclage au couteau, défouraillage en moto
Daronne qui pleure, frero qui s'venge ou qui s'fait fumer à leurs tour
Click-boum! Ça va trop vite
Rafale à travers la vitre
Là t'es mort mon ami, t'a même pas eu l'temps d'voir défiler ta vie
D'un coup tu t'demandes c'qui t'arrive, Azraël te dit fais pas crari
Au lieu de louer ton Seigneur t'a préféré vendre d'la cocaïne
Y'a deux chances sur trois que tu sois là à cause de l'aïn
Tout ton corps s'met à rendre des coups
Tes mains, tes pieds, ta bouche, tes narines
Tu vas goûter l'feu tu t'es fais fumer comme de la weed
Tu vas aller rejoindre Sigmund Freud, et Charles Robert Darwin

Pour calmer tous ces nerfs j'dois en fumer des litres
A-L Bandit gros scar-la, j'veux qu'des carats
Faut que je sois parer à m'barrer d'ici, et bon débarras
Sans gêne dans les escaliers, ça découpe des 100g
Si ton pote d'enfance te parle plus c'est peut-être toi qui as changé
Les grands de la cité sont rangés, y'en a au placard

Les p'tits d'chez moi bah ils te séquestrent pour ta gold
Quand tu sèmes le vent c'est des bastos que tu récoltes

Pour les gens pieux la vie est moche mais la mort est si belle
Des fois j'aimerais être une mouche pour ressentir les décibels
J'représente ville-Belle comme Halimoush et Bebel
J'resterais vrais, frais et prêt jusqu'à ce que le Seigneur m'appelle

Quand on s'y met tu peux faire une croix, on vient pas pacifier
Demande à tonton Bruler, j'taille vif et l'compte est pillé
On vient pas pactiser mais putain qu'est ce qu'on va tiser
Tu m'allumes, j'te rallumes avant d'avoir cicatriser

Qu'il m'avance un mètre carré j'ai envie d'me barrer
J'ai vingt ans on dirait que j'en ai pris 5 cette année
Tout est carré, pour la mama faire des sous fallait
Sur l'terrain armé quand ça risque de rafallé
Paris 5 sur le pavé, y'a des chose que t'as pas vu
Toxicomane j'avoue, j'pète un garde à vue
Au bistrot on m'ressert un cocktail de rue

Paranoïaque, j'arrive une heure avant chaque rendez-vous
Si t'es un brave j'allume pour oit, gratuitement j'me dévoue

On a du seum's et du caviar, on a d'la pers et de l'écaille

Quand j'voyais les larmes de ma mère
Crois-moi que je jouais pas les fiers

Tout ce qu'on veut c'est faire des liasses
Sans pour autant ce faire menottés
Et comparez pas Las Vegas et l'casino tah Bénodet
Avant il m'en fallait qu'un maintenant m'faut 5-6 millions de côté
Je m'arrête au feu rouge, j'en profite pour décapoter
La jeunesse est en train de se bloquer
Donc l'État il est en train de comploter
L'union fait la force, je m'adresse à toutes les communautés
Bienvenue dans ma principauté, l’intérieur, la vraie beauté
Les vrais reconnaissent les vrais
Les faux ils savent que boycotter
OK, j'suis barjo, j'suis toqué

Ils se demandent si j'suis millionnaire, ils ont le seum, ils sont vénère
Je vais au bled j'me régénère, y'a que le très haut que je vénère

Ils veulent soulever des diamantaires

C'est vrai qu'j'voulais t'baiser ta mère on m'a dit ""prends-toi pas la tête""
T'as beau mettre des bandanas, de Tupac t'es la rumeur
Je hais comme un tueur, et j'aime comme un dictateur

Petit vois pas le pire pour abuser dans tes failles

À part si on m'allume mon bébé j'suis dans les temps
J'revois la directrice me dire t'es foutu dans huit ans
J'vois mon père avec des larmes mais pris par la déception
Les fils de généraux qui m'attendent à la réception

Exchanged our song for another
Can't blame, is that flame that once glowed like no other.

We were so alive
Only to see us wither and die.

You say you stand even if this is our fault
You're earning, you'll dare when you will hit the wall
I shot your ears, tried to make you hear my call
But you were long gone, hoping this song is done.

Only to see us wither and die.

And I never ever thought I'd hear these words be said
Now I lay here in an unmade bed
Empty stomach, Sunday bowl to be fed
Your ego swallowed and from there you fled
So far away, could not find your way back
Walked down the path, wet feet slip through the grass.

Wet feet slip through the grass
Could not find your way back
Wet feet slip through the grass

Keeping low never wanna play
Wandering far, disappearing
Feet stuck in place, not moving

You've been low low low
Troubled sea so deep, troubled none no sleep
You've been flying so high
Avoiding the road

Pretending to not feel alone

Where to fly? who knows
Winds rapidly, blow
From branch to branch you go
When you see the sun dear friend let it glow
Don't shun it all, don't let it fall
From your hands how you used to crawl
You're walking tall, no need to hide
Behind the clouds in the sky

You've been up and down down

Troubled sea so deep, troubled none no sleep
You've been flying so high
Avoiding the road

Pretending to not feel alone
Pretending to not feel alone

Vagabond is you, ran the mile no shoes
If the sun goes down too soon
Embrace the starry eyed moon
Vagabond is you, swam the sea at the darkest blue
You made it, made it through
You made it, made it through oh

MisterWives,"Pick yourself up off the floor
Voice won’t be silenced anymore
These wings will soar
Struggle to open your eyes
Swollen from all of your cries

Look to the sunrise

And I know that the weight is pulling ya down
We didn't come all this way to let love drown
Keep your head up, try to stay above the water, but my heart keeps sinking

Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go
Oh love, where did you go?

'Cause I need hope that these sticks and stones, won’t break my bones

Oh love, where did you go?
Oh love, where did you, where did you go oh go oh, oh whoa oh

Lifted the veil, we’re all sinners
Crowned the devil a winner
And you tell me that, it’ll be just fine
Scarier than any bad dream
Can’t wake up from his regime
So don’t tell me to sit down and dine

Vous pensez si le jeune homme en profita !
Pardon Mamzelle fait's donc Monsieur...
Ah ! quell' poitrine elle est divine...
Malgré moi je l'écrase un peu
Pardon Mamzelle fait's donc Monsieur.

Voyant combien elle était gentille
Dans sa garçonnière alors il l'emmena
Mais avant qu'il ne la déshabille
Pris de pudeur il lui murmura :

A plusieurs fois mêm' dut se reprendre

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow,

Mists Of Avalon,"It took so long to remember just what happened.
I was so young and vestal then,
You know it hurt me,
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise.
I've got my hands bound,
My head down, my eyes closed,
And my throat wide open. 
Do unto others what has been done to you 
I'm treading water,
I need to sleep a while.
My lamb and martyr, you look so precious.
Won't you come a bit closer,
Close enough so I can smell you.
I need you to feel this,
I can't stand to burn too long.
Released in this sodomy.
For one sweet moment I am whole. 
Do unto you now what has been done to me. 
You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise.
Won't you come just a bit closer,
Close enough so I can smell you.
I need you to feel this.
I need this to make me whole.
There's release in this sodomy.
For I am your witness that
Blood and flesh can be trusted.
And only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind. 
Got your hands bound, your head down,
Your eyes closed.
You look so precious now. 
Show me something
Thought I could make it end
Thought I could wash the stains away
Thought I could break the circle if I
Slipped right into your skin
So sweet was your surrender
We have become one
I have become my terror
And you my precious lamb and martyr.
I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Shit blood and cum on my hands. 
I've come round full circle.
My lamb and martyr, this will be over soon.

Misturada 4,"Hoje foi que a perdi
Mas onde já nem sei
Em Vera me larguei
E deito nesta dor
Meu corpo sem lugar
Ah, quisera esquecer

A moça que se foi
De nossa Vera Cruz
É o pranto que ficou
Do norte que sonhei
Das coisas do lugar
Dos mimos me larguei

Correndo sem parar
Buscar Vera Cruz
Nos campos e no mar
Mas ela se soltou
No norte se perdeu

Se ela em outra mansidão
Um dia ancorar
E ao vento me esquecer
Ao vento me amarrei
E nele vou partir
Atrás de Vera Cruz

Ah, quisera encontrar
A moça que se foi
Do lar de Vera Cruz
E o pranto que ficou
Do norte que perdi
Das coisas do lugar

Got no ears and they got no feet

Cause if we had anything goin' at all it must've been love

Don't think it's just your troubled mind if suddenly you find
That's something brushed away the bitter tears you've cried
If you feel something touch your face and disappear without a trace
And leave a warm familiar feeling by your side
It's not the shadows of the leaves in the early autumn breeze
As they blow along the grass that's summer dried
Through the good times and the tears through the autumn of your years
Night and day I'll never leave your side
Oh the shadows of the leaves...

I never thought I'd hear your voice again
I heard the windshield wipers callin' out your name
Somewhere in Virginia in the rain
I realized that I'm the one to blame (oh come on)
And I won't make the same mistakes again
My left front window's busted got a patch with cellophane
Somewhere in Virginia in the rain
I know it must be two a.m. bout Lewitt Mountain time
I'm here in telephone booth underneath the lonesome pine
And I've only got three minutes cause I'm down to my last dime
I hope it's not too late to say I'm sorry
Somewhere in Virginia in the rain little country towns all look the same
If I woke you up it's just to let you know somebody loves you

Mitch Easter,"Did you see your friend crying from his eyes today
Did you see him run through the streets and far away
Did you see him run, did you see him fall
Did his life flash by at the bedroom door

Did you hear the news it came across the air today
Someone has been found on the rocks down in the bay
Did you see him hide, did you see him crawl
Does his life mean more than it did before

Did you see that man running through the streets today
Did you catch his face, was it 10538

Mitch Frohman,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1998

But a song will only scratch the skin 
And there are still places I haven't been 
Because I know what's in there 
Is already in the air

There's a storm on the way 
There's a storm on the way 
All right
There's a storm on the way, yeah

And it's coming no matter what I say 
Oh

Here I come, I come, I come, I come

Hey, hey, hey
There's truth in the thunder 
Love in the lightning 
The feeling is frightening 
But isn't it exciting 
I'm something like stormy weather 
If I weren't we'd never 
Huddle together 
Do I have to tell ya 
That I'm also the sunlight 
That shines shortly after 
I just rain 'cause I have to 
On to other chapter 
I wish you lots of laughter 
Till the next time you see me 
Just remember you need me 
I'm the storm coming, coming, coming

So here I come, I come, I come, I come
Well come on!
Here I come, I come, I come, I come
Ah come on!

Run towards the hills 
To avoid the high floods 
I can do a dance that'll make the sky cry blood 
Skills provoking 
Seals to be broken open 
All that's left to do is try my love 
Woah

An I'm singing in the cyclone 
I'm writing a raging sea searching 
For a sign of the times 
Is it safe to say it's me 
Listen to our lives 
The wind will whisper the way it is 
I'm going to happen what a lovely day it is 

Don't ask why 
Just live 
And 
Die",Storm Coming,1979

To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Mitch McVicker,"I stood on that Cherokee Plain, 
And the Cameron broke free and jumped its banks 
All in a rush of life. 
The thunderhead roared out its song, 
And it gave what was too much for it to hold. 
And so must I. 

[Chorus]
And You light the sun to lead me. 
Send the wind to be my guide. 
Just the wonder of this prairie, 
So lonely and so alive. 
And the song the moon is singing 
With the rain and with the fire. 

Says there You are. 
(There You are) 
There You are 
In front of me. 

The antelopes' white flashing flanks 
Sparked in the heart of the Cheyenne breaks, 
Only to disappear. 
Just like this memory of what once was my home. 
And as I move beyond everything I've known, 
You pull me near. 

[Chorus]

Says there You are. 
(There You are) 
There You are 

And Your kingdom sings of a glory. 
Of a power that is Yours alone. 
And You're the one breathed into the many. 
You're faith, You're love, and the hope. 
As we lay our hearts before You 
Our hands are free to let go. 

And there You are.

And it's startin' to settle down
Here among the shadows of the evening
So I'm startin' to wonder about
The shape my soul is in
And they say only time will tell
But I say time will never take me
To that secret place I love
Where my mind is free to play with
Just what I might become
If I let go of everything that I've been holdin'
And I reach out for help

Because I, I can't get my broken heart to mend
The tears I cry, they never wash away my sin
All the strength I might find, will never heal
This soul of mine, only love will
Only His love will

So now I'm hopin' that the spirit
Will hang me out to dry
That I will listen and I'll hear Him
And He will draw me to His side
And when I press my heart to His
I will find my room to breathe
With the breath that comes from Heaven
And the peace we find in prayer
From a Grace that's oh so ancient
But still I know it's always here
To lift my mind above all I've been doubtin'
And move me toward belief

Because I, I can't get my broken heart to mend
The tears I cry, they never wash away my sin
All the strength I might find, will never heal
This soul of mine, only love will
Only His love will

Mitch McVicker,"Sometimes I feel at home
Often I feel so far away
And though dreams and wheels move me on
I pray my heart will always stay
Well within the sound of His voice of love
And my doubts come now and then
But peace has come forever more
And when I feel my faith is wearin' thin
He picks me up from the floor
And gives me strength to stand, when I think I can't

That's why He is the only thing I want to see
That's why I pray, I pray His love takes
A hold of me, Lord take hold of me

So I hope I take my words to heart
The tongue has a way of movin' with ease

There once was a farmer who took a young miss
In back of the barn where he gave her a lecture
On horses and chickens and eggs
And told her that she had such beautiful manners

That suited a girl of her charms
A girl that he wanted to take in his
Washing and ironing and then if she did
They could get married and raise lots of

Sweet violets
Sweeter than all the roses
Covered all over from head to toe

The girl told the farmer that he'd better stop
And she called her father and he called a taxi
And got there before very long
'Cause someone was doin' his little girl

Right for a change and so that's why he said
""If you marry her son, you're better off single""
'Cause it's always been my belief
Marriage will bring a man nothing but

And started in planning for his wedding suit
Which he purchased for only one buck

And so he got left in the lurch

End of the story which just goes to show

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""

I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry

I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""

Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1958

With a corncob pipe and a button nose 
And two eyes made out of coal

How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic 
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head 
He began to dance around

Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play 
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun 
Now before I melt away

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square 
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler Stop
For Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
Don't you cry, I'll be back again some day

Mitch Miller,"Mister Christopher Columbus
Sailed the sea without a compass
When his men began a rumpus
Up spoke, Christopher Columbus

There is land somewhere
Until we get there
We will not go wrong
If we sing, ""Swing a song""

Since the world is round
We'll be safe and sound
'Till our goal is found
We'll just keep rhythm bound

Soon the crew was makin' merry
Then came a yell
""Let's drink to Isabelle
Hum, bring the rum, ho hum""

No more mutiny
What a time at sea
With diplomacy
Christy made history

Mister Christopher Columbus
He used rhythm as a compass
Music ended all the rumpus

He's so good-lookin', gonna have some more
Feet up, pat him on the po-po

Then there's the night I had a fight and landed in the clink
But now my rootin' tootin' days are done
Gotta be the man that he thinks I am 'cause I love my son

A blushing flower.

She rented by the hour.

""Well, that's what comes from
Too much pills and liquor.""

Mitch Miller & the Gang,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses

But I miss you most of all my darling

With a corncob pipe and a button nose

How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic 
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head 
He began to dance around

Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play 
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun 
Now before I melt away

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square 
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler Stop
For Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
Don't you cry, I'll be back again some day

Standing here with broken wings

And sink me down low

I'm doing exactly what I wanted to
And baby I don't even think about you anymore

Just thought I'd drop you a line
To let you know I was feeling fine
Cause honey it's been a long long time
Since you walked out my door

It took me some time I must confess
For a while there I was feeling less than my best
I had to get out of town so I headed out west
I ended up in Seattle

I thought I'd start a brand new band
I thought I might call it Lonelyland
Things got a little out of hand
I ended up hooked on heroin

So I ended up moving back over to Germany
Living with the folks baggin grocery's
But the time I had was mostly free
So I spent most of it drinking

I got myself in a jam or two
I guess it's what I had to do
Late at night I'd still think of you
And it felt like I was drowning

Till I met this girl at a discotheque
She was a dancer but not what you'd expect
She taught ballet and she was half-Czech half Chinese

But after she decided not to have the baby
She said she was gonna move back to Czechoslovakia maybe
By then I didn't really care I was either half drunk or half crazy

I got arrested once but never convicted
My parents eventually had me evicted
I tried your number but it'd been disconnected
I guess I should've known

I heard you got married and you moved away
I called your folks but where they wouldn't say
They said it's probably better that way so I just let it be

I moved back to Austin bout a year ago
I drive a schoolbus I don't drink no more
I go out every once in a while and see a show but mostly I just watch TV

So I don't know where I'm gonna send this letter
I doubt things are ever going to get much better
It seems like life is just one big whatever anyway

I just thought I'd drop you a line
Lie and say I was doing fine
Cause baby it's been a long long time
Since you walked out my door",2002,2006

But I guess in the meanwhile I'm taking you off the speed dial
Tell me how am I supposed to get you off my mind

And every time I hear the song it used to play when you called
I used to want to sing along but now I wanna die
I don't listen to the radio I'm trying to forget you

Because Santa's coming

Say goodbye, to this year.
Wish I could avoid the empty, summer days, that await me
The fakers smile goodbye to this year, we're celebrating inner freedom.
I sit alone on the couch, wonderin' why

I wonder what it's like to have it all.
To never be afraid that I would fall.
But I don't think I've ever, known a time, that I was part,
Of the in crowd.

Here we go another day of disgrace,
Small black, on my face.
I wish I had a bunch of money,
Catch a plane, head out west.
Don't wanna play around offer up a fantastic freedom.
I sit alone on the couch, wonderin' why.

I wonder what it's like to have it all.
To never be afraid that I would fall.
But I don't think I've ever, known a time, that I was part,
Of the in crowd.

Doesn't anyone here, live an original life?
What did you surrender to be on the inside?
When you disappear they won't remember your name.
And you'll fade away, and someone'll take your place.
(Take your place!)
In the in crowd!

Spin away the combination for the last time,
Say goodbye, to this year.
I wish I could avoid the empty, summer days, that await me.
No time for small small goodbyes, we're celebrating inner freedom.

To never be afraid that I would fall!

To never be afraid that I would fall!

That I was part, of the in crowd!
Of the in crowd.

While waiting for, something new, to begin,
Waiting for, something more, someway, to fit in.

Get the picture fixed in your memory
I'm driven by the rythm like the beat of a heart
And I won't stop until I start
To stand out
To stand out

Some people settle for the typical thing
Livin' all their lives waiting in the wings
It ain't a question of ""if"", just a matter of time
Before I move to the front of the line

Once you're watching every move that I make
You gotta believe that I got what it takes

To stand out, above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you'll see
Gonna stand out

'Til ya notice me

If the sqeeky wheel's always gettin' the grease
I'm totally devoted to disturbing the peace
And I'll do it all again, when I get done
Until I become your number one
No method to the madness, and no means of escape
Gonna break every rule or bend them all outta shape
It ain't a question of ""how"", just a matter of when
You get the message that I'm tryin' to send

I'm under a spell, I'm in over my head
And you know I'm going all the way to the end

To stand out, above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you see
Gonna stand out

'Til ya notice me

If I could make you stop and take a look at me
Instead of just, walkin' by
There's nothin that
I wouldn't do if it was gettin' you to notice
I'm alive
All I need is half a chance,
A second thought, a second glance
To prove, I got whatever it takes

It's a piece of cake

To stand out, above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud

Gonna, stand out, stand out

Why Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Mitchell Ayres,"You better watch out, you better not cry
Here's the mab who is gonna tell you why

I just got back from a lovely trip along the milky way
I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old, dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me

So you better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list, and checkin' it twice
Gonna find out whose naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees when you are sleeping
Knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is coming to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa is coming, coming to town

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland all around the Christmas tree
So you better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With his sleigh all full of loot

Better start in to forget you 
Because, to know you is to love you so,

To know you love me! 

Were you the sun, it would be twice as sunny, 
Were you a bee, there would be sweeter honey, 
Were you a tune everyone would be croonin' 
Harmonizin' out in the street! 
You're such a bundle of me oh my, 
And that's the reason when you go by, 
Each heart naturally skips a beat!

Who have met you

Mitchell Ayres,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Remember you can't get the monkey off your back

And now you're running and you're running and you're running away
You're running from the monkey man
And now you're running and you're running and you're running away
You're running from the monkey man

I was lost, but now I'm found
Some might even say that I've been around
With the crowd I would move
Mr. sophisticated just can't lose

Now in the style that I was dressed
I was the steady reason no-one could test
Yeah I was smart and I was cool
No matter how hard they tried I was no-ones fool

And now you're running and you're running and you're running away
You're running from the monkey man
And now you're running and you're running and you're running away
You're running from the monkey man

Did you hear what I say?
Now did you hear what I say?

When you look, what do you see?
You only see the monkey not the man in me
But now I'm back, and that's a fact
Gonna show the next generation where I'm at

What I mean is to say
The way that I was is the same as I am today
And if you're white, or if you're black
Remember you can't get the monkey off your back

And now you're running and you're running and you're running away
You're running from the monkey man",Lullaby of Broadway,2006

Mitchell Ayres,"'Twas the night before Christmas, 
When all through the house, 
Not a creature was stirring, 
Not even a mouse! 
 
The stockings all hung 
By the chimney with care, 
In hopes that St. Nicholas 
Soon would be there! 
 
The children were nestled 
All safe in their beds, 
While visions of sugarplums 
Danced in their heads! 
 
And Mom in her kerchief 
And I in my cap, 
Had just settled down 
For a long winter's nap! 
 
When out on the lawn 
There arose such a clatter, 
I sprang from my bed 
To see what was the matter! 
 
Away to the window 
I flew like a flash, 
Tore open the shutters 
And threw up the sash! 
 
The moon on the breast 
Of the new fallen snow, 
Gave the lustre of midday 
To object below! 
 
When what to my wandering eyes 
Should appear, 
But a miniature sleigh 
And eight tiny reindeer! 
 
With a little ol' driver 
So lively and quick, 
I knew in a moment 
It must be St. Nick! 
 
More rapid than eagles 
His courses they came, 
As he whistled and shouted 
And called them by name: 
 
""Now Dasher, 
Now Dancer, 
Now Prancer, 
Now Vixen, 
On Comet, 
On Cupid, 
On Doner 
An' Blitzen!"" 
 
To the top of the porch, 
To the top of the wall, 
Now dash-away, dash-away, 
Dash-away all! 
 
As dry leaves 
Before the wild hurricane fly, 
When they meet with an obstacle 
Mount to the sky. 
 
So, up to the housetop 
The courses they flew, 
With a sleigh full of toys 
And St. Nicholas too! 
 
And then in a twinkling 
I heard on the roof, 
The prancing and pawing 
Of each little hoof! 
 
As I drew in my head 
And was turning around, 
Down the chimney St. Nicholas 
Came with a bound! 
 
He was dressed all in fur 
From his head to his foot, 
And his clothes were all tarnished 
With ashes and soot! 
 
A bundle of toys 
He had flung on his back, 
And he looked like a peddler 
Just opening his pack! 
 
His eyes how they twinkled, 
His dimples how merry, 
His cheeks were like roses, 
His nose like a cherry! 
 
His drawl little mouth 
Was drawn up like a bow, 
And the beard of his chin 
Was a white as the snow! 
 
The stump of his pipe 
He held tight in his teeth, 
And the smoke it encircled his head 
Like a wreath! 
 
He had a broad face 
And a round little belly, 
That shook when he laughed 
Like a bowl full of jelly! 
 
He was chubby and plump, 
A right jolly old elf, 
I laughed when I saw him 
In spite of myself! 
 
A wink of his eye 
And a twist of his head, 
Soon gave me to know 
I had nothing to dread! 
 
He spoke not a word 
But went straight to his work, 
And filled all the stockings, 
Then turned with a jerk! 
 
An' laying a finger 
Along side his nose, 
An' giving a nod, 
Up the chimney he rose! 
 
He sprang to his sleigh, 
To his team gave a whistle, 
An' away they all flew 
Like the down of a thistle. 
 
But I heard him exclaim 
As he drove out of sight, 
""Happy Christmas to All, 
And to all a Goodnight!""",Twas the Night Before Christmas,2012
Mitchell Ayres,"When I was but a youngster
Christmas meant one thing,
that I'd be getting lots of toys that day

I learned a whole lot different 
when Mother sat me down 
and taught me to spell 'Christmas' this way: 
 
'see' is for the Christ child, born upon this day
'H' for herald angels in the night
'are' means our Redeemer
'I' means Israel 
'S' is for the star that shone so bright 
'T' is for three wise men, they who travelled far 
'M' is for the manger where He lay 
'A' 's for all He stands for 
'S' means Shepard's came 
 
And that's why there's a Christmas day! 
And that's why there's a Christmas day!

Where the sky meets the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me

Bali ha'I
Bali ha'I
Bali ha'I

Someday you'll see me,
Floating in the sunshine,
My head's sticking out from a low flying cloud

You'll hear me call you,
Singing through the sunshine
Sweet and clear as can be

""come to me, bali ha'I""
""come to me""
""come to me""

Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra,"Lost in the shuffle, I've drifted and strayed 
Bruised by the city, bewildered, betrayed 
With a heart heavy laden with faltering strides 
I have come to the bridge, to the line that divides 
 
What am I doing up here in a daze 
As I gaze at the cold river bed 
Why do I ask myself, shall I go back 
When I seem to be going ahead
 
To black moonlight
Where everything reflects your color 
Darkness that is endless 
Nights that leave me friendless, blue 
 
Black moonlight
You make the lights of Harlem duller 
Just like me you're faded, jaded and degraded, too
Why must you send 
Ebony moonbeams, depressing, distressing 
Like shadows of love that are gone
 
Where will it end 
Will it spread on to the starlight, the sunlight 
And darken each promise of dawn 
 
Black moonlight
I've lost all power to resist you 
Madly, I await you, even though I hate you 
Black, black moonlight",Black Moonlight,2002

Can I doodle, I can't get it outta my noodle

A bushel an' a peck and a hug around the neck
Hug around the neck and a barrel an' a heap
Barrel an' a heap an' I'm talkin' in my sleep

(Oh, I love you a bushel an' a peck), how much?
A bushel an' a peck though you make my heart a wreck

Make my heart a wreck and you make my life a mess
Make my life a mess, yes a mess of happiness

Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra,"If you were only mine,
if you were only mine
I know the sun would shine for me . . .
I'd find my happiness,
to be in your caress,
my every fear and every tear, I'd lose dear . . .
If you could understand,
I know you'd lend a hand,
to all the dreams I've planned for you . . .
Life would be so divine,
I'd worship at your shrine,
Sweetheart, if you were only mine! 

Life would be so divine,
