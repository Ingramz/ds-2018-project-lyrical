Nneaka Morton,"[Chorus]
I will always be there
I always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll be there

I'm bout to meet my comrade on the busy Ave where we clash
Trying to see how much gritty cash this city has
Meantime harass every bitty that pass
And then here you come with your pretty ass
All petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street
Your for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete
You got your head on tight and when you talk I like
For me and you two different walks of life
I'm in the streets too much I pack the heat too much
Put too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch
You try to get in contact I don't respond back
Where the god at come back smellin' like cognac
Baby beware I'm tryin' my best to be fair
Aye yo-the key here is repair this love we share
Cause if we care we would prepare to see clear
Eye to eye we here as long as you be there

[Chorus]

Yo, I'm startin' to understand it you like your evenings enchanted
Love is bond, organic, restaurants romantic
Want me to take your hand and take you around the planet
But I take advantage and take you for granted
Call collect explainin' why I ain't came yet
I ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check
Blow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again
Don't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end
Talk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear
Make you role in your bed when your thug ain't there
Somewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud
Open my file baby you should know me by now
Tryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites
Find my place in life plus I like to hold mics
It might be seven whole days and seven whole nights
But yo it's gonna be alright just hold tight

[Chorus]

(3rd verse)
Who said something good won't last forever
I know too much of any thing is bad whatever
Long as we have good and bad times together
Bad times make the good times that much better
Peaches and cream, diamonds and ice
You like pieces of dreams you shinin' in the night
Features of a Queen and your mind frame is tight
Timin' is right get ready for the time of your life
You speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds
Apparently we know it's no guarantee
But losin' you boo who smooth as you
You unusual this is for the cool in you
And for the chill I will forever come real
Your appeal makes it hard to keep my love concealed
All it took was one look, one kiss, one meal
Now come feel, let's make this a done deal

Nneka,"You keep pushing the blame on our colonial fathers
You say they came and they took all we had possessed
They have to take the abuse that they have caused
Our present state with their intruding history
Use our goodness and nourishment in the name of missionary

Lied to us, blinded slaved us, misplaced us
Strengthen us, hardened us then they replaced us
Now we got to learn from pain
Now it is up to us to gain some recognition
If we stop blaming we could get a better condition

Wake up, world
Wake up, world, wake up and stop sleeping
Wake up Africa, wake up and stop blaming
Open your eyes, eyes, stand up and rise
Road block, oh, life penalty

Why do we want to remain where we started?
And how long do we want to stop yourselves from thinking?
We should learn from experience
That what we are here for this existence
But now we decide to use the same hatred to suppress our own brothers

It is so comfortable to say
Racism is the cause and it's not the cause
But this time it is the same color chasing and biting us
Knowledge and selfishness that they gave to us
This is what we use to abuse us

Wake up world, wake up and stop sleeping
Wake up Africa, wake up and stop blaming
Open your eyes, your eyes, stand up and rise
Road block, oh, life penalty

Those who have ears let them hear
Brothers who are not brainwashed take ruins and rest
Pick them up and stick them back together
This is the only way we can change this African weather

Lied to us, blinded us, they slaved us, misplaced us
Strengthen us, hardened us then they replaced us
Now we got to learn from pain

Wake up world, wake up and stop sleeping
Wake up Africa, wake up and stop blaming
Open your eyes, your eyes, stand up and rise
Road block, road block

You got to, you got to see the truth

Nneka,"You said you'd be there for me
In times of trouble when I need you and I'm down
And likewise you need friendship
It's from my side pure love but I see lately things have been changing
You have goals to achieve
But the roads you take are broad and heartless
The wounds you make you are no aware
You throw stones
Can you see that I am human I am breathing
But you don't give a damn

Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you see the pain you're causing
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you see the pain you're causing

Blood blood blood blood is rushing

And now the world is asleep
How will you ever wake her up when she is deep in her dreams, wishing
And yet so many die
And still we think that it is all about us
It's all about you
You sold your soul to the evil and the lust
And the passion and the money and you
Innocent ones die, people hunger for decades
Suffer under civilized armed-robbers, modern slaveholders

Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you see the pain you're causing
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you see the pain you're causing

Blood blood blood keeps rushing

Evaded, eliminated, erased, interrogated
Our tradition, our love for our fellow countrymen
Our property, our resources our pride

Can you feel my heart beating
No no no you don't

Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you feel the pain you're causing

Admit the stains on our, our chest, our hands

See how sad it looks
Come let us take a break, go into ourselves and
Find the peace and silence saying

Nneka,"Government politics, system policies
Money, banks, foundation and discoveries
Mischievious and self centered development strategies
Uneffective enough not to affect the physics and the spirits of mankind
In short and infact where do we go from here when we lack love in our hearts
When we lack an open heart and lie to ourselves and the one that truly loves, that we love
Truly we don't really give a fuck
Another day has passed my conscience is hunting me one small form
E to face this next temptation that is coming up now
The flesh has overcome the spirit, eyes opened but shot, sight blurred
Can't see the road because I am scarred of the lights
I gotta go on, I gotta move on, we gotta go on, we gotta move on
Cause if you don't search for the truth your soul will definitely remain undone

Maintain your focus
The misery is all around you
The misery, the envy
It is hard staying away from the temptations of the world
Maintain your mind, see

Is it the drugs? Is it the men? Is it the money? Is it the fame?
Do not need all this to find myself
Have met my shadow a thousand times
I know how it feels to be untrue to oneself
See would you hold back the things that urged you to speak your mind?
Living in the bondage, in if clauses for the rest of your life
You want to lie in systems custody, your soul strip for free
Living in the bondage, in if clauses for the rest of your life
You want to lie in system custody, your soul strip for free

It is hard staying away from the temptations of the world

Temptations of this world
You see the demons coming out of you
They reveal themselves to you and yes you can see your truth

Oh no no, got to maintain your mind
In this world of pain
In this world of sin
In this world of hate

What am I without my shadow
What is life without knowing that death comes
What is a song without a melody

Needed to search myself to go back
Had no signs of hope before lost in the darkness
Not knowing what my fate makes of me
And oh ignoring the fellowship accompanying me
There were swamps, slums, gottas, brunks, love songs, 
Hidden pleasure, ignored passion, secret worship, 
Quiet movement and undissolved self loving
Now I know God has brought me here for something

What is the mind without the heart
What am I without my shadow
What is life without knowing that death comes
What is a song without a melody

My head says I lost my way
But my heart knows that my life is destined in anyway
A long road running towards stops where I pay
Pay, pay for what I have taken and is got what I deserving
Oh God knows very well that my sins are always before me
Yes he gives and he takes and he wounds and he breaks, 
He destroys and he builds and still I know
That his love is endless grace

What is the mind without the heart

Camuflage killing
Civilization to the extent of imprisoning me
Freedom is what you speak
Your god, is whom I seek
For all you have, you have because someone else grief
Impose your lies on me nothing is left of me
A living dead to function in your in your own reality
In my head, I picture paradise, Jehovah and the antichrist
These are the end of the days
Your footprints engraved in the pavement of a demonic ways
Pump me with your droug, so I cannot feel me
Take back all your love, for you have deceived me
You compite with god

Oh god knows why God knows why

I am just a product of a different type of living life
I am just a public enemy, that don't believe the hype
I am from the jungle,where some people never see the light
I guess we nocturnel, black fire files
Might burn you a while I serve you with the diatrive
I got this message to to deliver to the riot squad
Just to let them know I answer to a higher god
Self style, man child in the promise land
Starring like a child soldier on a sonogram
He is in a feeble position
Bow and needle precision, it is destiny it was writen

God knows why Only god knows why
Oh god knows why God knows why

Turn the stone into bread,in the wilderness I hunger
Give me more of it for my lust goes far, eyonda (after life)
I stole the apple of wisdom, I now see I am naked
I have no shame, I have made love, I am no longer sacred
Burn the incense, prays to the sun, pay is intense,and so I lie I mourn

Would we ever defeat, the dark is in the heart of mankind

All petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street
Your for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete
You got your head on tight and when you talk I like

Put too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch

Cause if we care we would prepare to see clear

I ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check
Blow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again
Don't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end
Talk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear
Make you role in your bed when your thug ain't there
Somewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud
Open my file baby you should know me by now
Tryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites
Find my place in life plus I like to hold mics
It might be seven whole days and seven whole nights
But yo it's gonna be alright just hold tight

You speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds
Apparently we know it's no guarantee
But losin' you boo who smooth as you
You unusual this is for the cool in you
And for the chill I will forever come real

I wanted love and here it was

To turn back the clock, to say I will excuse myself,
I'm here to respect you

One and one is two, I lost the vibration
Nine to nine, there is no sunshine
Without you my life has no colours and no time

Rap 2:
Walking - till the end of the road
For now and forever, I'll share your load
When you're next to me, I felt so strong
Seasons are changing, and now you're gone
Feels long - but it's the right time
Cuts like a knife, inside my mind
This is my sign - the real love of my life
Get out of my heart, I will survive

Rap 3:
You're so special - this is the right word
The more I think, the deeper it hurts
Love - no isolation
Think about togetherness, is my imagination

Looking down to see about how much higher I am
Another cool wind comes through, brushes my skin

I gather my thoughts the further and further I go
With some luck I just might keep on climbing

So high the climb (So high the climb)
I can't turn back now
Must keep climbing up to the clouds
So high the climb (So high the climb)
Can't turn back now

I can't turn back now (can't turn back now)

I must now prevail with no question
Have no time to stop
Onward to the top of the mountain
And I, I can't turn back now
It's so very high but I can't turn back now
If I keep it up, I'm gonna make it
I'm so very close can't you see

No Doubt,"For a long time I was in love
Not only in love, I was obsessed
With a friendship that no one else could touch
It didn't work out, I'm covered in shells

And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life
And all I needed was a simple man
So I could be a wife

I'm so ashamed, I've been so mean
I don't know how it got to this point
I always was the one with all the love
You came along, I'm hunting you down

Like a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight
And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life

If we met tomorrow for the very first time
Would it start all over again?
Would I try to make you mine?

I always thought I'd be a mom
Sometimes I wish for a mistake
The longer that I wait, the more selfish that I get

Guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare
With their eyes
Oh I'm just a girl
Take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh, I've had it up to here!

Oh, am I making myself clear?

I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be!

Oh I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb
Make me worry some
Oh I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to
Is making me numb
Oh I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum there's no comparison

Oh, I've had it up to!

The clumsy boots, peek-a-boo roots that people think so dashing

Of deep meaning philosophies where only showbiz loses

No Empathy,"Daddy was a cop on the east side of Chicago 
Back in the U.S.A,. back in the bad old days 

In the heat of a summer night, in the land of the dollar bill 
When the town of Chicago died, and they talk about it still 
When a man named Al Capone 
Tried to make that town his own 
And he called his gang to war with the forces of the law 

I heard my mama cry 
I heard her pray the night Chicago died 
Brother what a night it really was 
Brother what a fight it really was, yes indeed 

I heard my mama cry 
I heard her pray the night Chicago died 
Brother what a fight the people saw 
Brother what a night the people saw, yes indeed 

And the sound of the battle rang 
Through the streets of the old east side 
Til the last of the hoodlum gang had surrendered up or died 
There was shouting in the streets 
And the sound of running feet 
And I asked someone who said 
About a hundred cops are dead 

I heard my mama cry 
I heard her pray the night Chicago died 
Brother what a night it really was 
Brother what a fight it really was, yes indeed 

I heard my mama cry 
I heard her pray the night Chicago died 
Brother what a fight the people saw 
Brother what a night the people saw, glory be 

And ther was no sound at all but the clock upon the wall 
And the door burst open wide, and my daddy stepped inside 
And he kissed my mama's face 
And he brushed her tears away

Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

To go out and make discreet observations

Or was it just a waste of time?

No Fun at All,"Coming over to your house I see you waiting
Turning over all the things I used to treasure
Falling into something new and undetermined
Not to worry, second best is not the end of life

Burning bridges, empty words but not forgotten
Empty fridges, dusty rooms and burning ashtrays
Failing for you, taking every chance to prove it
Got to worry see the things I cherish start to slip

I don't know what you want me to be
'cause you push me around till I can't even breathe
I don't know what you are doing to me
You have turned me into something ugly and cheap

Indecision, tender words with hidden meanings
Try to listen, tolling bells is all I'm hearing
Count the hours till they fade and all's forgotten
In the passion nothing seemed to matter at the time",Second Best,2003
No Good,"I know there's pain
Why do lock yourself up in these chains?
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind
Is it really fair to feel this way inside?

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry

Things'll go your way

You could sustain
Or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness
You got yourself into your own mess
Lettin' your worries pass you by
Don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind?

No I.D.,"Yeah yeah, now check the method

No time to get all excited, just write it
From the inside let the pen slide, and spread
The ink on the papyrus, come understand this (what?)
Paint the canvas, givin you my vision
To mold you, compose you
Get a picture of the scene, then get an exposure
Words out my cipher, the life of my circle
Pain trapped inside of me, Cabrini to Ida B., don't lie to me
You want me in your needle
Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch
I excite your brain til I'm out of your system
Beat digger, not a nigga or a negro I figure you're
The winner of the bread, precede your thoughts
'fore they come into your head (yo kid kinda nice!)
From the word, I speak, unique, clear and concise
Heads I'm boring, soaring to a new height of flight
And then fight the night
With a light to gain sight make your competition say AIGHT

I want you to see me when you do you look and fear
I dilate pupils that's cornea than a retina

When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me
I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me
CHEAP ASS NIGGAZ! Go and purchase it
I ain't do all this work for shit
My style's my child I gave birth to it
Like an immaculate conception, clean I came
Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name
I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes
It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes
I love black thighs, you sisters better realize
The real hair and real eyes get real guys
So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind
I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon be like
""I can't believe it! I got shot!""

But I got the Rid, for my dick
And the crab MCs that be all over it

I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Kendall
I remember me and Dion tried to get into Mendel
I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in

I’m hearing fuckin’ voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds off for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was frío
That’s Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pinot noir style, better with time
I’m gambling with watches getting better with time
So I’mma ride this out for long as God allow me

Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas that’s behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I’ve seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining 'til I die man
I’m a rare diamond that’s hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K
47 To 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ain’t no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me diamond

Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I’m rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin’ that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say “I need that fadeaway”
Had a crush on what’s her name, the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you can’t take his chain away
Real play you can’t take his game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you can’t take my dame away, devil in a red dress
But she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day to day to day to day

Catch me in court, beating all kinds of cases

There ought to be somebody by my side

The band is better than the one last night

I?ve been known to blow money on a stranger?s eye

To nurse my wounds and heal my pride


There ought to be somebody in my car

To drive me passed my wrecked up heart

Leave the past that?s fading slow

And take her further than she wanna go


Chorus:

There ought to be something right with just being me

Letting go of what is out of my reach

I do what I can, Live my life

There ought to be somebody by my side


There ought to be somebody by my side

This house is empty and it don?t feel right

But I cannot hold back the hands of time

It looks like another wasted night


Repeat Chorus


Bridge:

If I could find someone I know we would both reach out for a dream

I found a love I could never leave

",By My Side,2006
No Justice,"

Written by: Stephen Allen Davis / Boo Hewerdine


Confrontation ain?t your thing

You say that laying blame won?t do no good now

So before you go and say goodbye

And move on with your life I wish you would somehow

Give me a reason to believe

That everything you?re gonna leave behind

Is a waste of time and ain?t worth fighting for


Chorus:

Slam the door, yell out loud

Don?t hold it in, let it out

Put me down, put up a fight

I can be wrong, you can be right

Just get mad, is that too much to ask

But, don?t walk away, walk away like that

Don?t walk away, walk away like that


Kicking me in the teeth would be better than leaving me untouched

So try

Cause all the words we never say

The wars unwaged have started stacking up

So high

There may not be a way to make you

Wanna stay and try to save our love

But if it can?t be like it was before


Repeat Chorus


Give me a reason to believe

That everything you?re gonna leave behind

Is a waste of time and ain?t worth fighting for

",Don't Walk Away,2006
No Justice,"

Written by: Steve Rice


I know I missed you party again,

I?ve always had trouble being the man that you want me to be

And I know you wore that red dress you were shining like a diamond

I?m somewhere down in Texas trying to find a way

To give you everything


Chorus:

Baby I can?t sleep when I can?t get you out of my mind

You cut so deep in this dark hotel room I can?t unwind

Set me Free so I can run to you again

Take me back, take me home to your red dress


We knew it wouldn?t be easy living this way

Hours on hours days upon days on a hard worn highway

I know I made a promise that I intend to keep

I said I?d never leave you now you?re all alone in my sheets

You?re wondering where I am


Solo


Repeat Chorus


",Red Dress,2006
No Justice,"

If I gave you up for gone, quit all of this holding on, would I wake up tomorrow feeling better? What if hopes the only thing keeping me from crumbling, the last thread holding the pieces together. And it?s hard to tell the one that i?ll regret just letting you know that I?m not giving up yet.


(Chorus)


Such an ordinary day, you know the one you went away. I?ve relived each minute a million times. And all the things I almost did then didn?t do instead keep running around in circles in my mind. This heavy heart just won?t let me rest till I?ve convinced myself that I tried my best.


(Chorus)


And I wonder where could you be? I wonder why, did you leave without me.



Chorus:

I want to run out to the edge of town, scream your name for hours out loud. Turn this world upside down to find you. I want to build myself a time machine, to go back and change everything to see you here with me. That?s the closest I?ve ever been to who I want to be.

And the sun was gone
Turned on some music
To start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
More than a feeling
When I hear that old song they used to play
I begin dreaming
When I see my marianne walk away
I see my marianne walking away
So many people have come and gone
The faces fade as the years go by
And still I recall as I wonder on
As clear as the sun in the southern sky
More than a feeling
When I hear that old song they used to play
I begin dreaming
When I see my marianne walk away
I see my marianne walking away
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away
She slipped away

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

A part of life we cannot hide
Although it's fact
We still deny

In disbelief of what I see
It just don't seem real to me

Facing internal strife
Pacing the walk of life
Withering with the breeze
Holding on to memories
Burning it in my mind
Veracities of mankind
The limits beyond what you percieve
Your soul's alive but does it breathe!

I lie with greiving sighs
Questions running through my mind
Answers lagging far behind
My mind is tired of trying
To see beyond what man can see
Can I face reality

Searching my head for a truth yet unsaid
I brace every breath as I lie in my bed
The bleeding I hide from this torn heart inside
Where do I go when we cross the other side

Black is my fear, faith my despair
Wake me, will you wake me
When the end is near?

Can you see the way
The game you play is not for keeps
Clear as glass but hard to see
Your manifested destiny

Another challenge of life I will test
I am changing, I am changing
All who I am.

No more time for any distractions
And walk away from any detractions
I have taken, I have taken
All that I can.

Cut-I'm never gonna get away
If I don't ever make this change
Cut the weight and
Fuck all the human waste

Cut-they're never gonna take away
The vision that I portray
No time to waste
I cut all that's in my way

With a breath of a fresh new light
I will start again
And say goodbye to all of my fake friends
Rearranging, rearranging all that I have

Remove myself from more than I need
Separate from those who doubt me
I am changing, I am changing
All that I am

Cut-I'm never gonna get away
If I don't ever make this change
Cut the weight and
Fuck all the human waste

Cut-they're never gonna take away
The vision that I portray
No time to waste
I cut all that's in my way

close my eyes and take a look at my life
Think of all the ways that I've been denied
Is it pride or is it timing
It's taking time but the road I'm finding

Healing back now from the
Wounds that I've made
Stabbed myself a thousand times this way
To keep my pace up with the hill I'm climbing
I'll cut the ties of those that bind

close my eyes and take a look at my life
Think of all the ways that I've been denied
Is it pride or is it timing
It's taking time but the road I'm finding

Cut-I'm never gonna get away

That I've tried to understand
But something within me
Just holds me back and says I can't

I'm fading, degrading
Trapped inside this cycle hell
Fighting, and hiding
A persisting lust that I must fill

Wanting to give you
All I can that's in my will
But inside it has rule
The more I grab the more I spill

Decided, divided
I cannot drop this burning coal
Trusting, and lusting
Competing sides strive for control
Why?!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Falling torn by deceit, approaching self-defeat
The mental light that's hounding, pounding
I'm falling

A feeling of sadness
Follows me with my mistakes
Scarred in my conscience
Haunting every move I make.

Alone, drifting miles apart
I'm found, with an empty heart
The sound, of peace is calling me
I wait, for a time of ease

Can't you see, that I am weak
Can't you see, I'm falling.

Vision of life that's now compromising me

There's something that is not seen
Your severing the esteem
Tore apart the seams

don't come fuckin' with me
Fuck the hype you feed
Leave the altitude
With the multitude
Hype is all you need
To plant the poison seed
Keen and wicked tool
Lures the mindless fool

Devote your mind
To self utilizing
When all the while
You're chasing a hopeless dream

There's something that you cannot feel
Oblivious to what's real
Soon your life will yield

This is my way

Nothing can break me
Or take away the need
It is my fate

With frustrations inside
Will I ever change
This part of me

In my mind
I have seen
This was not

Took my pain
And I made it something

The other day I was hanging with some friends
Going around the room talking about our favorite noise
I said I had a brother in the Backstreet Boys
So everyone screamed

Hey is this some kinda trick

Yea, which one is he?

The blonde one, Nick
Then the cutest girl said:

I have to see their show
But I have no ticket, Aaron
How can I go

Your wish is my command
See it's no problem, hon
In fact I'll get some tickets here for everyone
All I gotta is pick up the celly
And its a done deal
Let me call Nick and tell him

By the way Aaron, if you could, while you're at it
Can you hook up some seats
For my friends and my parents?

So I said to myself, well heck, why not?
There's nothing that can beat the connection I got

Aaron, oh Aaron
What are you going to do?
You make empty promises oh so big
(Aaron: man)
How gonna make them come true?

What are we going to do with you?

Always a-makin' a fool

Hello?

Hey Nick
I need a favor from you, dude
I promised people tickets
So you gotta come through

Sure, bro, how many do you need?

1, 2, uh, 3003

What?!
I can get you maybe a dozen
You can't promise seats to everyone and their cousin
What did you do? 
How'd you get in this mess?

I was talkin' to this girl

Hold your breath
I know the rest
Guess you better get yourself a whole lotta money

For 3000 tickets?
Nick, that's isn't funny.
How'm I supposed to pull that off in so little time?

You got me, Aaron
That's your problem, not mine

Aaron, oh Aaron
(Aaron: What do I do?)
What are you going to do?
You make empty promises oh so big
(Aaron: What?)
How gonna make them come true?
Aaron, oh Aaron, 
(Aaron(annoyed): What?)
What are we going to do with you?
(Aaron: I don't know)
Always a makin' a bigger mistake 
(Aaron: So, it was just one mistake)
Always a-makin' a fool
(Aaron: Whatever)

How in the world can he do that to me?
I thought we were blood.
I thought we were family.
We're gettin' to the show
We'll get good seats
Everyone on the bus, you're all coming with me
I'm tellin' you guys when we get to the gate
He can never say ""no"" when he looks at my face
Hook me up! Nick, Man, I swear I'll pay you back

Well come to think about, we need an opening act.

What do you want me to do: tell jokes; dance; act?

Nah, I want you on stage, I want you to rap.

Let's pretend that it's me,
And I'm everything you'll ever need

CHORUS:
What are you waiting for?
Are you crazy?
Open up your eyes and see what's going on, baby
There's someone at your door
Her heart is racing 
Come on and make your move
What are you waiting for baby?
END CHORUS

Now here's a clue: her favorite color's blue
That's how she'll feel if she can't be with you
Cause you're the one who takes her breath away
When you look that way

So just for fun
Let's pretend that it's me
And I'm everything you'll ever need

CHORUS

I hear there's something good that waits for you
Check it out. It just might be true
There's so much more to her that meets the eye
You'll never know it if you don't try

I walk into a pile of shit
After that I hit my head on a stop sign
so I cross the street and stumble into the store
I feel like shit, I live in a ditch.
My life is hell; my house smells
It's 3:14 as I get into the store
Walking down the frozen food section I touch the frozen burritos
I pass the deli department
and put my fingers in some free sample cheese dip
I finally see the sunflower seed aisle
There it is. The gleamy view

He doesn't care about what happens
If you see him walking down the street

You had no reason, I saw no warning sign
You think I'll stick around, you must be on glue

becoming a problem you can't hide?

No Use for a Name,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope, goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
Solitaire
And by himself it's easy to pretend 
He'll never love again
Ohhh

So where is Jesus now and where do I belong
What is faith if there is no proof?

Humans do their worst the find out what that is
A mystery known to many as the divine, it's their dime

We read the whole thing wrong
And guidance should be used like a tool

And the leaves dance and play after you
Take my hand and hold it as you would a flower
Take care with my heart, oh darling, she's made of glass

And the birds cease to sing when you rise
Ride easy your fairy stallion you have mounted
Take care how you fly, my precious, you might fall down

In the pastel skies a sunset I have wandered
With my eyes and ears and heart strained to the full
I know I tasted the essence in the few days
Take care who you love, my precious, he might not know

With an overwhelming pain
And on yesterday's proud forehead

After years of wandering astray

Battling for breath, battling for blood
And a body of His own

But that would be my death
For while I've waited and debated
He has grown

Deep in my heart, I wish I could love him
Erase our past with a mother's embrace
I want to start fresh but within me I'm fearful
Will I find my oppressor in his tiny face?

You're kin to the winds, sister
But you've an alabaster frame

And you're too proud to admit that love is gone
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden
Too proud to admit, and much too strong
The landing was rough
And the seat belt unfastened

Now it's gone away

Now it's gone away

Reinvent yourself with space and time

You're kin to the stars, sister
But now your perfect body's maimed

Still you're to proud to admit that love is gone
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden
Too proud to admit, and much too strong
The landing was rough
And the seat belt unfastened

Now it's gone away
(And you gotta let go)
Now it's gone away

When I look into your eyes, I see your universe
And how much better your life could be, and how much worse
I see all that you've done to try and keep you hope intact

How your bright eyes reflected the African plains 
You told me of Laos and the Ivory Coast

You taught me to never hide my wings 
To strive for all the craziest things 
And always believe in the goodness men 
You told me all this 
And took off again

You're on your own path 

I remember you when you drank your beer 
And the crack in your voice when you said 
Don't you worry 
You know I must go, but I'll come back again
In the book of your face I could read your story 
A torch in the disillusioned night 
You raged and raged and raged 
Against the dying of the light 
And I still believe in the goodness of men

Noah and the Whale,"Last night, I had a dream
We were inseparably entwined
Like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine
Held together, holding each other
With no one else in mind
Like two atoms in a molecule
Inseparably combined

But then I woke from the dream
To realize I was alone
A tragic event, I must admit
But let's not be overblown
I'm gonna try to ride a love song
Just a sad, pathetic moan
And maybe I just need change
Maybe I just need a new cologne

But now I look at love
Like being stabbed in the heart
You torture each other from day to day
And then one day you part
Most of the time it's misery
But there's some joy at the start
And for that, I'd say it's worth it
Just as you play the shortest sharp on me

And if love is just a game
Then how come it's no fun?
If love is just a game
How come I've never won?
I guess maybe it's possible I might be playing it wrong
And that's why every time I roll the dice
I always come undone",2 Atoms in a Molecule,2008

And sun, sun, sun all down our necks

And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke

Noah and the Whale,"There's a boy with his head,
Pressed up to the window,
Of a bus heading out of town,
In his breath on the glass,
He draws with his finger,
A map of the roads they go down,
Circles of street lights,
Are the only signal,
That there's people out there in the black,
He waves goodbye, to the town he grew up in,
He knows that he'll never come back,

The night outside is five below,
His heart is pumping blood,
On his lips a perfect smile,
His eyes begin to flood,

Because tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,
Tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,


The rumble strip clack,
And the rattling frame,
Beat out a pulse on his head,
The engine hums, a humble tune,
A melody of rubber and lead,
Under lamp light glow,
And paradise stars,
An infinity of dancing white light,
He sees that his debt,
Is to experience only,
And not to those who'd plan out his life,

The night outside is five below,
The moon is in the sky,
His heart is full of perfect joy,
He whispers his goodbye,

Because tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,
Tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,

And tonight he's not gonna come back home,
Oh tonight he's not gonna come back home,
Oh tonight he's not gonna come back home,

In a quiet neighborhood where she's living without wings

Bruised ribs and rips on the side of her jeans

From the crooked clock tower to the borderline

To work it out but we just don't get along, yeah

She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more

That my baby she don't love me no more

Every way and everywhere

We could be sharing all we've got together

I've been too shy
That I'll never get to heaven

Will you and me
Be movin' and funkin' in time?
That sexy smile
And lips so sweet
You know you knock, knock, knockin' me off my feet
I could be your girl
Show you 'round the world
Show you what you mean to me

Do it soft or tough
Want to give you all kissin'

Boys may come and boys may go

Never give it up on material things

There ain't a data file they will come on time
When they try to play and mess with your mind
When you're looking for some one you can depend
Don't look any further than your own best friend

And now we are gonna do are own thing

I'm not the kinda girl to sit home and wait
For the phone to ring waiting on some date
Love chases with the weather out black the cats
Sometimes I just might change my mind

It's Billy on Mondays, Tuesdays Jack
Forget about bobby I don't want him back
And we phone them on again, my heart again

It makes me sick.
Stuck in a dead end job and I wanna quit.

Nobuo Uematsu,"Go on if you want it.
An otherworld awaits you
Don't you give up on it.
You bite the hand that feeds you.

All alone cold fields you wander
Memories of it, cloud your sight
Fills your dreams, disturbs your slumber
Lost your way, a fallen knight

Hold now, aim is steady
An otherworld awaits you.
One thousand years, you ready?
The otherworld it takes you

Go into the sand and the dust in the sky
Go now, there's no better plan than to do or to die
Free me pray to the faith in the face of the light
Feed me fill me with sin now get ready to fight

You know you will
You know you will
You know you know you know you know that you will
You know you know you know you know that you will

Fight fight fight
Fight fight fight
Fight fight fight

Hope dies and you wander
The otherworld it makes you
Dreams they rip asunder
The otherworld it hates you
Free now ride up on it
Up to the heights it takes you
Go on if you want it.

Dirt bikes popping wheelies by the cookout, that was that summer,
I was thirst to be plumper. It pays better but the risk was worst,
Save the fly leather copping kicks with the work.
It didnt work; I was fucken up the re-up.

Especially if the niggas up the block, sell garbage
Told it, crumbles all apart when you hold it
Wasn't naturally born a crook, I was molded
Drugs kept my uncles in the green, so I sold it
Even learned to smell a good grade through the packing
Headed Midwest and got financial backing
Started networking with the wheelies on credit
Any concepts of being robbed I was debited
Anybody get it, don't come a day later with the eigth money
Got to play it out, cause I said it

Get his neck so cold you would think he's lethargic (I'm froze up)

Though there seems there's no one to this pain 
Every time I close my eyes I pray for rain 
I pray for rain to wash away the strain 

You couldn't understand how much the pain weight 
So in the hood we love the rainy days 
Cause subconsciously we know the suns coming 
We love the winter cause we know the summers coming 
Remember I got locked the same night my son was coming 
All I could do is pray that they don't take me away 
And lord knows I have the angel's on my side 
They search the car I had the hammer in my ride 
A miracle on Flatbush Avenue I still made it back 
To say push when she was having you

Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play
Like a child at play

It's hard to say the things I feel for you today 
But now I know my heart will never be the same 
Girl I'm no toy for you to play with everyday 
I'll show you just the kind of game I like to play 

[Chorus]

Stop you can't lie to me anymore 
Stop you can't lie to me anymore 
Stop you can't lie to me anymore 
Stop you can't lie to me anymore 

No, no, no, no more lies  
No, no, no, no more lies  
No, no, no, no more lies  
No, no, no, no more lies

Noel,"I'm on fire 
My emotions run so deep 
You vowed to love me 
Is that a vow you keep 
Your smile's so tender 
You'll not be sighing a sweet surrender 
Your touch is so pleasing 
Makes me warm inside 
Makes me feel I'm alive 
And I can't resist the heavenly bliss 
The magic concealed in your kiss 
Must realize what I see in your eyes 
Takes me beyond the skies 

[Chorus] 
Silent Morning, I wake up and you're not by my side 
Silent Morning, You know how hard I try 
Silent Morning, They say a man's not supposed to cry 
Silent Morning, Why did your love have to be a lie 

I'm on fire 
And you're my every desire 
A living fantasy 
And you know just what to do for me 
I love the things you do 
Here open arms waiting here for you 
Words you whisper 
Makes me warm inside 
Makes me feel I'm alive 
And I can't resist the heavenly bliss 
The magic concealed in your kiss 
Must realize what I see in your eyes 
Takes me beyond the skies

And I can't resist heavenly bliss 
Magic concealed in your kiss 
Must realize what I see in your eyes 
Takes me to paradise

Noel,"It's been so long since I've seen you last 
There's so many things I have to ask 
Please stop awhile and let me have some time 
So tell me what have you've been doing with yourself 
I'd like to know 
To be honest you are always on my mind 
I think about the times we had 
So much good it makes me mad 
To think that you just walk away 
Without a word to say 

Chorus: 
The question that I have to ask since 
I have the chance to ask it is, after all this time gone by please tell me why 
The question that burns in my mind 
That I've been living with deep down inside 
Is why you never said goodbye 

The scars have taken time to heal 
But now you're here once more I feel 
The pains that were subdude return again 
Not a word you said to me 
Before you left that day 
Please tell me honestly and by my friend 
I think about the times we had 
So much good it makes me mad 
What did I do please let me know 
Was it so bad it made you go 

Chorus 

I will be stong 
You took our love 
And threw it all away

Noel,"Here come old flattop he come grooving up slowly 
He got joo-joo eyeball he one holy roller 
He got hair down to his knee 
Got to be a joker he just do what he please 

He wear no shoeshine he got toe-jam football 
He got monkey finger he shoot coca-cola 
He say ""I know you, you know me"" 
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free 
Come together right now over me 

He bag production he got walrus gumboot 
He got Ono sideboard he one spinal cracker 
He got feet down below his knee 
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease 
Come together right now over me 

He roller-coaster he got early warning 
He got muddy water he one mojo filter 
He say ""One and one and one is three"" 
Got to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see 
Come together right now over me",Come Together,1996
Noel,"Sittin' on my own
Chewin' on a bone
A thousand million miles from home
When something hit me
Somewhere right between the eyes

Sleepin' on a plane
You know you can't complain
You took your last chance once again
I landed stranded
Hardly even knew your name

I want to talk tonight
Until the mornin' light
'Bout how you saved my life
You and me see how we are
You and me see how we are

All your dreams are made
Of strawberry lemonade
And you make sure I eat today
You take me walking
To where you played when you were young

I'll never say that
I won't ever make you cry
And this I'll say I don't know why
I know I'm leavin'
But I'll be back another day

I want to talk tonight
Until the mornin' light
'Bout how you saved my life
(You saved my life)
I want to talk tonight
(I want to talk tonight)
'Bout how you saved my life

Noel,"Yo naci marcado con tu amor 
Yo senti tu respiracion 
Yo creci soÃ±ando con tu piel 

Aprendi a amarte sin querer 
Yo presenti tu tenias que ser 
Supe que te hiba a conocer 

why una noche al fin 
La luna se encendio 
Te vi fue magico 

[chorus] 

Te llevo en mi por siempre 
Fui hecho para ti 
Yo te imaginaba asi... 
Estabas dentro mio 
Desde antes del amor 
Ya eras parte de mi corazon 

Pensando en ti 
Mil noches pase 
El alma abri 
Why te encontre 
Eras tu la unica la misma... 

Desperte mi sueÃ±o es realidad 
Descubri la felicidad 
El destino no podia fallar 

hoy estas aqui 
Why se que no te hiras 
Seras mi musica...

Cada caricia amor 
Estaba escrita 
Con mi pasion 
Tenia cita 
Why en tu mirada yo lo 
Veia....

Ya eras mia...

Noel,"No puedo seguir, no quiero fingir
Aun me haces sentir
Pero no puedo evitar tanto llorar
Ven siéntate hay que hablar

No se que paso entre tu y yo
El fuego se apago
Donde quedo esa pasión que abrazo al corazon
Extraño el sabor de ese dulce amor que alimentaba nuestra vida

Somos lo que fue
Fuimos lo que ya no es
Vivimos del ayer
Todavía un milagro tal vez pueda haber

Estas junto a mi, estoy junto a ti
Pero hay un millón de millas que nos separan hoy
Si piensas que no hay mas remedio dímelo
Extraño el sabor de ese dulce amor que alimentaba nuestra vida

Somos lo que fue
Fuimos lo que ya no es
Vivimos del ayer
Todavía un milagro tal vez pueda haber",Somos lo Que Fue,2007
Noel,"No logre tomar
Distancia critica
Me vuelvo a equivocar
La historia típica
Y en un irracional
Impulso eléctrico
Mi corazón corre en tu dirección

Me hace tanto mal
Tu humor errático
Te sigo sin pensar
En automático
Si doy un paso mas
Ya no lograre volver
No se como retroceder

Una y otra vez
Tengo que luchar conmigo

Vivo en peligro
Y otra vez corro por la linea de fuego

Me besas y caigo en tu juego
Peligro de caer
En tu voz estoy perdido
No escucho
A mi sexto sentido

Usas contra mi
Tu voz hipnótica
De nuevo voy a ti
No tiene lógica
No se como cruzar
Un laberinto que yo construí
Quiero salir de aquí
Una y otra vez vuelvo a tropezar contigo

Vivo en peligro
Y otra vez corro por la linea de fuego
Me besas y caigo en tu juego
Peligro de caer
En tu voz estoy perdido
No escucho
A mi sexto sentido",Peligro,2011
