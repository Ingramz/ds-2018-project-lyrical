Creedence Clearwater Revival,"First thing I remember was asking papa, why
For there were many things I didn't know
And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand
Saying, someday you'll understand

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes

Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust
For there were many things I didn't know
When daddy went away, he said, try to be a man
And someday you'll understand

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes

And then one day in April, I wasn't even there
For there were many things I didn't know
A son was born to me Mama held his hand
Sayin' someday you'll understand

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes
Ooo someday never comes

Think it was September, the year I went away,
For there were many things I didn't know
And still I see him standing, tryin' to be a man
I said, someday you'll understand

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes

Creedence Clearwater Revival,"Was ridin' along side the highway, rollin' up the country side.
Thinkin' I'm the devil's heatwave, what you burn in your crazy mind?
Saw a slight distraction standin' by the road;
She was smilin' there, yellow in her hair;
Do you want to, I was thinkin', would you care.

Sweet hitch-a-hiker,
We could make music at the Greasy King.
Sweet hitch-a-hiker,
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

Cruisin' on through the junction, I'm flyin' 'bout the speed of sound,
Noticin' peculiar function, I ain't no roller coaster show me down.
I turned away to see her, woa! she caught my eye,
But I was rollin' down, movin' too fast;
Do you want to, she was thinkin' can it last.

Sweet hitch-a-hiker,
We could make music at the Greasy King.
Sweet hitch-a-hiker,
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

Was busted up along the highway, I'm the saddest ridin' fool alive.
Wond'ring if you're goin' in my way, won't you give a poor boy a ride?
Here she comes a ridin', lord, she's flyin' high.
But she was rollin' down, movin' too fast;
Do you want to, she was thinkin' can I last.

Creedence Clearwater Revival,"Well, I was born on a Sunday; on Thursday I had me a job.
I was born on a Sunday; by Thursday I was workin' out on the job.
I ain't never had no day off since I learned right from wrong.

I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see those bad times today

Creedence Clearwater Revival,"It's been an awful long time since I been home,
But you won't catch me goin' back down there alone.
Things they said when I was young are quite enough to get me hung.
I don't care! I don't care!

They came and took my dad away to serve some time,
But it was me that paid the debt he left behind.
Folks said I was full of sin, because I was the next of kin.

Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!
I don't care! I don't care!

All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune.

Wrote a song for everyone,
Wrote a song for truth.
Wrote a song For everyone
And I couldn't even talk to you. 

Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail.

If you see the answer, now's the time to say.
All I want, all I want is to get you down and pray.

Saw the people standin' thousand years in chains.

Creedence Clearwater Revival,"I went down to the station, just to take a ride.
I went down to the station, just to take a ride.
Found myself on a flatcar, yesterday behind.

Pullin' out from the platform, there was no brass band.
I pulled out from the platform, nobody raised a hand.
And there were no tears of regret from my runaway train.
Train, train, train, train.

Got no sand in my pocket, you know I ain't tied down.

Ain't no sand in my pocket, never do sit down.
I'm just a cross-tie walker, where the freight trains run.

Creedence Clearwater Revival,"Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune
Lookin' for a pot of gold
Thing got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Rode in on the Greyhound
I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friends
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

A man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar
For every song I've sung
Every time I had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in a Lodi again
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a Lodi again",Lodi,1981

Just what it was that made our dream begin.
It seemed like a good idea way back then.

But I'm wondering now what daydream took me in.

A way to share the trouble on my mind.

Said ""I was on my way""

And ran out of songs to play

For every song I've sung
Every time I've had to play

Creedence Clearwater Revival,"Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm,
I know; it's been comin' for some time.
When it's over, so they say,
It'll rain a sunny day,
I know; shinin' down like water.

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yesterday, and days before,
Sun is cold and rain is hard,
I know; been that way for all my time.
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow,
I know; it can't stop, I wonder.

Creeper,"Ex-lovers stalk the streets like shot arrows
We were burning down houses singing ""love has left us low""
You swim the water now even though you know exactly what lies below
Calling ""wolf"" each time you say you'll go

Eternity, in your arms

Wrap your heart in chain mail
We all die just to feel alive
Your friends become echoes of a life that you left behind

Floating like an astronaut in space
They tell me that purgatory's such a pretty place
But I never thought about living here
Heaven knows hell's gates are near
Forever seems like such a thing to waste

Eternity, in your arms

Wrap your heart in chain mail
We all die just to feel alive
Your friends become echoes of a life that you left behind

I've been a man, now a ghost
Two of the things that you fear most
Now is the end of this journey, what's left for me?
I've been a man, now a ghost
Two of the things that I fear most
Now is the end of this journey, what's left for me?

Now I'm left asking myself
If there's a god up watching me I just can't see
Then how could he build a world but still not fix you and me?

Suzanne, I want to die holding hands
Running from this world's demands
All those radio bands never made me feel

You were the girl that the world swung for, 
I was just a boy who sung until his lungs were sore
And in your diary you had an entry listing all your enemies, 
What you'd do to them and what you'd do it for

Now

Suzanne, I want to die holding hands
Running from this world's demands
All those radio bands never made me feel

Can music save your mortal soul? 
Can you teach me how to dance real slow?""

And in your hospital room at the midnight hour,
You had your boyfriend back just for half an hour
Past the landscaped shrubs and the rusted iron gate

So let's start a siege, you make a list of demands
Set the hostages free and we'll die holding hands

In tombs, ex-boyfriends bedrooms

And I'm tired of satans company
And it's bed time for the troubled sea

An they asked me if anyone who cares
Would join them for lunch with brandied pears
Bring Tracy we have her missing tears
Chasing Tracy is all I do Tracy's rotten

All the way through captain killjoy
Said that it was true two lovers lost
And searching for sat naked on the casino floor
Be brave boy show your broken wings but don't
Listen it hurts when Tracy sings

Chasing Tracy is all I do Tracy's rotten
All the way through captain killjoy
Said that it was true don't know what to do
Well I waited beneath the giving tree

And wondered if it would set me free rest
Gentle beneath the emerald sea there's Tracy
Cool hands of mercury chasing

I'm not as down as you
And there is a better way
To walk around these days
I don't believe in cool
I went to summer school
There was a man unkown
Stripped himself down to the bone
And he said
Hey, give me nothing, I'm from nowhere
And you don't know my name
He doesn't exist
Guess I just missed
Chance of a lifetime
Romance and white wine
Easy living
A new beginning

Blind as wood
And there's not a bone in my body that's good
I watch the tanks roll by
Disguising themselves as the ambulance
Who will race to the show
Waving flowers and caskets, oh no
It's just another win for hope and a heart made of tin
If I were alive I would slow dance in the ghetto
And sleep beneath the street
Doesn't exist
Guess I just missed
Chance of a lifetime
Christmas and sweet pine
Easy living
A new beginning

Left all alone
Watching breakups and afternoon drama
I must have lost my mind
She was trapped on the bus
With a kiss in her hand
And when the screams died down
Her lips were on fire
Spitting magic around
There was one more mile
It was long it was long
I would float on the thermals of laughter
High where I belong
It doesn't exist
Guess I just missed
Chance of a lifetime
Lemonade and sunshine
Easy living
It's just beginning

There's a spot where she's kissing me

Only see roads leading to nowhere

Crescent City Orchestra,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,1988
Crescent City Orchestra,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1988

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

I got fans that's dyin to see me flow
my favorite movie is CB-4
H$E Click you know we throwed
I'm 6 foot 1 on the digital scale
I'm a ghetto star and a man as well
and I'm all about my mail like a man in jail
I wonder if I put my tape out, can it sell?
only time will tell how many copies get sold
and I pray to god that I live to get old
'cause half of my homeboys already dead
and the other half doin time with the feds
I'm like the CincinnatI Reds  I'm playin ball for the pennant
and if I fall while I'm tryin I start from the beginning
they say practice make perfect and it really paid off
I'm my own boss now so I can't get laid off
and I'm gonna stay the same flip no matter what it takes
and I won't stop rappin no matter how much I make
Whether I'm rich or broke i'ma still crack jokes
and I never turn my back on mobbin foes

[chorus]

(Lil' Flip)
I done been through a lot of pain
at an early age ??? gave me silent game
I got knowledge but I didn't get it from college man
I'm not gonna change because I'm flyin private planes
and if I don't work, my pockets hurt
man it costs a lot of money livin on this earth
everybody got to shine but it's my turn
the early bird gets the worm that's what I learned
ever since I was a kid I had to ball
I don't smoke cigarettes and I hate alcohol
I went from being a janitor to a manager
when you become a star with me, want to dance with yah
I'm gonna keep my platinum teeth and my pants saggin
now everybody want to jump on the band waggon
I ain't braggin, because I got a little change, 
I ain't gonna let my head blow up 'cause I got a little fame
now when my cousin died things got a little strange
I know the block is hot just ask lil wayne
everybody dream about goin to hollywood
but look how fast I turned clover land into ???

[chorus]

(Lil' Flip)
everyday I'm on the paper chase
I gotta win first place in this paper race
a lot of kids around the world want to take my place
but momma said boy don't let nobody take your space
that's why I pay attention, so I can see
it ain't the army but I'm bein all I can be
so everyday I shop like I hit the lottery
I'm Lil' Flip that's the only thing I gotta be

Too much destruction, they claim we gotta make a change
So much trouble between each other cause ya ghetto life is strange

Philosophically, psychologically ya fixin' to be fucked
We goin' on this ride and ya bitch I'm gon' seduct
Nigga what, do I give a...
Ask the mound killer
Faces I remember they say dump him in the river
New Year's Eve 1999 nigga
Virtual reality, galaxy gettin' slicker
Me and Crime Boss and a nigga named Mister
Mike to a flight, had some glitz to deliver
Headed back to the Suave castle
I had to wrestle with this transvestite who had a dick like a lasso
In this castle was a midget with banana clippin'
Bootleg sniffin' or Mr. Mike'll fuckin' wicked
Ways infared waves hit his fuckin' chest
Blew his ass to bits, particles of green shit
It really goes to show ya that shit ain't changed
In year 2000 life still be strange",Strange,1996
Crime Boss,"(music plays in bakground)
(eightball we doin this shit once again
For you fake ass niggaz lay it the fuck down BEYITCH)

Intro/Chorus:

lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down

Verse One: Thorough

He's got his head tilted back on his face is a frown
Who's that nigga there it's Thorough bitch
So don't you clown, the sound and style, of Swisher after Swisher
Oh how I wish ya would step so I could hit ya
With wicked shit slick and swift
As I slaughter quick, oughta flip with fluents
To show you how we be doin in the Suave House federation; that is cat
You don't know how it's comin cause you don't where it's at
A mack of all trades, low cut, tight fade
We all get paid, so gets sprayed, so buster behave
My flavor's deep, please peep, I ain't soft
I represent at all cost and always got my niner out
So eeease back cause you marks can't hang with me
I got to much game in me, killin ain't no thang to me
Give a nut check, and I see you outta place
And I say that to say you're a BITCH, and you ain't got what it takes
To stop the funk mutha from freelance jackin
Brushes up on yo skills, cause fool I ain't lackin
With my hands on my dick, my click is thick so don't clown
Bitches we ain't playin you hoes lay it down

Chorus: repeat 2X

Verse Two: Eightball

It's Sunday morning, I'm stil yawnin from the night before
So much sess in my chest from the Swishers I smoke
OH NO!!!! Who is this hoe in the bed with me?
I remember the pussy but I don't remember her name G
Grab me Swisher cut it up and fill it with weed, hit that hoe
In the head, and tell her get out of my bed you damn freak
Hopped into the shower for an hour, it was hot as hell
Got dressed and ran a gold comb through my curls
Walkin out of the house slow, tellin that hoe come on let's go
First I crack up the music then, hit the switch on my six-four
Candy coated paint, got the bitches at the bus stop sick
But at the same time on my dick, thick
Beat a bitch quick I'm sick, full of Swishers and malt liquor
I'm a killa on them sticks, aggivated hallucinatin
Tryin to let go of my frustration
But some my luck, nigga gonna be a med patient
I gotta nine uzi AK, but that shit don't really matter
Cause if I gotta I will rat-a-tat-a
To splatter the guts of nigga with no nuts
And if you step to Suave you will have to lay it down

Chorus: repeat 2X

Verse Three: Crime Boss

Here comes the spy, that fry, get high, and get head rushed
The number one gangsta you can't touch or bust
So steppin is the wrong that you gots to come against me
You best to do a driveby and be prayin that you hit me
Cause nigga if you miss me I'ma have to draw my gat
And take yo ass way back, cause way back way back in the days
I used to beat dope fiends down just get paid
Live my life as a hustler, sellin drugs was my only J
My moms was a trick hoe I had nowhere to stay
And nigga that's fucked all my homies are loners
I've been on this for ten years so I'm known on corners
With bitches and prostitutes, pimps and killa thugs
Five-oh harrassin me, so Crime Boss is feelin slugs
A good guy gone bad, devious fuckin kid
Victim of ?, shit that my momma did
These dope beats comin up, I'm servin those clucker bitches
My beeper still goin off, I'm thinkin of addin riches
For dollars and sense, see I gotta have it goin on,
Or be trapped in this hole for too motherfuckin long
IT'S ON!!!!

Verse Four: MJG

Thirty buster in yard talkin shit bout a bitch
Claimin to be that bitch's family but they look like dirty tricks
Talkin about why did I meet that hoe, fuck the hoe
Charge the hoe, break the hoe, bust her inside her shit and go
Suckers how the fuck you think that MJG was gonna slip
On the only reason you mad cause you sister couldn't pussy whip
A back breakin, check takin, pimp nigga constantly makin
Money off you and your lady, nigga I ain't tradin
Why don't you niggaz understand I'm the pimp she's the hoe
Now that Itold you now you know, break that chain and let her go
Back on the track shake that ass, make my money
Make it fast, get yo head swoll bringin me checks bitch bring me cash
Drop yo panties, to let you start
To open your mouth, slurp and slob
On this dick you, he's the trick you's a bitch, do ya job
When you through, get up and go, get the cheese, hit the door
Catch a cab, back to the lab, bring my motherfuckin money hoe
Don't you ever front me with a lame lie about my bank
Oh shit, look out bitch, dump a bitch catch a plane
Yeah hoe now you know, I'm a pimp, and I'ma clown all upside yo head
Yeah bitch, I'ma lay it down

[Talking]
Nigga don't act like you don't know who I'm talkin' bout

(Fifty-Cent piece drops on table)
[Coinciding With 50 Cent's Intro on 'Get Rich Or Die Tryin']

[Scarface]
It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day.
It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day.

What it is?, nigga!
You don't wanna get involved with this here, nigga!
Is you a bitch nigga?, you a bitch nigga!
Look at yourself and then analyze me!
This motherfucking G
I can see the flaws in you, you got girl drawers in you
Girl flaws in you, a broad nigga!
I peeped your whole hand when you came in
I'm a man and I hang men
Play the game to win
All men should play on ten
Scarface 'finna do it again
Mash you nigga, smash through niggas
Don't make me upstrap and blast you niggas
Once again, it's only, its a must that I do it
Lock you in my scope and blast your ass through it
I'ma ruin
The image and the style that you used to
'cause you don't keep it real like you used to
A O.G., esa, fool to the hole fa'sho
So niggas slow your motherfucking roll
'Fore I come through with the same M-11
The Feds took from me, and shoot you in yo motherfucking stomach

[Chorus: Scarface]
You a Snitch Nigga, when you rat on yo friends
Bitch Nigga, when you steal cash from your kin
You'z a Snitch Nigga, running when the drama go down
You was bumpin at first what happened to the manly sound
You a Snitch Nigga, specializin' at bumpin' ya gums
Bitch Nigga, countin' all your bricks but all I see is crumbs
Snitch Nigga, ain't you tired of running your mouth
Can't even go home, cause a jacker might run in your house

[Verse: Z-Ro]
Now snitch fellas get up under my skin
That's why I don't mess with friends
Unless it's my Mac-10
I'm the king of the ghetto, Z-Ro the crooked in the flesh
Looking for head shots, 'cause snitch fellas get the bullet-proof vests
What you scared for?
What happened to all the tough ass talk
The way you was bumpin', I thought you had a taste for asphalt
Look at momma's baby out here starvin' for an ass-
Whippin', beefin', with a magician then drippin' now his ass missin
I'll be damned if I pull a rabbit out a hat
Well pull my 40 out of holster, and put a snitch fella on his back
WHOA!, look how I handled this .44
My conscience be screaming Z-Ro Murder Mo!, Murder Mo!
And these snitch fellas on ""How I'm Living"" try snitchin' on ""BET""
But got a restraining order against ""Murder I-N-see""
This how we ride, and ain't never gon' make a switch dude
Z-Ro the Crooked, I'll be damned if I be a snitch fool

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
It's Bun be I go back-a like ""Atlanta Black Crackers""
I back-slap a, back-packer, from here to Cakalacka{Carolina's}
Wack rapper, short stopper or dope kicker-inner
Bitch I ain't ya chicken hitter, bring the heater get you wetter(get you
Wetter)
With the 50 caliber magnum handgun
Step a bear off in his tracks, you better hope I don't land one
If I cock that bitch back..aim it at your chest
It'll be weeks before they even find the pieces to your vest
We releasers of ya stress..ease ya pain
Put this pistol in your mouth, you'll never need them trees again
The one ya momma warned ya about
Bun-why he's insane
Kill a kid over a quarter, (???)
(???), boy you fuckin with the triller
Z-Ro the young guerilla
And Face the born killa
(Bitch Nigga)
Feel around in the dark for dough
(Bitch Nigga)
You here the sound, see the spark, and you know

[Chorus]

With Mr. Gun-Clapper blast, who got murder for that killer slash
Thug rapper, as these niggas begin to come after

Is it Mr. Mike or did I change my name to Victor
In the middle of the fight
Quiet, shh, on the set, light up ya blunts and cigarettes
The richer G's get, the bitcher these niggas
My picture gets painted like Leonardo de Vinci, fully of envy
Texas was the spot niggas got shot and fucked ya memories
Send me the flyest MC that's tryin' to see
And Suave come pound, they got hung, broke down to the highest degree
Well I be, the bitch want to fuck Mike for free
Either slide me a G or get the fuck up out my ride see
My oozy weighs a ton, when you niggas see me run
Got game to fuck a nun, blame my gun
I leave you shakin' son of a bitch, I'm rich
I'm quick to hit chu' up (Nigga)
It's them strange motherfuckers that don't give a fuck


I was born and brought up where these streets be the key
Erasin' suspicious and heartless niggas on the streets
Some live in poverty, even though a nigga be slangin' dope
And dodgin' the Feds cause them bastards want me broke
Back flashes of prison, for ninety days I'm doin' bad
No money for books so every day I'm livin' mad
Born to be tough through all these miseries and pain
Standin' strong through these struggles of this deadly game
Visions of body bags and my homies closed caskets
Illusions of prison and pistols pressures that I blastin'
I'm out to live with no time to play
I got the tendencies to kill in relentless ways
Straight up, cause life is a trick bitch, if you weep and reek
You stuck outta luck, seekin' for relief
Too much destruction, they claim we gotta make a change
So much trouble between each other cause ya ghetto life is strange

Philosophically, psychologically ya fixin' to be fucked

Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist,

Homegurl bow down when you see me because I'm comin up fresh

But I got a sexy mouth, hair is done and nails are too
And I match from head to toe, then to top it off
I'm rockin' 6-inch black stilettos hoe
Different color everyday that's just to match the mood I'm in
Silver, red, grey, and black lookin' this good should be a sin

Oh, around and around I go 
You got me going in circles 
Oh, around and around I go 

First you go and tell me this 
Then you go and doin that

You never give me straight facts 
Comin' at me with these stories 
Taken up a playa time 
You seemed confused up in yo head 
And you can not make up your mind 
I'd be the first one to listnin'

First time for ya lovy dubbi 
And now he call me his homie 
Wishy washy kinda feelin 
Tryna play wit my emotions 
And mumbled the words I love you 
Went then said that he was jokin'
Stuffed up in the mind 
Tough love is what he calls it 
I don't read between the lines 
Now you need to get the talkin'
Spell it out and make it clear 
Don't tell me what I wanna hear 
Yes or no jus' goin' and say it

Once I stepped on the scene 
Now my body once I got it

Bitch nigga you don't know me nigga you don't know me

Now its a bunch of niggas hatin on the mob since we came on
Niggas talkin shit cause they broke and they ain't on
Who them niggas rappin they ain't snappin on that lame song
Tell them muthafuckas that them suckas got the game wrong
You seen us on MTV and our album on the shelf
4-5 hundred strong and we ain't need no fuckin help
Fuck a hype man we can crank the show up by ourself
And play them hatin ass muthaufuckas to the left

I ride in the back wit lil buss niggas 
All of em back wit em black wit em black pumps wit them black slacks and black macs
And all of em gutta thoreau with that gangsta
Nigga we blow perk we don't blow reggie with them wankstas
I'm trapped out on the curb and errbody in my squad 
You know we keep that expensive ass herb
For all these fuck niggas who plottin and hatin on me
Ha ha you already slow I keep a K on me

[Chorus: 2x]

Since we came up on scene we been hated on contemplated on
But that shit don't even phase me homes (phase me homes)
Niggas smile up in yo face and turn around and turn around and steady hatin
We one of the reasons that yo song is in heavy rotation
Who can say they made a classic hit that gets the club jumpin
Started in 2001 4 years passed and today its still bumpin
Always on the fuckin grind niggas tryna stop our shine
You'll never get the best of us cause we too tough and we gon ride

We gon ride and leave you counterfits behind playa but this click gon shine
You hatin cause I got mines but its all good that's just you
L12's get the L in they face 
Flaw niggas get no props they get put in they place everyday
That's just how it is that's just how it goes
So I stay up on my toes and chose my money over hoes
Mobbin over esub dammit ay lil stupid bitch
MOB that be the click and you don't really know about me

[Chorus: 2x]

You know we stars now in them duece dueces
Hand out the brain nigga throw them dueces
Or I might throw it back I'm in the bichevy 
Niggas hatin on me because my pockets heavy
Dreads in my head I got my mind right
My next day say I'm 30 so the time right
I do alotta flexin yeah I be puttin on
I guess that's that's the reason why you boys be hatin on

They wouldn't hire me 'cause I was lookin' like a slob
At school I was a fool, my grades was off the wall
Was failin' every class so they wouldn't let me play no ball

You already know money is my mind frame
Nigga's jackin mine, they ain't got no type of mind games

Do my shit myself, got my own rules and my ways
I got a aura about myself and that's greatness

Never settle for the less, stop all the hater shit
Don't get offended 'cause I'm gettin' mine to make it
And I'm tryin' always, can't nobody come and take this

Money makin' my everyday mission, I slippin' if I don't flip

Keep these bitches whipped straight from the bottom now
Ballin', ridin' high with my niggas, never could I be a lame

'Cause them lame's don't count figures, they roll nickel's
And they definitely love to hate and I shine in their face

Never second guessin' 'cause your girl want it all down the hustle
Just to get it off the muscle, if I have to I'ma struggle
'Cause I am down for my nigga's crime mob
Never better for deez streets for the heat

You better practice what you preach
'Cause everybody want a lil' peace
Now you fucking with some real o.g's
Every time we hit the scene, all that bullshit gon' decease

Catch a nigga with a stick
Beat haters gon' get slick
Come up with some [unverified] and mothafucka

LIL JAY:
I got ma sign in the air
But these niggaz unaware 
That we never gave a fuck we gives a damn if you don?t care
I?m with my niggaz shakin hair shakin dreads in this bitch
Them otha niggaz in the club dat be scared talkin shit
Hiding right behind they homies hesitated to throw up signs
Ima put it in his face and slap that boy fuckn blind
I?m a player on da grind 
Ella? Jay don?t give a shit
See me crunk off in the club 
Throw ma sign up like this

PRINCESS:
A Throw yo sign in the air
Let them niggaz know what set yo claim
Ellenwood dat be ma hood 
And where the best is known to hang
In the club crunk
Drunk as hell
Pockets stay the fattest
Quick to buck up on a hoe 
'cause East side bitches be the baddest
Neva backin down
Act a clown I?ll show you its nothing
Throw dat E up in yo face
I pulled yo card so get the buckin
You know the deal
And talkin shit is wastin time
So let it be known 
That I?m about mine
And I am not scared to throw up dat sign bitch

CHORUS:
A put yo sign in the air
If you feel it
They don?t won?t it 
Way high in the air
Just like this (x4)

*DIAMOND*
And If they dealin with violence nigga 
I?m strapped and I?m ridin 
'cause if you want it I got it 
Ma cliques the reason you hottest 
I got my burrow
Ma clique
Ma zone and sign in the air
We ain't boss claimin
You name it 
I?ll throw ma sign anywhere
And flip a middle finger for a hater up in ma face
Just know the circumstance
Ain?t no second chances yo way
So when you reppin yo sets
Yo city, Hood, and Yo trap
Just keep you mouth close
And dem eyes open and watch yo back

M.I.G.:
I throw it up 
I put ma sign in the mothafuckin air
If y'all niggaz feelin me 
Then throw a mothfukin chair
Niggaz wanna know where ya from 
This is do it there
If you from the hood 
Throw it up ?cuz nigga you don?t care
Get ya head knocked off
In the streets it ain't fair 
I'm from Ellenwood man

And wanna get with Lil' Jay after she dance on that pole
I pull my cash so quick and fast when that **** hit the flo'

Now I got 32 flavors of that bootylicious bubblegum
Raspberry, grape, cherry, come and get this honeybun
Yummy, yum, baby, not an ordinary lady
Known to drive a **** crazy, Willie Wonka wanna pay me

On the daily, off the hizzle, rock my hizzle and shake my skittles
Soda, pop it, watch it sizzle, man, this **** right here's the shizzle
**** on the highest drizzle, wanna taste it just a little
Rock my hips, then make it wiggle, wavin', sippin' in this bizzle

Fat cat, don't act on a pimp
You got me enticed by the way you rock them hips
You's a trip, girl, doin' all them tricks, that's what's up
I like that **** a lot, come and holla at a thug

A-town's finest, I'm the top-notch glamor chick
Tell me, if I throw it at ya, baby, can you handle it?
'Cause the cause is Russian, if a hater wanna run they lip
Step up in the club and have them whisperin', 'God ****, she thick'

Take it to the bar, Hpnotiq and Hennessy is on my list
Seductively moving my body, now watch me rock my hips
Take a sip of the Goose, I'm lookin' good and livin' lavish
Big boy pimpin', poppin', dippin', now tell me I'm not the baddest

I like it when she rock her hips, then take it low
She grab the towel and wipe the pole, oh oh
Shawty got it goin' on, it's just me and her
And I'm in my zone

Check out her rack
Shawty got a fat ****, watch her throw that **** back
And say she sweet like snacks, let you put her on the track
Every day you eat less, countin' **** stacks

Criminals,"""It's all hopelessness, but we add hope
In a sea of, of hopelessness."" 
The air stings my eyes
The water burns my skin

I've seen the reactions through my actions
But I don't try to change a thing at all
We're taught to close our eyes 
And conditioned to believe their lies

As we watch them rape the land and skies
To build the things that own our lives
And we'll never stop 
Were driven by greed 

We'll never stop 
We take more than we need
And we'll never stop
Our society

And they'll never stop

The corporations won't compromise 
Still we refuse to change our lives

And we all fall down

Ourselves without regard for our surroundings

Can't stop, won't stop, nigga, that's that Crip Hop
Roll until I hit the top, find a bitch to break my crop
Hit a switch and then a drop, if it's a club then she gon' hop
From club to club and dick to dick, trick bitch, hush the shit
Hit licks for big chips, get rich, retire quick
Spit shit for convicts and hoes that's full of nonsense
Fuck a guilty conscience, I kill shit regardless
It's real shit, the hardest, the realest regardless
Don't ever try to get shit started, that's retarded
You ain't gotta ask how we got in, we bogarted
y'all gon' know how we lay shit down, it ain't no secret
And it's gon' stay in the fam, nigga, that's how we gon' keep it
It ain't no time for jokin, nigga, fuck the Dreamcast
Busters be mad, see well on a misssion that means cash
You better soak up some game and learn to be a rich roller
Shots hit you through your window while you was holdin your controller

My life is full of sin, too much drama in California
Niggas runnin up on ya to dump and put you in a coma
Or worse, six feet, get put as deep as you stand
Get carried by five homies, your brother the sixth man
Think about your life and what you got to live for
You may not have a lot of money but you still find a way to glow
Just keep pushin and strivin, livin one day at a time
Have patience with life and one day your light'll shine
And when you shine, watch them niggas that watch you gleam
Cause envy brings niggas to jack for bling-bling
In my life it's hard to deal with the pain
But it's part of bein a man, it's part of the game
Accept the shit and move on, partner, and hope for the best
Cause the best way to get some revenge is through success
Cause they don't like to see you come from nothin to somethin

[ VERSE 3: Celly Cel ]
When I really think about it, life is fucked up
All the shit I did and man, I'm still here, I lucked up
I know it's people prayin for my soul every day
Before I go to bed I get down on my knees and pray
Niggas like me ain't gon' never be shit
If you can't shoot a basketball or grab the mic and make a hit
We set up to fail before we get a opportunity
It's easy access to drugs in the black community
So we choose it, we sell it and we use it
We like to live our life fast and know we might even lose it
Abuse it, with 40oz. Mad Dog and hard liquor
Have you catchin cases, makin a nigga walk the yard quicker
It ain't no love, mayne, mama didn't raise a thug
But I got caught up in the streets, I like to taste the blood
I like drug money, 211 thug money
I ran the streets fascinated by that blood money

Trabalhe a ansiedade

Dos beats, das biates
Do traje, do pisante
Respeite o Judas aê pra ele achar que é mais homem
Sem humildade, mãe, não dá esquema
É fei’ colar no palco e não respeitar a vivência
Pra quem curte o preconceito e só vive de aparência

E a cada cem metros alguém morre ferido

Quick to cook and breakin' cane
Straight runnin' thangs around the way
Havin' his money man
A rider from the hood understood by many sets
With the hood tatted on his back arm and neck
Givin a fuck about a robbery steady dippin and ready for trippin
Let the good times roll when my nigga put that clip in
The type of homie you can depend on
When some shit got crazy or relict went dead wrong
Respected by G's, lil' locs and ghetto queens
Stripes from late night creepin' with infra-red beams
He seemed to be a soldier who thought he would switch
And start talkin like a lil' old punk bitch

He ran his mouth like a two dollar hoe
Even brought that motherfucker to my door

Used to be down to suck a fat dick
Quick to turn a bitch trick
Brang the scrilla home to me
Kept my pockets fat
Should've stopped me on the block sellin' coochie for big leaf
With the cold dippin' the pocket while she on her knees
Givin a fuck about a murder, give her a strap watch it now
Breakin' a nigga a bid

That type of hoe you can rely on
When the chips get low
This hoe gon' get a grand O
Laced on the team I guess that's why she call me daddy
Never thought this funky bitch will run her twist and try to have it
For the ki's I got this hoe tried to set me up
And the folks out side waitin' to tie a nigga up
But I'm sure I do this funky hoe was up to something
So I grabbed the .9 and started dumpin'

Runnin games, havin' thangs, steady stackin' the dough
Used to be down for the hoo ride, quick to do a homicide
If you owed him chips you better pay him or you for sure to die
Soldier from that old school, ready for combat
With a left hook down to put a youngster on his back
Really not care where you come from, what set you claim
See it's all about that scrilla, when the .9 take game (that's right)
That type of uncle you respected
Hit a lick for the chips, bump a bitch and get naked
He used to lounge in my house when the things got crazy
Never thought he'd crossed the line and be fuckin my lady
But it goes for sure then my uncle was a cold nigga
Played to find a weakness in my bitch and he went up in her
Hit the stash, get some cash and a quarter key
Want to kill his ass but I can't smoke my own family

Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
(B.I.G) I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left saying good girls don't grow on trees

I felt like it was yesterday,
The times we had that went away
We're still young, but of course we felt a lot
Now I've been living like a villainess been shot
I met her through a friend of mine,
Who told me that this girl was fine.
I picked her up and I started to figure out
There's more on the inside than on the out

(What she say? what she say?)
She said don't bother me (hey hey)
She told me that I had to leave
I wanted her just to believe

Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left, good girls don't grow on trees

Helped me get my world in tact
She had my heart, I told her that
Now it hurts every time I think about
The very night that I started with acting out
The morning brought a painful sun
Knowing now just what I've done
She always was the better half for sure
The part of me in life that I preferred

I gave up all of me (hey hey)
Though I tore her up inside
We still kept the love alive (Amen!)

Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left good girls don't grow on trees

You know the good girls tainted by the bad world
The good girls hard to find
Woah, she's like H2O, can't get enough

So connected that you know I got a motel cheap

When I'm with you, I wish that time could move slow-mo

And maybe one day we'll turn that group into a photo

But if she goin' with me than she goin' for better

Ameaça desistir e eu digo: Cara, I know
É tudo uma questão de calma, Body and Soul
Fica firme aí e Never Let Me Go
Essas coisas são parte do show

All the way be free, you should care for me

Não esqueci que se a platéia está demais
The Man I Love Round Midnight
Do bar tem olhos só pra mim
Eu sou a maior, eu sou Sara ""Von""

Cris Groenendaal,"Someone to hold me too close.
Someone to hurt me too deep.
Someone to sit in my chair,
And ruin my sleep,
And make me aware,
Of being alive.
Being alive.

Somebody need me too much.
Somebody know me too well.
Somebody pull me up short,
And put me through hell,
And give me support,
For being alive.
Make me alive.
Make me alive.

Make me confused.
Mock me with praise.
Let me be used.
Vary my days.

But alone,
Is alone,
Not alive.

Somebody crowd me with love.
Somebody force me to care.
Somebody let me come through,
I'll always be there,
As frightened as you,
To help us survive,
Being alive.
Being alive.

And then they have to die
Trapped within the circle time
Parade of changes

Scenes of my young years
Are warm in my mind
Visions of shadows that shine
Till one day I returned
And found they were the victims
Of the vines of changes

The world's spinning madly
It drifts in the dark
Swings through a hollow of haze

A race around the stars
(A race around the stars)
A journey through the universe ablaze
(A journey through the universe ablaze)
With changes

Your tears will be trembling
Now we're somewhere else
One last cup of wine, we will pour
And I'll kiss you one more time
And leave you on the rolling
River shores of changes

I'll kiss you one more time
(I'll kiss you one more time)
And leave you on the rolling river shores
(And leave you on the rolling river shores)

En tu nido tu rincón de paz
Te hacen olvidar

Cristian,"Vamos a hablar, hoy de verdad.
Desnudemos el alma
Definamos nuestro amor,
Pues a pesar de ser muy mio
Te siento ajeno.
Dime porque te sientes así
Si yo creo que no he cambiado,
No miento al decir que te quiero.
Es mas lo que tardaste en decirlo
Que en saber mi corazón que no me amas.
Pero porque dices eso si siempre
Estoy contigo,
Why aún así me siento sola.
Pero nada te ha faltado
No tengas miedo,
Loque no tengo es amor,
Pero yo te quiero!
En el amor no existen peros
Cuando se ama de verdad
El corazón no siente miedo
Se entrega todo con pasión,
Son cosas del corazón
Sorpresas del destino,
Hay historias de amor
Que no tienen final.
Habia todo entre tu why yo
Pero nos faltaba algo,
Ah! Pasión.
Pero porque dices eso
Si siempre estoy contigo
Why aún asi me siento sola,
Pero nada te ha faltado
No tengas miedo,
Lo que no tengo es amor
Pero yo te quiero.
En el amor no existen peros
Cuando se ama de verdad
El corazón no siente miedo
Se entrega todo con pasión.
Son cosas del corazón
Sorpresas del destino
Hay historias de amor
Que no tienen final.
Habia todo entre tu why yo
Pero nos faltaba algo
Ah! Pasión.
Sabes una cosa?
A mí nunca se me va a
Acabar la pasión,
La pasión que siento por tí.
Entonces hay que volver
A intentarlo.

Cristian Castro,"Yo sigo aquí,
Luchando por vivir en este espacio cúbico,
Entre la tele el compact y el frigorífico,
Sacarte de mi vida fue realmente estúpido,
Como si el corazón fuera un tubo dentífrico

Yo sigo aquí,
No creo que haya un complejo vitamínico,
Para sacarme de este grave estado anímico,
Pues siento como sé que siento en esta buscada,
Perdido en tu recuerdo siempre tan esdrújula

Sintiéndome gris,
Amándote ahora, pensando en ti, otra noche así,
Mientras que en el techo se aman los gatos yo sigo aquí,
Yo sigo aquí

Yo sigo aquí,
Pensando en el nuestro con rigor científico,
Para evitar tomarlo como algo trágico,
Porque por dentro soy tan sólo un fanático,
Que quiere que regreses y que está nostálgico

Amándote ahora, pensando en ti, otra noche así,
Mientras que en el techo se aman los gatos yo sigo aquí,

Cristian Castro,"Es como poder ser dueño del tiempo
Y así detenerlo con el pensamiento
Es como tallar una obra de arte
Que no puedes crear sin enamorarte
Es como abrazar las nubes más bellas 
Cubrir nuestros cuerpos
Con mantos de estrellas 
Es como beber las luces del día
Cargando la sed de mis fantasías

Amarte a ti es soñar despierto
Los ojos abiertos
Amarte así es de verdad,
El corazón entregar,
Tan lleno de paz

Es como escribir la última historia
Gritando pasión en vez de victoria
Es como curar aquellas heridas
Es como empezar una nueva vida

No lo castigues mas así
Ayúdame hazme sonreír

No dejes ríos sin cantar

Y negro como mi suerte, quise hallar el olvido al estilo Jalisco

no te rajes

Pero aquellos mariachis y aquel tequila me hicieron llorar.

Me canse de rogarle. con el llanto en mis ojos mi copa y brinde con ella,
No podía despreciarme era el ultimo brindis de un bohemio con una reina.

O chiusi in una stanza
Gli amori in cui hai perso la speranza
Gli amori con le spalle al muro
O quando dici: ""dio ci pensa""
Gli amori in cui non sei sicuro
A cui non dai importanza

Ma quanti amori,ma quali amori
Con il coraggio e la paura di volversi bene
Amori fragili che vanno via
Quelle un cui soffri solamente tu
E gli altri a dire: ""cosa vuoi che sia""

Che non sanno stare insieme
Amori al limite della follia
Quelli che trovi e che non lascipiú

A volte si avvisinano per non sentirsi soli,
Per questo sono grandi,
E gli chiamano amori

Ma quanti amori,ma quali amori
Con il coraggio e la paura di volversi bene
Amori fragili che vanno via
Quelle un cui soffri solamente tu
E gli altri a dire: ""cosa vuoi che sia""

Quanti amori, ma quali amori
Amori appena nati con la voglia di restare insieme
Amori al limite della pazzia
Quelli che trovi e che non lasci piú
Gli amori a pezzi da gettare via

Gli amori sono quasi tutti uguali
La differenza adesso falla tu",Gli Amori/Los Amores,2001

Que me traicionó el deseo de oír tu voz 

Se que me vas a comprender
Quise saber si estabas bien
Necesitaba oír tu voz amor
Saber si tú me extrañas como yo

Tal vez pudimos evitar esta situación que me hace mal 
Y aunque se que ha sido lo mejor 
No he podido soportar el deseo de oír tu voz

En que otros labios me entregaron su calor

Y hoy bebo gota a gota mi condena

Y yo le di el puñal de mi traición

Por el amor que un día se fue
Yo sólo sé vivir por ella
Cómo arrancarla de mi ser

Porque se que me quisiste 
Que no te olvides 
Yo estoy pensando en ti 

Dime que te aleja de mi vida 
Que algun dia llegara
El momento para amar 

En tus ojos puedo verlo todo 
Ellos son los que me dicen la verdad 
Si supieras el amor que yo te puedo dar 

El cariño que te di no encontraras 
Somos almas que se buscan para amar 
Ni la fuerza del destino lo podra cambiar 

Libre 
Quieres ser libre 
No te detengas 
Yo estare aqui 

Lo que me diste
Fue lo mas bello
Es tan dificil
Sobrevivir

Viento
No me robes la esperanza
Que en mis sueño
La veo junto a mi

Siento
Que me haces tanta falta
Sin tu mirada
Yo desapareci

Ooohhhhh

Pensaste que quizás
Sería lo mejor marcharte y olvidar los besos y el amor.

Si no te puedo ver yo voy a enloquecer.

Pude ver otros amores,
Mientras yo callaba.
Y por tus besos sin entrega,
Se me hizo el alma piedra,
Mientras yo callaba.

Tu cuerpo como hielo,
Congeló todo mi anhelo,
Mientras yo callaba
Por que mi universo aún estaba en ti.

La distancia fue creciendo,
Y nuestro amor disminuyendo,
Sin esperanzas.
Nuestra cama era un desierto,
Donde yo soñé despierto que aún me amabas,
Un océano de noches fue ahogando mis reproches,
Mientras yo callaba.
Hasta que mi universo dejó de estar en ti.

Te crees más que nadie tú,
Y no eres lo único en el mundo,

Y el dolor con dolor, se pagan

Que seas fuerte si tu suerte cambia.

Ya no siento más amor de repente 
Se acabó vivir, que es mejor la verdad yo no se mentir 
Es verdad que te ame 
Es muy cierto te amé pero ahora ya ves tu ahora ya ves que no 

Por algún tiempo sufrirás yo lo sé 
Pero alguien vendrá y te dará su amor 
Tarde o temprano, tu volverás a ver la luz 

Pero nunca le hieras 
Nunca le humilles 
Nunca le engañes 
Nunca le dañes su amor 

Para que nunca te abandonen

Para acabar con las traiciones 
Debes decir adios primero 
Como yo

Para ver a esa chiquilla,
La que cautivo mi alma.
Boquita dulce, mi niña loca,
Besarte tu boca
Es todo lo que más me provoca.

Sabes que te amo desde lo más profundo de mi corazón,
Y que si tú no estuvieras,
No podría expresar lo que siento.
Simplemente necesito que me escuches,
Porque todas mis palabras,
Van dedicadas para ti.

Mendez!

Mi niña bella, cosita loca
Llego el momento, de besar tu boca.
Tan iluminada, con esa dulzura,
Robarte un beso, es una locura.
El decir ""te quiero"", es un muy poca cosa,
Te regalo el alma, mi niña preciosa.
Eres tú mi reina, y por eso grito,
A los cuatro vientos, ""yo te necesito"".

Si pudiera regalarte la luna yo bajaría,
Y adornarla con estrellas, solo para ti mi vida.
Porque tú eres como el mar, bien repleta de corales,
Y que de mi corazón, niña tú tienes la llave.

Sabes que me vuelves loco, y soy solo para ti,
Y te juro yo, mi reina, sin ti no puedo vivir.

Cristina Branco,"Por la blanda arena
Que lame el mar
Su pequeña huella
No vuelve más
Un sendero solo
De pena y silencio llegó
Hasta el agua profunda
Un sendero solo
De penas mudas llegó
Hasta la espuma

Sabe Dios qué angustia
Te acompañó
Qué dolores viejos
Calló tu voz
Para recostarte
Arrullada en el canto
De las caracolas marinas
La canción que canta
En el fondo oscuro del mar
La caracola

Te vas Alfonsina
Con tu soledad
Qué poemas nuevos
Fuíste a buscar?
Una voz antigüa
De viento y de sal
Te requiebra el alma
Y la está llevando
Y te vas hacia allá
Como en sueños
Dormida, Alfonsina
Vestida de mar

Cinco sirenitas
Te llevarán
Por caminos de algas
Y de coral
Y fosforescentes
Caballos marinos harán
Una ronda a tu lado
Y los habitantes
Del agua van a jugar
Pronto a tu lado

Bájame la lámpara
Un poco más
Déjame que duerma
Nodriza, en paz
Y si llama él
No le digas que estoy
Dile que Alfonsina no vuelve
Y si llama él
No le digas nunca que estoy
Di que me he ido

Fueste a buscar?

De viento y de sal

Perdona, sono a terra, ho 
Saltato anche la palestra e 
Per giunta il metrò non funziona
Come sarebbe nel week-end? Non ci sei? 
Pensi sia meglio che io resti un po’ sola?

Siamo abbandonati ai nostri destini

Cristina Scabbia,"Bound to your side and trapped in silence
Just a possession
Is the sex or only violence
That feeds your obsession

You send me to a broken state
Where I can take the pain
Just long enough
That I am numb
That I just disappear

Go on and scare me to death
Tell me I asked for it
Tell me I'll never forget

Hurt me with nothing
Some sort of sick satisfaction
You Get from mind fucking

Oh stripped down to my naked core
The darkest corners of my mind are yours
That's where you live
That's where you breathe

The most beautiful nightmare
A charming monster, a honey-tasting curse, embrace my name

Brother, take me! 
Hold my hand and 
guide me through death
We are creatures of pure energy (we are)
Dance in flowers, rest in trees
We are precious parts of everything
Ever living entities
We are fragments of eternity (we are) 
We built forests we built seas
We erase grey from deadly battlefields
And paint green living hills

Burn their faces with your glare and fade in shadows

Follow me! I've been embraced with chains and kissed with stones
Trust in me! I've been caressed with razors and fed with poison

Stars, hide your fires! 
Let not light see my black and deep desires

Sister, breach in! take my hand and follow my name
Brother, take me! hold my hand and guide me through death

We are creatures of pure energy (we are)
Dance in flowers, rest in trees
We are precious parts of everything
Ever living entities
We are fragments of eternity (we are) 
We built forests we built seas
We erase grey from deadly battlefields
And paint green living hills
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player 
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more. 
It is a tale Told by an idiot
Full of sound and fury signifying nothing

Where shall we three meet again? 
In thunder, lightning, or in rain? 
Upon the heat!

We are creatures of pure energy (we are)
Dance in flowers, rest in trees
We are precious parts of everything
Ever living entities
We are fragments of eternity (we are) 
We built forests we built seas
We erase grey from deadly battlefields
And paint green living hills",Salem,2017

Se juntos já jogamos tudo fora

Se, ao te conhecer, dei pra sonhar, fiz tantos desvarios
Rompi com o mundo, queimei meus navios
Me diz pra onde é que inda posso ir
Se nós, nas travessuras das noites eternas
Já confundimos tanto as nossas pernas
Diz com que pernas eu devo seguir
Se entornaste a nossa sorte pelo chão
Se na bagunça do teu coração
Meu sangue errou de veia e se perdeu
Como, se na desordem do armário embutido
Meu paletó enlaça o teu vestido
E o meu sapato inda pisa no teu
Como, se nos amamos feito dois pagãos
Teus seios inda estão nas minhas mãos

To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1986

With sightless eyes, a candle in his hand

Inside they watched a clock upon the wall
Put silver in the box and left the hall

the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Spot sunshine, sundress with a shot glass, one lime
I'm usually confident
Beautiful made me kinda' timid so I raised up
My blood alcohol percentage and I represented
Hesitant to grab her arm
Looking like a vagabond Caliber kills her with the charm
As compensation for the cash flow
I approached the honey mad slow
Hoping in a moment we could dance slow
But before I could advance yo she said no
Mumbling something about the club scene and assholes
[I] stayed humble, extended my hand
[She was] so receptive to the fact when I approached her I was such a gentleman
[I] told her that's just how I am
Would you consider this dance?
[She] said, ""My skirt's too short, maybe if I wore pants
Plus the heels, make it harder to move.""
Told her, ""Disregard the feeling, only part required is your waist to groove.""
[She] grinned slightly. Feeling she begins to like me
I converse politely hoping she'd invite me but
Instead, I got a hole in my head
Something bout' getting out of bed and dreading work because
Her boss makes her fed
Dead the conversation
Had to see if she was with it, then within an instance
I began to feel resistance
Didn't budge, I got bored
Lunging for the dance floor
She's indulged in conversation, that's not what I'm here for
Therefore
I said, ""I'm about to slide, I get the picture.""
She said, ""I don't want to' dance but it's nice talking with ya.""
Look, clubs are for dancing
Coffee shops are for discussion
And if we party now maybe tomorrow we could luncheon
Involuntarily I move when I hear the percussion
Man! Stand still, paying twenty bills for nothing
Out of the question
regardless of your beauty you're making me regret that I said pardon of
excuse me
(Truly) your beauty's dazzling but I'm about to peel
Too elegant to sweat is something

Gracious I might say exotic like a wild bouquet

I don't play this game to lose
Q don't run away (NAW)

be	-boy arrogant pose
Trying to get the last drag off the hash in the roach
My wardrobe, it shows that I ain't trying to boast
But hopefully you and me we get to whine real close
Most of the time I play it cool
Don't even sweat these shorties cause
Sometimes you wave hi they think you're getting naughty
But you Miss, you're unlike all these little girls that bore me
I'm trying to get you off the wall and get on the floor see
It's curiosity that's got this cat frisky
Hot under the collar feeling tipsy off the whisky
Maximum return on my interest cause my business never risky
[I'm] spitting in tongues until you get me
Why don't you let me gently hold your hand sexy
And spin it out [of] control like a 430SC?
I think I see a spot in the corner
Where we can work it out sweat dripping like sauna

Ich fang' dich in meinem Wolkenbett
Du bist die Schönste hier von allen (Hey!)

Ich lass mich fallen
Ich fall' in dich hinein
Es fühlt sich wie fliegen an
So leicht muss Liebe sein
So leicht muss Liebe sein

Oh ho? Hier ist schwer was los
Doch du schwebst durch den Raum so wie schwere-los
Wenn du siehst was ich seh', oh wär' das groß
Denn oft gibt‘s nur die eine, nur die erste Chance und
Sag mal was ist das, was du in deinem Blick hast?
Denn deine Augen sprechen, auch wenn du nichts sagst
Nennen wir das Schicksal, wenn es jetzt ""Klick"" macht?
Ich flieg in dich hinein, weil der Himmel dich geschickt hat
Cro!

Es ist dieser Augenblick
Du fällst während du in diese Augen blickst
1000 Meter tief unter der Haut ist
Alles neu doch alles vertraut
Lass uns raus hier aus diesem Beton
Und die grauen Wolken, ach schieb' sie davon!
Einfach nur weg und nie wieder kommen
Nimm meine Hand und wir fliegen davon (Hey!)

Ich lass mich fallen
Ich fall' in dich hinein
Es fühlt sich wie fliegen an
So leicht muss Liebe sein
So leicht muss Liebe sein

(Oh) Uh, Mädchen, komm flieg mit mir
(Oh) Komm wir fliegen weit weg von hier
(Oh) Und ich fall' in dich hinein
(Oh oh uh oh) Ich hab gehört so leicht soll Liebe sein

Ich lass mich fallen
Ich fall' in dich hinein
Es fühlt sich wie fliegen an (Yeah, lass mich fallen)
So leicht muss Liebe sein (? Komm du singst für mich)
So leicht muss Liebe sein

So leicht, so leicht

Cro,"Manchmal denk ich, wie's wohl wär'
Wenn ich nich' wär', wer ich bin
Aber kein Mensch steht mir so gut wie ich
Deshalb bleib ich wie ich bin!

Mir liegt die Welt zu Füßen, denn ich bin ein Superstar
Bin immer schlecht gelaunt, bin arrogant und gut bezahlt
Doch bin ich dann mal ziemlich nett, will ich nur mit dir ins Bett
Und bin sofort wieder weg, weg, weg
Ich hab' nie für dich Zeit, schreib' dir nie zurück
Bin nie verliebt, ständig breit, denn ich schnief' mein Glück
Mir wird zu ziemlich alles vorgelegt, gerade wenn es um Mode geht
Hab' ich 10 Berater, die mir sagen, meine Hose steht mir
Exzellent und erst recht das Hemd
Diese Farbe ist der Wahnsinn und demnächst im Trend
Ey und geht es um Frauen, dann bin ich der king
Lebe den Traum, will niemals 'n Kind
Gebe viel aus und leb' in 'nem Haus
Bin jeden Tag blau und irgendwann blind
Und wenn ich's nich' hab, dann gib' es mir her
Und wenn ich's dann hab, dann will ich noch mehr
Dann will ich noch mehr, dann will ich noch mehr
Dann will ich, dann will ich, dann will ich
Und plötzlich merk' ich, diese Welt is' nix für mich
Geh' von der Bühne, werf' die Maske in die Ecke und bin ich
Yeah!

Ich setz' die Maske ab und lauf' durch den club, doch
Keiner schaut, kein Applaus, keiner guckt, denn
Hier bin ich Carlo und keiner wirft den Arm hoch
Und keiner sagt mir Hallo, jap, denn keiner hat 'ne Ahnung
Hey und geht es um Frauen, dann bin ich 'ne Niete
Lebe den Traum, doch immer noch Miese
Jeder Tag grau, doch reg' mich nich' auf
Hab weder 'n Haus, noch hab ich die Miete
Leb' von Applaus, ernähr' mich von Liebe
Steh' wieder auf, bin grad in 'ner Krise
Da geb' ich nich' auf, da geb' ich nich auf, da geb' ich nich'
Und plötzlich merk' ich, diese Welt is' nix für mich
Setz' die Maske ins Gesicht, geh' auf die Bühne
Und bin ich! Yeah!

Cro,"Könnt' ich durch die Zeit fahr'n in einem schnellen Auto
Würd' ich alles nochmal tun und zwar genauso
Schick' mich zurück in die Zeit in der niemand mich kennt
Und ich würd alles dafür tun, dass du mich wieder erkennst
Wär ich auf einmal wieder 16
Dann würd im Matheheft ein Text steh'n
Scheiß auf Schule, ich würd weggeh'n
Nicht weil ich wüsste, ich bin irgendwann reich
Nein, weil ich weiß, diese Zeit ist so rasend vorbei
Wär ich auf einmal wieder jung (wieder jung)
Dann wäre Dad noch am Start
Und ich schwör ich wär mehr für ihn da
Und Oma wär nie mehr alleine mit dem Pärchen im Park
Denn sie kann Opa wieder lieben wie am allerersten Tag
Ich schließe meine Augen es ist 2006
Doch weit vor den Raps und dem Nightliner-Bett
Wir fühlten uns erwachsen, hatten heimlichen Sex
Und ich würd' ihn wieder trinken, auch wenn Wein noch nicht schmeckt
Wäre 2006 (2006)
Dann hätt' ich sicherlich kein Streit mit der Ex
Wäre weit von der weg, diese Zeit ist perfekt
Also scheiß auf den Rest
Doch was man damals hatte das begreift man erst jetzt

Und in der Schule war das Zeugnis eher schlimm
Und nach dem zweiten Läuten war der Neue noch nicht drin
Ich soll mich bitte ändern, doch ich träumte vom Gewinnen
Hätt' ich nicht auf mich gehört, dann wär' ich heut nicht wer ich bin
Also schick mich ruhig zurück, ich würd' genau die selben Lieder schreiben
Jedes Wort, jede Zeile, ich würde sie wieder schreiben
Jede Nacht, bis um 8, durchgemacht, dann gefragt
Bleib ich wach oder soll ich heute einfach liegen bleiben?
Schnappte mir die Bleistiftmine, schreibe wie ne Schreibmaschine
Schreibe über Hass und über Liebe, keine Zeit verlieren
Weiterschreiben, meine Linie, auch wenn ich kein' Preis verdiene
Schreib ich wie 'ne Reimmaschine, als wär das die zweite Bibel
Doch leider begreifen viele nicht, dass ich die Scheiße liebe
Meistens reale Motherfucker mit 'ner fiesen Neider-Mine
Ich schreib weiter meine Lieder, du bist nur die zweite Liga
Schick mich ruhig zurück und ich schreib ganz genau das gleiche wieder",2006,2014

Ey egal wieviel Uhr, ich bin immer zu spät
Der Typ auf'm Sofa der immer nur schläft
Immer nur gähnt, Immer nur fehlt
Ey Jungs, tut mir Leid war Zeit es zu erwähnen
Ich hab doch letzten Monat diese Frau besucht
Wir waren was essen, hatten ein Rendezvous
Auf jeden Fall sie ist jetzt meine Freundin
Doch immer wenn ich bei ihr penn mache ich kein Auge zu
Aber nicht wegen Sex, ich hab Schiss (vor ihr)
Denn sie zwingt mich und sagt du kommst mit (zu mir)
Und dann erzählt sie von irgendeiner Clique
Und dass ich nicht mehr rauskomm denn alle wären informiert
Sie sagt lass uns ein Pärchen sein
Ich würde gerne rennen, doch sie sperrt mich ein
Und ich wäre ihr Ken in dem Märchenteil

Will nicht, dass ich geh, beraubt meine Bank
Stellt meinen Wecker immer drei Stunden nach
Ey, du musst mir glauben, der Scheiß hier ist wahr
Sie hat mein Handy und gibt's nicht her
Nein, ruf' nicht an denn es ist gesperrt
Und den Mac hat sie obendrein mit versteigert
Ich denke mal, dass ihr mich deshalb nicht erreicht habt
Und ja ich hab meinen Flug verpasst
Doch ich steh mittlerweile mehr als mit 'nem Fuß im Knast
Und neulich häng' ich so allein in ihrer Bude ab
Da kommen die Cops durch die Tür und sagen „Wir suchen was“
Ich sag superkrass, ich bin hier eingesperrt
Ich glaub ihr Name ist Janine und ich weiß nicht mehr
Und alles was sich hier befindet, das gehört mir nicht
Doch leider glaubt mir das der Typ von der Behörde nicht

Ne, die kennst du nicht, aber egal, auf jeden Fall die
Ey immer so blöde Ausreden,
Irgendwelche Mädchen, dir fällt immer so ein Quatsch ein
Aber ey jetzt wart doch mal die gibt's wirklich
Ey wieso sollt ich die erfinden?
Erst ist der Hund abgehauen, dann hast du den Bus verpasst
Ja ich weiß, die Geschichte war erfunden, aber die ist wirklich echt mann!
Jeder normale Mensch kann doch pünktlich sein
Ja aber wenn die, ey wenn die einfach meinen Wecker verstellt Mann!

Cro,"Ey, yo
Es ist wieder mal 'ne Samstag-Nacht doch ich cruise durch die City
Hab nur 'ne Schrottkarre, denn der Bruce hat den Caddy
Im Tapedeck steckt noch Tune von P. Diddy
Ich dreh auf, mach es laut, fühl mich cool so wie Biggy
Und während ich so mit 8 km/h, unantastbar wie Gas
Durch die Nacht fahr, blas'
Ich den Rauch raus, dampf wie 'n Rasta im Park
Währenddessen hängen sich motherfucking Cops an mein' Arsch
Ah, sie fragt was machen sie beruflich
Ich sag Music, wenn ich Zeit habe produce ich
Sie sagt „Ey ich dachte mir von Anfang an, dass du's bist“
Sie kennt jedes Lied und meint, dass meine Platte gut ist
Das wär genau ihr Ding
So 'n Mädchen sieht man eigentlich nur in Fashion-Magazinen
Sie zieht mich aus der Karre, sagt „Das war's für dich jetzt
Ich muss dich leider hier verhaften wegen Paragraph 6“
Und sie packte ihre Handschellen aus
Und behandelt mich als wär das hier ein Tankstellenraub
Ich sag ""Baby du bist eine von den ganz schnellen Frauen""
Sie holt Panzertape raus und sagt „Mann, halt dein Maul“
Hat mich ohne Kommentare danach an sich gedrückt
Die Wangen abgeküsst, behandelt wie 'n Stück
Auf einmal wurd es stürmisch und sie langsam verrückt
Denn sie reißt an meinem Shirt und wirft mich dann auf die Rück-
Bank, yeah die Blicke sind so heiß
Denn langsam wird sie geil, wie nach 'nem Whisky oder zwei
Sie setzt sich auf mich drauf und zieht den Slip bis zu den Beinen
Ich mach einen auf Al Capone, denn ich fick die Polizei
Yeah, wir sind allein und tun's,
Sie macht es nice und smooth, sie hat den Scheiß im Blut
Ich würd sie gern für immer haben aber nein bleib cool
Baby krieg ich deine Nummer? „sie sagt 1-1-0
Doch nur im Notfall du weißt
Ich hab ziemlich viel zu tun und nur an Montagen frei
Doch vielleicht teilen wir uns mal mein Sofa zu zweit
Tut mir leid, ich muss leider wieder losfahren, bye“
Dann war sie einfach so weg
Ich bin einsam im Bett, keiner weiß wo sie steckt
Und seitdem knack ich täglich Maserati's, Ferrari's
Setz' mich rein, warte bis sie kommt, doch sie kam nie
Verdammt was tut sie mir an
Vielleicht ist sie grad bei 'nem Mann
Hat die Bluse nicht an, sie schmusen und dann, verdammt
Diese Wut macht mich krank
Du hast doch ihre Nummer, ey ich glaub ich ruf sie mal an",Cop Love,2014
Cro,"Ey, die Leute sehen mich heute live im TV
Reich und beliebt, doch weißt du noch wie alles eigentlich verlief
Ich mein weit vor dem Hype, vor den Rhymes und den Suites
Acker jeden Tag und hab 'nen Scheißdreck verdient
Großstadt, jap ich war allein ohne Ziel
Mach' die Nacht zum Tag, der geistige Krieg
Zwischen Rhymes die ich schrieb und bin eigentlich verliebt
Lag im Grunde nur die Hoffnung, dass die eine es sieht
Also scheiß auf Musik, ich muss Kohle verdienen
Ich würd ja auch viel lieber chillen wenn es ohne das ging
Doch leider bezahlt man 'ne Wohnung plus Strom und Benzin
Nicht vom Erwarten irgendwann das große Los mal zu ziehen
Sie sagen du musst los nach Berlin
Ich hab nie erwartet, dass bei mir was Großes geschieht
Bei manchen war es Koks oder Weed
Ich dagegen nahm in Krisen halt die Droge Musik

Und immer dann wenn es nach oben geht
Schreib ich es hin denn so bleibt's in Erinnerung
Egal was passiert, ich greif nach Papier
Und schreib mir mein Leben ins Gedächtnis
Und immer wenn ich dann am Boden bin
Weckt mich ein Song wieder aus der Erinnerung
Läuft nicht so geschmiert, wirst motiviert
Und merkst, dass das Leben wieder fort ist

Yeah, ey, sorry
immer noch broke, keine Kohle am Start
Häng bei Psaiko auf der Couch, denn dort wohne ich grad
Drehen die Scheiße auf, wussten nicht wieso es so war
Doch bauten dicke Dinger wie 'n Silikonimplantat
Noch immer ohne Vertrag, noch immer ohne die Charts
Noch immer weit entfernt von irgend 'nem Millionenbetrag
Eher so Dosen im Park, eher so Hosen am Arsch
Das erste Mal wie sie sagt, dass sie mich ohne Witz mag
Warte, wo ist meine Karte?
wieder mal verpennt im Büro außer Atem, ähm
ja, äh ich wohn eigentlich grade
Nicht bei mir Zuhause doch ist bloß so eine Phase
Klingt nicht schön wie die Mondscheinsonate
Eher so Blamage, im Schoß eine Gabel
Ich lege los, schreibe Flows, Bloß eine Frage
Der Zeit, bis die Scheiße sich lohnt zähl ich Tage

Und immer dann wenn es nach oben geht
Schreib ich es hin denn so bleibt's in Erinnerung
Egal was passiert, ich greif nach Papier
Und schreib mir mein Leben ins Gedächtnis
Und immer wenn ich dann am Boden bin
Weckt mich ein Song wieder aus der Erinnerung
Läuft nicht so geschmiert, wirst motiviert
Und merkst, dass das Leben wieder fort ist

Ey
das große Jahr und sie bemerken ich hab Hits gemacht
Sagten das ist richtig krass und was ich alles richtig mach
Komm' doch mal vorbei und wir trinken was
Zack, unterschrieben und der Scheiß wurde fix gemacht
Ich wusste nicht genau was ich damit jetzt mach
Denn, dass es so wie heute wird, das hätt ich damals nicht gedacht
Und irgendwann ergibt sich was, Daddy fand es nicht so krass
Denn ich schmiss die Schule mit den Worten „I don't give a fuck“
Und von da an gab es Tankstellenfraß
Fahren durch das Land, waren gefangen im Spaß
Und Basti fragten, ob ich mich in' Schrank stellen mag
Ich sag klar, sag nur wann, ich bin ganz schnell am Start
Ey wir konnten es nicht ahnen, wie ein Brandmelder Gas
Doch die Hände gingen hoch wie ein Panzer im Irak
Und du merkst du bist oben wenn du ganz unten warst
Also scheiß auf den Rest, irgendwann kommt der Tag, let's go

Und immer dann wenn es nach oben geht
Schreib ich es hin denn so bleibt's in Erinnerung
Egal was passiert, ich greif nach Papier
Und schreib mir mein Leben ins Gedächtnis
Und immer wenn ich dann am Boden bin
Weckt mich ein Song wieder aus der Erinnerung

Denn ich fühl mich so fly

Von jedem Streit, jedem Stress, ganz allein, bleib relaxt
Bin mein eigener Chef, dieses Life ist perfekt

Und die Zweifel mich fast wieder killn'
Weil ich nicht weiß was passiert
Ich will schreien, aber bleib lieber still
Und wenn die Zeit nicht vergeht
Weil es einfach nicht läuft wie man will
Doch dann kommt diese Melodie, dieses Lied
Ich war nie so verliebt (war noch nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt)

Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen

Damals warst du noch mein Star, ist mir sowas von egal, ah

Nur nicht ganz so arrogant, bin eher so sympathisch nett
Große Bilder, Art Attack, der Typ der auf sich warten lässt

Und wenn die Zeit nicht vergeht
Weil es einfach nicht läuft wie man will
Doch dann kommt diese Melodie, dieses Lied
Ich war nie so verliebt (war noch nie so verliebt, war noch nie so

Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen

Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen
Und alles beginnt sich zu drehen",Melodie,2014
Cro,"If growing up means it would be
Beneath my dignity to climb a tree
I'll never grow up woo
Yeah, ey
I'll never grow up, uh-uh
Ich nicht, never
Ey yo ah (I'll never grow up)

Uh-uh denn Fliege tragen steht mir nicht
Bleib forever young
Chimperator, keiner lebt wie ich (I'll never grow up)
Der Typ der immer noch Zuhause wohnt
Scheiß auf euer Rauchverbot wie damals auf dem Pausenhof
Hat sich nix verändert, nicht im letzten wie in diesem Jahr
Und Mama will immer noch, dass ich endlich auszieh' oder Miete zahl'
(I'll never grow up) Und seitdem ich jetzt ganz alleine wohn'
Kam die Putze einmal, aber wollte dafür zwei Millionen (I'll never grow up)
Ich sag „Okay, das kannste später haben“
Stürz mich aus dem achten Stock und schreie ich bin Peter Pan
Yea, sie sagen nach mir kommt die Sintflut
Ich sollt endlich mal erwachsen werden, ey yo spinnst du? (I'll never grow up)
Genau ich werf die Füße auf'n Tisch
Der Kinder-Schokoladenjunge ist genau wie ich (I'll never grow up)
Und Bier ist was für alte Männer
Hab ich keine Lust auf Arbeit, penn' ich heute einfach länger (I'll never grow up)
Ey sag mal Klettergerüst (Klettergerüst)
Du hast 'ne nackte Frau geküsst (I'll never grow up)
Ey, ich lass mich treiben vom Wind
Und ganz egal was andere schreiben, man ich bleibe ein Kind 'cause I

I'll never grow up
Uh-uh never, ever
Never, never, ey
Ey yo  (I'll never grow up)
Never, ever, never, ever, ever (not me)
Denn ich glaub ich bin der schlechteste Erwachsene

I'll never grow up
No never, ever
Die können machen was sie wollen doch ich
I'll never grow up
Never, ever, never, ever ever (not me)
Ey, niemals, nochmal (I'll never grow up)

Ey, okay, ich mach jetzt mit Mucke patte
Doch ich hab keine Lust auf blöde Zahlen, gibt's hier Zuckerwatte? (I'll never grow up)
Nein? Egal ich mein nur, dass ich Lust drauf hatte
Und bin schlecht gelaunt, weil ich 'nen Tag lang nichts zu futtern hatte (I'll never grow up)
Und ich hab wieder Beef mit dem Boss
Denn ich hab wieder kein Bock auf so 'nen biederen Job (I'll never grow up)
Verpenn' Termine, stell' mein Album vor Release schon in' Blogs
Dauert nicht lange bis mein Labelboss es sieht und mich droppt
'Cause I (I'll never grow up)
Ich bin wie 'ne Katze bei Nacht
Und laufe super gut getarnt durch die platzende Stadt (I'll never grow up)
Und keiner von den Menschen ahnt oder dachte sich was
Weil mich mein Oberlippenbart ein Stück erwachsener macht
But I (I'll never grow up)
Genau, scheiß auf Erwachsensein und den ganzen Kackverein
Lass uns wieder Affe sein (I'll never grow up)
Yeah, spring in die Karre, leg die Platte ein
Und alle Menschen fallen sich in die Arme wie am 8. Mai (I'll never grow up)
Ey yo sag mal bitte Tomate (Tomate)
Dein Pimmel kann Karate (I'll never grow up)
Ich lass mich treiben vom Wind
Und ganz egal was andere schreiben, man ich bleib ein Kind 'cause I

I'll never grow up
Uh-uh never, ever
Never, never, ey
Ey yo I'll  (I'll never grow up)
Never, ever, never, ever ever (not me)

I'll never grow up
No never, ever
Sie können machen was sie wollen doch ich
I'll never grow up
Never, ever, never, ever ever (not me)
Ey, niemals, nochmal (I'll never grow up)

Yeah
Ey
Nochmal (I'll never grow up)
Und Mom es tut  mir Leid (not me)
Nicht mit mir
Sag's nochmal (I'll never grow up)
Uh-uh
No, no
I'll never grow up

Ne (not I) (not me) (not me!)",Never Cro Up,2014
Cro,"Yeah
Ich komme nach Haus und werf' mich auf mein Bett
Mal wieder mal'n hektischer Tag
Doch bin immer ruhig und relaxt egal wie stressig es war
Bestelle mir Essen und dann
Verbring ich den restlichen Tag
Nur in meinem Bett und geh nicht mehr weg, egal wie gern ich es mag
Zu viele Anrufe warten in Abwesenheit und
Jeder will heutzutage in der Stadt leben weil
Sie haben Angst was zu verpassen
Jagen hunderttausend Sachen
Gestern Nacht war richtig krass
Wo hast du denn gesteckt du Lappen?
Ist mir egal, ich chille Zuhaus
Und male mir Fenster an die Wände
Der Mensch ist auf 'nem Festival doch rennt übers Gelände
So viele suchen jeden Tag nur Gänsehautmomente
Doch wenn sie es bemerken ist es längst wieder zuende
Doch wenn man ihn erwischt dann wird er fotografiert
Auf Instagram gepostet und sofort kommentiert
Das Leben zieht an dir vorbei auf der Jagd nach Likes
Und der Ghettoblaster spielt noch „It's A Hard Knock Life“

Yo chill
Wieso willst du weg von hier?
Denn der Moment ist perfekt
Leg dein Handy mal weg und relax mit mir

Chill
Wieso willst du weg von hier?
Denn der Moment ist perfekt
Leg dein Handy mal weg und relax mit mir

Und jeder da draußen hätte gerne viele Scheine
'N Haufen Frauen wie bei Blow?
Doch ich hab lieber diese eine statt die tausendste Hoe
Und eigentlich ist alles cool, also schau wieder auf
War vor der Mucke ganz genau wie du, pausenlos broke
Doch jeder hier rennt über die Welt und dabei vergessen so viele
Mal anzuhalten und den Moment zu genießen
Yeah, scheiß auf Ängste und Krisen
Und die Welt wird wieder bunt, wie wenn wir verliebt sind
Doch ist man ständig am Fliegen und jeden Monat verbucht
Verliert man Menschen um sich rum ganz ohne groß was zu tun
Sie sagte „Sohn hör mir zu, es geht Oma nicht gut“
Ich hab sie so lange schon nicht mehr einfach so mal besucht
Wir lassen viel zu viele Dinge einfach sausen auf der Reise
Doch posten jeden Tag 'nen riesengroßen Haufen Scheiße
Und wenn's uns nicht gefällt dann haut man pausenlos drauf ein ey
Ist unter diesem Lied bestimmt schon ganz genau das Gleiche

Chill
Wieso willst du weg von hier?
Denn der Moment ist perfekt
Leg dein Handy mal weg und relax mit mir

Chill
Wieso willst du weg von hier?
Denn der Moment ist perfekt
Leg dein Handy mal weg und relax mit mir",Rennen,2014
Cro,"Vielleicht ist es gerade besser wie es ist
Kann sein, vielleicht aber auch nicht
Und vielleicht gibt es 'nen Besseren als mich
Doch vielleicht passt zu dir niemand besser als ich
Und vielleicht solltest du nicht schreien, wenn dich was stört
Vielleicht hätte ich dann besser zugehört
Vielleicht hätte ich verstanden was dich stresst
Vielleicht wärst du dann nicht weg

Doch vielleicht mach ich mir auch nur was vor
Vielleicht wär es zu Ende, vielleicht nicht verloren
Ah, und vielleicht ist nicht alles voller Dornen
Doch vielleicht beginnt dann alles nur von vorn

Cro,"Ich werd' alle Sorgen heute liegen lassen
Und höre nur noch Lieder die mich fliegen lassen
Ich checke ob mir noch die alten Sneakers passen
Alles was passiert ist, würd' ich ganz genau so wieder machen
Denn glaub mir jeder Tag war perfekt
Diese Bar, erstes Becks, Erstes Mal mit dir Sex
Schlichen uns heimlich nach 'ner Party ins Bett
Alles Fresh, denn wiedermal hat es Mum nicht gechekt

Huh, manchmal wünscht ich dieser eine Tag bleibt für immer
Und deshalb sind wir die ganze Nacht wach
Aus Angst uns zu verlieren
Doch wir werden irgendwann mal alt sein
Doch uns trotzdem genau erinnern
Denn, wir waren hier
Wir waren hier

Yeah! Und bei den Bullen rattern Schreibmaschinen los
Doch Mama bleibt relaxt, denn auch die Kleinen werden Groß
Jetzt bin ich hier und lass mich treiben in 'nem Boot
Alles cool, ist der Himmel grau, streiche ich ihn rot
Und es ist Sommer irgendwo, irgendwann
Bitte lass uns nicht mehr reden, gib mir bloß deine Hand
Ja ich weiß, vorbei, wird nicht wieder wie es war
Bitte lass uns nochmal sein wie an diesem einen Tag, denn

Manchmal wünscht ich dieser eine Tag bleibt für immer

Ey

Ich wache auf und du bist nicht hier
Denn es war alles ein Traum
Doch ich weiß, du bist irgendwo da draußen
Und ohne dich fühle ich mich so allein

Sie isst 'n bisschen Kaviar, 'n bisschen Pizza
'N bisschen L.A. Ghetto, 'n bisschen Nizza
'N bisschen Hipster, 'n bisschen Glitzer-Glitzer
Doch scheiß mal auf Schampus ey sie will 'n Sixer
Sie ist VIP, doch pennt auf'm Rücksitz
Sie ist nett, aber kennt keine Rücksicht
Wenn du bedrückt bist, macht sie dich glücklich
Und schenkt dir ein Lächeln es macht baam! Und erdrückt dich
Gibt es Stress, ja dann boxt sie dich raus, sie hat
Alles im Griff, ist der Boss hier im Haus, doch
Sie weiß nicht, ob sie diesen Rock wirklich braucht
Ist nicht zufrieden, aber trotzdem gekauft. (Yeah!)
Und Baby nein, ich rede nicht von der Musik
Und ich muss sagen, ey, ich bin auch nicht verliebt (nein!)
Denn das ist mehr, das ist eher sowas wie
Und der glücklichste Mensch dieser Welt, weil es dich gibt, doch

Ich wache auf und du bist nicht hier
Denn es war alles ein Traum

Und ohne dich fühle ich mich so allein (allein)
Allein (allein) allein (allein)
Ohne dich fühle ich mich so allein (allein)
Allein (allein) allein
Ohne dich fühle ich mich so allein

Für diese Frau würd' ich sofort um die Erde segeln
Pferde stehlen, Sterne zählen, mit dir will ich mehr erleben
Ich denk da an ein Haus, mit ein paar Nervensägen
Doch ich bin raus, tja, denn leider ist ihr Herz vergeben
Denn sie hat 'n Freund, wahrscheinlich so'n Starken
Wunderschön gebräunt, mit breiten Oberarmen
Der sie dann, wenn sie heult
In seinen großen Arm nimmt, nein ich bin nicht enttäuscht
Ich werd wahnsinn! (Verdammt!)
Und das verrückte daran ist, Ich freu mich für dich!
Nein, im Ernst echt, ich freu mich für dich, denn ich
Muss damit leben, dein Freund bin ich nicht
Doch ich hoff, man, mit neunzig bereust du es nicht und
Wie lang das weitergeht? Ich kann's dir nicht sagen, doch ich
Geb mich sicherlich nicht kampflos geschlagen, also
Lass mich bitte nicht zu lang darauf warten
Und fang' an dich zu fragen, denn die Antwort ist klar, doch

Ich wache auf und du bist nicht hier

Schaut aus dem Fenster lässt Gedanken freien lauf
Lehnt sich ganz entspannt zurück
Denn er muss lange noch nicht raus

Er wechselt grad das Lied und plötzlich stand da diese Frau
Und er dachte sich wow
Sagte klar der Platz ist frei
Sie lachte und er dachte sich nur bitte komm
Sprich sie an
Das ist das schönste was du je gesehen hast
Und sie hat sicherlich kein Mann
Stell dich nicht so an
Wenn nicht jetzt wann dann?
Doch alles was man hört ist mein Herzschlag

Was soll ich nur sagen irgendwas knockt mich aus
Ich bin ein Versager, weil ich mich doch nicht trau
Mein Kopf ist voller Wörter doch es kommt nichts raus
Und sie steht auf, steigt aus und sagt

Bye bye, bye bye meine Liebe des Lebens
Und ja wir beide werden uns nie wieder sehen
Kann schon sein, dass man sich im Leben zweimal begegnet
Doch es beim zweiten Mal dann einfach zu spät ist

Es ist ein unglaublich schöner Tag
Und draußen ist es warm
Sie hat bock auf Shopping also in die Stadt
Sie braucht so Sachen die Frauen halt eben brauchen
'N Bikini 'ne neue Tasche und außerdem will sie schauen, also los
Ab in die Bahn
Sie zieht sich 'n Ticket 470 für die Fahrt
Ist ja ganz schön hart
Doch dann sieht sie diesen Typ
Findet ihn süß
Setzt sich extra zu ihm hin
Und denkt sich bitte bitte bitte bitte

Komm, sprich mich an

Also komm Baby geh nicht weg und bleib liegen
Wenn ich sage du bist immer noch das Allerbeste was mir je passiert ist
Na dann ist das untertrieben
Denn mit dir im Bett
Ist die Welt wieder wie perfekt
Und kein Plan wie das ohne dich ging
Denn so lange du hier bist will ich nie wieder weg
Ja und ich weiß du willst das nicht hören
Aber Baby du bist wunderschön
Und manchmal wünsch ich mir du würdest deine Zeit
In meinem Kopf verbringen und die Welt aus meinen Augen sehen
Du wärst das Schönste was du sehen würdest
Komm wir machen ein Paar Dinge die man Mama nicht erzählen würde
Siehst mich an, machst das Licht aus
Ziehst mich an und ich dich aus
Und ich bin so was von addicted
Denn jedes Mal wenn du mich mit ‘nem Blick triffst
Steht meine Welt kurz still

Wir sind weit, weit weg über Wolke 7 (tausend)
Und wenn ich Bock hab könnte ich dir auf der Stelle
Sofort über hundert Dinge nennen wieso du das Allerbeste dieser Welt bist
Würdest du mir nicht immer den Mund verbieten
Und deshalb sag ich nichts
Blind verstehen
Doch das hat 'ne ganze Weile lang gedauert
Weißt du manche Dinge kann man halt als Kind nicht sehen
So wie Sterne am Tag
Und immer wieder merk ich, wie selten ich sag
Wie sehr ich dich mag, deine ehrliche Art
Und es wird immer mehr seit dem ersten Tag
Und ja ich weiß, es ist nicht immer leicht
Und wir beide haben leider hin und wieder Streit
Es tut mir Leid, bitte bleib, Baby
Denn dieser Moment ist so perfekt ich lass dich nie wieder alleine
Jeder von uns beiden weiß, das Leben ist so schnell vorbei und
Deshalb lass uns doch so tun als hätten wir für immer Zeit doch irgendwann ist alles wieder so

Es ist schon komisch wie das Leben so spielt
Bis eben noch hier, umgeben von dir
Ein Augenblick später heißt es: „Geh bitte! Wir
Sind nicht mehr wir.“ Du bist da, und ich bin jetzt hier
Und ich mache Jahrelang auf hart und sage: „Ist nichts passiert“

Tipp ´ne Nachricht in mein Handy, doch ich schick‘ sie nicht ab
Deine Nummer, keinen Plan ob ich die richtige hab
Ich denk an dich und daran, dass es jemanden gibt der dich mag
Du hast wirklich keine Ahnung wie verrückt es mich macht
Ich stehe auf, leg mich hin, gehe raus, denk ich spinn‘
Reg mich auf wie’n Kind, schrei es laut in den Wind

Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte nur fragen wie’s dir geht
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen

Lang, lang ist’s her, du erkennst mich sicher nicht
Ich schau hoch zu deinem Fenster, wo das Licht an ist
Geh auf und ab, als wenn ich wahnsinnig wär‘
Und mein Herz schlägt so laut, ich hör‘ die Straße nicht mehr
Ich bin wach vor deinem Revier, und ich lege mich an die Grenze
Es vergeht kein Abend, an dem ich nicht an dich denke
Dein Garten ist schön, er erinnert mich an dich
Und der Flieder blüht das ganze Jahr, wo immer du auch bist
Ich steck‘ ein Brief in dein Türschlitz, versteck‘ mich hinterm Zaun
Dann renn‘ ich fluchend wieder hin und hol ihn hektisch wieder raus
Kein Plan was mit mir los ist, ich habe dich nur so lange nicht gesehen
Und wollte fragen wie’s dir geht, und ob du froh bist
Ich mache mir keine Hoffnungen, oder so, ich wollte höflich sein
Ich hätt's früher getan, doch es ergab sich keine Möglichkeit
Es passierte so, wir haben uns leider nicht gewehrt
Und jeder lebt sein Leben weiter wie bisher

Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte nur fragen wie’s dir geht
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte nur fragen wie’s dir geht
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen

Es ist schön dich zu sehen, Love, hab dich vermisst
Hab' fast vergessen wie ich mag wie du bist
Kenn dich schon seitdem ich klein bin, wir hingen immer zusammen
Damals waren zwei Wochen Ferien ohne dich schon zu lang
Hab als Kind jeden Tag in deiner Straße gespielt
Jedesmal wenn meine Mami mich suchte, saß ich bei ihr
Wir wurden älter, ich lernte dich noch besser kennen
Erinner' mich wie wir am kleinen ? gesessen sind
Ich war zwölf und Rollerscater, ? breite Achsen unter ollen Trainer
Fuhr mit fünfzig Sachen down und mich hat's gebrettert
Hab meinen Arm geschreddert, fuhr es wieder Wochen später
Über dich lernte ich viele meiner Freunde kennen
Lachen über wie wir damals war'n, wenn wir uns heute sehen
Mit der Zeit ändert sich die Perspektive
Stucki, du bleibst meine erste Liebe

Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte nur fragen wie’s dir geht
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte nur fragen wie’s dir geht
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen

Wollt' heut mal fragen wie's euch geht?
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Ich wollte fragen wie's dir geht
Wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen

Lieber ficken statt quatschen
Jimmys lieber spliffen statt klatschen
Kein bisschen erwachsen, but ain't nobody fuckin' with my motherfucking game'

Und wir haben Süßigkeiten da
Denn wir büßen jeden Tag, ja, am Dübel ziehen macht Spaß
Ist übertrieben klar, doch gib mir noch ein Jahr
Und dieser Danju, Danju, Danju übernimmt die Charts, oh
Denn die Kiddies flippen aus
Und jeder echte G kommt aus dem Nicken nicht mehr raus
Woah, doch das' grad gar nicht der Punkt
Denn ich brauch nicht mehr als nur 'ne Parkbank und die Jungs
Wir waren die Hälfte unserer Jugend breit
Seit Bambule high und trotzdem war's 'ne gute Zeit

Cro,"Ich wär' so gerne Millionär
Dann wär mein Konto niemals leer
Ich wär' so gerne Millionär
Millionenschwer
Ich wär' so gerne Millionär

(Geld, Geld, Geld, Geld, Geld, Geld, Geld, Geld, Geld))

Ich hab' kein Geld, hab' keine Ahnung,
Doch ich hab 'n großes Maul
Bin weder Doktor noch Professor,
Aber ich bin stinkend faul
Ich habe keine reiche Freundin
Und keinen reichen Freund
Von viel Kohle hab' ich bisher
Leider nur geträumt

Was soll ich tun, was soll ich machen,
Bin vor Kummer schon fast krank
Hab' mir schon paar Mal überlegt
Vielleicht knackst du eine Bank
Doch das ist leider sehr gefährlich,
Bestimmt werd' ich gefasst
Und außerdem bin ich doch ehrlich
Und will nicht in den Knast

Ich wär' so gerne Millionär
Dann wär mein Konto niemals leer
Ich wär' so gerne Millionär
Millionenschwer
Ich wär' so gerne Millionär

Es gibt so viele reiche Witwen,
Die begehren mich sehr
Sie sind so scharf auf meinen Körper,
Aber den geb' ich nicht her
Ich glaub' das würd' ich nicht verkraften
Um keinen Preis der Welt
Deswegen werd' ich lieber Popstar
Und schwimm' in meinem Geld

Cro,"Das war mit Abstand die schlimmste Woche
Die ich in meinem Leben je hatte
Ich weiß nicht ob ich aufstehen soll
Und ich hab keinen Plan was ich mache
Denn irgendwie ist alles scheiße
Ich war noch nie so weit am Boden
Denn ich weiß mein ganzes Geld ist weg
Und meine Frau hat mich betrogen!
Whatever!

Bye, bye, ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Und mir ist scheißegal was morgen kommt
Ich heb' mein Glas und schrei' bye, bye

Ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Denn mir is' scheißegal was morgen kommt
Ich heb' mein Glas

Und schrei in den Spiegel, Mann, ich brauche nichts außer dich
Wir beide packen das, ich hab dich, du hast mich
Und hat irgendjemand von uns beiden sich mal verpisst
War das sicher wegen Geld oder irgendeiner Chick
Jetzt bin ich frei, frei und steh' wieder auf
Ich bin allein und schrei', es geht wieder raus
Spring' in die Nikes, fly, und geh' wie der Baus
Und Zeitlupe in den Club es hat ewig gebraucht
Doch es ist Samstagnacht, ich werd' langsam wach.
Und bezahl' die erste Runde mit 'nem Handschlag, passt
Was geht ab? Cro, guck mal das ist meine Welt
Meine Hobbies sind, öh, schubsen oder Beine stellen
Oder hin und wieder bisschen faulen auf 'ner Couch
Manchmal allein und manchmal mit Frauen
Doch heut' bin ich im Club, ich komme noch nich' heim
Wir feiern durch die Nacht bis die Sonne wieder scheint

Bye, bye, ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Und mir is' scheißegal was morgen kommt
Ich heb' mein Glas und schrei' bye, bye

Ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Denn mir is' scheißegal was morgen kommt
Ich heb' mein Glas

Ich wache, auf, schaue raus, keinen Plan wo ich bin
Das ganze Haus voller Frauen, ey, die schlafen bestimmt
Meine Hose ist zerrissen und der Wagen ist hin
Geh' in die Küche, mach mir erst einmal 'nen Kaffee mit Gin
Setz' mich hin, what's up, was geht, bin hier
Und leb', doch geh', demnächst, zu dir
Okay, und falls irgendjemand schon weiß was heute Abend geht
Dann bitte, bitte gib mir Bescheid
Denn ich bin irgendwie Moses, da will ich nicht Heim
Probleme lös' ich locker mit 'nem billigen Wein
Gib mir noch 'n Schluck, noch 'n Schluck
Noch 'n Schluck noch 'n Schluck, noch n Schluck
Jap ich bin yaba-daba-dei
Also gib, gib, gib, gib, gib mir 'n Becks!
Und ich kipp', kipp', kipp', kipp', kipp' es auf Ex!
Deine Gang hat Kids mit Clique auf der Cap
Ham' den Whiskey gegrabbt und verpissen sich jetzt

Bye, bye, ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Und mir is' scheißegal was morgen kommt
Ich heb' mein Glas und schrei' bye, bye

Ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Und mir is' scheißegal was morgen kommt,
