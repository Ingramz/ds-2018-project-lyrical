Howard Keel,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind",You Were Always on My Mind,2006
Howard Keel,"When you turn to the subject of Harry
That's a horse from a different safari. 
He can box like a fox, he's as dumb as an ox
But it's Harry I'm planning to marry


(Yes, it's Harry she's plannin' to marry)
 
My heart's twined around his suspenders
He's the one that I truly adore 
I'm numb, I succumb when he renders 
The face on the bar room floor


When he flexes his muscles, I flutter 
Like a butterfly caught in a shutter 
When he calls me his mate
I just disintegrate


Since the world first began (Since the world first began)
Never been such a man (Never been such a man)
Who could love like he can
So it's Harry I'm planning to marry!",Tis Harry I'm Plannin' to Marry [From Calamity Jane],2009
Howard Keel,"Others find peace of mind in pretending,
Couldn't you?
Couldn't I?
Couldn't we?
Might as well make believe I love you,
For to tell the truth I do",Make Believe [From Show Boat],2009
Howard Keel,"You are love, here in my arms
Where you belong,
And here you will stay.
I'll not let you away
I want day after day with you.

You are spring,
Bud of romance unfurled,
You taught me to see
One truth, forever true.

You are love,
Wonder of all the world.
Where you go with me
Heaven will always be!

You are love, here in my arms
Where you belong,
And here you will stay.
I'll not let you away;
I want day after day with you.

You are spring,
Bud of romance unfurled,
You taught me to see
One truth, forever true.

You are love,
Wonder of all the world.
Where you go with me
Heaven will always be!

Once a wand'ring ne'er do well,
Just a vagrant roving fellow,
I went my way.

Life was just a joke to tell,
Like a lonely Punchinello,
My role was gay.

But I knew the joke was aimless,
Time went on, I liked the game less,
For you see,

Somewhere lurked a spark divine and,
I kept wond'ring whether mine
Would come to me.

Then my fortune turned and I found you;
Here you are with my arms around you.
You will never know what you've meant to me.
You're the prize that heaven has sent to me.
Here's a bright and beautiful world all new
Wrapped up in you.","You Are Love [From ""Showboat""]",2009
Howard Keel,"Take me back to the black hills
The black hills of Dakota
To the beautiful Indian country
That I love

Lost my heart in the black hills
The black hills of Dakota
Where the pines are so high
That they kiss the sky above

And when I get that lonesome feelin'
And I'm miles away from home
I hear the voice of the mystic mountains
Callin' me back home

So take me back to the black hills
The black hills of Dakota
To the beautiful Indian country
That I love

And when I get that lonesome feelin'
And I'm miles away from home
I hear the voice of the mystic mountains
Callin' me back home

So take me back to the black hills
The black hills of Dakota
To the beautiful Indian country
That I love

To the beautiful Indian country
That I love
Take me back to the black hills
To the beautiful Indian country that I love",The Black Hills of Dakota,2011

Howard Kirkpatrick,"Oh, come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

God of God
Light of light
Lo, he abhors
Not the virgin's womb
Very God
Begotten not created
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens
Of heaven above
Glory to God
In the highest

O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord

See how the shepherds
Summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks
Draw nigh with lowly fear
We too will thither bend
Our joyful footsteps
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus
To thee be glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord",O Come All Ye Faithful,2001
Howard Kleinfeld,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]",The Look of Love,2002
Howard Kleinfeld,"Woo  ah mercy, mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be.
No, no, where did all the blue skies go,
Poison is the wind that blows 
From the north and south and east 
Woo mercy, mercy me
 
Ah things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon
Our seas fish full of mercury, ah.  oh
 
Ah things ain't what they used to be
What about this over crowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
 
Oh mercy, mercy me.
Ah things ain't what they used to be.
No, no, no, radiation underground and in the sky;
Animals and birds who live near by are dying oh,
 
Oh mercy, mercy me.
Ah things ain't what they used to be.
No, no, no, radiation underground and in the sky;
Animals and land how much more abuse from man can she stand?",Mercy Mercy Me,2004
Howard Kleinfeld,"Ooh la, la, la, la.
I did you wrong, my heart went out to play 
And in the game I lost you, what a price to pay!
I'm cryin', ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
Mistakes I know I've made a few, 
But I'm only human;  you've made mistakes too!
I'm cryin', ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
Ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby I'm just about at the end of my rope.
But I can't stop tryin', I can't give up hope 
'cause I feel someday I'll hold you near, 
Whisper I still love you 
Until that day is here ooh I'm cryin'.
 
Ooh baby baby ooh baby baby","Ooh Baby, Baby",2004
Howard Lanin & His Orchestra,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You,2000
Howard Lawrence,"Helpless is all I can feel
There's a plate in my head of reinforced steel
Have patience they said
We've done all we can this time
I know it's wrong to hang your hat on a rack that don't belong
But I was too young to realize the world wasn't mine
When will the fog clear?
To feel alive again I'll say goodbye and disappear
How do these things happen?
Maybe I'm just color blind

They tried in vain to save his tender ego
But she found a way to punish him with bullets and arrows
They traded for the standard replacement
Then left him in shock in the basement
His hair in disarray

They told me things they knew were false
And never tried to fight the impulse
Spent many days and nights behind the curtain
Paralyzed with fear as they made their moves
The pain's still sharp-it lingers on
They left me with nothing but things to prove

Too stoned to find the door
So he curls up frightened on the floor
Winter passes while he's away
The doctors and nurses have nothing to say

Take back my soul now
All I see is red
When I'm lost I'm found
Back in bed
Researchers can chart my decline
I wanna be brave
And take a dive off the coast to test the waves
When I'm too far from the shore would you throw me a line?
Put my trust in science
That's the honest way back to self-reliance
The lights have changed
This man's no longer color blind

He opened up the drawer to find the letter
It said she had to get away for something better
Their program enhanced his understanding
His nightmare was over and soon he'd be landing",Color Blindness,2011
Howard Lawrence,"Never was groomed to ride like a cowboy
Much more at home in a cyberspace lab
For fifteen minutes of fame and fortune
I'd blow my cover
What choice would I have?

But look at me now I'm a real disaster
Catch me on Twitter-the clues are there
Nothing we build is sacred here
The more we suffer the less they care

Plant the seed and then withdraw
Let it learn-then exploit the flaws
And when the kids log on on the weekend
They'll be part of this cause
Better warn your people, better watch your back
My shadow just coughed up this digital scream attack

Year after year this addiction grows
One day I'll be on my knees
Crawling through holes is my new purpose
Crack the code the firewall bleeds

Scan your drives...your fragmented folders
Encrypt your sensitive information
I'll just double down and recruit more soldiers
Protégés from the next generation

The black seed wants to grow from within
Cat, mouse. who's gonna win?
And when the laptops grind to a halt
You'll never find what the cat brought in
Pull the servers offline so we don't get tracked
My shadow just coughed up this digital scream attack

Pop my pills in the shower
A green one every hour

Download that streaming video
Pass around your audio clips
Spread my germ to your home network
Kiss the girl with tainted lips

My iPhone buzzed 7:30 this morning
They shot me a message I couldn't ignore
This might sound like deranged paranoia
But no one could explain what the app was for

You're locked out now-it won't let you in
The cat can only watch as the mouse plays gin
And when the kids log on on the weekend
You'll never know where they've been
Didn't warn your people
now they're not coming back
My shadow just coughed up this digital scream attack

Mistakes were buried in the yard
You rode me way too hard
All the way down",Digital Scream Attack,2011
Howard Lawrence,"Someone let you down
Dealt you a hand you couldn't play out
Made you afraid of life
Gave you a reason for raising your knife
But something brought you here
You don't know what it is or whether it's real
Like hourglass sand you're falling through space
Searching for clues so you know what to chase

Don't look around for a four leaf clover
Don't get attached to your fortune cookie
Nothing can save you from drowning your faith
Or hatching a plot for the ultimate escape
But everything you need is there staring back at you
Once you let go of the enemy inside
Everyone's waiting, we're all here to catch you
So give yourself a gift-let go of the enemy inside

Swimming against the tide
You put your thumb out and got taken for a ride
Lost all your dignity
The audience laughed at your pleas for humanity
Sometimes it helps to eat dirt
With a newborn's perspective you'll rarely get hurt
Just keep one eye open in case of attack
'Cause even your friends can put a gun to your back

Don't be surprised when the storm flies over
Don't burn the leaves on your neighbor's timetable
Nothing can keep you from losing your touch
Dark chocolate everyday?
Hmmm, that's a bit too much!
When all you need is me in there staring back at you
You can let go of the enemy inside
Don't keep us waiting for you to decide
Listen to your heart-let go of the enemy inside

Haven't you made a big fool of yourself?
Even a blind man can see you need help

Remind me to book the next date
So you can rediscover what's been left on your plate
Show you the rhythm machine
If you get up and dance there's a chance you'll be seen
Leave your computer alone
It's a crutch and you know it-your chair ain't a throne
How long has it been?
Such a long time to waste
Put the glass to your lips-all you need is one taste",The Enemy Inside,2011
Howard Lawrence,"Bless the mind of a quiet child
Give him a reason to crack a smile
He may not be a happy boy
But there are moments he may enjoy

Winter clothes from the discount bin
A weary face shows where he's been
The teachers miss his pleas for help
He wishes he were someone else

That's why he's so far from heaven
Already three steps behind
Too many lonely boys learn things the hard way
You can't rule the playground on your own terms
Every miscalculation costs you one turn

Goes to work with hopeful eyes
Wants to get noticed, that's no surprise
Enters the meeting with fresh ideas
Makes it look easy outgunning his peers

He feels resentment as the group walks by
They laugh at him but who knows why?
Eats his lunch alone in the park
The little girl stares and it breaks his heart

That's why he's so far from heaven
Can't leave his odd ways behind
Some people dig trenches, they always learn the hard way
You can't win them over on your own terms
But that's the only way to go if you've got the nerve

He runs upstairs to see who's there but never in time
The telephone rings till he picks up—another dead line
Kicks the wall and grits his teeth then pours some more red wine
Deal with it! 

Friday night he hits the clubs
With cash in his pockets lookin for love
Scans the room for a friendly face
A chance to show off his style and taste

Stands aloof at the end of the bar
Nervously jangling the keys to his car
A beautiful woman glances his way
He wants to move in but has nothing to say

That's why he's so far from heaven
Couldn't solve the mystery girl again
So many lonely men gotta learn the hard way
You can't crash the party on your own terms
Once it's drained of energy it never returns",Far From Heaven,2011
Howard Lawrence,"Give yourself a glimpse of the new world order
Come in then lock the gates
I'm the fat cat in charge
Who lets the inmates date the guards
You're gonna run em out when it's too late

Cover your eyes
This may not be a pleasant thing to watch
Never thought I'd find religion here
But got hooked on single malt Scotch

How do we survive?
We haven't found the secret yet
Chasing friends online is all we know
And to really get creative we beat ourselves senseless
Why don't we just pack our bags and go?

Gotta get to the airport
22 miles to catch that plane
If the shadow jumps that wall again
I might just go insane
The end of what I love is near
Who can fly this bird with broken wings?
Across the pond they're betting against
The next savant that we crowned king

Dark circles frame his eyes
Uploads the database that tracks his known failures
When friends arrive he polishes his act
The change is subtle—otherwise he cracks
He swears he's safe but shrinks from reality
Why won't he expose his self-loathing malady?

We're running in place here
Wasting all these gifts to make ends meet
No wonder we're lost
This brilliant master plan was never even our idea
But we subsidize it's cost

You can bring your dog to see me
But don't expect to rid him of his fleas
We buff the patient's chart here
His treatment just might trigger a new disease

What passes here for breaking news
Just teaches kids to hate our views
Whaddawe expect them to do?
Hurry up already
We're tryin to hold steady
The more they fear the less we beg
So let's just blow the powder keg

Gotta get to the airport
22 miles to catch that plane
If the shadow creeps outside again
We'll all end up insane

The noise is growing louder now
She can't maneuver in reverse
The rocks are bubbling underground
Pick up the phone and call the head nurse please!",Miles Away,2011
Howard Lawrence,"The headline said you were caught
Heard a rumor that you were bought
You hurt a lot of people that's for sure
But we can overlook anything we can't ignore

This time you were nailed
We installed the patch but it failed
So here's a proposition-please hear us out
We're gonna uncover what you're all about

Sign your name on the seventh page
Be a 00-agent of the digital age
Changing the way the world spins is our job

Someone said getting knocked in the head
Will teach you right from wrong
That sounds like a good fit for a theme song

Open up that backroom door
Reverse engineer your doomsday plan
Tell us it's a hoax in language we understand

Our team leaders can show you how
To separate right from wrong
We knew it was you
Blowing bubbles in the holes all along

Maybe it's time to look around
They're gonna grind you into the ground
You can bury ambition and end up poor
Or put twenty large aside at the end of our tour

Now's the time to come clean
Dismantle your digital scream
Be the next megamogul, keep the girls safe
There's no better way to get yourself laid

Call me a misfit and threaten my job
But if I needed a lecture I'd call my mom
This is a pretty slim package
Start greasin my palm!

I'm not what you think so don't even try
You'll never teach me right from wrong
Here's my wish list-you'll notice it's ten pages long

My world is a sacred place
My views are in focus and highly evolved
So what makes you think I'm for sale?
My tail wag like a dog?

You can drop the pop psychology
You don't really know right from wrong
And now it's much too late
This ain't where I belong

Someone said getting knocked in the head
Will teach you right from wrong
That's a helluva good fit for a theme song

My mind is a scary place
But my views are in focus now and highly evolved
Hey you're convinced it's just a game
Let's end this call!

I may be far from heaven
But I'm right where I belong

You'll never catch me
I'm just not for sale
Not now, not ever!",Right From Wrong,2011
Howard Lawrence,"Staring at the mirror I don't even know my own face
My mind spinning circles
My world filled with empty space
The light playing tricks on my sense of time
When strangers come up to me
I say I'm just fine

Who can believe all this straightjacket logic?
When people say they're schizophrenic
Aren't they neurologic?

There's so many of us reeling
Wandering around
Searching for clarity
Focusing on inner sounds
If all we need is love
What's the fighting all about?
They've stacked the cards against us
And now they're shaking us down! 

Crackin up from chronic lack of REM sleep was bound to happen
Howlin at the moon
Whisper if you catch me nappin
I seem to explode at the drop of a hat
For no apparent reason
So what's up with that?

Blame the ugly side effects on all this medication
I know I'm only schizophrenic
But who needs such aggravation?

Freedom is something none of us has
So we lie to ourselves
Have you ever noticed?
They keep me in a lab conducting the most invasive tests
My behavior makes them nervous
Maybe they've got things to hide?
My plan is to check myself out involuntarily
Her smile will light my path
See, I've done all the higher math…

Needing just to be with her without raising expectations
One wet kiss would be enough to energize my sensations
But then I remember who I really am
And the laughing gets the best of me
I just don't stand a chance

I must not be alone in here
Coz even when it's dark
This notion that I'm schizophrenic
Tells me where to start",Schizophrenia,2011
Howard Lawrence,"We're not the enemy young man
Wind up the game again
Wash out the stain of friends
You need to believe the answer lies deep in your prayers

They can see you
They can see me
They're only guilty of lacking in sympathy

In the early morning they come and go like dreams
Your world is bleak and disconnected
Maybe it's the company you keep

Follow the road signs
Signal please either right or left
It takes real vigilance to screen each call for help

They're closing in to take you down
Well ain't this story tragic?
Dragged into the dark abyss surfing into madness

Phishing scams
Sickening spam
Madness, madness, madness

You tried to steal from me what you never had
Took pains to shelter me from good things not bad
Now it's your unrelenting voice that's driving me mad

Gotta wise up
It's time to climb up and crawl right out of this place

Bots and worms
Makin me squirm

They can hear you
They can hear me
Uniforms in hot pursuit chasing after ecstasy

It leaves you dry
This cocktail you've been swallowing
You walk the street alone but you don't know who's been following

I don't wanna play, stop the game! 
Gotta get back ain't that a fact?
My brain is on a binge again and on the wrong track

I tried to hide the evidence
My poor mother found it
She caught me going hardcore surfing into madness
Could all this mayhem mean we're going straight to hell?",Surfing Into Madness,2011
Howard Lawrence,"Make love to jazz and dance in the rain
Pour yourself a nightcap to soften your brain
Fill the yard with pets if they make you laugh
Lock the year-end bonus in to thank your staff
Stop driving with your fist in the air
This is not the way! 
You wanna be remembered down there?

The holidays were good to you so give some back
It doesn't matter how?????just stick to those who lack
That gurgling in your stomach just means you've had enough
So drop some change in the beggar's cup
He'll sing some wicked stuff

Start the day with supplements and herbal tea
Book another weekend with friends you hardly see
Tell your dad you'd love to share an evening at the pub
Package up a golf game and a happy ending back rub

Thank God for all this freedom??...

Host the next conference here without an agenda
Gift your box seats to your favorite bartender
Avoid the big mistakes and you might forgive your parents
Sure they're full of nonsense but look at what they're wearin

Howard Lawrence,"All those years feeling displaced
The light on my face reflecting sadness
Too much weight around my shoulders
Pulled me closer to the edge of madness
I struggled hard to resist temptation
My albatross? The next sensation
Now I'm learning how to live with that past

When I'm awake I'm plagued with worry
Keeps me honest so I don't deceive myself
It's not a cakewalk with anyone
You can't just toss pennies in the well
To jump right in when the water's cold
Takes a leap of faith?????I've never been that bold
Hope I haven't hit the ground running too fast

I'll follow you if you'll ease my mind
All I need is proof
You're the cavalry
My hero for saving my life
Girl you're the truth

There has to be room for conversation
You've got to find some common ground
It's all about sharing your secrets
With someone you know who'll be around
Don't look too far beyond the sunset
Just be sure to give what you get
That's the only way to make your love last

I found the answer in your eyes
When all I needed was proof
You're the memory
You're the future of all ages
With you in my life I found the truth",The Truth,2011

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak

If it should rain we'll let it

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

Everyone's gone someplace
I pick you up and in the trunk I've packed
A cooler and a 2-day suitcase
Cause there's a place we like to drive
Way out in the country
Five miles out of the city limit we're singing
And your hand's upon my knee

So we're okay
We're fine
Baby I'm here to stop your crying

Chase all the ghosts from your head
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart
Adding up the total of a love that's true
Multiply life by the power of two

You know the things that I am afraid of
I'm not afraid to tell
And if we ever leave a legacy
It's that we loved each other well
'Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people
Trying on the treasures of youth
But a road that fancy and fast ends
Ends in a fatal crash
And I'm glad we got off
To tell you the truth

'Cause we're okay
We're fine
Baby I'm here to stop your crying
Chase all the ghosts from your head
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart
We'll look at them together then we'll take them apart

Multiply life by the power of two

All the shiny little trinkets of temptation
(Make new friends)
Something new instead of something old
(But keep the old)
All you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface
(But remember what is gold)
And it's fools gold
(What is gold)
Fools gold
(What is gold)
Fools gold

Now we're talking about a difficult thing
And your eyes are getting wet
I took us for better and I took us for worse
Don't you ever forget it
Now the steel bars between me and a promise
Suddenly bend with ease
The closer I'm bound in love to you
The closer I am to free

So we're okay
We're fine
Baby I'm here to stop your crying
Chase all the ghosts from your head

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Right where it counts - no, not in another place

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

Melody haunting me

More lost without you and so it goes

Howard Roberts,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1959

Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Howie Damron,"Had an uncle named Matthew
He was his father's only boy
Born just south of Cobly, Kansas
He was his mother's pride and joy

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

And all the stories that he told me
Back when I was just a lad
All the memories that he gave me
All the good times that he had

Growin' up a Kansas farmboy
Life was mostly havin' fun
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a view beneath the sun
 
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

Well, I guess there were some hard times
And I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in forty-seven
A twister came and stripped them clean

He lost the farm and lost his family
He lost the wheat and lost his home
But he found a family Bible
Faith as solid as a stone

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

So he came to live at our house
And he came to work the land
He came to ease my Daddy's burden
And he came to be my friend

So, I wrote this down for Matthew
And it's for him the song is sung
 Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a view beneath the sun

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

Lately I've been dreaming with you 
I'm so resistant to this type of thinking 
Oh, now it's shining through 
I was alone for the last time 
Before my night's vacation with you 
Alive from the first 
Now I'm denied by the ghost of you 

You take yourself a photograph and laugh at me 
Please 

I know there's little use in crying 
It's more wide awake and dying then I'm used to 
I thought we'd walk these streets together 
Now I'm hoping that I'll never have to meet you 
Step aside from all this anger 
And somewhere in between I can feel you 
Ask me should we try again 
I'm thinking no 
why'know, it's not what I believe in 
It's not what I believe in 

You take yourself a photograph and laugh at me 
Please 
You make yourself a photograph and laugh at me 
Please 

No I, want to taste you, love 
No I...no I 
No I, just want to taste you, love 

Standing in your shoes 
I turn and now 
You're standing bare in my doorway 
I only wish that I had been prepared 
I'm gonna have to go along with your way 
Just take the plastic camera out 
It's the pants you borrowed in the driveway 
Alive from the first 
Now I'm denied by the ghost of you 

Make yourself a photograph and laugh at me

She left it up to fate
Standing at a phone, oh

And she knows what she wants
And she came here to take it
How perfect it could be you and me

And she met him at the door
I don't want you anymore
Remember what you said

You and a promise
You and a promise
You

You tell me he didn't wait
He walked right through the gate
So glad to be alone

And he knows who to call
I'll always be there for you
Call me anytime

I don't mean to offend
The voice on the other end
Is a stranger to me

You and a promise
You and a promise

And they say to themselves
And they say to themselves
How could I ever let this out

I've been wandering through the park
With the angry words you said
Wandering through my head

There's nothing I can do
To keep from feeling like I blew
The only chance I had to make it better

The shadow on the wall
Is looking down from 10 feet tall
And I wonder what it sees
As I stumble through the streets

To never feel alone
It seemed written down in stone
But now it's all I can do
To try and forget her

40 hours and counting
I could shut my eyes
And sleep here

Warning comes and goes
And I'm tangled in the throes
In the stillness of my room
And the bandage on my wound

My heart becomes a bird
She said freely, just a word
And now I'm wishing
That I had never met her

40 hours and counting
I could shut my eyes
And sleep here

People rushing by
Out the corner of my eye
A kaleidoscope of bloom
A mirror broke in two

A thousand little stars
And a million little wars
Scattered out upon the open desert

40 hours and counting
I shut my eyes
And sleep here

A world is set ablaze
By a never ending haze
And you're closer than a tear
I see you ever clear

The rush is in the veins
And there's nothing else to blame
But every minute
Every hour, every second

40 hours and counting
I shut my eyes
And sleep here
Shut my eyes and sleep to dream

And Your bed was made you must have cut out sometime lastnight,
My heart beat started pounding out riddle in my brain,
Voice from deep inside said got to be insane,
Everyone knows how this old story goes,
Got in my taxi and drank my conscience away,

If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight,
Start livin, out with the old, I'm on the up,
Must be the good life

I went to your friends house begged you to open the door,
With Your hands on your hips you spoke while I sat down on the floor,
Two dishes in the kitchen sink, the way you treat me when you drink,
You don't look so superior when you give your opion,
Don't think I don't know how you act on your own,
Just who are those names on your cell phone anyway,

If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight,
Start livin, out with the old, I'm on the up,
Must be the good life,

Its the cool breeze on the setting sun,
The New Year's , The 4th, wrapped into one,
You make me want to be someone that you could look up too,

If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight,
Start livin, out with the old, I'm on the up,
Must be the good life,

Come on and try,
Come on now what are you waiting for?

So hard, to let go of

I was close to a fault line

Was it real?
Now I feel, like I'm never coming down

Howie Day,"We had it all we were, young lovers, we were full of trust and faith 
We were dead set on makin' it last forever, forever and a day. 
I recall it was fall last year when, it started to die. 
You standing still as the temperature kills, the summer's thrills that were keeping it alive. 
The days got colder so I held you closer, in an effort to save us from time, 
Almost like a wind came and ruined the spark and left us in the dark. 

But hey, I coulda told you that I loved you and stayed, 
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late, 
On my return and now you've lost all faith. 
And I am the liar, 
I'm no longer what you require. 

I still feel you at night, turning in the sheets when I turn out the light 
That's how it goes, the ghost of your first love wont ever leave you til the day that you die 
I wont ever live down leaving her behind even if the choice was the right one 
It was a good thing staring me right in the face but I turned and ran away. 

Hey, I coulda told you that I loved you and stayed, 
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late 
On my return and now you've lost all faith. 
And I am the liar, 
I'm no longer what you require. 

Back then the days were so much faster, 
We were young, stubborn, and in love with disaster. 
You know you can't go back even if you try, 
You better just forget her won't you close the door on me 
Cause it'll never be the same 
It'll never be the way it was before 

Well hey, I coulda told you that I loved you and stayed, 
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late, 
On my return and so you've lost all faith. 
And I am the liar, 
Oh hey- I woulda told you that I loved you and stayed 
Around to rekindle the fire but I was late

It's hip hop, don't hem 'em
Money earnin' concernin'
I'll be teachin' and learnin'
Gettin' hot from my rhymes and my looks
Not from bourbon
No solution, no remedy
No cure like a deodorant
Yo, you have to be sure
That if you talk up or walk up into myface
That wouldn't become a big public disgrace
'Cause I'll ban you, burn you up, and tan you
Treat you like the elephant
And man you will be hocked and locked in a jar with a lid
Hangin' on a wall in Michael Jackson's crib
'Cause I'm bad, in fact I'm a thriller
I drink milk, that's why I'm a top biller

Rough like bark but dark and lovely
This ain't no game and I'm no toy
And like Anita Baker, I'll bring you joy
With my word when I open my mouth
Ask Oliver North to go and break south
A homo is a no-no but you know I'll smack a faggot
Boy, you got to see me, I'm rich like Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a loon and ya know, comin' soon
A rhyme kicked to this Popeye tune
This is hip hop with a little be-bop
And I won't flop 'cause I can't stop
I will mop up the slop and then go to the top
'Cause I'm not Robocop, I'm Chubb Rock

I'm Chubb Rock risin' and I'll break your leg
And I'm more than a forty ounce, I'm more like a keg
And I'm the big dipper, rippin' like Jack the Ripper
And if you want the proof, the proof is in my liquor
So you knew it and you blew it, let's get to it
Gonna run you over with a rhyme that's like a big Buick
And since you think you're slender, I'll slap you with a fender
And bind you up, wind you up, and grind you up in a blender
And then I'll serve you with coffee and cake
Oh damn, I should've had a V-8, oh well
I'll put you on a plate so it looks a little neater
You're a tramp, so I'll sprinkle salt and pepper
And paprika on your face, like mace
So you can taste immediately
Just like the base that went up your nose previously
So it seems you're too zooed to battle
Word's up chump, acne bump, skidaddle
You're a nine, I'm a ten
Victory is mine agai, this Bud's for me
So here, take a Heineken
With your self-esteem, you will never redeem
Like Martin Luther King, you have a dream
That maybe you will beat me, maybe defeat me
But you're too illiterate, so I won't consider it
Weak is the word and the rhyme is identical
This is not the late show
And I'm not Arsenio Hall
But quite tall with the gall
And I have magic and I can play ball
And guys won't boo this, girls will just screw this
It's ludicrous but we can dothis

Howlin Rain,"Goodbye, Ruby, watch you winding
Down these snake trails that roll like rain drops in the dust
Windy woman, blown my cover
I sit here all alone but I would never sing this kind of song

Wicked dreams
Down drowning streams
Of blood and other wild schemes
That play like mold for the rust

Swallow's wings
And other old and tattered things
The dull and fade of wedding rings
Now this song is one of those

There's fire in these hills, closer every day
The wind calls the hangman to my name
My father said the ocean would beat upon my grave
And that on that day I would long for my home
And it's family stone

Here I am waiting in watercolor gray
I'll wait for you or Jesus or any other technicolor day
Howling dogs at the dust cloud walls
Snapping at the heels of death
To share with them a piece of the catch

I long to see the Banyan trees or any other place
Where the waves are made of thunder
And the seabirds clean the blood from off my feet

Oh, wicked ocean made my heart a beggar
The crabs that ride the jet streams
Are picking out the eyes of my dreams

The fire in these hills gets closer every day
The wind calls the hangman to my name
My brother said the wild world would feed upon my skin
And that on that day I would long for the farm
And an honest simple faith

The majesty of insect wings
And the brittle of their bones
Reminds me of a tropic wind
Blowing through the skull of our home

Ruby, I chased your laughter with elephant wings
You left me for the law
Left me bones for the grave

Childish beauty, Sunday charm
All has made a ghost of me, spirit dead, shackled arms
As I hung the wind whipped your wild name
And pierced the heart of a fading ghost
For seabirds only death upon the plain

The blood that beats this heart is blood upon the floor
Ruby you lead the hangman to my door
My mother said a woman would be the death of me
And that on that day no god would hear
An outlaw's dying prayer

",Goodbye Ruby,2008
Howlin Rain,"I caught a glimpse of your body by the river
I was alone and the sky went forever
I was the one that killed your father in the first world war
I once vowed to love your sister for a lifetime
Took her to the altar and left her like a wind chime
That was the dawning of the age of the cannibal world

Lord have mercy on my soul, have mercy Lord
Mama, have mercy on my soul

I took your wild peacocks down to the sawmill
And ground their bones into dust and blood meal
A rainbow of feathers and shame fell upon my wicked hand
Lucy, my love, get inside my Grand Torino
I tell you little girl don't go into the jungle
There's a million hungry insects there
And man, they're going to eat you alive, yes, they will

Lord have mercy on my soul, have mercy Lord
Mama, have mercy on my soul

Cold dead moon don't stare at me
With your bony judgmental eye
Only the peacocks and earthly things
Can judge me as they pass by
Can judge me as they pass through this world
Judge me as they pass by
Lord, he has my number under the thunder in his hand

",Lord Have Mercy,2008
Howlin Rain,"Carry me back into the sand
Into the sand with the flowers and the fern
Old Mr. Centipede climbing tobacco leaves
Looking for livers and hearts for to eat

Cold and gray clouds staining the sounds
Straining the weight of a sorrowful sky
Wool on the trees, dust on the eves
The bark on the pines is worse than its bite

All of the lines have been lies this far
There is a feeling I must keep from you

The hills of nomads, we envy their lives
A picture we love, hills have eyes
This old motel song you dig when you're stoned
But sounds like a cheap shot
When you're sober and cold

But if you are
As stoned as a ghost in the snow
Your eyes will be blue flames

These lines are crawling snakes up your open legs
You wear them pale and fine
This is the line I'll give you true as the dawn
While the furious eye on the sun is upon us

The way your breasts dance while we're making love
Now that is a line penned by a divinely guided hand

Tailwind carry the birds to the coast
To watch the clouds roll along
Pollen and pitch whisper the scripture
Of kings in a tongue only spoken by ghosts

",Nomads,2008
Howlin Rain,"Did you fall in love with the cannon's fire?
And the smell of a smoldering world
In the bloody sand where lead flies like insects through the air
This is just a moment of confusion, birds like a lattice to the sun
You calculate the simple execution by the silent run
Of the numbers in our blood

You don't have to go through any more changes, it's all done now
You don't have to break the wild horses that run you and run you down
You don't have to untangle the bells that jingle and chime and charm you
You don't have to change, you don't have to hold onto your past
You don't have to carry it down this path, it's all part of the deal

In the pitch of the night is a stranger, strange as the shadow by your side
It calls to your mind a face you haven't called upon for years
Once you were a magnificent fiend, eyes like electric eels
An executioner of the highest degree
Here you are family sweet torturer in the arms of the secret world
A piano plays to the vague erosion of the day

You don't have to go through any more changes, it's all done now
You don't have to break the wild horses that run you and run you down
You don't have to untangle the bells that jingle and chime and charm you
You don't have to change, you don't have to hold onto your past
You don't have to carry it down this path, it's all part of the deal

",El Rey,2008
Howlin Rain,"These are not thieves come to take your ruby ring
They are not ghosts with tales too long
It's the sound of dancing of many legged things
That gather your tears from off the ground

Our home is a feast love moving from the land
We're swaying swamp reeds in the sand
It's a cold feeling that hangs about our bones
When we ride the death's head waters like leaves

Take my arrow, the last one I got
Wait for the wind to take your shot
Maybe tomorrow you'll leave another tombstone
Made of sand and moss

Here's my teeth, mama, do you want them back
To tear the woven web and wires that bind you?
I killed a man and I'd kill a country full
To keep the rusted boat beneath your feet

Our days are numbered too but not outnumbered yet
While I see you laughing at the sun
The stars lay on your naked skin, the moon was on your breast
When a hail of arrows fell upon us

Take my shell of buckshot the last one I got
Wait for the wind and take your shot
Maybe tomorrow we'll leave two sunken tombstones
With the silt and moss

Can you take aim at my enemies?
I can't see them anymore
I will fire blindly into the trees and hope I hit someone's god
Or three of some kind of ghost

These are our times, mama, made of blood and bone
Furious misfortune is upon us
We had a run of luck and ran it to the ground
It calls our lives from the darkness

I see you with burning eyes, burning with my tears
I hate, I hate to see your fear
I'll leave a hundred bodies rotting in the sun
And when my final bullet flies I'll be gone
I'll be with my love upon the Styx river

Dreamt of raging fires
Swept around the bend
Dreamt I had a nightmare

The cities burning down again
The cities burning down again

And the storm it kept on coming
All the while I saw the sun
Then the earth made a sound
And I heard it tempt me

The cities burning down again
The cities burning down again

So help me out please
So help me out please

Oh, I

Trying to rise the water
It was a love that filled the sea
Dreamt I had a nightmare

The cities falling down on me
The cities falling down on me
The cities burning down again
The cities burning down again

Will it taste like the collisions we played out in the dark?

Hoyt Axton,"It was Della and the Dealer and a dog named Jake
And a cat named Kalamazoo.
Left the city in a pick up truck,
Gonna make some dreams come true.

Yea,they rolled out west where the wild sun sets
And the coyote bays at the moon.
Della and the Dealer and a dog named Jake
and a cat named Kalamazoo

[Chorus:]
If that cat could talk what tales he'd tell
About Della and the Dealer and the dog
as well
But the cat was cool, and he never said a mumblin word.

Down Tucson way there's a small cafe
Where they play a little cowboy tune.
And the guitar picker was a friend of mine
By the name of Randy Boone.

Yea, Randy played her a sweet love song
And Della got a fire in her eye
The Dealer had a knife and the dog had a gun
and the cat had a shot of Rye.

[Chorus]

Yea, the dealer was a killer,
He was evil and mean
And he was jealous of the fire in her eyes.

He snorted his coke through a century note
And swore that Boone would die.

The stage was set when the lights went out.
There was death in Tucson town.
Two shadows ran for the bar back door
And one stayed on the ground

[Chorus]

Two shadows ran from the bar that night
And dog and cat ran too.
And the tires got hot on the pick up truck
As down the road they flew.

It was Della and her lover and a dog named Jake
And a cat named Kalamazoo.
Left Tucson in a pick-up truck
Gonna make some dreams come true.

Down in Mexicali.

To try and find a way
To reach that woman
In old Mexico.

And I met a kind man
He guarded the border
He said, ""You don't need papers,
I'll let you go,
I can tell that you love her
By the look in your eyes, now"".

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you

I have never known sleep
Like the slumber that creeps to me
I have never known color
Like this morning reveals to me

And you haven't moved an inch
Such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this
The flesh calmly going cold

We lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand
So still and discreet
So long we become the flowers
We'd feed well the land
And worry the sheep

And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you

They'd find us in a week (Lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long we become the flowers)
They'd find us in a week (Lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle shows fear (So long we become the flowers)

And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had its say

I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you

Laughing away through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather to be tonight

I need to be youthfully felt, 'cause God I never felt young

Fortunately baby, I'd already locked the door

They say, there are men who are blue like me in the stars
Beards for the weird and bars for bizarre guitar men
Fortunately baby, I'd already joined the force

It wins the race to the place where I'm gonna pack up

Turn around and tell girls we like family

Behind the laughter they thinkin' about jammin' me
But they don't know, I got somethin' for them
But I ain't with that negative vibe, so fuck all that
I've earned a lot from this game, and sacrificed more
Stand here a new man, but I'm still the old boy
They claimin' they sell but I'm still the old boss
Sometimes wings get clipped, we all hit the floor

Disturbed like the eighth floor of your hospital ward

sont souvent aussi noires
que les charmes exhalés
dans nos trous de mémoire
les vaccins de la vie
sur les bleus de nos cœurs 
ont la mélancolie
des sols bémols mineurs
pour un temps d'amour
tant de haine en retour

quelques froides statues
aux pieds des sycomores
rappellent un jamais plus
avec le nom des morts
un oiseau de chagrin
dans le ciel assombri
chante un nouveau matin
sur des ruines en bosnie
pour un temps d'amour
tant de haine en retour

je visionne les miroirs
de ces vies déchirées
maintenant que le soir
ne cesse de tomber
& ma colère qui monte
& ma haine accrochée
au-dessus de ces tombes
où je n'ose pas cracher
pour un temps d'amour
tant de haine en retour

d'autres salauds cosmiques
s'enivrent à bételgeuse
dans les chants magnétiques
des putains nébuleuses

apprends donc à tenir ta laisse

que la vie tient toujours

tu verras ta reine arriver
au volant de la stéréo
d'un tuning-car customisé
mais l'amour s'use à la lumière
& les louttes sont toutes un peu louffes
elles te feront jouer du somnifère
dans un h.p avec les oufs

apprends donc à tenir ta laisse
t'es pas tout seul en manque de secours

peut-être qu'en smurfant sur ta folie
tu deviendras l'idole des bas-fonds

fera sa standing ovation

de backstages en mondanités
la réussite est un échec

A ne montrer nos yeux que dans le contre-jour

Curieux soleil de plexiglas 
Dans la vitrine des marchands d'ours 
Gyrophares sur mes pataugas

Filmé par les Mau-Mau 
Par les stups et les contes de fées 
Je planque mon secret sous ta schizo 
Et m'accroche à ton corps blessé 
Amant-mutant matant nos stances 
A l'ombre des amours gadgets 
J'endors mes cadences en instance 
Et me balance à ta planète 
Inutile d'afficher nos scores 
Aux sorties des supermarchés

des ondes & de l'asymétrie
des paramètres aux cœur violet
je vois des voiles d'aluminium
au fond de mon regard distrait
des odeurs de mercurochrome
sur le registre des mes plaies 

le vent glacé sur mon sourire
laisse une traînée de buée
quand je regarde l'avenir
au fond de mes yeux nécrosés
le vide a des lueurs d'espoir
qui laisse une ombre inachevée
sur les pages moisies de l'histoire
où je traîne ma frise argentée 

mais mon regard s'efface
je suis l'étranger dans la glace
mais ma mémoire s'efface 

la brume adoucit les contours
des ratures sur mes triolets
la valse des nuits & des jours
se perd dans un murmure discret
les matins bleus de ma jeunesse
s'irisent en flou multicolore
sur les molécules en détresse
dans le gris des laboratoires

Mon âme funérailleuse me fusille le cerveau
Il est fini le temps des laudanums-framboise
& le temps des visites au corbeau d'Allan Poe

Voici la voile noire du navire de Thésée
Qui me déchire les yeux au large de Sounion
Où un stupide anglais prétentieux a gravé
Comme un vulgaire touriste le nom de Lord Byron

Le jeu de la folie est un sport de l'extrême
Qui se pratique souvent au bord des précipices
Où dans les yeux des filles au bout des couloirs blêmes
Des labyrinthes obscurs aux fumeux artifices 

Ne m'attends pas ce soir car la nuit sera noire
& blanche, illuminée, rue de la Vieille Lanterne
Où Nerval a pendu son linge & sa mémoire
Sous le regard des dieux, au bout d'un drap en berne

Je rêve de transparence & d'épouvantes mystiques
Le long de la frontière qui jouxte l'inconnu
En traînant mon cadavre & mon vide pathétique
& ma douleur femelle sur mon dos de bossu

Baudelaire est mort hier, à onze heures du matin,
En zoomant d'apaisantes nuées crépusculaires,
Fatigué d'un été qui le rongeait sans fin
& de l'hargneuse odeur des furies sanitaires

Qui traverse le temps perdu de la sagesse
& rejoins le bateau ivre d'Arthur Rimbaud
Dans le flux des bateaux tankers d'Arthur Guiness

Tous les mornes aboyeurs de slogans

Pour te cacher de la rue en chaleur
& tu dis du bout de tes dents en or :
« Dommage que Dieu soit plus à la hauteur »
Faut être saturé d’un rare espoir

De la sinsémilla dans mon brûle-gueule

quelque sordide horreur sur tes amis passés 
elle t'entraîne dans un gouffre aux multiples rancoeurs 
d'où je préfère m'enfuir en te laissant l'honneur 
l'honneur de lui chanter

c'est une brise-burnes
une casse-burettes 
un cauchemar diurne
une trouble-fête 
une tornade en croco
qui se chauffe aux benzos
aux vibrations néfastes

Avec les mêmes discours, les mêmes connotations

L’heure où les vieux kapos changent ma pile corticale

Une photo d'Arthur
Rimbaud

Avec ses cheveux en brosse
Elle trouve qu'il est beau
Dans la chambre du gosse
Bravo

Déjà les p'tits anges
Sur le papier peint
Je trouvais ça étrange
Je dis rien

Elles me font marrer
Ses idées loufoques
Depuis qu'elle est
En cloque

Elle se réveille la nuit
Veut bouffer des fraises
Elle a des envies
Balaises

Moi, je suis aux p'tits soins
Je me défonce en huit
Pour qu'elle manque de rien
Ma p'tite

C'est comme si je pissais
Dans un violoncelle
Comme si j'existais
Plus pour elle

Je me retrouve planté
Tout seul dans mon froc
Depuis qu'elle est
En cloque

Le soir elle tricote
En buvant de la verveine
Moi je démêle ses pelotes
De laine

Elle use les miroirs
A se regarder dedans
A se trouver bizarre
Tout le temps

Je lui dit qu'elle est belle
Comme un fruit bien mûr
Elle croit que je me fous d'elle
C'est sûr

Faut bien dire ce qui est
Moi aussi j' débloque
Depuis qu'elle est
En cloque

Faut que j' retire mes grolles
Quand j' rentre dans la chambre
Du p'tit rossignol
Qu'elle couve

C'est que son p'tit bonhomme
Qu'arrive en Décembre
Elle le protège comme
Une louve

Même le chat pépère
Elle en dit du mal
Sous prétexte qu'il perd
Ses poils

Elle veut plus le voir traîner
Autour du paddock
Depuis qu'elle est
En cloque

Quand je promène mes mains
De l'autre côté de son dos
Je sens comme des coups de poings
Ça bouge

Je lui dis ""t'es un jardin""
""Une fleur, un ruisseau""
Alors elle devient
Toute rouge

Parfois ce qui me désole
Ce qui me fait du chagrin
Quand j' regarde son ventre
Et le mien

C'est que même si je devenais
Pédé comme un phoque
Moi je serai jamais
