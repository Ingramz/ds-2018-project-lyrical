Big Kap,"[Jay-Z]
This one for the future
Everybody want to be a Roc-a-fella gangsta
Hard for the street, sicka for the club
Sometimes for the ladies, but this one for my thugs

Hey yo, niggas want to drive by the hood and dump
Come on stupid, I clap up from your hood to the trunk
Foot on the floor, back on the wall, good with the pump
Blast through your stomach, stupid, you can look through your lunch

Is this what you want? Niggas that's clappin that priest
Runnin the streets, lawless, blastin police
Stickin Furby's out the window, snatchin your niece
And nah, we don't just rap we clap you past the seats

Me with the twin eagle, B. Sigel and Bleek
And I got the whole city ready to throw toast wit' me
I'm loved, niggas want to throw slugs with Jigga
All they, need is a reason to show love for Jigga

Niggas want to go back to back, till both of our gats clack
Till we reload in three seconds flat, I'm back
Niggas ain't met ya hat till we entered through ya shoulder
And we exit out ya back, gangsta nigga

[Chorus]
Jay-Z: I flow hard for the street, sicka for the club
 Sometimes for the ladies, but this one for my thugs
Bleek: To my thug niggas, slug niggas, tear the club niggas
 My ""I don't give a fuck niggas.""
Both: It's all love niggas

[Memhpis Bleek]
Cock and shoot it, smoke, whole city polluted
When I talk the whole block muted
Like E.F. Hutton style
Bleek not frontin now

We suit up for war with no button down
We clip up and zip up, hit your wip up
Put 4 in your cage, the other 4 in your face
And you don't want that

I catch a nigga, who ain't pump at
Send 'em to one of my custy's and bring a lung back
Me, Bean, Jay, shit you can't front that
Weed, coke, dope, Bleek nigga pump that

Stay in the game for my beef, I tote up 
Sit blow in the seat, my weed I roll up
Smoke one to the head, come between my stomach and leg
Yeah I'm the thuggin the street 

You don't want nothing with Bleek
Its Roc-A, Fella for life, you know that shit
Get your guns, get your ones, nigga throw that shit

[Chorus]
Jay-Z: I flow hard for the street, sicka for the club
 Sometimes for the ladies, but this one for my thugs

Both: It's all love niggas

[Amil]
This goes out to my give head bitches, my suck pussy niggas
Supply cookie niggas
Yo I live for the sheets, I die for the sheets
And I got spit for beets, like I ride for my peeps

Yo I love this glamour shit, but bitch I been gutter
Before can I get it and double excel covers
I thought I heard somebody say they want some hardcore
I like everything from my dick to my bras raw

Now, is my street niggas no into this
Now, is my street bitches not into this
Wild loud like my thugs do up in the tunnel
You know the rock ??? itchy finger the tussle

This territory locked, no more room in this hustle
Check the sound scan we getting platinum plaques and bundles
Verses I lye them down, they never die down
If the crowd rile down then fire another round

[Chorus]
Jay-Z: I flow hard for the street, sicka for the club
 Sometimes for the ladies, but this one for my thugs
Bleek: To my thug niggas, slug niggas, tear the club niggas
 My ""I don't give a fuck niggas.""
Both: It's all love niggas

[Beanie Sigel
I squeeze guns that'll go through your jeep
You know I'm controllin the street
Beanie Sigel, Hove, and Bleek
I keep rope and a baby mack

Don't get your ladies snatched
Comin out that baby gat
Fuckin with a crazy cat
I know you want to lay me flat

Shit, plenty niggas want to pay me back
Win on stick-ups turn thou' avalanche pick-ups
For the soft and the cooked up they lost when they looked up
Why you think I roll with the Roc?

Shit, everybody I roll wit Hash-E
Everybody I roll wit got
Ain't stopping me from takin over blocks
West coast style, S.K. with the shoulder stop

Order hour fifteen, I spur on your team
Four pound heckling cocked
Jeckle ya block, settin off Viper alarms
Strikin ya moms
Roc-a-fella dynasty gotcha right in their palms

Big Kap,"Check Check, 1-2 , 1-2 1-2 (it's rolling)
Yea yea yea Dr. Dre up in here y'all know what this is.
It's what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap,
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby.
Yo Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby

I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident

I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it ain't latching, and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it

Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking self's at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedation? (Come on!)
Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?) 

The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, ""Fuck the Police""
When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth
(Fucking baby) Became a role model after Colorado

Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo!
Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't

'Cause you'll probably want to stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
(Want to Fight?) I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking

Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'mm juss high on life

So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers, Slim Shady

Dr Dre!

I'm drunk pass the tec

Eminem and Dr. Dre 
Cause if I get locked up tonight!
Then I might not come home tonight!
[Dre]	
Keep it moving! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On

The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (AHH!)
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake
Don't get so bent out of shape 

'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up

And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain being baked

My shit's still in the oven on 480 De-Grades
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby,
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady
You critics want to criticize but couldnt visualize

Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth

And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit

Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it

But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge

I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old

Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do (echo)",If I Get Locked Up,1999
Big Kap,"Everything yeah, yeah
What the fuck nigga
Ayyo dim the lights on my shit son
Yeah you heard, fuck that
For my nigga Flex

[Chorus:]
It's like that why'all (that why'all)
That why'all (that why'all)
That why'all (that why'all)
That why'all (that why'all)
It's like that why'all (that why'all)
That why'all (that why'all)
That why'all, It's murda

Respect a thug, or accept a slug
Or accept the death of somebody you love
That's the rules we live by, ways I kiss by
We all murderers in the eyes of all ours
So when I pull a bubble up and back in your car
When I spit sixteen's you gonna wish they was sparks
Can you hold something, you can hold heat you can keep
Slugs in your sleep while I'm plugging your freak
I'm the thug of the week, the killer of the millennium
Spitting like mack ten and a nine ??
Blasting off like Flex on New Years
Who cares how many slugs why'all spit in the air
Niggaz over here got glock nineteen's, P89's, hollow points, and M16's
Three fifty-seven's and mack11's 
We clap you come to the funeral...

Motherfucker if your holding them ?? nigga
Then I'd advise nigga, we rip the high niggas
Don't matter the size niggaz
Ever since I popped up, a lot of niggaz done got stuck
While I'm laying the cut, meant that's rocked up
Believe it's murda
Niggaz get popped up, buried and chopped up
We don't give a fuck if the cops get touched
A ?? and a baby blue drop
With a stash box holding a fifth and two glocks
And every sixteen I spit I ??
And won't stop firing, firing until I got, a four full of money
And playboy you bunny
Yo you get us a clip of hollow tip slugs from me
Bitch nigga, acting out the life of a thug money
I hustle and, grind those block for drug money
And make sure, kept counting every stack
We drop bombs like Flex and Big Kap

[Chorus:]
Fuck that

Oh why must children die
I guess the lil' nigga want the piece of the pie, let 'em die
Oh why must thug niggaz snitch
I guess the lil' nigga thought he'd get a lil' rich, lil' bitch 
That's why we don't talk quick
'Cause niggaz who talk quick get killed for the bricks
This is it, that's why we walk with our guns
'Cause those without guns get killed by guns

?? the one that will kill you son
It's the same where ever we from, it's the slums
We spit guns, lay you down for the 1
I love when niggaz talk slick with they tongue
You ain't buying no one, you talking shit
I'm from the place get killed for shit
So fuck where you from, better start from day 1
It's amazing...


Murda mommy in every song
You was warned, should of listened when I told ya
It's coming to a closure
And almost over now
Go to war like a solider now
And you rat broads running my style, I'm shutting you down
From N.Y. to L.A., Vi-ta from Jersey
More of a bitch then a lady
Chase chips, slick bitch
With flows that's sick, and it only gets worse...

[Chorus:]
Fuck that

Murda, is the way of the walk
And since I walk a thin line, I'm looking at niggaz with dead eyes
And I'm baptized, my body has sinned
A lil' weed, a few hoes, and a whole lot of head
Got me hollering, I don't give a fuck!
About nothing at all, front
I'm blasting off, killing you with probable cause
'Cause you probable of thinking that you hotter then I
It will never be until I die, and touch the sky
Hells angel, fly
I feel like I'm at war fighting for my inner self fighting for my life
This world made me a, Murderer
May the lord take you, before I murder ya
Bodies turning up, and who you think got 'em all touched
Murderers, is on your block catching the rush
Like niggaz can fuck wit us, they all gonna fall

Wiggle my feet, I shook Shaq with a cross over pass and look back
Yo, Brick City gorilla when I stomp
Earthquakes, hurricanes will build up until dusk

Throw fishin line to a chicken a reel it up
My crew gun clappers, half of 'em pilled up
Hit the club then I ?cornbread?

Hope the Lord got your soul cause your ass is mine

[Chorus: x2]
Come on, let's do it now
Just move around
Move to the sounds
Look at me, Wow!

Look at me and how I put it down
I was working while you stood around
See, I don't got to be the best chick
But for the heat y'all know who to get with

Whether you knock it in your Benz of your Lexus
If you go the bracelet of the necklace
If you want to O.D. or just test this
It don't matter cause we coming on some neck shit

I bet this be the one that takes the world
Even though some of y'all want to hate the girl
But watch your mouth, I'm the type that run the show
Plot the low, quick get your money and go

See y'all ain't really nothing to me
All day you hear my name and got something to say
But I'm a chill, lay it down, make a hit and do me
Angie, up close don't worry you'll see

Come on, let's do it now
Just move around
Move to the sounds
Look at me, Wow!

What you gonna do now
I'll make it real hot, let me cool down
Look I don't care what other people doin
I just want to spit and try to keep it movin

What they gonna say when a bitch drop hits
Y'all niggas ain't never gonna stop this
Watch this, you ain't never gonna top this
On your hot list, shit is just monotonous

You ain't never gonna be hot, shit
You rap mad like De-Da
Me I stay cool, I know the remedy
Make sure you cats all remember me

I ain't never want to fall I want to ball hard
And leave the hatin' motherfuckers all scarred
You got no points on the score card
So you can't be a part of the all-stars

Look at me getting cocky wit it
When its on then its on, ain't no stoppin' with it
Ride the beat like my Poppy get on top of it

Big Kap,"Pimp shit, uh
Uh, pimp shit
Yeah, turn my shit up a little bit
My vocals, uh, uh
I hypnotize ya eyez and then you recognize
That the sparkles of my chrome shoes paralyze
Gettin' money like this, people want my vibe
Full of jealousy and pride, hate the way I ride
Sometimes ya speak, sometimes ya don't

And then I told her, I said it's cool, get at me
And then my voice got raaaassspy

Punched him in his chin and then he passed out

Always hit them weak motherfuckaz right in they mouth

'Cause niggaz will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch
You little bitch, that's what the callin' you

You're looking at me and it's easy to see that you want me

I don't hide things well

So I bet you can tell that I want you too

We sit for a while then both of us smile

As the band starts to play

I ask you to dance we know that romance

Is only a rumba away


Put your hand in mine

Lay your head on my shoulder

Then when the song ends

We can pretend it's not over

As our bodies oh they come together and we sway

Let's hold on to the night 'cause the rest of our life

Is only a rumba away


As I hold you close I smell the rose that's in your hair

I start to imagine that we are in heaven alone somewhere

Your touch is revealing what we are feeling no one has to say

Under the stars above we both know that love

Is only a rumba away


Put your hand in mine

Lay your head on my shoulder

Then when the song ends

We can pretend it's not over

As our bodies oh they come together and we sway

Let's hold on to the night 'cause the rest of our life

Is only a rumba away


Put your hand in mine

Lay your head on my shoulder

Then when the song ends

We can pretend it's not over

As our bodies oh they come together and we sway

Let's hold on to the night 'cause the rest of our life

Is only a rumba away


Let's hold on to the night 'cause the rest of our life

Is only a rumba away

Big Kenny,"There's a picture in my mind
I can't get out
I can see so clear and bright
Kinda like the sunshine shining through the clouds
Imagine for a moment
Everybody happy smiling everybody everywhere
Imagine for a moment
Nobody ever has a worry nobody has a care
This big old world is spinning 'round
And there's not a solitary teardrop falling down

Think about it, think about it
Everybody come on and think about it
Think about it, think about it
Everybody come on and think about that

I walked along the water
Looked out in the ocean just as far as my eyes could see
And I began to wonder
Is there really any reason why this picture that I'm seeing
Couldn't be, couldn't be reality
If only everybody saw things the way I see
Imagine for a moment
Everybody happy smiling everybody everywhere
Imagine for a moment
Nobody ever has a worry nobody has a care
This big old world is spinning 'round
And there's not a solitary teardrop falling down

Then tell me why should I go

Frolicking in the sunshine, oh and the peacefulness I find
Well, it's sweeter than red wine

Think I'll just stay here and love you

So let the ocean swallow California
The mountains fall in Colorado
Let tornadoes rip through Kansas
I'll just stay right here and love you

I'm just tryin' to excel so you feel me

I remember the days sittin' in the pews
When I heard the preacher sayin', ""Spread the news""
I was feelin' the blues 'til I had a chance to choose
Now I feel the love to the soles of my shoes

Try to walk in a path of the guiding light
I thank the Lord for everything when I pray at night
'Cause I can feel His strength, I can feel His power
He's the one I turn to in my darkest hour

Try to be a good man, never called a saint
Never walked on water so I know I ain't
I might swim in the whiskey

Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew

Won't hit a girl well I ain't real cause I beat bitches up

I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill

To snap in heaven with a Mac-11 and rape Christ

I keep a cutie with a soft booty, hoes be runnin up
""Can I get your autograph L?"" No bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Aiyyo crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed
So I suggest you spread pretzelhead

Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers

After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A Tec-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches

I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit

And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx

I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put the glock to his dome
Tell him ""Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split""
Grip, it ain't nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
Mad niggas be fronting the life
Popping mad shit, trying to be something they not
Your faggot ass better stay to dancing, don't even look at me

Hey yo, I just left the studio, and it's about 2 in the morn' 
I just finished doin a song 
Now I'm ready for sleep 
But first I want spaghetti to eat 
In this good Italian restaurant right up the street 
So I jumped in the jeep, stash the heat under the seat 
Then I got a beep 
My voice is harsh, barely can speak 
I called back on the cell 
It's Coley, mad as hell 
He told me to listen well as he started to yell 
""I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend 
And they just got a room in the Holiday Inn"" 
""It's my wife, you sure?"" 
""Yeah I'm sure 
I saw the whore as soon she walked through the door"" 
""Yo, say no more, which one?"" 
""The one in Jersey, son, right over the bridge"" 
""We goin' hurt those hoes"" 
""And hurt both of them kids"" 
Now I'm in the Range 
Switchin lanes, doin a buck 'n change 
I can't wait to touch the lames and them fuckin dames 
Reach the destination, grab the heat without no hesitation 
These niggas fuckin up my reputation 
I saw Coleone holdin the chrome 
Ice-grill, lookin like he had a license to kill 
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cup 
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up 
""Yo, who that in the background?"" 
""It's Tommy Giss"" 
""Oh, I didn't recognise you with your hat down 
Son you ready, we got this whole shit mapped out"" 
""Yeah, wo goin to take the backroute 
And pull our gats out and throw our mask on 
We ain't leavin till everyone's dead and all the cash gone"" 
""We goin to get our laugh on when we're through 
But right now we got a job to do"" 
""So let's do it"" 
Hey yo, I stepped to the deskclerk 
Put the gat to her dress-shirt 
Told her to listen up before she get hurt 
""They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males 
What room they got?"" 
She paused and said ""212"" 
Took the steps now I'm out of breath 
I gotta stop smokin 
Them cigarettes goin be the cause of my death 
My heart beatin fast now, cause it's about to pop off 
Saw the door, let the glock off, tore the lock off 
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pase 
I felt disgraced, I should've shot the bitch in the face 
Then my other two niggas ran in 
Each had a cannon 
Ready to take care, how we done planned it 
""These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate"" 
We know they got stacks 
Cause they don't move with nothin but weight 
We got the cuffs and the ducktape and put it to use 
Then told 'em when this is over we be lettin 'em loose 
""Hey man, I kicked Mike in his face 
So I just had your back 
You want to live and tell my nigga where the stash at"" 
He gave me the address then I ran outside 
But first I took the keys to his van outside 
And when I got there, I found 50 keys in a stash 
A 100 pound of grass, and 2 million in cash 
I was dumb glad 
The sit didn't fit in one bag 
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the teeth 
And put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck 
When I got back, Coley done popped them punks 
""Hey yo', fuck it L, we might as well pop these studs"" 
Man that's four bodies 
Two outta-towners and two hotties 
And after that we ain't sleep for three days

[A.G.]
We on a world tour with Midnight Marauders and such
I'm at the table, like the Godfather smoking a dutch
Controlling the bucks; I roll with enough
Niggas that'll blow in the clutch
Not only holding we bust
The fat raps, so pass that and let me hit it
Got me gassed, black; skins was mad fat
She flipped it, Bronx is equipped with niggas that'll rip shit
Studios get blown from D and D to Mystic
With this shit I'll bomb the nation from a distance
The jewels gotta have patience plus persistence
We rock glass like Rockford
Waiting for bottles to pop in the condo; bottles get rocked
To sum up my career from bottom to top
Now we in the thick of it, and you don't stop

Check it, I be puffing blunts in the house, sexing stunts on the couch
This year, a lot of frauds might get punched in the mouth
For when your wife see me, she don't know how to act
So don't be mad when I blow out her back, for real
Your whole team a bunch of pooh-puts who made a few bucks
Date a few sluts then y'all start running your lips a little too much
My whole crew wild, thick as new now
We go to clubs, hit the bar, and trip two thou
Other emcees ain't got a chance at all
'Cause Big L Corleone is too advanced for y'all
Chicks can never walk away 'cause they like the sex
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
I'm a pimped-out nigga that walks with canes
Talk with slang, ball from New York to Spain
Haters E-N-V-Y me B-I-G
'Cause I'm V.I.P. till I D-I-E, what?

[O.C.]
I spark light with the pen, drink O.J. with gin
Rock Tims with my laces untied
Cruise in the city on seventeen inches; ride past wenches
Past the projects, thugs chilling on the benches
Profile low as if I had an ill vengeance
Life on Earth is just a death sentence
Fuck it, alpha omega, arm, lega, lega, arm
With cold steel if you pose a threat to my neighbor
D-I double G I-N, I-N T-H-E Crates; lock shit times ten
Dive in, become part of a cliche; that art of an expert
Your honor from New York to Florida
Chicks rush the corridors; chicks try to star with us
Besides rolling thick my whole crew be marvelous

You might find me on 1-3-9 sippin' a Bacardi Breezer
That's where I rest at, killin' tracks is what I'm best at
Jealousy, I expect that, I don't stress that
I want a cutie with some tight jeans on, that I can scheme on
Treat her nice, take her out and trick some cream on
TV screens all over the U.S. I'm seen on
It ain't all about me, I'm tryin' to put my team on
Because it's good to have a crew to lean on, mics I fiend on

I even buck celebs, nigga fuck the feds

I stay sweatin' out a bitch perm
I love it when a girl ass is fat and they tits firm
I take all the dough my chicks earn
I watched Corleone do it, now it's Chris turn
A ""hoodlum"" like Fishburne

I pack a nine and once I aim it, I got to flame it
Push a blue eight, got props from here to Kuwait
And while your crew hate, you hear me on Big L new tape
They call me C-Town, I snatch mics like a rebound
Pack a three-pound, that's my prerog' like B. Brown
I rip shows in large arenas, like the Garden or Meadowlands
Got nuttin' but love for all my ghetto fans
On 1-3-9 and Lenox eyes get shut
The ""Danger Zone"" is where pies get cut, where all the guys get stuck
Try to front we gon' size you up
Like Corleone'll grab the chrome and throw five in your gut

Aiyo, gats we bust (backs we crush)

Me and my man was cruisin through the streets and everything was flowin nice
The corner's crowded, niggaz must be rollin dice
I parked the ride so my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot
and I'ma gamble until he come back - why not?
Click-clack, cock the gat back, gotta be strapped
The game was mad packed, mad cats pockets was fat
They playin cee-lo, my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothin less than a G yo, you know my steelo
First I was losin then I started throwin headcrack
after headcrack, got my bread back, jumped in my red Ac'
I'm waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggaz startin to plot, and I'm far from my block
Finally he walked out, told him, ""Hop the fuck in""
On my face he saw the grin and said, ""How much did you win?""
I estimated about, 45 maybe 50 G's
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at Mickey D's
Now I'm alone, headin home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggaz trailin so I picked up the phone
Called Bones, I said, ""Yo son, I'm on the run
Need your help before I get done
Meet me downstairs, bring your big gun""
I don't believe this, this nigga said he can't make it
cause some bitch is in his house butt-naked
and then he hung up
And this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut, what?
I'm cruisin fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from, and his grimy crimey
It's about to get, real hasty
Grabbed the steel, took it off safety
cause I refuse to let these niggaz waste me
I started to cruise fast, then stopped short and made 'em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed, when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too, leakin with a deep gash
I ain't panicked, I was quite calm
Couldn't use the right arm, so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him, shook my head then started buckin my heat
It's over now, cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think I'm dyin, I'm feelin weak out on my feet
but before I got some medical help, I had to catch a cab first
to one-forty-first and Bradhurst
That's where Bones live, walked in the buildin, staggerin
Lookin tore down, shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye, he knew he would die
Started to cry, stuck the gat to his head and said, ""Why?""
Then he offered me, all of his cheese
then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out
into the streets covered with blood, about to pass out
The hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but
damn, here comes a couple of cops; I pulled out 
and started blowin they started blowin back I'm goin all out
I ain't holdin back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin back
I kept shootin, one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleedin real bad, and couldn't stop it
but still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets
The coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playin everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them, run for they share
and all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear
Now I can hear the sirens, that means here comes the Jakes
but it's too late, I'm knockin on the pearly gates

Check it, a year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, ""Monique""
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get somethin to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right - it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
with some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that?  I wore a Lifestyle

Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware

Get caught in a mad lie, come in your crib mad high
Think about me with the smile on your face
Think about me with my hand on your waist
and think about me with your hair in your face
Even caught a case fuckin witchu
Had said some ol' slick shit, that had forced me to hit you
Had you set up livin swell, how you gon' fuck my man L
like we don't cross paths in these New York streets?
But that's good, cause he's my man and we both shine
and to say we don't love these hoes is a old line
Honey just save some space in it so you can hold mine
Her whole spine be twisted;
things she did and how she kissed it
I kinda missed it, think back on how we dissed it
Now we two-fisted, she ain't never resisted
Left it red and blistered, shakin
I could slam it if it wasn't NO money makin

Word up games, these girls nowadays they play many
Techniques for gettin your loot, they got plenty
Suck the skin off your dick, just for some ice and shit
In the beginning they're polite, actin all nice and shit
But honey got plans to be pushin your Land
When she got you - she goes and fucks your man
Understand?  You gotta lay down the law
A lot of broads is fraud, they'll set you up Baby Pah
Some'll try to get you stuck up, some'll fake pregnancy
Most are after the dough, and the fame basically
Yo you can't make a hoe a housewife kid
Pick the wrong chick - could be a lifetime bid

Keep frontin', I'ma try yo' chin out 
I knocked a lot of men out 
I left 'em on the floor spittin' phlegm out 
It's either that or I'ma squeeze the gat and pop ten out 
You see ?codione?, ice spinnin', jigged out, white linen 
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women 
Every time I come around you see your wife grinnin' 
Don't be mad 'cause yo' career's in the ninth innin' 
It's over now, nigga, leave the game 
I'm from the danger zone where emcees get slain 
We're thugs that never hesitate to squeeze the flame 
We're niggaz be takin' drugs just to ease the pain 
Hustlers flip cokey, 48 Hours like Nick Nolte 
When I was OT your bitch rode me 
First day home I dived in it 
Left her thighs dented 
Now that bitch be pagin' me every five minutes 
Emcees I squash and disgrace, it's all about the Benjis 
So why your bills got Washington's face?

Used to ride Greyhounds wit' dime holes and stuff the coke in they ass 
Crazy beef's got provoked in the past, lot of wigs got split 
A lot of innocent kids got hit 
Harlem World be the place of my borough, believe me son 
We breed the smoothest niggaz on the face of the earth

Stackin’ money and playing the field man like Regis

Bitches want an autograph, I sign them titties in crayon
Like goddamn
It's me and B-I-G-L-N-B-O cooking like chemists
It's me and B-I-G-L-N-B-O
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie

Eat wack MCs like Hannibal
'Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal

Over here, over here
Over here, over here

Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious
The young Spiegle, interstellar with my retrieval
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval
I spit at it like a Baretta, you know I get better by givin' the people
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden
The Return of the Jedi, bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do

Overdue, pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through
The B-I-G-L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio
Aye dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo
To hold a brother down like the white man
Fuck that, nigga

Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff
Even in a pair of cuffs know we always keep it real
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man
I'm just 301 reppin', second I step in Maryland
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this
Throw a Molotov in your crib and tell them bitches to bill us
We the illest
Finger fuck a critic, shit is darker than The Chronicles of Riddick

Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom

Let that ol' midnight special

Desde mi Mexico hasta el Gabacho

Hace tiempo que esperaba este momento
Y no ha sido por lento ni falta de talento
Al fin el hombre grande de Juárez
Bajó de entre los cerros
Se puso bien contento

Salió bien rayado y conoció nuevos perros
Pura gente fina, basados en muchos huevos
Recibido con calor de familia
El ejército del norte
El general aquí en la corte
Y preparado pa' el exporte

A ver compadre pasa el fuego
Pa' prender aquí la fiesta sigue
Hasta el amanecer funky bless
Y de santa el cartel

Uniendo la huasteca, esperando el pastel
En la pista rabiosa bailan ritmos para usted
Hidrofónicos cartel y santa si saben de placer

Yo ya lo sé, lo que quieres y buscas yo lo sé
Dale fuego compadre préndete
Con las nenas rozándotelo al 100
Que la fiesta esta puesta sírvase
Ándale pues
Trampe en viaje como es
Cartel de santa conectando con los de funky bless

Llego mi compi, santa se puso funky
Cumpleaños el monkey, vamos por unas pompis
Tracas, hierbas, polvos, yonkis
Huamas, aguas, brownie, monchis
De fiesta con el Big Man, formando un gran clan
Tramando un buen plan, viajando sin van
Andamos todos arriba en el humo región 4 norte
Tirando las rimas sin corte
Que conste que es hecho de cora
Directo de la aurora
Y para Juárez como Nora
Pa' su raza chingona y pa todas sus mamitas
De parte del cartel de santa y de toda su clica
Mi rap no se limita suena por todas partes
Lo entrego a domicilio no más pa' alucinarte
Tu sabes que funciona y yo sé que te emociona
Cuando en el teibol bailan mis rolas las cachetonas

Yo ya lo sé, lo que quieres y buscas yo lo sé
Dale fuego compadre préndete

Hey rolate el toque carnal pa' que juaritos pegue el grito
Cuando llegue a cantar
Por eso hay, como me gusta caray que no les tiembla
Y pala hierba siempre se dejan caer
Disfruto el hi como el bombai, puchaste el play
Ya viste que hay, where it today partiendo el cake
Recordatorio por el Friday
Planeando bien vamos al 100 nos para quién es el cartel
Con el Big Man súbete al tren
Que no queremos que puede ser

Que onda
Que onda loco
No está contigo babo
Le he estado marcando
Pero no me a contestado
Seguro anda de cabrón

Jaja, nel, esta grabando una canción
Si agarramos fiestón pero ya andamos tranquilón
Saliendo de cabina yo le digo que te marque

Pues pa' luego es tarde, dime la neta
Que quiero más detalles

U sigues
No te paniques, ya sabes que nosotros
No ocultamos cuando andamos con mujeres

Es que nos enojamos, dale mi recado
Quiero que me marque y dejar todo arreglado

Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart

You've made me break a many true vow

For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1973
Big Maybelle,"I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream.
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind,and melt your cold cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life,to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me

Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy is Sunday, with shadows I spend it all

Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know

With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Your words don't mean what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise

I can remember loving caresses showered on me.
Mother's eyes would gaze at me so tender, 
What was their meaning? Now I can see.

One bright and guiding light, 
That taught me wrong from right,
I found in my mother's eyes.
Those baby tales she told,
That road all paved in gold,
I found in my mother's eyes.

Just like a wandering sparrow,
One lonely soul.
I walked the straight and narrow,
To reach my goal.

A real unselfish love,

I find the future dark as can be.
Sorrows I have known, always surround me, 
Then through the shadows, I always see.

Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

It's my life.

晴れた日の日曜日
短く長い一日の始まり
決められたする事もなく
ブラブラ町を歩く

透きとおる青い空
太陽さえもじゃまなくらい
2人で HAPPY LUNCH TIME
お腹も愛も満タン

僕とあなたと 2人だけで
素敵な星空がくるまで
僕とあなたと 2人だけで
素敵な星空がくるまで
幸せな時を過ごすこと
Don't worry be happy.
Happy Sunday. It's my life
Don't worry be happy.
Happy Sunday. It's my life

どうしたの?
何があったの
何をそんなに悩んでるの
でも心配することなんて
何一つもないよ

簡単に自分を責めたり
自信をなくさないで
簡単に自分を責めたり
自信をなくさないで
もう 明日は日曜日
Don't worry be happy.
Happy Sunday. It's my life
Don't worry be happy.
Happy Sunday. It's my life
With one more time
Don't worry be happy.

Big Mello,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time",It's Goin Down,2000

Yes indeed, H-Town, it go down Lil' Flex, Z-Ro, Big Mello
Know what I'm saying, you boys can't stop us man
Unstoppable, feel me, yeah
They got to feel us till they kill us, this for the radio

[Lil' Flex]
Ain't nothing but a g thang baby
Turnel sets dried yellow bones crazy
Can't fade me, died lately
Pulling out the escallade or a mercedes
Trunk popper, show stopper, drank sipper
Rule number one is to never tip a stripper
And I know a lot of why'all want to wish me trouble
Went from swanging hoo-doos to a bentley bubble
Image is everything, diamonds in every ring
Piece and chains that hang down low to my dang-a-lang
Stop that, cop that, I'm a baller baby
Got the rims that poke out on the prowler baby
I'm the same young cat that dropped the jewels on them
Next year I'm about to drop 22's on them
From the Mo to the Fo, back to airport landing
Diamonds speak for theyself, Flex so outstanding

[Chorus]
Still standing, and you know we represent the south
And ya know ya know we represent the south 
Still standing, we in the door and these haters can't keep us out

[Big Mello]
I represent that S-O-you-T-H to the S-I-D-E
Drop screens you can see me completely
Off the heezy, fa sheezy I'm breezy
Cause my diamonds they be known to blind hoes like Stevie
Believe me, outstanding with my family
From me and Z-Ro and Lil' Flex at the grammy
Boss player from Texas, you could tell by the necklace
We gone break these hoes on four's now we frozen the Lexus
My protected, move around, get around
Come through show some round when we hit your town
It go down, whoa now, school slow down
Watch these fours roll down crawl down your block
Top drop, trunk knock, glock cocked
And these shops gone bop, it don't stop
Won't stop, how it go down
Harm clock, Mo City, south west still shine, wooo

[Chorus]
[Z-Ro]
Screwed up representer these fellas don't want none
From the land of the trunk poppers where ballers blow tons
We stacking funds, and living our life out on the run
In search of a platinum plack trying to get stacks it just begun
If you talking down move around we ain't having that
East and West took it before but see we came to grab it back
Can't see us like cataracts, off in our natural habitat
That's the studio and bro you know ain't no more selling crack
Ain't nothing but rocking trash talking on down to the ain't that
Cause I'm a veteran to this here ever since the days of the Wave Band
When I was knee high to a grass hopper but now we roll on chppers
Me and Gene hovering over the ground in candy helicopters
Now we platinum status without driving a dodge stratus
Keeping it gangsta energy instinct with a heater to protect us
Man it's third coast, to me our music mean the most

No vengas a arrepentirte

Me enseño que mi destino era rodar

Pero hay que sabes llegar

Pero sigo siendo el rey

Digan lo que digan
Yo ya no gasto saliva
Ahora tengo la corona
A mí nadie me la quita

Los súper hermanos nos están
Diciendo contando que yo tengo algo
Levanten la mano toda la gente
Que saben que el rey ha llegado

Big Midnight,"Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid

No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes i couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still i had to keep on going

Never knowing if i could take it
If i would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and i prayed
And now i've found my way

[Chorus]
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(make it happen)
And if you get down on your
Knees at night
And pray to the lord
He's gonna make it happen
(make it happen)

I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on

You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still i have to keep going

Never knowing if i could take it
If i would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and i prayed
And now i've finally found my way

I once was lost
But now i'm found
I got my feet on solid ground

You can make it happen

Big Mike,"featuring Scarface 



Push, push, push, push... 

Here it comes... 

It's - it's a girl 



{Big Mike:} 

1971 a young girl gave birth 

Only a child, bringin another child on this earth 

Only 15 years of age 

But comin from the ghetto, it won't make the front page 

See, that's the way shit go 

And to the government she ain't nothin but another hoe 

Thinkin all she want is food stamps 

Give her a check and let her hang with the school tramps 

And mama's gettin mad 

Cause now she gotta watch her little girl grow up fast 

Straight ghetto life, straight ghetto drama 

Wanted a baby doll, now she's somebody's mama 

And life is so confusin to her 

Askin herself why is this happenin to her 

So now she gotta choose 

Between a box of Pampers and a pair of new tennis shoes 

Never had to make that choice before 

Never heard a baby's voice before 

And the daddy ain't nowhere to be found 

Too busy bein a hoe around town 

He just fall into another statistic 

Claimin black men don't do shit 

But that's the way it is 

And little do they know daddy also sheds tears 

Cause he don't know what to do 

Be a father to his child, or run with a crew 

You might say: easy choice, be a father 

But why should he do it when his father didn't bother? 

Just another sample, I guess 

Of black men settin bad examples 

Thinkin deep about the whole thing 

Takes his last bit of money and goes to buy a gold ring 

And askes her to marry her 

Promise to get a job, so he can carry her 

Thinkin that's the way to do it 

But little do they know that there's much more to it 

'cause marriage is demandin 

It takes lots of patience and understandin 

But they go and tie the knot anyway 

And they'll be gettin their own crib anyday 

The first couple of months were alright 

A new crib, adaptin to a new life 

But then came the arguments 

And the constant fightin got em thrown out their apartment 

So now they gotta move in with her moms 

And that just adds to the muthafuckin problems 

Cause now he's feelin like he failed 

And while they asleep he grabs his shit and bails 

Smooth out the do', black 

And never takes another look back 

Now grandma's house is an unhappy home 

Now that daddy's gone 



{Scarface:} 

Daddy broke before I stepped in this muthafucka 

And left the job to be done by my mother's mother 

Raised up by grandmother ??? 

Cause my mark-ass daddy never came around for guidance 

So now I'm forced to stand up on my own two 

Cause mommy dear had to work three jobs, duke 

He didn't even want my friendship 

I guess the mark-ass nigga wasn't down to begin with 

Too lit to come around with his drunk ass 

And beatin up my mom with his punk ass 

And shit got dread 

I guess I shouldn't talk so bad about my dad 

So here it is, brothers 

If you gon' have babies, you need to father them muthafuckas 

Cause if you don't in due time 

Your kids'll speak about daddy exactly like I do mine 

So do yourself a favor 

Take your kids to the park, buy em shit, and they'll pay you later 

But payin's not the issue 

If you'd die right now your little kids wouldn't even miss you 

So put away your caddy 

Call your bitch up and tell her to make room for daddy 

Cause if you don't you'll be alone 

And the only thing they'll say about daddy, is daddy is gone",Daddy's Gone,1994

Big Mike,"Now as I flip through this world of mine
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
The ones that's doin good and the ones that's doin evil

Now as I flip through this world of mind
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
Some doin good and others doin evil

I heard somebody say I'll do anything nowaday to make a buck
'cause niggas are dyin and nobody gives a muthafuck
And you be wantin to trip when I be talkin about murder and thangs
I think it's obvious that you ain't never heard of mine
What goes on in the neighborhood
East coast, West coast, ain't shit turnin out good
Sometimes I want to cry
And straight put the 9 to my muthafuckin dome and let the bullets fly
But mama said I'm too strong to break down
And I'm caught up in another drug shake-down
'cause they think I'm sellin birds
But i'm workin 9 to 5 and still ain't gettin what I deserve
So who's fuckin who
Is it that white man or the black man standin next to you
See, most blacks can't handle power
Get paid and get to changin by the hour
Closin all the doors
Got a little paper, now they want to treat they people like hoes
Now after takin a look at that
How the fuck you think the white man is supposed to act
See we can't check the peckerwood
If we can't treat our own fuckin people good
We want to pick the fruit, but the fruit ain't ripe
Yeah, now who got the right to write

Now as I flip through this world of mine
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
The ones that's doin good and the ones that's doin evil

Now as I flip through this world of mind
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
Some doin good and others doin evil

Niggas are gettin fooled by the president's plan
In jail they got a president, but they call him the boss man
The boss man is prejudiced, hurtin em with politics
Better let em out quick or they gon' cause a riot, bitch
Even if you lock the door they still got the power
'cause the fuckin white house reminds em of the watch tower
The man is watchin over us, steady controllin us
And if we make a move he's ready to put a hole in us
Everytime I step he's always around me
To tell the fuckin truth, I feel safer in the county
At least in jail I know what I'm up against
But everything is a muthafuckin mystery outside the fence
Thinkin that we made it, but we ain't made it yet
And it's gettin harder 'cause the man ain't givin up shit, bet
Steady lettin us down
And ain't nobody helpin us out

Now as I flip through this world of mine
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
The ones that's doin good and the ones that's doin evil

Now as I flip through this world of mind
Everything is lookin peaceful

Comin from that swamp
You know
Just kickin it how I feel
And that's on the real",World of Mind,1994
Big Mike,"[Verse 1]
My lil' partner be talkin about it's been approximately 
Five years and four months from the day
That all these niggas done came up around his way, what can he say
You can ask Shelley, and even she'll say (hey)
These niggas be callin themselves big shots ever since he been away
Even Dante got a little size upon his chest
Maybe it's from the reinforced teflon vest
But nevertheless, he takes it all in stride
Talkin about (these niggas got theirs, it's only right that I gets mine)
Nah, don't go near them niggas, son, you might get shot
Believe me when I tell you: things ain't the same on the block
They got glocks and shit done changed
For a buck and some change 
They might blow out your muthafuckin brains
These niggas ain't thinkin when they're tryin to get a piece
The only peace you better get is of mind
And stay your ass inside
Wide eyes actin sheif and shitty
For attention hoe-ass niggas'll have a mortician ready to fit me
For a suit and casket, it's gettin drastic
My nigga got hit in his shit, some say he was askin
For trouble, true, and he found it with a .44 mag
They took him out in his jag (yo man went out bad)
Such a sad, sad song if you ask me
Blood on his t-shirt and khakis, brain in the back seats
(Goddamn) that's exactly what I said
But now my nigga's dead behind that fast life that he led
Shedded some tears, but they all got wiped away
I love my nigga, I put his name on my license plate
I live my life this way cause that way'll get a nigga stank
No more smokin dank on suicide quests for bank
I puts it down on tape and reap the benefits
Like the smart niggas who grew up and quit that shit
Life is precious, cherish it while you have it
It's enough loot to go around for everybody to live lavish

[Chorus]
Everybody wants a name 
Everybody wants the fame
People playin suicide games 
Tell me who's to blame
For all the pain and things 
That we can't explain

[Verse 2]
Partner, it's cold outside, and the temperature's steady droppin
But these niggas ain't stoppin as long as drugs sales are poppin
They clockin a grand a day, muthafuck what the man will say
Villains kidnappin to kill a nigga, and they plans to stay
So when I sleep, I sleep with one eye closed
'cause the fellas ain't the only ones schemin, even fly hoes
I knows this, I seen it all in their fangs
I stay alert cause muthafuckas do dirt with half a chance
And I plans to be around, not six feet in the ground
Kickin back with other blacks enjoyin the sound
Of our kids comin up in a similar fashion
Makin it happen, gettin theirs without askin
Until then I keep on rollin with the punches
Collectin dough in bunches, layin my head on plush shit
A hunch kid,'ll get your ass a long stay
But a little bit of faith'll carry a nigga a long way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now, show me a man who ain't afraid to die, and I show you five
Choose a rule, so partner, choose your side
Recognize with your own eyes this ain't no false statement
I'm from New Orleans, where bullshit ain't shakin
You gots to qualify, be down to die
These punk-ass niggas around my way thinkin they hard made it hot outside
You got your pride, I got my love
I'm too swift with the gift, you find no blood on my black glove
Now I'm above all that chitter-chatter
But a year ago you was about to throw a blow, now tell me what's the matter
Collect the data, I had a year to put this out
I got one more bomb in my palm, now bet I miss your house
Now is you is or is you ain't?
Ready to put your goddamn life on the line for that bank
You better think, but partner don't think too long
My people stay strong, we know where we belong

Big Mike,"These niggas ain't feelin us

It's the best kept secret, baby

Down south 
We got women on the beach
Swerve on streets
Players ridin drop
And the flips won't stop

[Verse 1]
Now tell me what y'all know about a player like me comin through steppin
I'm wreckin, New Orlean'an, and in 1984 turned Texan
Lyrically flexin I made a name for myself
Gained love, not in clubs, on streets, and I dealt
With these playa-hatas out here among us in the game
I had to pass em by cause it really wasn't my thing
Now don't you want to scream it like you mean it
To them fools who said I couldn't do it 
The ones that said that if I left the group, then I'd be ruined
Keep on doin what you're doin 
That's what my conscience said, use your head, and you'll win
Cause them haters who I thought was my partners, wasn't really my niggas
They reneged, they couldn't stand to see me get big in the business
That's why they player-hated me
Talkin my business to them broads like we related, gee?
It never faded me cause I know where my head is at
Know where I'm headed at, that's why I keep on makin...

[Chorus]
Now the deeper the root
The bigger the square of the loot
When people think of the bomb shit, they think of the boon, fool
I'm speakin the truth, partner, seek and you'll find
Southern dialect, I'm regulatin, that's how I gets down for mine

[Verse  2]
It's on to the break of dawn
So why should I stop kickin these fly-ass rhymes
That's puttin these knots in my pocket? I'm
About to rock until I can't no mo'
I'm takin this here all the way to the bank for dough
Cause y'all know, as long as players turn into rappers
And rappers turn into actors, all these broads'll be gettin atcha
Now which non-believin MC want to see what time it is?
The rhymin wizard's about to show you haters what southern rhymin is 
I'm bombin kids, I show no mercy on a braveheart
Put it down in '94, and never gave thought
Caught every ???, every ass, checks got cashed 
Fools got slung like the trash, I mash 
>From the scene, never seen by no witnesses
Partner, don't try to play dumb, look, you know what this is
Quit the biz cause y'all ain't ready for the outcome
No doubt, son, I'm from the south, and never lost a bout, son

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now, don't step, or you'll get ruined, mayn
I got you trippin on the way a soldier's like me over here doin things
You knew the game, but you blew it again
Now the head honcho is back, so non-believers, hand over your ring
Give it up or get broken down
It's goin down now, Mike Dean supplied the potent sound
So now you know it's a southern thing
I'm handlin things, I bust a rhyme and do damage to any man you bring
I'm serious, I told you that way back in '94
They want to flow, it ain't no thing, just let the record go
Didn't you know I bust from southwest to southeast?
Blessed by the best with this platinum-plated mouthpiece
So I give thanks, then it's off to the bank
Protected by forces unseen, so I ain't gettin ganked
As for the fakers and the haters
Small things ain't nothin to a player
I'm all about my paper
I stacks my chips and then I break
Gather up my crew to Mike-a-nize, then we go and rock another state
Forget what another say, I'm backed up by my actions
Produce a dope hit, make a lick, and leave em askin
Who is Big Mike? and like that I'm back atcha
Partner, handle your businesss, I ain't mad atcha
Million dollar lyrics I compose leave a pattern for quality stature

[Chorus]",Southern Dialect,1997
Big Mike,"You wonder why
I hang with these thugs.
Whut?
I'm from the hood,
Nigga.
I gives a fuck. (I gives a fuck.)
It's in my blood.
Since I was little I been hangin' with these niggas.
And till I die I gon' remain with these niggas.
St. Paul in
The M-P-L-S, I hear you callin'.
I put it down, yes.
Now, Chris Rock, where you at?
I heard you say some shit about some blacks,
Nigga, this been your ass back.
Come see the real deal.
Stay in the fields, nigga.
These niggas will kill.
This ain't no cap-gun shots, nigga.
This a glock, pah, pah.
It's death on your block,
Knock, knock.
Whut's up nigga?
These sirens start singing.
It's me and Yuk with the L-G in the makin'.
It's stinkin', freakin',
Bowlin' on the weekend.
Creepin, seekin'
Me, till the currency
Gimme stacks up on mo' stacks.
I'm double parked for the train.
Even your moms know my name.
I be the D into the M, and the M into the G.
And I bring the B-O-M-B,
Nigga.

[Chorus]
It's in my blood. 
Smokin, sweets, drink forties to the suds,
And fuckin' wit' these thugs, nigga.
That's in my blood.
You wonder why us niggas be hustlers,
And out there slingin' drugs, nigga?
That's in my blood.
That drug money, stuff that shit up under the rug,
And make that nigga bug, nigga.
It's in my blood.
Niggas like me, turn niggas like you into hustlers.
Fucking with us, fucking wit us!

It's in my veins,
Like a chain-reaction.
How it all happened.
Paps is slangin' crack in the mid eighties,
Back in the day, when shit was crackin'.
Niggas pay thirty-eight for a package.
Tightly rappin',
For shippin' and handelin', taxes was added.
That's where the A-rap's headin'.
Even when I sleep, they in cavage,
Lavage shit.
Do automatics, with scopes, under my mattress,
With the dope and the drugmoney.
Stuffin' that shit up under the rug money.
Thug hungry.
Takin' drugs only 'cause we love money.
I'm a nigga, he's a nigga.
Would you like to be a nigga too?
Makin' big scrilla, like these niggas do.
You probably be a drugdealer too.
Scan and tuned, into the boys in blue.
Listen for clues.
In the kitchen, bakin' up Peruvian flake.
It takes twenty-eight grams,
Multiplied by thirty-six zips to make
A triple beam brake, a triple beam shake.
A hundred grams on the triple beam flake.
Two point two pounds, to be straight.
My niggas just flew in from G-A,
Ready to buy 4 kilos,
Then drive slow back to Youngstown, Ohio.
So fuck these rhymes.
Let me stick my dick in your ear,
And fuck with your mind,
Nigga.

[Chorus]

Niggas portray themselves as low key.
Broken down and fabricated,
Easily ejaculated, table with, and halfway faded.
Ain't no wars, 'cause they made it.
That type of bullshit is outdated.
But I played it like I laid it.
My partners have always said that.
It was set me up 
For life.
Money, clothes and hos, but road I chose was
Nothin' nice.
Niggas know just what it's like to be hustlers.
Governors from strugglers.
Bitches lovin' us.
Blindly chasin' that life we lust.
I blush.
Bottles, havin' thoughts and iring dreams.
Goin' down and roll fast.
Tryin' to get what my eyes have seen.
Fried of me, huh.
Nigga for a hand that got me through these eyes right to see.
But part not I was blind to the point,
Not even I could see, or that I could be,
Obviously.
I wasn't meant for me this type of trickery.
Hit me with the type of mystery.
Lay it down like history.
With the intent of me, myself, and I.
Street desire, easily.
Piece of mind, I was least to find.
Some sassiness.
Hossisiless, it gets to shit and praise to the farmer innercist.
Nobody was meant for it, it was deadly,
And I was discontent
With the shit that life once sent.
Government depend, now most of my time is spent
Escapin' what I love.
It's in my blood.

1-8-7 on these mothafuckin amateurs of rap
Feel the wrath of a nigga who bust
Makin my clique the shit, bitches want to discuss

In this, in my vein, ain't no way I can control it
When this inside of me is as deadly as them niggas
You know the ones who killed them boys and dumped the body in the river

Affiliated with cash, got my foot on the gas
Tailgatin real fast, through my sun roof my verbal gun shoot
Them scriptures, paint the pictures
We believe was cops tryin to catch me like receivers
Scream my name, to all these bitches who be hard to tame
Momma said it's a shame, poppa gave me the game
Experience a soldier, my heart pumps battle fluid
You want to go to war let's get to it
Mac-a-don, put you on teflon style of murder
Deadly as the killer kyle in your hamburger
Till they bury me black, wrapped up in street camo
I rock the microphone strapped off with street ammo

Transform into Liu Kang and finish ya

Witness the street level on the be	-ball court
Bitch I'ma die wit it, cause it's a part of my vein
Hear that word camoflauge when you hear my name
So tell them niggas I'm back affiliated, enemy lines are penetrated

I been watching these gotti niggaz for while now
I like they style and I like they style now
I like the way they travel close like a family,huh
Tightly knitted, well-known band of G's
I'm for that cheese
I did a couple of jobs for em, some mob shit I kill a ride for
Lied for em, in the process I made some paper stacks
Wanted to chill but was a lil to late for that
On the real they say they like the way I twirk it
Flat book style made dollars coming from dirt quick
Gold tooth smile, they had a vacancy in the outfit
Were these the type of cats I want to be down with
Don't fuck around with it
Something was kinda telling me, 
But it seems curiousity got the best of me
Slip through the seams, 'cause cream I'm one of the paid men
Remember the days when I was nuthin but a slave then
Some niggaz came in the days when
Between them all, I balled and always stayed pen
Tried not to fall on my toes I had to stay partner 
'cause when you fall is when these muthafuckin snakes gotcha
Right or wrong, now is it wrong for me to roll this way
Is it for me to put paper away for colder days
What would say, cold ass questions I had to ask myself
Wasn't trying to give way to soul just to have some wealth
My cause advanced that's how they came to me
Temptation all through my life had me claiming shit
Now blaming me for misleading the younger heads
Wondering if I might be out there on the run from feds
Who else be dead, hard to say partner to many faces
Keep ballin outta town, in unfamiliar places
I'm starting to hate this shit I thought I once loved to death
I thought I'd be around to day when there was nuthin
Looking all sad at times just might be the death of me, huh
Outta line will niggaz have respect for me
Like Mike be	 had ??? adreneline, to main from northline
My niggaz cut in short time
Niggaz who been down for figures I promised
Take a wheel took me around all these unfamiliar streets
Blowin sweets,huh gazing a thiefs, black laquer flows
Lavish ass bus sitting just for tours, cash for ???
Muthafuckas telling me that the world is yours
At the time I couldn't figure if these niggaz hearts were pure
Were they fuckin with me mentally or was it my destiny
That this click right here just happen to be meant for me
If they had love would it show itself it due time
Crystal camera sorted like a shoe shine
New era, new ideas bout to come to life
But is the right year what really was instore for Mike
Which way shall roll take left or move another right
Will I find happiness or will I meet my death tonight
If my guess is right I might just fall right in between
A better team, a better scene and piece of this niggaz green
??? gleam tell the stories of my past worries 
Reminise on soldier tales of no nuts no glory
what's really forme decisions, decisions 
When all I wanted was a mission of peace
Security from these cold ass streets woes me
A simple matter though it's complicated 
Niggaz who I once thought were friends yet in my mind most hated
Graduated status, afraid men, never paid men 
Never been in the company of made men

Afraid men

Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all, that's all baby
Oh no oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
I never felt that before
I never felt that before
But there's always
That's all, that's all

This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Beemers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
Ain't nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging snidd-ow, the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I got to get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow

I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
I never felt that before
(Just American dreamin')
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
But there's always
That's all, that's all

Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
It's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No!
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a ""personal Jesus,"" I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, its all in the stars
Like Tony LaRussa on how you play your Cards
Cause y'all ain't fucking with me! The ironies are
At all costs better avoid these bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins

I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
I never felt that before
(Just American dreamin')
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
But there's always
That's all, that's all

Step one in this process: scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince them that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
And the cops is coming, you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time

Big Mike,"Poor me, dad was gone, finally got my dad back
Liver bad, he wouldn't live long, they snatched my dad back
Guidance? I never had that, streets was my second home
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at, matter of fact, I learned it all
Burned it all, this music is where I bury the ashes at
Had to get some chollah bread so you can holla back, and holla that
Flash back, not having much, not having that
My Jewish lawyer too enjoyed the fruit of letting my cash stack
And just in case a nigga gotta use his rat-tat-tat-tat
Own boss, own your masters, slaves
The mentality I carry with me to this very day
Fuck rich, let's get wealthy, who else gon feed we?
If I need it, I'mma get it however, God help me
And I don't need no hook for this shit

I'm so fa sho, it's no facade
“Stay outta trouble,” momma said as momma sighed
Her fear: her youngest son be a victim of homicide
But I gotta get you outta here momma, or I'mma die inside
And either way, you lose me momma so let loose of me
I got the rein our direction will soon change
To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game
Hustle caine, hustle clothes, I hustle music
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick
Skinny nigga, toothpick, but, but I do lift
Weight like I'm using roids
Rolls-Royce keep my movements, smooth while maneuvering
Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in
Choices, we make trying to escape
And I don't need no hook for this shit

This is not for commercial usage
Please don't categorize this as music
Please don't compare me to other rappers
Compare me to trappers, I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris
And Luda's my dude, I ain't trying to diss
Like Frank Lucas is cool, but I ain't trying to snitch
I'ma follow the rules no matter how much time I'mma get
I'mma live and die with the decisions that I'mma pick
So fuck DeHaven for caving, that's why we don't speak
Made men ain't supposed to make statements

Turn crack rocks into a chain of 40/40's
Sorry my jewelery so Gordy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Maury's
America meet the gangsta Shawn Corey
Hey young world wanna hear a story?
Close your eyes and you could pretend you're me
A cut from the cloth of the Kennedy's
Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America's not witnessing
The Harlem renaissance birthed black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence's as the incense burn 
And the turn tables turn and that AL Greens plays
I see my mother's Afro as momma taps her toes as she rolls her jays
And my poppa just left the house, in search of the killer of my uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm my nerves, as I observe this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store we could never be sure so all we can do is
Pray

Because of your strength
While I walked upon the
For god is my defense

As I head towards my home room I observe the rooms though needles on the ground
I hear a car go vrooom drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle I ask why you laugh they say ""you too little""
One day you'll understand when you become a man 'bout things you have to get you
Fast forward freeze frame on my pistol
Fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful
I didn't choose this life this life chose me
Around here is the shit that you just do
I just left school, the same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had they guns drawn screaming just move
Unless there something else you suggest we can do
He made his way to the trunk, opened it like a huh
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we call corrupt he called paying dues
Now when the rules is blurred as they hears a what am I to do
But pray, pray the lord forgive me
Pray guys goodbye for what I'm about go through
Pray

Delivery me in thy righteousness
It cause me to escape and climb thy air until I am
Save me lord

Anyway there's oppression the drug profession
Flourishes like beverages refreshing
Sweet taste of sin everything I've seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or I victim I beg
What came first moving chickens or the egg
This is why I be so fresh I'm trying to beat life
Because I can't cheat death
The truth is the shamelessness ain't stainless is that aim this is
You know who's game this is
Move coke like Pepsi it don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine everything I do I'm a man behind mine
I'm not a angel I'm sure but every night 
Before I lay I drop my knees to the floor and I pray

The name shall continue as long as the sun will
Men shall be blessed in him
All nations shall call him blessed

My nephews would have grew up to do the same

And my influence is the same and my therapy is music
They ask if you ashamed

And though I wish I could separate the two things
I cannot so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the hall of mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look at myself in the eyes

No shame, no sir
Just big boats and tearin' the cost up
Tight coup like I'm wearin' the roadster
For any coup I'm bear hugging the holster

So a G a nigga gotta be
We playin' our property, no monopoly
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me

So I take it far as I can we then shall see
Shall we dance with the devil for a beat?

Do the hustle put keys in the street?
Then I'm ballroom dancin'

I can vouch for you if you ain't a part of this
So pardon me as I pave my wrist as I parlay my chips

Business like I'm white but I'm not I'm just bright
So fly with no fear of the flight

So if y'all hear my plight
And if you think you can make it this far without a fight
Couple mistakes here and there not always right
But I'm always real that's how I sleep at night

Maan, you stay talkin bout you're down wit me
But you stay on that complaining thang, you know what I'm sayin?
I ain't down wit all that complaining and fussin and fightin man
I'm a playa type dude, I'd like to let my gal get in the way,
But, you know what I'm sayin, the Lord blessed me with somethin
So I gotta take advantage of that, you know what I'm talkin bout
So I gotta do it, so its whateva

Would you still be down with me, yeah
Because I'll leave you tonight, uh ohh
I wonder if I didn't come
Would you still be down with me, yeah
Because I'll leave you tonight, uh ohh

If I didn't come home
What would you do to me?
Get on the telephone? Call Tyrone? Tell him come get you in he morning
You're wrong, this is my song
And I gotta pay bills, keep my happy home
Wreckshoppin all night long
I'm ready, fire burnin
No matter what you do to me, my wheels gon keep on turnin
Are you down? So please don't get me started
I got bitches out of town, if you fuckin wit clowns, I'll leave you broken
hearted

[Verse Two]
I let you play one time, then I knew you were mine
The way you caress me baby and sex me, I 'd have to say you put it down
You took me, and you put me under you're wings, I can't lie
Can't no other take your place, and can't a damn thang comply
I don't know if you noticed, but you're the throwedest on my list
Can't no nigga or no bitch compare their loving to a love like this
Up and down, thick and thin, I was always there
Ready to box or unload on a bitch, you know I don't care
When you kiss me with your lips, I just fall in a daze
Me and you against the world baby, priorities are gettin paid
Diamonds blindin, hoes cryin, ain't a damn thang changed
Showin up and pourin up, in this damn rap game
And by the way, I'm gon let you run the streets with your thugs
When Valentine's comes around, you know who's gettin your hugs
Fuck faces by fireplaces, Drink chases on mink rugs
You a dog, you gon rome, but always find your way home, so what

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now if I don't come home, would you blow up my phone?
Punch holes in my styrofoam? Misplace my chrome?
Childish games in yo dome got yo mind confused
A made nigga or a fake? Now its time to choose
Many have tried my shoes, but didn't travel too far
You knew the shit that you was in before you fucked the star
Look how you suck up all my barre, you think this shit's for free?
All this hustling in these streets keep all this ice on you and me
Picture how nicer it can be, private flights twice a week
Without you gripin about some freaks and how they saw me at the beach
I'll practice what I preach, you sit being obsolete
And remain to keep my business and my hustle out of reach
And now if I don't come home, would you still be down?
You are a fool, I will admit, but start practicin now
'cause I'm still the same playa that's all about my dough
And I'm not comin home tonight, you triflin ass hoe!

And that ain't because I'm a trick
That's just because through all the hard times you stayed down for a player
YouknowI'msaying, so I got to respect you for the queen you are
YouknowI'msaying, and I'ma treat you like a shining star
That's for real, coming from Lil' O

[Lil' O]
I'm thinking about the hard times I had boo
Like when I had to borrow change I had to ask you
See when a player had nothing I still had you
And you stayed down and it wasn't cause you had to
That's why I'm glad to, buy you things like diamond rings
Take you to the market to design your jeans
Expose your whole world to the finer things
Or put you in a drop benz sticky lime green
And that's all because you ain't do no popping
Girls hate you like bad food I got this bar rocking
But fuck them broads tell them we goin shopping
And when they see you 'sachi'd down, don't start jocking
See when I was down, where was my pals
They didn't come around it was me and my gal
That's why I don't hang it cats, niggas play it foul
But for you, I'll do anything just ask, that's my style

All you got to do is say it and (I'll do it)

[Big Moe]
When the going got tough, you got tough with me
Through the thick and thin you stuck with me
And even though we're not living in luxury
Stay bubbled a player to come up with me
And I remember all my days in jail
Running my business from outside my cell
Look in my kitchen and try to use my scale
You even caught a case trying to make my bail
I don't want another woman cause you're all I need
When I post up my script you break down in greed
And I always appreciate your love
You even let me run the streets with my thugs
Even went to hit the streets with my drugs
Penitentiary chances, anything you need
Baby I can provide, all of these circumstances

(Chorus)
Since you was there throuh the pain (I'll do it)
Since you stood through the rain (I'll do it)
And baby money ain't a thang (I'll do it)
So if you need your rent paid (I'll do it)
Need your wardrobe laid (I'll do it)
You want to chill all day (I'll do it)
All you got to do is say it and (I'll do it)

[Dirty $]
From the start you were my one trusted, much repect
It's amazing how we connect, I'd be a fool to neglect you
I'd do whatever it takes to protect you
If you ever need me call and I'll be there in a sec., boo
When I was flat on my ass you gave me your last
When your people talk trash, you take it in stride
And just reply with a laugh, this hater on enhanced
Still thinking that a player spitting game trying to stab
Trying to slam couldn't create demonstrate between you and me
Now my glass half full no longer half empty
Boys envy, chicks just might tempt me
But I see, his and her plates on bentleys and jewels
In our future, tell me baby boo does this prada suit you
Then pack your shoe, till the virign not last
Anything you want, I'll do it cause of the past

(Chorus)
So if you ever need some change (I'll do it)
Since you was there throuh the pain (I'll do it)
Since you stood through the rain (I'll do it)
And baby money ain't a thang (I'll do it)
So if you need your rent paid (I'll do it)
Need your wardrobe laid (I'll do it)
You want to chill all day (I'll do it)
All you got to do is say it and (I'll do it)

and if you seen my gal playa you would know that I'm blessed
with a pretty face and beautiful breasts,
flat stomach, big bootie, bow legged thighs, runnin track legs,
and stay fly from her toes to her hair
plus I know that she loves me, been with me through thick and thin

Wrapped around a pole and took a sip from my cup

Coming through the record company, want all my dollars
You ain't got my paper bitch, you don't get no dick
And I ain't put my dick in the uh you wrecked
Cause tramp hoes be talking, on the pilla walking
Out the street get them hoes, telling em bout all your clothes
And your car sitting on gold, and how much you get at shows
You shouldn't trust that bitch, that bitch will get you hit
I see it all the time, bitches get knocked on the grind
Keep it ten with that wife, coming back in the middle of the night
Say bitch you need to stop, you need to sell some cock
You need to get off them rocks, and get on private yachts
I'm talking bout they cousin, coming through bitches buzzing
Drinking on Hennessy, bitch you don't know Pimp see
You late on the slab, coming through whipping ass
I whip it up in the lab, and put it out like it's dark around

Keep the busters out your business and haters up out your face

Shrivel my signature I call it rapping refunds

The ones that criticize be the ones you call your friends
The ones that ride it out ain't gone always be your kin
But then, you got to know, if it's yours you gone get it
But also you got to know that everyday, ain't terrific

I thank the lord cause you know I'm the best
A little love set with the press
Why you want less cause through this

I guess it's best for me, to stay calm
And hold it down till the day that I'm gone

Between the hours of 3 to 7, that's when I bleed

Break the shop of a n**** that's short stopping my change
But me and him to the fullest ducking bullets at close range
Feeling crazy, like I'm a lose my life to a b**** n****
But while I'm here I be a rich n****

Nephews and nieces, niece cool clothes and chains and pieces
I break bread with my family when my record releases
Besides skills in the west, n**** got mouths to feed
Anything against the grain just light a finger spot over seas

[K-Luv]
Lemme tell ya how it feel when ya droppin' ya top
Pullin' up at Exxon and ya watchin' 'em bop
Makin' it hop bringin' it not
Pullin' through the Cario with a bad hoe drippin' ya knot
Grabbin' the glock cause sometimes boys be hatin'
Mad when they see young K-Luv skatin'
Down to get my cake baby with the top reclined
Casey in the 4-door with the dot to yo spine

[Toon]
Toon expedition we ain't playin' no games
We goin' park the 6 so we can floss the range
40 inch chain so my piece can hang
Ball kappa tennis shoes is a everyday thing
Purple stuff up in our cup we drank
While sippin' on a gallon here's the tap we crank
Bodies feelin' good from the X we take
And pockets filled up from the mission we bring

[Noke D]
Chunk that deuce in the air
Body rock with the H-town mayor
If you beatin' ya block and got hops on ya drop
Put ya middle fingers up in the air

Big Moe,"[Chorus: (Big Moe) Toon]
If you thugging in the club (thugging in the club)
And you rolling on dubs (rolling on dubs)
You ain't tripping, showing love (and showing love)
Say it's about to go down
You got money in your city (money in your city)
And the mamas looking pretty (mamas looking pretty)
If you feeling what I'm feeling (feeling what I'm feeling)
Say it's about to go down

[Mr. 3-2]
As I slide down on dubs, moving around on concrete
That g, oh he and I stays on feet
Heat with hollow clips, ready to bust shots
Glocks, full of heat leaving the situation hot
Plot all day boss hogging for position
Street game all in your face watch the rolex cushion
Heavy weightier, I'm the champ, Mr. 3-2
Really though big baby and it's 2002
Wreck a shop with Mo-Yo I'm boy hard
Boys, want to got to war black them out like tar
Swingers, on my guard, in a old school
I'm a god damn fool, start to busting with the two
Fresh braided, player made it, deuce out the roof
Rest in peace to my old and in these streets running loose
Ain't no use, trying to stop it just come and pop it
Loco, big dozer and we still sitting sloppy

[Chorus]

[D-Gotti]
Cash me Gucci coat, slicing a bad bitch
Watch her get a china face lift
Gear shift, we performing up in the land
Suicide doors, dubs and twin cams
All bitches on the fam' heads turning tonight
Watch us be the star traction and a harder night
More than Sprite, plus my neck and wrist are cold
Ice cubes in my watch and the piece is just froze
These hoes, all on a nigga dick cause I'm young, fly and rich
Escorting a bad bitch, doja lit, I ain't worried about the laws
Hoes whisper to each other girl I think he played ball
No bitch, I'm just a rapper out the hood
And I'm wrestling with the wood, powered up feeling good
Little engine that could, beat the block for it's stock
Turn around and swap game for a political job
R.I.P. to Pab aka Mr. Sweets
If you peeping from the south we about to blow you fin to see
Gucci boots on her feet, Gucci boots on my feet
I'ma pay a lot tonight, shine and have a seat

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip]
When I hit the scene, I'm crispy clean
I got a box of doughnuts from Crispy Creme
Everybody looking at me like Flip you the shit
Hell yeah I'm the shit, look at my wrists
I roll up a Philly, roll up a Philly
Head to the town and watch 3rd Ward Billy
Knock a nigga out while pouring up a drank
Got my mind on the bank, in the jail I use a shank
I sip that, flip that, wood grain grip that
Go to the Papa Do's yeah I'm gone tip that
It's Lil' Flip I'm a million dollar star
Blue, black or red don't touch my car, uh

[Chorus]

[Noke D]
I'm shook up, I'm looking throwed
Gucci wardrobe to match the Gucci soles
Gucci hoes and hop out the SL
I'm popped up and sliding on Sprewell
We sell, everything you need
Riding through with Pardon Davis and some falling t.v.s
Moe and me, we have been a lot
Looking for some head in a little bitty shop
On top, on wrist rock it's going down
H-Town southside 3rd Ward bound
Pulled up acting and class so they'll know
The south on shine cause we ain't broke no more

[Chorus]
Baby girl I'm sending this letter to you
Just to let you know you're still my baby boo

[Big Moe]
Lately I've been on the road
Can't say when I'm coming home
In and out the studio
That's the way the business go
Dealing with these bitches and niggas you never know
How this shit would end up like would end up after the show
By the way you smoke without a day
Got caught up on the highway
The cops tried to take me away
They weren't trying to hear what I had to say
I said these cops wouldn't let him go, we don't move no snow
I don't see what they see reason takes, my new tour
Search for us, never let us go
Cause he didn't find what he was looking for
Situation could of gotten out of control
But we made it through now it's time to roll
State to state to state we make so much of this hate
It's always strange to see what jealousy can create

[Enjoli]
Say boo you know it's real if you don't come home
When I call your phone ain't no plex in my tone
Hold this shit down leave your plex at home
Ain't bugging ain't tripping put you in the sex zone
When you hit the streets I know you giving them hell
Hit the studio make your pockets swell
Nigga knock but don't stop baby go on and mash
I'm down with my nigga we gone forever last
You chose me I chose you I ain't worried about no hoes
Got my name in your mouth don't let your mouth fall low
To a diamond baby, now go on and shine

I was raised Screwed Up Texas, didn't know my direction
Now I'm a state representative, been chose by election
Some said I wouldn't make it, but I'm still in the game
Things done changed, diamond rangs
Man it's funny how things done changed
I hooked up with that DJ Screw
He slowed it down, chop-chopped it too
Got blades on the bus, candy paint on the truck
If you wanna know what's in my cup

Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff

Now now now
That 'Purple Stuff', that Houston soda in my cup
Now I'm behind the wheel, catch the wood, I'm done
Under the influence of bar
Drank stains on my FUBU and I still feel like a star
Now I'm a go up behind the wheel cause I done woke up
Wrapped around a pole and took a sip from my cup
Now I can't slip up, clipper
Catch a playa leanin impa-uh, one up in the trunk
Now now hut, two, three to da fo'
I done slammed up the fo' wit a Crush Pineapple
Gotti gon' last long but I ain't sippin wit dat bowl
Drinkin at the bar baby I be way too throwed
And I guess a playa had about enough

Screwed Up Click, my click of G's
Ah you got to feel that player M-O-E
Rolling with the Los, running with the codeine
And we about break, so take all you can

[Hawk]
Screwed up, what, chest be looking booed up
With the chemistry it's brewed up tracks get chewed up
Brighten the mood up, when I'm spitting this all
Above the law, coldest nigga you ever saw
Stay there, outlaw hand me up the state
I infiltrate your chest stain and increase the death rate
Don't hate, my, it only makes us madder
Pockets get fatter, then a only makes them say matter
Squash all the chatter in the southern region
I pledge of allegiance to my niggas not breathing
We all still breathing screaming S.U.C.
And that's the story mafios, and P-A-T
Niggas can't see me cause I'm rougher than most
You boys are like bread not butter and toast
They can't even come close, they done already told ya
Like the H-A-W-K and a screwed up soldier

[Chorus]

[Big Moe]
See when we floss our candy rides
Screens keep falling from the sky
Players ball and we stay true
And if you want to test my click
I pop problems what you get
S.U.C. and we god damn fools
We got that purple sticky dank
Chased with purple sticky drank
And forever we gone bang screw
Oh it's the Screw in us, we gone represent with pride
It's the Screw in us till we die

[Chorus]

[Lil' Keke]
Devastating and motivating it's the S.U.C.
Showing and blowing up since the year 93'
Everybody be claiming the click, they want to be down
Wait to trip, on a flip through H-Town
Let's take it back, cause you know we love that
Poppi in the gray lay with the with the fifth on the back of the lac
You know we ride chrome everyday
Having the ghetto dreams like my nigga P-A
We crossed inside and forever we glide
And one thing's for sure man southside's riding
Let's get this cheddar, you got your wood and your leather
Sitting tall on boys pushing dubs or better
This a click full of g's, so we do it with these
Keep the block on pop and the ice on freeze
Mo yo, and Keke for real it don't stop
S.U.C. took a mission on down to Wreck shop, come on

Screwed up click, gone keep it true
Oh P-A to, that DJ Screw
We gone morne you so deep for you
And I want to say to you, without you fool",S.U.C.,2002
Big Moe,"Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

Gotti we gone slide down swang wide
(Aight)
We gone ride gray or peanut butter buck eyed
Then we gone tip toe, so slow
We gone wreck the slab for the dirty third coast
Hell we gone post up, on the lot

Fifth drop screens lit, trunk pop
Stash spot, cash box, on vogue socks
Old shoes chrome laces giving haters blues
Banging what Screw, tell me what it do
Shocking and rocking club and the thug and staying true

I'ma do my thug thang, bang bang, chitty, chitty chop
With the stash unlocked, trunks staying hot
HA, green sticky la, deep in the shop
Cardiac kicking times

It's a party baby bounce, bounce sugar hit the flo'
I'm on the cool up in the fo', in the newest Gucci clothes
'Bout to drop it to the door, baguettes touching my navel
Body rocking kinda slutty, served out like label

We got, a stable full of pop
That dish the satellite and throw cable at the spot
Up on the table if it's able to get wet like a mop
And after we wreck the spot we can just ride

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

I'ma do it like this, I'ma do it like that
I can hit it from the front
(Or I could hit it from the back)
I'ma put it in your crack, see how you act

If you like it on your knees, you could have it for a snack
I'm a fat mack, in a handy bag with a snub with 'em
Broads like the way the fat mack do his thug thizzel
When I hit 'em with my love then I got 'em

I'ma hit it from the top, I'ma put it in a bottle
I'ma hit it from the back, the big black Casanova
I'ma put it in your head and I'ma set it on your shoulders
Syrup in the soda, talking bout the Barre

Foreigner car, feeling like a fallen star
'Bout the menage 'tois ain't that what that Pokey said
Never been scared, South side will leave you dead
And call me Big Meaty, call me Big Meaty

Don't come into my room if you ain't gone get freaky
Working on his boys, run through em like a tractor
Out the South side, Moe-Yo make the god damn adapter
I ain't even quit, I'm doing mighty fast

Sitting on glass, Moe-Yo showing my naked ass
It's the Moe-Yo freestyle I'm so throed
South side playa putting it down, cho-cho
Playas get chosen, like M O E

Put it in your middle yes the big body
Riding big tractor, I'm a money stacker
Out the South side Moe-Yo I'm kinda actor
Act a damn fool, on this damn tape
Like Po-Yo said got them hoes screaming rape

Freshened up, looked up thanking god that's who

Chopping up the deuce cause I'm a ghetto star

Watch shoes do the who with spectacular sound
That'll make you look around
School of Hard Knocks to the socks
Fresh out the parks, that's known for hot blocks
Cause players get changed so I focused
Affiliated with the game, sitting inches from the ground, now I'm holding
Rolling, want up in the lane
How I come from nothing to going back with change
Pitching the game, knowing that I got another chance
To be, fronting on dubs, stretched shirt down pants
Now I alert why'all to the dance floor, I clap hands
Doing what I want in my 64 with people saying

Feel that, know I'm saying, know I'm saying
I can't have you around me with that bitch shit
Straight up nigga, get the fuck away from me
Know I'm saying, this Noke D, Noke D's in here
Fuck whoever don't like me straight up
Run tell that, know what why'all could do for me for real

[Big Moe]
I'm a rider daddy, let a big nigga breathe
You the reason why your girl, keep jocking me
Got too many hands, pulling on Big Moe
But ain't too many hands, that Big Moe get thoed
See I was born, all by myself
If it wasn't for the worst, I wonder who would be left
Who really gonna hold me down
When all the chips, finally hit the ground
I had to stop, and look around
At all these new friends, I just found
Cause when I started out, singing these songs
It was me, Screw and a microphone
Slanging grey tapes, on Gravestone
All night long, sipping pints to the dome
Now I'm making hits, getting ghetto bitch
Now all these hoe ass niggaz, be up on my dick

[Chorus]
Move around
Get the fuck out my face
Move around
'Fore you make me catch a case
Move around
And get the fuck out my grill
Move around
And let a big nigga chill

[Big Moe]
See I finally realize
That the whole world is in disguise
And all the pain that's in my eyes
Came with the fame, and all the lies
And all the labels, with these deals
All in my grill, telling me about scrill
But Big Moe, still got deals
Fuck Beverly Hills, I'm still Southsive
From the cradle, to the grave
To the end of my days
I'm still gon get pay-ayed
From the block, to the top
To the last tick tock
All you roaches and you rats, won't stop
Hollin' what it do, claiming that you true
But I got my eyes focused, on you

[Chorus]

[Mr. 3-2]
Move around, beat your feet and get to walking
With all that con game, and fast talking
My dogs start barking, and things get ugly
Touching boys up, getting rough like rugby
I needs my space, so clear my atmosphere
You nothing ass fools, better get from round here
All up in my ear, I'm trying to holla at this broad
But you riding my pitbull, like menage tois
Running up on my car, wanting a contract
I ain't looking for no acts, but you bout to get slapped
To a coma, gone on a, get to stepping
Down the yellow brick road, 'fore I pull out my weapon
I done told you once, won't tell you twice
Move around playboy, shake and roll like dice
All that grabs handshakes, all that's fine
But it's a place for everything, and partna it's about time

[Chorus]

Move around
Fake ass niggaz, get out my face
Move around
Better move on down, 'fore I catch a case
Move around
Fake ass niggaz, get out my grill
Gotta move around
Let a playa just chill

Just chill, get out my grill

It's a damn shame, when your gal pull hoes for you
My girl ha feel this here, something different mayn
Peep game, my girl

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
That's my girl, dancing on the bar
Ma, baby take a charge for me
And my girl, is a real hot thang
And she catch hoes for me

That's my girl, with a red coat on
Sliding down the block, and her shoes made of chrome
She don't mind, when the hoes all bop
My baby ain't ashamed, she'll jump off the top
And I like, when she make her last spot
When I put my school head, up on fifteen knots
You, better not touch my baby girl
We just balling all night, in our own little world

Now my girl, a sexy red with a throwed head
North star brain, and keep her down in my bed
Baby ain't scared, to strut her stuff in your lane
When I touches her brain, she get wet like rain
Jet down mayn, on a beautiful day
Waving my blue trunk, like we in a parade
If you lay in an escapade, when we in to winning
Don't drop the matches, on my baby's buck skin
Twenty two's tucked in, crawling for a playa
She love when Moe-Yo sing to her, getting paper
Hot we wreck the spot, and don't mind
When the fellas try to holla, 'cause I know baby fly

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

See my boo, don't mind being couped up
'Cause when the weekend roll around, she gets ooh stuff
When she juiced up, attitude screwed up
Leave a chip on her her shoulder, boys swear she souped up
I chunk my deuce up, 'cause my lady too tough
Four scoops of purple stuff, mixed in my cup ha
No matter who what, when where or how
In the middle of a crowd, baby gotta stand out
Let the top down, she don't believe in broads
Quick to snatch my boy, 'cause she attract the law
Ask her bout them boys, like his like your's
She is my bitch playa, part
Every time we floss the board, is something you never saw
Not a single score, a solitary flaw
Started life as a Houpe, but now baby bulletproof
See uh, call my girl is proof

[Chorus: Repeat 4X]",My Girl,2003
Big Moe,"Hey girl, what's up, you know
I been checking you out right, what
You can't tell, check this out then
This what I want to tell you right here

[Chorus: A3 and Noke D]
Hey there shorty, can I get with you
Because we came here to party, and do what playas do
I've been peeping you all night, your booty's feeling right
I ain't trying to be your man, cause a playa's down to understand

[Mafia Mike]
Baby I been peeping you, for a real hot second
I know you got a man, and I trying to disrespect him
But check it, I get the message when you tell me that you need him
But baby, I ain't trying to change your lifestyle either
Your people steady telling you, to leave dude alone
But it's hard, you just pictured a new car and a home
A new phone to talk on, when you ride down the street
Your hair stay fixed, manicures smelling sweet
To me, all that beauty poo I know that you sick
It's the small things that count, and that's what you miss
I came back to get a kiss, and to tell you good night
And to really show you, that's it's goin' be alright
Kinda like Prada hot, to set the mood straight
Baby I'm your cow, goin' taking you away
Ok, go on ahead and lay your head on my chest
I know that's what you want, that mean you through with all the stress
I confess

[Chorus]

[Big Moe]
Shorty I've been watching you
Can you be my baby boo
We can bang Screw, all night
Floss in my Navigator, on chrome
Let me show you around my hood
Where the block stay hot, and it's all good
I'ma flip it, like a real playa should
I can't explain, what's understood
Understand, you can't be my wife
Cause I'm still young, trying to live my life
See things, that I ain't seen
I'm on a mission, trying to live my dream
We can chill, anywhere today
If it's real then it's real, baby girl why wait
My partner needs me, I ain't got time to play
I'll do anything you want, just say

[Chorus]

[Tyte Eyez]
Peep game, I ain't the one to jump fly
But since I stepped through the do', you been giving me the eye
I'm trying to figure out why, a girl so thoed
Want to mess with a nigga, that'll dig in her soul
I'm in control, let's keep it on the low
Watching your g-string, move across the dance flo'
While Moe over fo', screwed up moving slow
Only pulling bad hoes, that's down for losing clothes
I suppose, one I get up in your mind
Two, lay down then get up in your spine
Three, that's me a bonefied G
I smash and then free, that's the taste of a ski I-P
Are-O miss, to lace your bubble bath, in Don P and Cris
Watch us made that switch, but I'm far from a trick
I just like to make your wish, to live like this cause I'ma player

You might see me SUV on 24s
Or I might be flippin tippin on four vogues

But they gone be even madder when that jag leave the lot
I stay grindin so I can stay ballin

Candy paint on fours
Doggin all these hos
You handlin the road in my wide body load

VERSE 1:(LIL KIM AKA BIG MOMMA)
The Buda got my brain seein my own my blood stains
Dental records checkin my remains,it's hard to explain
First I see 'em then I don't, they disappear
First she tried to slit my throat,now she ain't there
I'm seein bitches in the mirrors behind me
But when I turn around, they hard to find 
See a little bit of weed and a little bit of greed
Make a bitch want to choke me till I bleed
Now watch a bitch breathe from dumb-dums
That some young bum had to bust just for wreck
Earn some self-respect,now should I tote a fo' pound
'Cause a clown wants my autograph
Broken off that hash I think he wants my cash
The Lexus and rings,give a sex simple and plain
But these bitches is mad an' they niggas is bad
So they scheme on a CREAM,you know
Fuck the hos,bitches is detrimental,the guns is essential

CHORUS x 2

VERSE 2:(LIL KIM)
I'm having re-occurring dreams-bitches they want my CREAM
They want to be lieutenant so it seems,I can't sleep
I see an image that keeps movin round and round my bed
The shadow stops,points a Glock to my fuckin head
I grab my pillow,crack the back window
pull out the tre-8,bust three times at the gate
LORD have mercy!The devil tryin to curse me 
I keeps seeing shit that wasn't there in the first
See bitches be livin mad fad-they fuck my man
Steal out my crib,then come an' try an' shake my hand
Yeah man,breakin you down one time
I packs that shit for your ass,Chronic for your mind
I keeps it real on all you bitches,I wish you keep your mind
Off my motherfuckin riches
Bitches,I'm tired of all you hos beggin me for clothes
Bank rolls is all I knows,that shit is dead chicken-head!

CHORUS x 2

VERSE 3:(LIL KIM)
The morning's finally here,damn!What should I wear?
Time to get dressed and do my hair,once again it's on
Somebody's knockin at my door,but when I walk across the floor
Just ope' it up,the motherfucker's gone
I'm hearing voices in the back of my mind
Better grab my 2,'cause this fool might get outta line
I guess it's time to test this bullet-proof dress
From putting holes up in my chest
I'm lookin through the peep-hole to recognise the face
I see three bitches and still I got to play it safe
I hope my dress come in handy,but when I open the door
Three little girls selling candy,ya see bitches is jealous
Of Little Kim because my click is thicker than the rest of them
All I want to do is be rich and stay that bitch
Clock dough on the law,why'know?

Back in the days, before I was Cool J
I used to hang up on the corner, pumpin' Games People Play
Sittin' on a garbage can, rhymin' to my man
Talkin' bout big money and future plans
I always told the brothers, if I got a contract
When the money started flowin', I'd be back
To do a jam, against all odds
Introducing rapper 1 from Farmers Boulevard

Hey yo, B-o-m-b, bomb explosion
Attack like a cat when I'm trapped and I'm closed in
Sharp-ass claws, and I break all laws
In a while all jaws, cause I'm perfect, no flaws
Now I'm back to Farmers on some new improved
I'm makin' moves, not fakin' moves
So don't you never come around here, talkin' that talk
Or walkin' that walk, you'll get played like a sport
Football, soccer, whatever you savor
You're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor
Ha! I'll have you breakin locks
I'll have you cookin fried rice in a big steel box
The type of skills that I got reigned for years
No worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears
'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers
Suckers, I'm drinkin' forties of beers

Yeah man, I wanna check out my man Big Money Grip
Yo, what's up, man
Kick a little something

Kick out the can and slam
Summertime, C.I.A. step into the jam
Reach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up
And the brothers start fleeing like it's a hold-up
Some step aside, but a few play me close
Never worry, cause the brother who cross me's getting buried
And the fool who wants to deal with another dose
I see to it in a hour that the mother is comatose
Farmers Boulevard, the place
Handing me a mic is like giving a chainsaw to Leather face
Smoking MC's in an instant
At my side busting caps is T-Boogie, my assistant
Throw that speaker in the trash
Why's that? Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash
Big Money Grip making you get up
Farmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up

Yo, yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo

Yeah, we living Chinese people in a Turkish bath, baby

Hi C over there, man

Yo, what's up Hi C

Hi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme
More than a line on time, because I'm gettin mine
Never underestimate the skill of a great one
The Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none
Another funky rapper from around the way
Leaving bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay
Boy, you been told, put your lips on hold
All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreading terror on the street like they was in the past
Any punks on the block, yo, never could last
And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag
(One time a sucker got ill and went out in a body bag)
Fear will erupt through the heart of another
The Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother

Yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here
Yo, yo, yo, Hi C
Yo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo
I was,

But yo, L
Won't you, won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?

Aight, let me sum this up

Now you heard the brothers speaking bout the street that we're from
Rhymes hitting, beats kicking, you can't get none

Marley Marl in the background doing the rest
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, kato

Big Nous,"Slightly schizophrenic borderline psychotic 
Sensational recreational narcotics 
I thought I lost it but I found it 
Temptation marches along till I'm surrounded 
Inspired by fire the sensual illusion
Caught between the crossfire anger and confusion
Howl at the moon black blanket that's starlit 
I'm rarely romantic plowing through tramps 
And harlots madchild prevails tails of the unwanted 
Not to be taken for granted 
My past has come back and haunted for real 
I've all ready danced with death. a dozen black roses 
I pose with babies breath 
Be afraid a place where magic is made 
I'll rain on your parade with silver razor blades 
I'm creepin' over the fence crawlin' through your back yard 
My mind states intense 
Savage penetration on the rocks with a twist 
Now scream and shake your fists
Cause dreams are made of this

For real the opposite transmit telepathic 
Roamin' the flats with automatics and back packs 
Doin' jacks for Big Macs, accumulatin' stacks to make G's 
Nigga please, you artificial 

You dropped somethin', it's your heart 
An' it's still pumpin', pumpin' you from this existence 
It seems to be absolutely mandatory, 'cause you be manipulatin' skin 
But no way, because you fake I can trace out your image 
Even though you don't cast one, I smell a rat, I'm smellin' that 
Stay back at least 150 inches, 
You brew tea? an I know you know I can sense it 
With the nostrils innocently mixed with 6 hostile stenches 
Henceforth the elbow swings dinging, we bring whip to bleed scalps 
Swingin' sleep out your mouth 
How long you been hibernatin'? Too long! 
You're abiding and aiding a felon, to switch your melon 
Droppin' grammar like a judges hammer 
I feel you mark, feel me feel your chart 
You gotta be real an you gotta to have heart 
You gotta to be real an you gots to have heart 

Stir the blur, nuts and bolts whirl 
Stored in electric ports, 4 strong boxes of 10 floors 
Shift the weight towards the door, in hopes of escape 
When hands on cord, the blazing roof Prev creates 
Sound break, concord, eye of the condor 
Hand skills of a saboteur, your in for 
A war that pours coarse of molten into cords 
Strung by the young ones, put me on tour 
No folk lore horsemen for poison, pour in skin pores 

Soft rhymers, metamorphize their cartoon characters 
Grafted from Africa, in this game you got no stature 
Not even a factor in this 
Whole shit makes me yawn 
Snatch your heart out your chest like a '96 ghetto spawn
Antonym of urban, too feminine for this cut-throat mentality 
Have ? thoughts in my area, you get snatched out your Suburban 
Fallacy with no antidote, in this ? your age get broke 
Runnin' from gun smoke, ballin' never rumin'

(What's up, son?  What's up?)  Word up.  Get go.
(No doubt, nigga!)  Money no represent; know what I'm sayin'? 
(All the time, baby.)  No doubt.  (You know what I'm sayin'?) 
Who we got here, son? (Shine, baby, shine.) 
(Look.) Look who we have here, yo! (Up in the sky... sky.) 

[Prodigy]
Here come the vultures; the Mobb-laced potent rap shit.
Perhaps, kid, make it happen; start the flippin'.
You fuckin' comic, who you kidding?
My nigga's laughing, blood bathin'; the world's greatest.
In-famous, crime-zanous;
To interfere would be dangerous.
Plane descent; stand clear; save your strength.
You couldn't do the limp if you was coked up.
By my z'd up, whatever the fuck; who gives a fuck?  You get fucked.
My coalition specialises in collision.
The clash of the cliques; the duel o' the iron mac; spit
And leave ya half-split.
You'll be missin' much more than a fraction
When it's time for action.
Hit 'em while a man down; make that nigga backspin.
Trapped up; a madman.
We blastin', you're collapsin'; heavily light, my gold Mac 10. 
Get imprisoned with dem raps; they have you relapsin'.
You get castin' the Mobb, deaf and assin'. 
We face splashin'; dope fake's ice-pick stabbin'.
He slow leakin', he 'ternally bleedin' for speakin'.
Outta place niggas get placed back, indecent.
Live at the main event may I present,
Screamin' out loud for any squad that's deaf.
My infamous Mobb; ya heart throb; hold ya breath.
It's KO from dead arm; rights and hard lefts.
Another satisfied consumer who got blessed.
Single out ya army til; there's no man left.

[Chorus]
Man down. (Man down, down, down, down...) 
Man down. (Man down, down, down, down...) 
Man down. (Man down, down, down, down...) 
Lay the fuck down!

[Havoc]
Infamous cartel; visible evidence.
We scarred well; associated team benevolent.
Never hesitant; opposition get settled here with
Sharp shit that'll rip through.
One hundred layers of Kevlar; sharp like the gym star.
Exiled, son, he get sent far;
He's the foulest; QBC gat bust the loudest.
Below profile; peep style; thirsty prowlest.
Catchin' court cases; pay for your legal aid.
Son, that's money wasted; I ain't got time for that.
Invest third place on my best sold rap,
On the scrap from the ignorant cats.
It'll be dead in a few... just like that.
Couldn't bust his gat right.  (Yo, y'know what?) 
But now you bucked your own man, amateur ass.
Homeboy, take that ass to class.
But you cut in, duckin' a reality blast.
You catch a D minus, fuckin' with New York's finest.
The conversation from them outsiders,
Dick riders, connivers, bomb ya camp.
We know survivors; push you off guard; got homicidin'.
We analysin'; tell you up front ain't no surprises.
We take you down first round; give ya man pound.

[Chorus]

[Big Noyd]
Check it out, Dun, them niggas ain't ones
To be blowin' off the top and shit; I'm tired of shit.
Dun, I'm about to dot the bitch and leave him stiff.
Toss me the fifth so I can bless the God with gift.
Yo. nigga Noyd, what's the topic?  Yo, the topic is this:
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list. 
First of all, them tight niggas with that space-down shit;
I stick a rocket up in they ass and give 'em a lift.
My marvellous Mobb is tonic, intoxicant, bee-swee.
Morphine raps; you get dope from inner mind-see.
Shit fienin', now get your fix 'cause you need it.
Fuckin' up your intravenous; the Infamous Mobb, top secret.
The only way you weakin' is if you beakin' this.
Sneak devy niggas, mischievous.
'Knowledgin'; the God behind the scene on some snake shit.
The vultures, water from their mouth, but we can taste it.
We just waitin' with patience.
Yo, dun, check the cross-examination; these niggas fakin'.
So you can scream, you can fiend, you can dream for the bacon,
Or you can snatch the Mac for the faggot, ai! 
Bang 'em up, fuck em up.

[Chorus]

Lay the fuck down, down, down, down...",Man Down,1996

Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against me
And is it the henny that bend me; i be in the zone
Gazing at the walls, suppressed, thinking da phone
Don't take personal, but only a minor few can understand
What a nigga feeling; 40-first 'til i die motherfucka..(no doubt)
I'm still breathing. you a must son, we full bread
You ain't my dogg, tring to infiltrate my clik is you
I get wit you, handle that on a later note.
We o'er-dose eveything is death, we so close
I'm trying to tell these cats, but i let them do they thing..
Ready for the bad news 'til da phone ring
Son is dead, now i'm irate over my head seeking revenge.
Son is dead, son on your behalf trying to laugh

Check out the drill-dun, conceal guns
Play the hum leaning back checking out the action
On the benches we drinkin x's
Yo twirl dat shit, while i spark this...
Sharply burn it down like an arsonist
Pull out the miz cause its time to bring the biz to kidz
And blow all hell fire out ya empire
Live as wire couldn't make my mobb expire or retire
I'm letting off 'til my arms tired
You set quite wit my head full of riot.
Our buyers, it clear for your ear to hear
I declare only live niggaz lock this year
'96-i lost my dun; '97-it got worse..
Pull money out the team, got to get mork..
And sat down you play the background when shots sound off
Flashbacks of how my man is gone, kb forever in my memory
I spill some henny then i keep it moving

Where you find me at spillin congac from a cup
With my heat next to my nuts
Never been afraid to bust
Slug rushin to your head like dust
If that wasn't enough as long as strong and tough
We squeeze back, better believe he no longer breath-black
Fuckin wit these swayze cats
I got dreams of raising my little queen and nobody gonna stop that
In fact black, if you come at me don't come sloppy
All my baby girl got is a papi to guide her
Through this world of hatred
And i die to see that she make it
And die to let the nextman take it, is you stupid, um...

Yo, you want to come test, son is mad from stress
Penalty is death, pay your last respects
We harass you reap if you slept or half step
We adapt to see who we can master next
After sex pass the bless for after effects
Relax your stress through mad physac, mad contact
Cash a check to get assets we blast techs
Dealing with the mental aspect on chest
So we create a trust, if you dunns come to shot
Get hit with a twenty-one gun salute
I keep a loaded yet deadly 7sc 30
Soon as you it hit me i release lyrics of fury
And quick to say a poem to ricochet in your dome
My click made me leave the nickel-plated at home alone
So i can get chatter and be the better trend setter
The 18th letter forever

Big Noyd,"It's kinda bugged how I go sometimes 
Know they staring brain feels like a wheel lost with out the ball bearing 
Stuck contemplating on who I can trust 
But like lleullo in a bill my feelings just get crushed 
But that's why I stick with my duns like I stick with the guns 
Don't get mad rip your hun concentrate on my funds 
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist 
Never get patted down when I step in the place 

Jiggied up, smoke the pot, confirm if it is real reefer or not 
Rally up, after this get followed straight to the crib 
Gem Star, double edge apply pressure 
Shave em down, blow marks right through your mecca 
want to be a thug, now you got the thug look, 
Stick em up, leave medicaid, with the real to push 
God body, with a rubber grip black shotti 
Pump one in his ass make that nigga switch hobbies 

A dossage, hand delivered, without postage 
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice 
Niggas get sniped like, Klonker Brockite 
Show em how to rock right, when bitches hold the mic, street life 

Why you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the 
concrete, If I survive only time can say, You where a part of me

Why you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the

This is something you feel nigga, like the theme song from Hill Street Blues 
This is real, this is ill street news 
How he gone, and left his moms mind struck 
Now his brother ain't giving a fuck 
Little sister giving up the butt now, Dun don't wet that 
I want you to rest black, cause you better belive Noyd gon handle that 
'Cause when I get em, I'm gonna have em 
Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at them 

I ain't no killer, you know me 
But I'll be damned if I don't lie for my C-O-D 
And then this Old G, scold me and told me coldly 
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homey 
But I gotta redeem, get this cream by any means 
I never been clean 
Nigga, my whole click got dirty 
From the battles, to the trials and bloody up shirtsleeves 
Nigga you heard me, its gangsta 

Vision the canvas I paint a picture 
Similar to Ernies Barnes nigga 
But mines is more ghetto more guns more drugs, mostly thugs 
All my duns, their baby moms daughter and sons 
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out 
Park benches broke, a nigga stretched out 
Jumped off the roof to his death its real 
Hand Ball walls displayed with are I-P murials 
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building 
Devils spring, keep em going while the snows blowing 

Grams get dipped, 50's are moked, cookies are broke 
And spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke 
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects 
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at 
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off 
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off don't get clipped off 
Street life

(Drop that shit)Yeah, yeah, check it out
Now run for your life, or you wanna get your heat, whatever
We can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24-7, mac 11 is my people
So why you wanna end your little life like this?
Cause now you bump heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive
The last night, damn right, I ain't tryin' to fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turning back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion
No signs of anger or fear cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you
I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Fuck where you at kid, it's where you're from
Cause where I'm from, niggas pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'ma test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way and beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Who's the richest nigga in the project, who got it locked
Rocking Convertibles, drop tops and mad hot
Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
Who's organized, all eyeballs is on CREAM
And your whole clique got nothin' but raw shit
Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks
Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable
In the jungle, banging NaS, Mobb Deep and Wu
There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons
Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns
You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in Saran
Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand
Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender
Get ninjaed on the island, plus the Bridge, boy remember

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that 118 tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me
Thug selling drugs, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy",Right Back at You,1999

Aiyyo, aiyyo, I produce threats, tecs
The underworld sweat when I rep for my set

Froze on my neck, explode when my 2G whip correct
Out of respect, M-O-double-be	 top shit
But logic, why'all niggaz know why'all can't fuck wit
From past incidents, shootouts, and fist battles
Scuffles through state lines, you can't stop mine
It's a crime to the dumb deaf and blind
Way before your time out of line niggaz walk straight
When I approach my I, rep my Infamous bloodline
Niggaz get your guns it's thug time
Came from no frills to skips, nights that gat clips
A cold cold world to this icy hot shit
(Nigga) Scars, bars, tappin niggaz shit
I'm cuttin 'em, buckin 'em, and fuckin they bitch
You like, ""Who that nigga?"" A smooth cat nigga
Walk around with two gats too nigga
Straight like that nigga, smack that nigga
If I don't know him then blast that nigga

Get down on my knees and cross my heart with it
Cause it's real, when I use it to protect my life
Shit was real when he shot a nigga over his wife

Clown tried to give me pound I threw it down in his face
I get down - in any town, get down in any ghetto

Yo for the dough we can spit, my style flow sick
For them sixteen bars, I get in you God quick
You don't want none of this, shit I'm hot as a pit
Check the shit I got 'em shook now they ride on my dick
Don't forget I rock for those lovin it, those thuggin it
Holes in they clothes and the less unfortunate

But never could afford it
But now I got ones and guns to re-insure it
Reach for my spine, pull out a fuckin nine Tourist'

I'm grimy, you find me where the loot is with Lugers
The bodies, the hotties, the hustlers and the shooters
With dudes that'll cut ya, that's what eatin your food is
Fools know the rules pull out your tools better buck it
Cause niggaz be flaggin and braggin when they cut up your nugget
Knee deep in the grind like ""fuck it""

What's truth, what's lie? Who's people, who spy?

When we die is there heaven or is it total blackness?

There's mad tension in the air (mad tension in the air)

Eject the Czech from the glove compartment
Lay out the lead spray, and flame him up like arson
It's dangerous business

So put your face in mine, best brace your spine
Cause opposites may attract, but they don't combine
My impact so fat, you feel your vertabrates grind
Now delayed second thoughts run through your mind
When my slugs connect, and strike your major arteries
When my fists connect, they causin major injuries

I doom the world like I was God and throw my gun away
Then snatch the moon out the sky, and blow the sun away
Me and my brothers play hardball
Strictly hardcore, lyrics til I'm finished breakin God's laws
My job's raw but I gotta do it - I'm feelin high then buddhaed 
So you might get shot and lose a lot of fluid
The spot I blew it at an early age, ever since the curly braids
I would earn a wage with the thirty gauge
There's dirty ways to get paid if you got the balls
Just load the glock and cause the hardest cop to drop his drawers
Don't stop or pause, let the shotty go up his butt
To finish up, punchin body blows and uppercuts

Trippin' me out, trippin' me out

[Snow]
What me and you have stay strictly 'bout the cash
Not only 'bout the ass
That's how I got this S-class
I got my own cash, and I watch my own ice
Peeped the real in me, huh? 
That's why you looked twice
Vision Snow in your life, holdin' you tight
Relievin' your stress as I caress you through the night
I'm the go-get-it type
To make sure we both right
No fuss, no fight, and we can blow like dynamite
With you handlin' your buisiness and me handlin' mine
With us both on the grind, we can't help but to climb
As far as time, baby, we got forever
But for right now, let's concentrate on this cheddar
And reaching higher levels, sportin' diamond bezzles
Can you imagine the shit we can have together?
Me trippin'? Never; I'm down for whatever
Snow and Po-yo - it don't get no better

[Chorus]

[Big Pokey]
I ain't trippin'; I'm just stunned 'cause you the bomb
I could see us in a six, flippin' like a baton
You set off my alarm
When you walk you perform
Spotted you in the crowd and picked you like a pecan

[Snow]
Well, let's hop this don and discuss how we increase our funds
I know it drives you crazy when I talk in digits, baby
Ain't nothin' shady about this, lady
Everything is everything, and I put it down for you daily

[Big Pokey]
You got me fallin', baby
On top of that, I can hear your body callin', baby
In the Impala, so you know I'm boss ballin', baby
Steady crawlin', and the motor ain't stallin', baby
It's all gravy
On sight, you hooked me
When you spoke, you shook me
First impressions be a trip, and you immediately took me
I'm far from a rookie; star status of course
You the glass on the blaze, driving me like a torch
That's why I want you by my side, so I can flaunt you
You don't want a square
You want a thug nigga, don't you?
Let's bend us a corner
Scratch off in the night
And everything's gonna be alright
It's goin' down

It's real right now, I chill right now
Post up in Cali, in the hills right now
This is for my uncles, in the fields right now
Swanging the agony, in tears right now
It's bills right now, the first of the month
I got...right now, the poppers come
R.I.P. to pop, and I pop the trunk
You gon see me pop, if I cop the pump
Pump it and can't rap, got the pump
Cause the hard top 6-4, got the jump
Falls gator on six 12's, got the thump
Got gators in my closet, like I copped the swamp
I got the stunt, I'm a mother mother stunner
I might rock the gators, might rock the iguana
Shark tank in the wall, next to the purrana
Anaconda overweight, cause I feed him lasagna
But remember how I done it, cause I bring the pain
Stain in the brain, unlock, aim and rain
I can't complain, I control the budget
Promotion and market it, control the public
...Ain't broke, cause I roll a bucket

Every five minutes, talking bout you loving a nigga

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang

Or I could hit it from the back

Gotti we gone slide down swang wide
(Aight)
We gone ride gray or peanut butter buck eyed
Then we gone tip toe, so slow
We gone wreck the slab for the dirty third coast
Hell we gone post up, on the lot

Fifth drop screens lit, trunk pop
Stash spot, cash box, on vogue socks
Old shoes chrome laces giving haters blues
Banging what Screw, tell me what it do
Shocking and rocking club and the thug and staying true

I'ma do my thug thang, bang bang, chitty, chitty chop
With the stash unlocked, trunks staying hot
HA, green sticky la, deep in the shop
Cardiac kicking times

It's a party baby bounce, bounce sugar hit the flo'
I'm on the cool up in the fo', in the newest Gucci clothes
'Bout to drop it to the door, baguettes touching my navel
Body rocking kinda slutty, served out like label

We got, a stable full of pop
That dish the satellite and throw cable at the spot
Up on the table if it's able to get wet like a mop
And after we wreck the spot we can just ride

I'ma do it like this, I'ma do it like that
I can hit it from the front
(Or I could hit it from the back)
I'ma put it in your crack, see how you act

If you like it on your knees, you could have it for a snack
I'm a fat mack, in a handy bag with a snub with 'em
Broads like the way the fat mack do his thug thizzel
When I hit 'em with my love then I got 'em

I'ma hit it from the top, I'ma put it in a bottle
I'ma hit it from the back, the big black Casanova
I'ma put it in your head and I'ma set it on your shoulders
Syrup in the soda, talking bout the Barre

Foreigner car, feeling like a fallen star
'Bout the menage 'tois ain't that what that Pokey said
Never been scared, South side will leave you dead
And call me Big Meaty, call me Big Meaty

Don't come into my room if you ain't gone get freaky
Working on his boys, run through em like a tractor
Out the South side, Moe-Yo make the god damn adapter
I ain't even quit, I'm doing mighty fast

Sitting on glass, Moe-Yo showing my naked ass
It's the Moe-Yo freestyle I'm so throed
South side playa putting it down, cho-cho
Playas get chosen, like M O E

Put it in your middle yes the big body
Riding big tractor, I'm a money stacker
Out the South side Moe-Yo I'm kinda actor
Act a damn fool, on this damn tape
Like Po-Yo said got them hoes screaming rape

I'm still working the block, the block still bleeding
I'm still toting a glock, cause niggaz be scheming
I still want what you got, until then I ain't leaving
Battle scarred and hard headed, off of the streets
Was brought up in the hustle, the game supported me
Day to day grinding, gotta make sure we eat
Gotta make sure, we can step out on the block and be seen
Trying to let all them fiends know, I'm back on the scene
Got them power packs ready, Scottie throw down a beam
Undercover snitch niggaz, trying to break my dream up
Baby girl home alone, waiting for me to show up
Plus this morning, she told me she woke up throwing up
And I wanna lay, all I'm thinking bout is paper
It might be real early, in the morning when I come home
But best believe I'm coming home, pockets full of do'


Gonna hop up on niggaz, like quizzes in class
Sensei shife niggaz, and chizzle they masks
I ain't your hammer jamming, but I'm packing a glass
When I hit you I'ma split you, like that crack in your ass
Got elbows of weed, I'm bagging my grass
I got weight niggaz, think I need to take out the trash
4 flipping in the dash, one under the seat
Worm just laid the track, to what I done to the beat
Wet niggaz up everywhere, but under the feet
Plus I rock-a-bye niggaz, put 'em under a sheet
I'm trying to get freaky tonight, I'm in the mood
For a baby-faced girl, with a big girl mule
Jeans on the couch, underwear in the pool
Closer boys keep girls, square in the nude
A layer, the Earth's my turf so I'm a grown
When I'm finished with these streets, I'm gone into hiding

Pull it all night, as on the block stacking bread
Ducking police, and I'm stacking big heads
Never letting it go FED, while I grind it out
Shooting dice on my knees, making boys drop out
Got it popped at the spot, and a twat that's wide
I dig up between thighs, when they qualified
Naked showing hide, cotton up six figgas
Day for day on the block, watching thangs get bigger
Build an empire, the boss of the street game
Stack it up real pretty, I'm sicking all my change

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

Make sure (ya heard me)
Real niggas do real things so recognize real niggas in the game
I know you heard me
You say (ya heard me), I say (ya heard me), He say (ya heard me),
I know you heard me, she say (ya heard me), everybody like it when I say (ya heard me)

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
You got a lot of nerve
They talkin alot. I heard
Only round yo homies, when I'm round you know, not a word
I'm a heathen who fight for what he believes in, and I don't have no plans on leaving till I get even
Salt and pepper, nigga I'm seasoned for any reason
The day you want something with Juve, come on and see him
My G ain't gon allow me to lose, I'm busting shots as soon as you make a move
Oooh, I'm not a fan of fools that's why I got attitude
Runnin your mouth to me, I'm a try to get at a dude
Don't even have a tool, what is you tryna prove
Gon head and choose ya [? ], cause I'm a shoot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
N.O. on my fitted, I'm committed to my city
Anything I will commit it just to show that I'm committed
Commit it then get acquitted
Aye Gizzle let me get em, Gizzle let me get em
Eat em up and shit em (ha)
And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed... achoo
I came to get me and I got you
And I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married you could'nt do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble...

Big Pooh,"It's the barbershop, y'all know the rules
No fighting, no cussing, no cause and no Bloodin'
And sit yourself down and act like you got some sense

Now I step through the door in the flyest pair of Dunks
Quit lyin', you ain't seen these at Foot Locker, chump
And I ain't about to argue, shoot game with you punks
who don't know Air Jordan's from some Reebok Pumps
And out of twenty-three, thirteen was the hottest
If it's rare and it goes on your foot, then I got it
I'm that undefeated off of Brayer playin modest
While you runnin' up to eBay to empty out your pockets

Sock it, in the mouth if you don't wanna get clowned on
Metro-actin' cats gettin' frowned on, we sound on
everything from ball to y'alls women
Ballers up in here and they braggin' how they livin'
'Til they car get pulled, still at home with they mommy
Changin' faces, Bull City, there's where you find me
Gettin' a low-down from the nigga internet
You ain't done with my haircut, yet! I swear to God

[Chorus: x2]
Now if your fade is as tight as we is on the mic
Just got your whip clean and your kicks on tight
'Bout to pull the fliest chick you ever pulled in your life
Then you doin' what we doin' and you doin' it right

Hey yo Murs, it ain't all about a cut to me
Wanna go somewhere, catch some comedy
and get the low-down on the drama, B
This lil' dude showin out, ""Who his mama be?!""
It's a lotta trash-talk ""I dress better than him""
""Look better than them, you ain't got no style!""
Keep the pagers goin wild with my new-new joints
Caught a glimpse in the mirror, can't keep me on point

Finally made it to Midtown, walked in the Legend's Isle
Got one waitin', so I gotta go second
Checkin' it with Quan, cran and Goose
C-2 got his son in the shop runnin' loose
to set the slang straight, ya girl is ya cape
and if she's blowin' you out, then you gotta set her straight
Now everybody hate to wait, but it's so much fun
A buncha dudes chillin', no beef, no guns

Now my barber named Lester, he from the N-O
Best fades in LA if you, didn't know
Tighter than Jamie, in the Kanye video
Still freestyle and gettin' Gs' when I rip a show
Especially when it's in the scope, you know I'm gettin' low
Shout out to all my playas that be chillin' in the Mo'
Slim, you don't want it with him
Peel ya cap back to the fat meet with this pen

I been, in the chair, four bucks and some change
Can't keep takin' breaks, 'cause he wanna go eat
Then he start takin' breaks, 'cause he wanna go speak
I shoulda known better coulda went over to T, but
It's all gravy bread, put the money in his hand
Right now, got me cut like a new man
Caught up on my jokes, fashion to folks
who I ain't seen since the last time we spoke

(YEAH) Hey yo, 9th man, me and Murs we was in the Circuit City the other day, man
An, and-and then took me back to the barbershop
'cause I ask ya boy, I said ""Yo man, is Chris-Chris ? here today, man? He workin'?
And y'know what this dude told me man?
You, you-you know what this dude told me, 9th? (What?!)
He was like, he was like, ""Naw man, to-the-Canvas ain't here today""

For even Jesus Christ forsake my soul
Please tell me the price to pay to make it home
Take control, I'm makin' doe, but not enough to blow
J O's, they lust my flows, but A-yo
I don't trust a soul, I know I need to
These evil streets will meet you
Halfway than eat you, alive
Tryin' to survive illegal, I leave you lost
Bounce you on the cross, rip you like a horse
Sacrife your life to a higher force
Than I stomp your corpse, it's the Bronx of course
Recognize the acsent, one of the last livin' still in action
General assassin', catchin' an erect, blastin' any tech
Smashin' any chest, passin' any test
Charles Manson in the flesh, any last requests
Before ya meet your maker, so would your reaper wake up
Shakin' up a storm, like Anita Baker
I'll take ya straight to hell and fill your heart with maden
Incarnate your fate in Satan's firey lake
Than I lock the gate, make no mistake
The Shit Is as Real as Joe, we follow the killers code
One becomes the you, tell me, where do you go?
Nowhere to run, hide or find you
In silence you scream and even if you kill me
I'll still be in your fuckin' dreams

You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death, won't even talk that East and West crap
Watch the left rack, It ain't where you're from it's where's your gat

You made a grave mistake, shouldn't of come here
You changed your fate, your brains will make a debut on the table
When I raise the stakes, the pain is great
But only for a second, is starts strong your lesson
Is when your restin'
The Armaggedon set in, left him with so much stress (B.S.)
Left him with no regrets (yes)
Welcome to hell son, the threshold of death
Face the serpent, I blaze the person
You get laced for certain
Even Jakes don't trace the work
So close the curtain, I'm hurtin', head severely
Really tryin' to bring the pain
There's nothing more satisfying
Then when you cryin' screamin' my name
It's not a game, it's Purple Rain
Floods and blood stains, Big Puns my thugs name
Bustin' my gun, that's my love thang
Slit the jug vein, snatch your Atam's apple
John Madden tackle your corpse
Then hoist it on the cross at the Taben Ackle
That'll have to hurt, I'll work your body till it burst
The curse of Viva, slangin' brujeria first
I'm worse than anything you ever been through
Sick in the head and mental, essentially meant to be so ?
When you awaken, your manhood will be taken
Faken like you Satan, when I'm the rhymin' abomination

Be advised people, we recognized who lies
It's all in the eyes chico
We read 'em and see 'em for what they are
Thieves in undercover cars, takin' my picture like I'm a fuckin' star
I'm up to par, my game is in a smash
Stash a million in the stash

Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
Give me the mini shottie, I body a nigga for a penny probably
I'm obligated to anything, if it's crime related
If it shine I'll take it, sill in my prime and I finally made it
I hate the fact that I'm the last addition
Probably stash magician, could of went to college and been a mathematician
Bad decisions kept me out the game
Now I'm strictly out for cream, doin' things to fiends
I doubt you'll ever dream, my teams the meanest thing you ever seen
Measured by the heavens King, down to the devls mesimean
I never scream so loud, I'm proud to be alive
Most heads died by 25, or catch a quick 3 to 5
So be advised, the streets is full of surprises
It's not what crews the livest, when the survivors who's the wisest

You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk

I called my Son he told me chill he'd be over with twenty
Punny what's the deal, niggas want to kill me
He said it's real, they jealous and tired of seein' me Willie silly
Had more to claim, niggas throwin shit in the game
Gave my wife some pictures with me and bitches runnin' the train

Rock bottom struck and threw my world off it's axis
Boomerang, plan to come back like Bronx rap
Storm like the Redcoats through anything in my path
First you shine like sterling, then you broke like Rick and Burley

Now should I slit my wrists, go for it all or call it quits
Picture me taking my life, leaving my wife and my daughter shit
Wish I could slip back, and switch the memories
Lift the felonies from my record I respected my enemies
Live like the Kennedy's, above the law, fuck 'em all
I'm coming for the rich thieving 'em even if I wasn't poor
I seen it all like I said before
The streets are for men at war and the beasts are the predators
I shed it all first ?and beat a prob every source?
Of course, I bury any adversary tryin' to floss
Just because, the reason I leave 'em lost in the sauce
Teein' off like we up North just for bein soft
A beaten horse like a slave gettin' minimum wage
Fillin the gauge, front page, these are the last days
Cash pays, and rules, the root of all evil
Shootin' amigos for lootin' perrico pollutin' our people
Movin' kilos like it's all good, through every ghetto
I ain't judgin', but buggin how we floss so many levels
The devil's got us by the balls, that's why the law allows
The drugs to overflood, knowin' we gonna buy it all
It's time to call a world order where every girl's your daughter
And priceless as ices and pearls fresh out the water
I'm gonna get mine, either from crime, or through the bible
Whichever way, you better pay, I'm feelin' suicidal

Big Punisher,"It's mine, it's all mine you understand?
At least me and my peoples, can you dig that?
21st century thought I'd never see it
Right around the corner, baby ours for the taking

Yo, I've seen child blossom to man
Some withered and turned to murderers
Led astray by the liars death glorifiers observin' us
Watching us close, marking our toast [unverified]

Purposely overtaxin' the earnings
Nervous, burning down the churches
They're scared of us, rather beware than dare to trust
Always in jail, million dollar bail, left there to rust

Let's call in order, give ourselves a chance to enhance broader
Advance to where minorities are the majority voter
Holdin' my own, I'm livin' alone in this cold world
My sister just bought a home without a loan, you go girl

She's an exception, some people can leap to the impression
See, me myself, I start flippin' and fall victim to deep depression
I'm stressin' the issue here, so we can cross the fiscal year
Tired of gettin' fired and hired as a pistol-eer

There's no longevity living off negativity
Fuck it, I'd rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery
That's how the city be, everybody gettin they hustle on
Judge singin' death penalty like it's his favorite fuckin' song
Word is bond, takin' my life you know they lovin' it
God 'F' the government and it's fuckin' capital punishment

Capital punishment, given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin' with
Can't live alone, watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin' the llello for life, the rightful heir to the throne

We come from Kings and Queens, people with dreams
Gods and Earths
For what it's worth we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First it's turnin' tables, open our own labels
Disable the Republicans, then reverse capital punishment

I've seen it all up close, shit out the movies you'd be buggin'
My cousin JuJe, barely a juve', lost it and turned on the oven
He wasn't playin', blew out the flame and started inhalin'
Barin' a secret too deep to keep on the street for sharin'

Wearin' the virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency
Dishin' his dick in every thick promiscuous fish in the sea
Listen to me, shit is rough in the ghetto
You bluff, blow your head off, fuck a snuff, we bust lead off

Get off your high horse, or die off like an extinction
Boriquans are like Mohican's, 'The Last of the Po' Ricans'
We need some unity, fuck all the jeeps and jewelry
The maturity, keeps me six feet, above obscurity

The streets are deadly and everybody's a desperado
I guess the motto we promise to let you homage in death your motto
Like Zorro, I mark my territory with a symbol
Not with a Z, but a P, 'cause Punishment's what I resemble

I lend you this if it expands yours, for you and yours
A real man can't fall, he stands tall
The Man's claws are diggin' in my back, I'm tryin' to hit him back
Time to counteract, where my niggaz at?

Capital punishment, given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin' with
Can't live alone, watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin' the llello for life, the rightful heir to the throne

We come from Kings and Queens, people with dreams
Gods and Earths
For what it's worth, we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First it's turnin' tables, open our own labels
Disable the Republicans, then reverse capital punishment

You like that, it's Pun and Prospect
We hold nines, own more treasure than gold mines, makin' progress
With Don Juan's, there's rules to be made, crews to be sprayed
Dues to be paid, nuttin' y'all can do to behave

We laid in the slums, made a cake out of crumbs
Even though the government, tryin to take out our sons
Rudy Gulliani trying to blind me, but I see reality
Was raised with the street mentality

My strategy's why my battery never die
The ghetto kept me wise, so I would never fall to the lies
It's no surprise, but do or die if you want the glamour
Yeah, I want the glamour, laid up with cheese and trees in Atlanta

While Cubans smoked out like Ronald Isley with Havanas
The hammer in the palm, never shaky, calm handlers
This renegade blow through barricades like grenades
I turn the sun to shade, then the night back to day

Like the twenty-four hour rotation
I know the location, it's just a little information
From the Squad, bringing the Terror for the nine-era
And let it rain on your fine leather, nigga, what?
",Capital Punishment,1998
Big Punisher,"Ay-yo I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap like Adam & Eve from the garden
I'm carvin' my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the ""BP"" shine off the board head
Reverse that, I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
'cause he ain't worth jack
Hit 'em with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back, watch the earth crack
Hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggaz be swearin' I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King, I be rapping and tongue's packing
The ones, magnums, cannons and gatling guns
It's Big Pun! The one and only son of Tony, Montana
You ain't promised manana in the rotten manzana
C'mon-pana we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana snake bite anaconda
I'm in Ivana with wine-a, try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin' I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma, and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kinda gramma

[Chorus]
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination 
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination 

I'm pure adrenaline, uncut, straight to your gut, medicine
Raw cure for pain I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain, I'll explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire, I'm-a make it burn!
Higher and hotter than lava this scholar
Is 'bout just as smart as MacGyver
To put honor inside the heart of a lion
Revolved in a life of crime (crime!)
Fuck it I like the shine (shine!)
Up in the white and lime (lime!) 
Comes with the pipe design
Plushed out! (No doubt!) Both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach, get the fuck out!
Take a hike, we can even battle to make it right
Go 'head lace the mic, you finished? Say good night
Head to head in the street, I'll leave you dead in your feet
Settlin' beef, I'll even let you rhyme to the Benjamin beat
But it won't matter, you dreams still gon' shatter
It's a long ladder to climb and mine is on the stagger
So get outta town, 'fore I hit you
With the loudest sound you ever heard
Desert bird player you outta bounds

[Chorus: x3]

You need the Pun to dis you if your whole steez is unofficial
I'll come and get you and let the desert eez tongue kiss you
With one pistol and two clips, I'll make your crew do flips
Like acrobatics, I'm charismatic, my gat is magic
It makes rappers disappear, whisper in your ear
Crystal clear, come here, let me kiss your tears
Everything you fear is here, you ain't got to search further
The first murder's the worst now I thirst further for reverse birth
Every verse hurts, every curse word's already more offending 
Than Eddie Murph's worst
I thirst for blood like a vampire, any man claimin' his game's tighter
Is a god damn liar
I set 'em on fire, retire your train of thought
Drain a quart of blood out your brain and leave you insane in the dark
The king of New York! Lays his crown in the Boogie Down
And sprays the town, with a Mac hoodied down
I'm no joke! (Yuh!) I soak your face with a sweeper
Dying disgrace, I'll face your death through the speaker

Grab his fam, and run the train on his granddaughter
Nah chill, that's too ill, for real I'd rather kill somethin'
Here's the deal, we shatter his grill, and drill fuck him
Oral torture, no doubt, the shit is holocaust
In two minutes tops he's guaranteed to cap and give up all the morsels
It's settled, blitt up, put on your metal, foot on the pedal
We got a half hour before the plan sours like Amaretto
Far from the ghetto, a rebel of chance, the devil in pants
Out for the fast cash, level advance
Takin' a chance, I've only got one my hundred shot
Tommy shotguns my judge jury and Johnny Cochran

Movin' on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash a niggas shit like a crash dumy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin' laced
Look at my face and I'ma shoot the place

Aye yo the plot thickens, I'm pickin' the locks in the back entrance
Payin' attention, not tryin' to get knocked and catch a fat sentence
Not to mention these kids is mafioso with lots of dough so
They got poco lock with the down to rock Morocco choke hold (oh oh)
Their security system's linear laser protection
No sweat, I brought the miniature mirrors for reflectin
Inspectin' the vault, for weapons assault, second of course
It's poisonous rays, boiled and baked in epsom salt
Rep in New York is the cat burglar, the fat murderer
Slippin' the clip in the Mac, inserterer
Hurtin' your pockets, droppin' your stock to zero profit
Holding heroes hostage and mansions for ransom like DeNiro mob flicks
Back to the top again, hand the grand prize
The safe flies open, the shining was blinding my eyes
I cracked the code, enough ice to make you laugh at gold
Passed the dough to Cuban started movin' for the back real slow
That's when I heard the sirens hopin' that my ears was lyin'
Knew we was dyin' when I saw the guard we tortured cryin'
Pointing at the building screamin', ""I can see them, kill 'em!""
Snipers was willing but couldn't, there's too many civilians
Still inside nowhere to hide nowhere to run
Cuban said, ""Fuck it, we die, we die busting our guns""

[Chorus: x2]

Aye yo it's time to pay, and I ain't trying to give my shine away
Let's show these pigs how much we give a fuck about a brighter day
I cocked the Eagle, Cuban drew the Glock it was diesel
Said, ""See you in Hell coppers"" and started poppin' like it was legal
We need a plan, if we can make it to the van
Missile launchers there with the grenade pistol I bought from Uncle Dan
Me and my man are runnin' out of ammo, I got about a handful
Of Black Rhino's and two Rambles strapped to my ankles
I trampled over one of the bodies, I grabbed the steel
Threw the bitch over my shoulder and used her butt as a shield
I filled the clip with the little bit of bullets remaining
Cuban said, ""Move your fat ass faster motherfucker they gaining""
I gave him the case, told him, ""Go ahead save yourself
Blaze a L in my memory, tell the family I gave 'em Hell""

Platinum status, yeah, what up, what up?

Yo, I plan to live a life a-glamour
Like my man Tony Montana
Stand and pose in front of cameras
With my golden silk pajamas on
Smoking havanas, drinking Don P
Thinking beyond deeper than Ghandi, while I'm in the Diamante
Counting my G's, I'm out to be a millionaire
Dipped in gear, flickin' hundred dollar bills in the air
Oh yeah, Cuban Link is into getting benjamins
'Cause if doesn't make dollars, then it doesn't make sense
I represent, I'm in to be the king of New York
Went from living in tenements to up in house resorts
I'm the latino, that'll take you to war like Al Pacino
Even De Niro know not to gamble in my casino
Vino wanna rock, slaps, to dinners with mobsters

Sitting on top of the world like the sun
A living legend from the Bronx, second to none, unless it's Pun

Players who ain't half as nice swear to, but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life

Ripped off from the Infiniti
Dump the body an' the shottie down the lake, leaving no identity
Just the memory, a casualty as I casually make move on my rivalries
All eyes I be, on the quest for loot
Pushing a Lexus coupe, to pursuit them troops, against the big-joker
Sipping alimoca, playing poker with some chocha
Heard an approacher, must be fam', but damn I had to smoke Pun
(Get the motherfucking gun)
Since ? become the one wanted for a lump sum of G's
Dirty rats pack gats for cheese
Bullets of breeze at light speed
Taking your pretty wife life and sacrificing your seeds
Indeed, we let him bleed for 50 G's
Ship his body to the states, filled with 50 keys
Please, no remorse for your two face
Inside a symbol, my life throughout the motherfucking suitcase
You about to take who's place? Not Seis
Your body'll be laced, and left without a trace

The leader, Terror Squad cleaner
Leave your family crying for you like Argentina, mira
Sweet dreamer like Nas, my entourage is thick
Camouflaging this bitch, so God forbid you start some shit
My squad's equipped with an arsenal of ammunition
Hollow tips an', cop killers with the ?
Accounts in Switzerland for rainy days
Nigga I'm staying paid, you's a joke
Always broke with your lazy ways
Anyway, back to the subject, in the bub-Lex
In the back seat, having rough sex
I love this glamorous life I live, having the ice and shit
Think twice, I give Christ your kids
I live life for gifts, keep the five burning while the tires turning
I blaze an L and seek a higher learning
Kaiser's learnin' everything illegally
We could de friend for years, cross me once that's theivity

Yo, the dough, the rap, the audience, party heavy till the 40's in
Ill like the Yakuza run the Orient
Take all the rent, and no man wept the path his daughter went
Dicks with the fallopian, wide as auditorium
She fuck for dough for opium, prostitute emporium
500 Benz, 500 friends sell Cambodian
8's cup of vodka, four cup of juice for sodium
Money, money, sweet as the smell of magnolia
It's get you down, but you spitting image of Appalonia
Now how can I go broke, pumping twenties of coke
Plus songs I wrote, milkin' dumb honeys I poke
The young blood sat on the bench in Vant Courtland, slingin'
Singing how he trying to get cash for Jordans
Another cat toss his Beamer to get the insurance
Currency's gonna murder me, it's never enough
Breakin' my ass gettin' it, just as fast as I spend the stuff
Calling Uncle Sam's bluff dun, taxes don't bite us, bite us

The glamour life, this life I live is trife as shit
Least my wife and kid got somewhere nice to live
I used to live in the gutter, me and my mother
Now she's fifty years old, pushing a hummer
The glamour life, hand me a knife I'll slice and dice 
Mini-mize, send them to Christ in the after life
Pass the mic down the line, let them hear it 
Let them fear it, send it screaming to the Holy Spirit

Why are we waiting in 
This intermission?

I dunno nigga I heard 
That I had to tell the peeps listening to get some

Big Punisher,"Aye yo I'm hard to talk to, if you live I probably thought you stalked you
Where you walked to at night, caught you then tried to extort you
New York niggas is trigger happy, got Pataki scared
This town ain't big enough for both of us and I ain't goin' nowhere
There it is, plain and simple like Jigga my game is mental
While slow niggas better know I blow their brains out they temples
I'm into black magical torture romantic dramatical author
Compatible with the average New Yorker
A fast talker, like Tony when gas whores I'm the masked enforcer
Out for the cash and the cho-cha
Smash the coca, bottle it up watch the fiends gobble it up
If I roll up, you do what? Swallow the stuff
I don't give a fuck anymore, I'm only twenty-four years old
And I've already broken every law
I'm horror core, this is for the heads

Hey yo my shit's the truth, one fifty proof no question
Parental discretion advised, keep out the eyes of the youth
It's too explicit, bullshit! I challenge the statistics
Violence existed before our music was even suggested
Arrested on sight, it's like there's no rights
That's why I rhyme so aggressive and bring every message to life
I fight the power, spite the power the 90 percent
Keep 10 and feed Twin half for personal reasons
The seasons change  things re-arrange, but I stay the same
Play the game, for the wealth, until I've made myself a name
So blame it all on the gangster rapper, thanks to Joey Crack
For the chance to do it my way like Frank Sinatra
I ain't a actor so it's all facts, strictly raw rap
Totally intended for yours dressed in all black
With the ski mask, or the pantyhose makin' cameos
In liquor store cameras with the twin Calico's

[Chorus: x2]

So forget the boom, one look, you shook, you know I'm stickin' you
Liftin' you off the ground, look down, that's where I'm puttin' you
Look in my eyes and remember me, how does it feel mentally
Havin' the enemy be the last thing you ever see?
The recipe is death and I'm the chef, fricaseein' your flesh
Be my guest, but I ain't cleanin' the mess
Me and TS we testin' niggas faith, just to see they face
Expression when destined to states, that death be in the case
I'm in the state of grace, in the hated race, by the pagan face
Couldn't fight us, made a virus, gave us AIDS
I paint the wake 'cause they ain't get me yet, wet me
Or reflect me yet, I know they comin' they just tryin to let me sweat
I wreck it like when I was just a boy, eatin Chips Ahoy!
Wasn't allowed to raise my voice, now I'm makin' noise
No more toys, strictly Mac's and missiles, shorties with forties
Packin pistols catchin bodies make sure we'll get you
So they say, I pray there's a better way
My kids don't do as I do, they do as I say, 'cause daddy don't play

[Chorus: x2]

Word is bond
One thing about MC's is that we don't conceal the truth
We present real pictures about the positive and the negative
So don't blame the hip-hop 
When your seed is learnin' the real life from us
Do your duty at home and raise your child in the house parents 
You don't do your job

Behavin' like a money hungry hooker, funny how the money took her 
From a average honey to a stunning looker 
I look back and reminisce how we used to kiss 
And smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ' 
She got too big for her britches but The Britch is Over 
Not the one in Queens I mean the one she dreamin' wasn't sober 
Told her how I felt, gassed me when she cried for help 
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fuckin' belt 
I felt stupid Cupid struck me with a poison arrow 
Shoulda drowned ya when I found ya crushin' in my boy's Camaro 
I didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead 
You robbed me of my honor, you ain't shit like my mother said

Come back come back come back come back to me, Punisher 
Punish me, ah I've been so bad, so bad 
Won't you come back?

Nah baby, I'm not gon' be able to do it, you blew it 
Threw it all the way cause you was stupid, girl why'd you do it? 
I mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby 
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me 
It's hard maybe we can make amends, be friends 
But we're only hurtin all of us for certain by forsakin' him 
Just take it in, don't even say a word, observe 
The way you were, preserve, these words so you won't play the herb 
Ever again, never pretend that he doesn't have a father 
I'm always there and you don't wanna bother 
I honor my word on my father's grave, guide him through his hardest age 
So he can thrive and survive in these modern days 
I wanna raise my little man but you keep resistin' 
I'm insistin' you chill for real before you come up missin'
Listen, I don't wanna fight I'd rather do what's right 
A boy needs a father that's the most important part of his life

Feathered wings, and rings with emeralds right out of Geraldine's

At Monty Frask, givin' the next nigga my punani 
You want me back cause he hit it wrong, now you wanna get it on 
With the Long Don, word bond my shit is strong (come back) 
Girl don't even start again, I beg your pardon 
And get your hands off my six button Cardigan 
This ain't no love lost between us far as I'm concerned 
Please leave, cut that busted weave I've been dyin' to burn 
Go buy a perm, try and earn some respect 
It's better to have loved and lost than live with regret

I want you to

Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats

That tackles you back and shackles and laughs at you
That's the mathematical madness I'm on, the savage, the strong
The marriage, a bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on as if Picasso laced you
There's lotsa hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school, that's why I have to debate you
My raps are like Capel, slashin' your face, you
That's how a master degrades you
I'm battlin' Jesus (hay-soos) if he passes through my label
I'm snatchin' his halo

Occasionally as I focus on my next opus

Remember me, the one you got your rhyme style from? 
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned 
Remember P, the one you got your rhyme style from? .

Yo it's the P  

Yo, disperse from off this
Who the culprits 
That claim to be the newest, rappin' bullshit 
My rhymes, get Ruger endorsements, my song boost 
And the tech sales through the ceiling,
Let's talk with guns 

Convo til the po-lice come 
Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match 
First max like it's Hamburger Hill for real 
It's Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on, my outfit 

Stuck on some wild out shit, all about it 
We move gambit, through the overcrowded 
Forthwith, pull out long fifths, extended clips 
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc

There's no escape from straight from the brain come the great one 
My blade swung, decapitate your snake head 
Slit your snake tongue, make one false maneuver you a mystery... 

Unsolved, the mob that we robbed's automatically involved 
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs 
Rock turtledove bowery suits and purple gloves 
Me and you can have some fun 

Make it a blast, you couldn't take the impact 
With steel shoulder pads
Blood for blood 
Veteran, covered in mud 
Wounded in the midst of war 
Still tradin' slugs gettin' major love 

Way above you newcomers, I come thunderin' 
With the heat of two summers when I enter the zone 
Move mountains with the presence alone 
Before the words rip through the microphone
Chrome dipped lyrics are known to split stone
You private eyes home in 
But can't seem to clone

I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned 
Remember Pun, I snatched away the moon and blew away the sun 
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned 
Remember Pun, the one with over a thousand guns 

Yo, Big Punisher's ready 
Prodigy, Deck and me, QB and Bronx trilogy 
Lyrically hazardous for your wealth
Swing on your world's piece 

Foil your plans, boil your grams, take a shine 
Fold all your hands, spoil your mans, make him mine 
Take all you made, call you gay on Hot 97 
Drop by your dwellin' got the weapon right behind your melon 

Ain't no tellin' when the bullet's behind the trigger 
I do it to live niggaz and Pulitzer Prize winners 
You wouldn't survive nigga, if I chose you 
Froze you from ear to ear, showin' your whole vocal 

Who told you
You could roll through
My lyrics practically rose you 
From the grave, like the Crow's do
 
Told you a long time ago, don't ever fuck me 
Cause if I leave you half dead consider yourself very lucky
Very ugly from the face up, leave you laced up

Big Punisher,"Ready for war Joe, how you wanna blow they spot
I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer, the Punisher's ready
Meet me at Vito's with Noodles, we'll do this dude while he's slurping spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fucking floor, Joey Crack
Buck em all if they move, Noodles shoot that fucking whore
Dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know
That we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddly

It'll be a cold day in hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake for real I wouldn't hesitate to kill
I'm still the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake, smack you then I whack you with my snub trey-eight

I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children
Like Amityville I drill the nerves in your cavity filling
Insanity's building a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealing
A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support

I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves
My brother from another mother sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me, one of the best -- might be
Even better leaving niggas kneeling on they right knee

Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture
You small change, I'm blowing out your brains getting richer

Hit you with the Mac, smack your bitch, nigga what?
You getting stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck!

Truck jewels, cruising in the Land, pumping ""Cash Rules""
Last crew to want it caught a hundred trying to pass through

That's true (So who the next to get it?)
TS the best that did it (Get it off your chest kid admit it and it's)

Yeah, and you don't stop!
(Twenty shot Glock with the cop killers fill 'em to the top)
Yeah, and you don't stop!

Yeah, and you don't stop!
(We'll make it hot nigga, what bring it I blow your whole spot
Yeah, and you don't stop!
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop

Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make em eat dirt
Take em feet first through the morgue, then lodge 'em in the deep earth
The street's cursed, the first amendment's culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights, tonight I hold my rosary tight as I can
I'm one man against the world, just me and my girl
Black Pearl Latina mas fina but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it

Creep with me, as I cruise in my Beemer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kicking ass as I blast off heat, and
You never see me talk to police, though
You should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat, and I'll leave you right there
So beware it's rare that niggas want beef, Big Pun speak
And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets

Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashing catching niggas while they sleeping
No relaxing, keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three techses in the Jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars
Full-a-clips mob, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock Down

We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine
Every time plus I'm the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk, all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk, I prey like the Predator
Whoever want it, go and get it set it baby and I'mma bury ya
So remember the Squad that I'm repping
I fill a clip of my weapon and Punish niggas 'til it's armaggedeon

Yeah, and you don't stop!
(Twenty shot Glock with the cop killers fill 'em to the top)
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Joey cracks the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked)

Murder game, I leave no evidence credentials
Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how you I used to pack a number two pencil
Stabbin students, grabbin' teachers, Catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cuttin' class, passin' my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label to earn
Like that nigga said in ""Dead Presidents"", money to burn
Queensbridge, pay homage, respect Nas is the vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes, niggaz is dissin' that
I'm just the best, puttin' all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings the blood ""los sangres"", blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison

My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try ""Now you know you done fucked up right?""
Hah, you ain't got no wins in my casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa
I hate a actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial college material insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter you shitter shatter, I'm the kid
Out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter

And spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim
Cause y'all misdemeanor niggas can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only cause I know that fagots respect pressure

The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God, stackin' up joints, rack em like Footlocker

Shit is so real I'm even back and forth to court now
We all struggle in the jungle for a bundle
Awaitin' the day, 'til the whole earth crumble

When cats blow four pounds see trial nobody be around
Just the other day my brother Kwan got bagged
Three half ounces, three nickel bags in his ass

To lamp like my cousin Thrash, with mad G's in his stash

That's how I know who to trust
That's how I know for who to bust

To shoot as many a clan concerned from Clue to Clutch
Who the fuck said that color matter? Your own brother 
Blacker than black'll leave you in the gutter splattered
It's automatic now with all the static

Only a coward or a faggot hides his flowers in the attic
I keep em close, to shine to blossom, try to floss em
Cried every time I lost one, fake niggaz come a dime a dozen
That's why I'm buggin, shorties is luggin heavy metal

Just call me a rebel cause I'ma keep reppin for every ghetto
For better or worse, up in the Jetta it hurts
I'ma keep reppin my niggaz til I'm dead in the earth
I'm settin the first, if niggaz want it we can three pound rock
Give me a call, you know the Big Pun'll be down

[Chorus]

[Rah Sun]
All decisions is made, we made it past twelveth grade
Health, wealth in the shade - whole team is paid
Even all the green beret's keep shit locked
More cheddar than Fort Knox, think not, we tryin to own spots

Yachts, cribs by the water, blessing
My little sons and my future daughter, I oughta
To everybody that didn't have faith, _I'll Be Missing You_
Like Biggie, for tryin to shit on no fair one's committee

From sun-up to sundown, the glock up to glock down
Call my name! I'll be around..
You know the fams'll be there

I'm in a six wit double dimes and a couple of nines

Me and tracks back to back, circle the block a couple of times
And we searchin' for this n**** to try
I'm bubblin' mine
If we don't get him now then we will in due time

I bust enough shots to kill him two times, I do crimes
I get caught then my mind's defendin my son's rhymes
'Cause my thoughts stay runnin like thugs from one-time
I been through it under the influence

Bustin' off I'm runnin' into it
See me say he didn't do it
Put the nine to his mind and blew it
'Cause some times I lose it give me a gun and I'll abuse it

Puffin with my family, my b****, my money or my music
Makin' killas say he's too sick when he do s***
But I'm on some new s***, and it's too late the fuse lit
I treat my nine like a new b****

After puffin some trees I'll probably be abductin' your niece
Murderin' beats since the days of permanent crease
Been around the block seen grams converted to keys

Aah Cartagena, breaks hearts in Argentine
My misses slugs to love me, my wife act like Anita
Terror Squad'll die for the cause even if it means blowin' up things
And takin' over City Hall

My s*** is raw straight from the Panama shores
If the feds can't catch me then they make up a law
Can't take it no more, n****s is fake to the core
My state pen friends'll leave you broken negative nore

Far from a devil, I'm God I mean I'm Gunz
And I shine like sun, rhyme like none, find my gun

Tellin' people don't play that, you gotta play this
Tellin' school you ain't sayin that, you gotta say this
You can't wear that, you gotta wear this
Well hear this, I'll go in yo chest and leave you earless, fearless

The only thing between us if you stop my cream
Is a glock nineteen, and I'm a pop like steam
Tryin' to stop me and mine from eatin' you need a doctor
With a hundred gauze pads n**** to stop you from leakin'

And a prayer from the deacon as you weaken
And words from the Funkmaster Flex dogs shouldn't have been reachin'

I'ma a bubble-head, I never listen to nothing my mother said 
Ay yo I hold niggas ransom for money 
Like Johnny handsome 
Been sonning niggas for so long 
I think I got a grandson 
My passion is money, a stash and a honey 
That won't ask questions but will blast anybody 
That's my kind of girl, kinda of world I want to live in 
Not a cell or a prison or in hell's armageddon 
Just a little ghetto 
Where my niggas control the middle 
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little 

Yo, yo been in rich places, sick places 
Seen my story on six thousand six hundred and sixty six pages 
Wages, I wrote six aces 
And at the same dice games, I caught six cases 
All over big faces, now it's tipped laces 
Ready to dig faces, but the bang it ain't 
Bitch spaces, niggas loading up they rib cages 
Cats like to rip places 
Bloody lip tastes, but the Cam is in big races? 
But I stay in import the pig places 
But the world know the girl though 
I fuck her off a furlough 
She'll be up, hook me up 
All your sales could be luck 
Only question for these ducks is 
Baby girl can we fuck 
You the type that need a wife 
Thought L-o-x told y'all the key to life

Fuck around, I spray around 
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it

Niggas try to smoke me out, mope me out 
'cause the rims on my new joint be poking out 
I'm about to have no feelings 
Shit is deep, do they dance with the devil when they sleep 
I wake up gripping the air, wishing the hit 
Shit that they kick in ya ear 
When your soul be drifting in air 
My gift is half-rotten when I spit it tears 
That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry 
And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die 
They say you get what you ask for, so get it 'cause you asked for it 
If a nigga ain't a thief, then he better have the cash for it

We wilin' wilin' sling back his body found
Washed up on Coney Island
When I rolled up  this niggas heart slowed up
That killa froze up, when I pulled up jumped out with the pump-pump
Thirty-two shots and ducked out
So look out
Left that cat for dead his body smoked out
Cause when I fall y'all killas a kill me kid
I'm goin' all out
Lifes a bitch, fuck it, got the gun bust it
Game play, gotta play by the rules or your own cannot be trusted
Don't try to test, abide your chest, put five inside your vest
Have you layin' with a dead rest
Shoulda known when you was lookin' in the eyes a death
And I swore forgiveness when I did this
There was not no witness but he should understand
Cause even God got a shit list

Beat downs anonymous
I spit like a shiny silver nanabus
Niggas fond of us
We the kind that rush, those that hold back
Takin' your whole stack
Grimy street cats
Niggas bald head like Kojak
Go gat for gat

Or cut black dust
Makin' your whole fuckin' stove crack

Had you thinkin' shits sweet
Now you up shit's creek
Cause your shits weak
How mich is your life worth to someone important
Cause I be extortin'
Kidnap for ransom is some shit you don't want to get caught in
From back in the days of Gordon
Niggas was gettin' robbed
The guy from Rikers Height stayed on his job
With his own little mob
Was it worth goin' back to the Earth so soon
Worth makin' my shit go boom
To your own doom, from the graveyards
Till there's no room
Fuck you know about a pine box
Money goin' out with nine Glocks
On top of that same nigga when they pull with they nine shots
Feel like killin' for your crew
I ain't gon' rest
It gonna take a whole lot to put up your best
Then watch your loins spill out your vest
You best get on some act your age shit
You a little kid
That run for faces
More niggas get killed like that

Whether the hip-hop type, country rapper, or big wheel

I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the hen rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. hear what I say y'all?
O.k. y'all. ask aj y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like stacy, damn, she was eatin' tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up desert storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the don fall
But I'll come inside the tunnel, nigga, wit pope john paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on street soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep two bones and two phones in each rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to lorey actins, but I get buck wild like corey jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin nicholi nigga, like volkof
Know what I mean yo? notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like el nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta lex coupe
With jimmy jones right next to me in the benz truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll wit god, the squad and ts
Out wit the b.s
We platinum, they even doubted jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around wit gold by the pound
Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit

Now it's a symphony
Without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without tiffany
N-o-r-e, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the wip on any street
I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' nore lay pretty low
But them niggas ishomos like the maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of chico debarge
Thugged out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thousandon my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you ??
Motherfucker clueminati 98'

Once I put the blows, get your clothes, cause you got to go

Lets unite the city and step to the world as a weapon
Cause everybody's checkin for Pun second to none
Cause Latins going platinum was destined to come
The inevitable, heavenly better than whatever you do
We eligible, TS is incredibly credible
For the revenue we gettin you open with lyrical dope
And these breaths that are potent is like an injectional dose
And it never quits
Take it from TS's top terrorist

I was young, I wasn't always Big Pun
It wasn't always this fun, ayo I rose from the slums
I had to pay my due, lay a few
But I ain't sayin who, stayin' true to the game
No names, playin' it cool just me and the crew

The way you remembered me since the centipede
Harder, big blacker back in the seventies
Try to remember me from my aggressive will
The way I kept it real is more important than any record deal
I used to chill on da block with Cuban and Seis
I still do but now it's in the blue convertible eight fifty
My true niggas'll always be wit me
The shifty kiss me, tell me they miss me, then try to diss me
Cause I'm rispy crispy for life sixties the price
Another fifty for the Cuban twisted in ice
Niggas is sheist but I psych 'em out
Though they like to doubt I make em all believers once I let the Tyson out
Cause I can vouch for only a few only the crew
From the old school I consider loyally true
I morally grew from a fool to a scholar
Follow the rules on how to spot a plotta that's cool for a dolla
I wanna holla at my peeps that's reppin' the streets
Wrestlin the beast of chest restin' in peace
Blessin' my seeds and watchin' over us
Til I die I'll align the souls with mine and shine for all of us

Nothin' less than the best if the squad did it
Hard-headed niggas better beware and fear like God said it

I gave you fair warning, beware

Ay-yo I warned you, now all niggas could do is mourn you
I'm born to kill and still thrilled, I put it on you
There's no regrets, remorse, only results and loneliness
Only the strong survivors strive through life as warriors
All of us die, some of us kill, even massacred
Who want to try? Punisher will if you ask for it
I'm hazardous for your health and hell's your next stop
For real my shit's cocked the world has just stopped

I'm not the one you should be underestimatin'
Come test your fate an' I guarantee I'll be under investigation
You can't handle the whole, I'll slam you on your skull
Or we can go blow for blow like Evander and Bowe, ya never know
However tho' I still hold the title
When all my rivals the chance to dance who missed the homicidal
Hand on the bible I swear to defend my crown
I've been around since forever and never let it touch the ground
Don't fuck around and catch a rude awakenin'
My crew's basically waitin' patiently for you to move your patrons in
Then we'll surround you, form Desert Storm and pound you
Look around you, Terror Squad's everywhere like Soundview
The Boogie Down do it like nobody, who are we?
The foundation, you're facin' a whole army

I gave you fair warning, beware",Beware,1999

Love me a ghetto girl and everything she do to me

Pass 'em through the clique until everybody burn 'em out

Holding knives to you neck
All my nines and my techs
Shine on but get strive for the best
Take time to perfect
Every rhyme that I kick
I should get a sign on my dick
""I don't got time for them chicks""
They be tryin' to resist
Every time I insist
They submit
Bitch don't be lying on my prick
I'm too quick for your lies and deception
Hold your eyes in my direction
If you strive for perfection
Just watch the pro
But its like a chore
You gotta cap and go
Feel the most
Catch me next time I gotta rock a show
Got's to go
I'll be back and some other fat chick

Make you bite your lips, Jenny you know you like unless
Nice and thick, if you ever leave me I'd slice my wrists
Treat you like a bitch, never that
We got beef where my niggaz at
Streets is where I'm living at

Where the glock, that's the sounds of the mini mack
Where we at, uptown where its really at
Here me yack, I want the mansion, the yacht
Advance on the spot, we can dance till we drop
Let my hands slip a knot

Joe you the don

Jenny you the bomb
Any man disrespect, good as gone

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me
That everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of my fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened up for me
That's why I'm feeling

I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

And everything is still going right

Or break this spirit of mine, oh no

Call a few friends of mine

Better run when you see me coming through the back door
Crack smart, I give it all for my brother
There's to things I don't share

Seis caps some steel, this better scrap for real

Shut up your grill
You know we never fight

We play the front not the back, when there's beef I attack
Grab the guns and start lighting
Ya'll the bitch niggas behind cars scared to death like ""yo, who fighting?""
How the fuck you teaching me I ain't got no obedience
Ya'll are made of shit I'm the thug's ingredients
And for my niggas I peel like fucked up paint jobs
Cover your block and put holes in you like old blankets
Fuck a bitch use a sock and wipe my nut what?
Run in your spot and use a Glock to get my cut what?
Smack you in public and embarrass you slut what?
Put you on punishment the same way I do to my son
And the only bullets by my stomach be the clip from my gun
And when my gun busts it's over so close the curtains
My silencer's like ch, ch, ch like birds was chirping
I like Boricuas ya know that Sheik be freaky
I put coke in their peepee then stuff the bras
Put some coke in the bras that look like coconuts

Busting out that custard cream
Piper cause I'm piped up with the mustard team
Plus the queen Fort Knox and hearts
King of medallions Monty Guard
Even Italians see my battalion prop the broad
I got the squad over qualified pulling over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted three wilted hydraulic slide
Spark the Live in the crowd ripping trough housings
Like the Wu do in Shaolin
John Blazing on a pound of buddha and all the mami chulas

I don't think so, your man's the thug you ride piggy-back
You're the one that passed the gat, told your man to bust that

Crack king descendant, 14 years old facin' a sentence
Me and Tone Soul still co-defendants

Split dough with detectives to get my flow in protection
Through the ice on my gold you see your own reflection
Can't tell me shit about murder and movin' weight

Some of us are dyin' to gain but the name lives forever

Marked on my flesh to make my thoughts manifest

Talkin' 'bout somebody tryin' to playa hate you
Actually I like you but fuck wit my squad the German A.K.'ll hit you
Ever seen what them things could do to
Cut your legs, remove your from your hip down to ya tims
I'm like the limit on ya life, the demon on ya light
That figure in the dark that takes ya heart in the mid of night

Gats on the holsters strapped to the shoulders of maniacs
Where we at the projects, why don't you get the closet
Ahh, shit killa clacks, could've brought back ya prostate

Buyacka got bullets big enough to move ya car
Land cruisers 18 wheelers we do it tied
Just let it happen, I prefer violence instead of rappin'
Fuckin' wit this Latin assassin, better get ya head examined
My shit be slammin' like Onyx and Wrestle Mania

You garbage pail rappers would get ya cabbage split
Got a habit of brandin' ammitur nigguz like cattle hips
So watch ya lips 'cause what you fuckin' is hazardous
Shut up and catch a clip, I roll wit more dogz than St. Lazorous
What happened is ya raps ain't accurate, you claim you packin' it
But when the action hits you rather switch into a faggot bitch
I'm hardcore, it's not my fault ya softer than cardboard
Ya started to battle so I'mma turn into the God four

Switch to southpaw like De La Hoya golden boy
I put it on you polaroid finish, left you as red as Sonya
I been a soulja all my life, fought for stripes all most saw the light
Talk to Christ, he told me that my songs so nice
And for the right price I might just body you
Chop ya ass into particles and read about you in newspaper articles
I'm sick and tired talkin' shit, got beef wit me then so be it
I'll rush you like the Soviet Union and leave you soakin' wet

I'm like a Triple Threat
Double dare you to try to rip my neck
The way you click spit techs will leave you wet from dick to neck
I know you ain't forget the way you squad niggaz rep
Comin' at me from the sideline like you intend to step

Yo, yo, yo, yo 
Yo, yo 
It's hard to explain how my squad can harbor the strain
of being the largest name in rap, since the almighty Kane
Acknowledge the fame, my call was to reign the streets
from Harlem to Queens, back to the Bronx who fathered the dream
Started this thing called rap, where I reign supreme, my team
Regardless of that, I've seen things as far as the crack
that'll make the hardest largest artist heart just collapse
I'm part of all that that's why it's so hard to go back
and start from scratch
I'm locked and I'm trapped, in a giant cage
Tryin to savor these few dyin' days
I have left, to the form of flesh, should I lie in my grave?
I'm tryin to persuade, my motto is try to be brave
and not give death the satisfaction of seein' me dyin' afraid
That why I rise from the grave singin' church songs like
I was Je-sus Christ pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

[Chorus: x2]
Whatcha gon' do when Pun comes?
Knockin' at ya front door
And he wants war, holy shit!
He ain't a rapper he'll kill you

'Til my last breath I'll have death before dishonor (c'mon)
And welcome drama (yeah) with open arms and a code of honor
My whole persona equals that of Gods
Definin' matters hard all before you even had a job
I'll stab and rob if I have to, fuck it I'll blast you
Tell the devil it was Pun, if he ask you
And let him know how we be deadin' 'em, show him my emblem
The tombstone, the throne, every millennium
A child is born that can preform at a level beyond
the expected four minute thirty second song
We reign supreme, my team be all up in your dream
with the ""kill anything"" grill, chillin' beside the guillotine
Executioner style, black suit and a smile
Who's next to get their neck hacked loose in the crowd
Move from the aisle, don't make me have to prove that I'm wild
Word to Cuban, my crew killers, y'all niggas shoot in the clouds
(Who's in the house?) Punisher straight from hell
Who's in the house (Terror Squad motherfucker we the real)
What the deal, now you know that's how we roll
Hard core like B.O., bring in the corns baby bro

[Chorus: x2]",Whatcha Gon Do?,1999
Big Punisher,"Man, what the fuck is we gone do, man?
Shit, man, I can't believe this shit, man
Them motherfuckers done killed him
We got to ride for this nigga
On them old hoe ass niggas
I say we ride over right there, right now
That's what I'm talking about, let's roll

As we delve through the mud and rain
Straight shots of tongue ease the pain
As we put to rest one of my niggas
That got cut up and lost half his brain
Shit, ain't the same niggas is dangerous
Buckin' like it's the thang to bust
When I looked at my nigga fucked up
I couldn't help thinking this could've been aimed for us

Niggas do hate like that, nigga, you never know
He say a friend but I smell foe
So I sit back and wait for the day niggas try to kick in my door
So I sleep with the big fo-fo
But what if I fuck up and pull it too slow
You know what they say, gotta go, gotta go
What if I be the one breathing no more, oh well
When I die I want all my motherfuckers to ride
(For me)

On the niggas that did me killed, me committed my homicide
Gather up after the funeral and pull out all the big guns
(Posse up)
Go through every hood poppin' till somebody tell you somethin'
How in the fuck can I rest in peace when I wasn't ready to die
So I'm begging my niggas to get my revenge
And do it the same night they put me under
Now I'm gone but this thug shit gone live on
Just write on my tombstone he was that thuggish ruggish bone

Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(Nigga, you never know when you gone die)
Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(Say never know when it could be you)

(This shit is real and oh, so true)

When I die I wanna see about a hundred niggas cryin'
Lying, talkin' 'bout they all love Ryan
And Joey too, you should've seen me at the funeral
Sporting the top hat tuxedo was royal blue murder who
Nigger, I died in the car chase shot
The place like the last scene in Scarface
Now I'm in the far place chillin' in the whites of the sky
Terror Squad till the day I die

I'ma thug, I'ma die high O.D. off the la-la
Niggas tell me get off that weed, I'ma keep smoking on that thai
Nigga, fuck that, I'ma keep hittin' that
(Puff puff)
Till my lung collapse, what's wrong with that?
You hypocrite, just a little bit you know you down with it

It's all good in your hood having laughs
Puff weed to clear my cataracts
Never thought I'd see the inside of an ambulance
But now I'm there too many dead brain cells
Runnin' 'round inside my head
That's when I died my eyes were blood shot red

Now picture me dead, still getting head in the coffin flossin'
Bitches fightin', cryin', tryin' to get a bigger portion
My niggas talkin', figuring how to get my fortune
While I'm lost in space waiting for Satan and his horseman
Walkin' through fire sparkin' my lighter cloud the sky up
Rising higher and higher, eye to eye with my messiah
Viya Con Dios as I cross the gates of hell
I faced the devil with a shovel and told him brace yourself

Reporters steady ask why KB be talkin' 'bout murder on all the songs
I say 'cause I could step out the door, somebody could pop and I'm gone
Then they wanna know why I pack chrome for one I'm paranoid
Smoking too much of that weed, what's that I just heard a noise
Get the 12 gauge and I call my boys
Motherfuckers is plottin' to get me, I know when I'm dreaming this
So that's the meaning of this

Nine millimeter heater strapped with infrared beams and shit
So nigga don't trip the reaper, seem to be getting closer
So I'm running from that motherfucker swervin' and duckin' murder
Pistol grip pump protected by the gauge
Mr Sawed-Off Leatherface reload the clip and into the crowd I spray
Murder murder, mo murder, murder, kill, kill, kill

Shit, it's selling but what they ain't telling niggas is that it's real
But you better realize for it be you in the casket dropped
Better get you ass a shotgun and go get a plastic glock
Nigga, don't take murder for no joke, that's like slittin' your own throat
But I tell you what'll help for sure is if you bust back at them hoes

But I been eating cunts, since pimps is pushing
Pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps
Bumpin' and grindin'
Simultaneously want it, climbing up the walls
With my balls bangin' off your hymen
I'm a diamond in the rough
Bustin' in your face, taste the sweetness of my dick
Rip your fetus out of place, yo
Bitches already know the repertiore
Step in my car, lets start the menage-a-toi
Like Escobar

Forget the kissin', I'm skippin' the tongue twistin'

Bought me a daiquiri, told me meet her in back of Zachary's
'cause she heard I was packin' meat
I bagged the freak
And hit the tele, got the phillies, lifted her belly
And put it in her mouth like Akinyele
Far from ugly
But they used to say I'm too chubby, but since the money
The honies got nuthin' but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish
I'll make you rich, take your kids to the flicks
Come back and fix your favorite dish

Where my other chick's at
Now can you dig that
I'm the Mack doin' my thing, pulling your strings
Making you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the hip-hop quotables
Giving you multiples, just by the tone
Of my voice and the vocables

Word to 'Pac and Big, my glock so big it can rock a bridge
Drop the midsection like the top of your wig
Ain't no bullshittin', gettin' the full treatment
Special two heated missles, 'til your crew's leavin' witchu
I rip you in half, blast that ass through a glass window
Laugh a little (ha ha) and dash in the S-Class limo
That's how we do it in the South Boogie
Where tough rough rookies get snuffed out, for talkin' loud to me
Why should I even consider your crew? Shit on your crew
Get rid of your crew, what I'm fittin' to do
I split you in two, leave you impaired when I blast the shotty
Grip you like dope and leave you there with half your body
We Rowdy like Roddy, probably robbin' your stash
Catch a body like Charlie up North, stashin' knives up my ass
Survivin' the task, we the last ones left
Blast them tecs with clips, fast as fast'll spit
Add some tips for any, bastard bitch, pappin shit
Watch me rep til the death from the bassonet, beotch!

Big Punisher,"Warning!

Yo, wanna rumble with Pun, ha?
Shit on the whole industry
Yo who puff more Owls than Pun? Pile on more styles than Pun?
Who the only one with over a thousand guns?
Runnin' up in niggas cribs like I paid the bill
Make you squeal the combination to the safe for wealth
I lace your grill with the fire starter
Hit your wife with the ? from the ?shower powers I devour?
I'm all about the fundamentals, like Pun and pencil
A piece of paper, a decent caper and someone to strafe you
My mental's compatible with the radicals
My oddessey type, qualities allow me to poli' with animals
Niggaz is canibals and the ghetto's a jungle
Where you either bet all your bundles or struggle on the simple and humble
My niggaz'll rumble with any man for a Benny Fran
Try to imagine what they can sacrifice for twenty grand
Niggaz'll slice you and dice you into a thousand pieces
And pound out we jettin to the ground Uptown
Up in the Boogie Down, ? swallow the team, pile on the green
Surrounded in green like flowers in Spring
For now I'm a King, so it's more than money, all the honies
Used to call me Punny cause my fam was always hungry
But now we rollin lovely, and you feel worse, want my money
Let your steel burst, cause I'd rather see you in hell first

[Chorus: Wyclef and Pun]

[Wyclef Jean]
Yo, yo, yo keep the lights keep the camera all I want is the action
The battle's on, where I roam in composition
A hardcore crowd, waitin to see, if I break
Like your first time in jail when you got fucked by an inmate
It'll never happen, I'm on balance like a Libra
And if I get murdered, Don't Cry For Me Argentina
Pour me a cup of vodka, bury me next to my father
In three days, I rise like Christ and still sober
Now my eyes open, in my hands I got the Gatling
I'm looking for the guy that sent me to say hi to Satan
Fists of fury, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry
I turn Mr. Rogers Neighborhood topsy turvy
Foes and enemies meaning the same in the dictionary
This ain't Pictionary, all you see is the cemetery
Bodies, from World War I and II is there
You don't want a third war, that's nuclear warfare
So Big Pun, count the stacks, make it fast
Illegal money turns legal now we runnin a laundromat
Your hunchbacked and wack rap is packed in your backpack
Your better off in D.C. with the mayor smoking crack
Yo, this ain't a diss, Wyclef bomb threat
Run out of the building or get blast in your Guess
Tec for Tec, or we can go text for text, oh
I forgot, you don't read, so take this hole in your chest - blaow
Hide the blood, give you the gun, run and hide
So when the DT shows up, he thought it was a suicide
Suicide it's a suicide...

Big Punisher,"Hey yo it's all love, but love's got a thin line
And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine
The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up, with the stash gone
I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast
Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the click, cause we all share
It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum
Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl
I'm the mighty Thor clothes lining motherfuckers like Steven Segall
Cause all you gonna get, is your ass kicked or up in a casket
That's it (that's it?) That's it

Cats getting Big Willie niggas like Billy Bathgate

Please, you ain't seen no thugs like these
I can tell you lots of things that'll make you believe

Your career's on life support, and I'ma pull the plug
And have every thug shootin' that Beatnut drug
In they blood, no escapin 'this
Niggas is goin' over their favorite shit (for what?) 
To be tapin' this
World premier, loud and clear
Lye and beer, get the dough, blow up the show
Dissapear, jump in the Cavalier
Feelin' marvelous, street pharmacist, twist arboles
For pleasure, bring your territory sever
Keep my workers under pressure got em sayin' ""fuck Lester""
But that's aight Duke-o, my heart nowadays too cold
Don't give a fuck where you been what you done
Where you go, you know, peep this favorite
In black shades like a secret, agent
We're night thieves, roll up on you sleeves
We light trees, bust these and stack cheese

Book me a flight to 30 cities round this land
Give me a fat sack of weed and some cash in hand
Some vatos that can handle themselves out on the road
And I guaran-damn-tee you the spot will explode
I want to rock Sur Califa Midwest known to deliver
Gettin stoned lookin' out over the Hudson River
See we poppin' worldwide West to East
Anywhere there's stomach acid in the belly of the beast
Where teeth is grittin' rundown but still hittin'
In their rides top tippin' with my cut straight dippin'
Be the type to leave you dazed out blowin' snot bubbles
Like a late-night bud binge face down in the puddle
If there's one thing I've learned in my travels that's ironic
We all the same it's just we smoked different chronic
We are carnales homes it's like you didn't know
You're the reason I came I think it's time to flow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've been around in the game much longer than you can figure
All across the map to keep my pocket book bigger
The late-night binges the all-night party
Daily gettin' twisted off the herb and Bacardi
Rollin with my homeboys but they more like family
Started in the West now to the East is where they're flyin' me
A first class ticket we flyin' overseas
Crossing the Atlantic feeling Germany's breeze
Pissin' in the snow right down beside the Autobon
Shook the spot in Hamburg ended up in Amsterdam
Hit the skies again back home to my Califas
A little champagne the huero's high off the reefa
Let's take a little trip down south of the border
Chillin' con mis compas tequila is in order
That's how it goes now I'm headed back home
Livin' on the road till my record sells gold

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
No matter how you see it now it's quite the same
You can tour with or for that platinum fame
I give a damn about the fame homeboy now you can keep that
I tour for the crema the masa the fucking straight cash
Fame don't pay the bills that's on the real
Only cash from my rola with that mass appeal
I got all y'all in my sights tonite
You should be pumpin' like a hydro if all goes right
I plan to rock my funky rolas from the gates of California
Jams like a bug-a-boo all up on ya
Passin' entrance aw you know

Do you see me now 
You remember me the guy from the back of the class
That used to where the glasses the one you
Used to laugh at look at me now brother do you like fruit 
Well I'm chewin' your girls nipples 
How do you like them apples asshole

[Chorus]
I'm laughing at you 
I'm laughing at you now you told me I was ugly 
I was scared to crack a smile
Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm laughing at you now 
Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm laughing at you

Six hundred Benz twenty inch rims 
House on the hill hittin' mad skin
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
It was all a scheme I used to load the teck with the magazine 
So I was mean but I still had a scheme 
17 years young everything seemed fun 
Still considered a veteran 'cause I feared none 
Pun's from the street where there ain't no rules
But carried heat 'cause he ain't no fool 
Ain't no wrong for dollars in negative digits
So debted followers and got rid of the quitters
That never forget us 'cause we've been down since the
Genesis two hundred horse power to four hundred Pegasus
The messages don't sleep till its over 
Next thing you know shorty seven feet
Tippin' over I'm still in the water drownin'
Knights and murder till the immortal terror squad
Threw me a life preserver now I'm ice forever
Stomach bustin' out the white carrera 
Life is better now niggas wanna rhyme together
Ay que sera! what can I do but take you to strive
Ay que hago! I hope the streets don't take me alive
You wasted your life and refused the struggle while 
I aim for the sky pay dues and bubbles I win!

[Chorus]

Now its not funny 'cause I'm hot and got a pot of money 
Alot of hunnies around (Don't stop do the brown for me)
My every wish is her command call her bitch she understands
I reminisce how she used to dis me and my man
Check part of the plan she told my son I wasn't the man
I ain't gonna to stop till I got a heart in my hand
I can silence the lamb but couldn't silence her cause
She was as wild as a man with a bottle of liquor 
I'm not going to hit her I'm gonna debt her tonight
Double platinum now shes one in the tribe well in the ride now
Well in a fly gettin' high now no more whiteout send the Cubans 
To provide now it's my world I demand my respect
Give me your girl or get slapped in your neck
Ain't nothin' change I'm still humble and modest
And I'm always proud to admit I came straight from the projects
Hardy har har har

Don't you forget about me now

Quick to bust the mack, better believe that 
She always got my back, nigga twirl that 
About to blaze a sack, where the weed at

With that monster rap, better believe that 
You know the Bronx is back, she represent that 
'Cause Terror Squad got her back, some say heed that

I'm troubled, shoot out the air bubbles in your sneakers 
The type to cop a Range along with all the features 
Then take the back streets to avoid the leeches

Her dead baby popped this pussy, and his boys can't beat us 
Straight strong armin', bombarding, and bogarding
Remi don't write her own rhymes, nigga, I beg your pardon
It's Ms. Martin I done broke night in the studio writin'
While fraud broads don't get no publishin', still be bitin'
They kill me lyin', like they the ones doin the scribin'
When you can hear the ghostwriter, all up in they rhymin'
I flows like water, got this drizzle with little C 
Catch me with Pun eatin skittles in the middle of Little Italy 
Y'all don't know diddly, I spit hot, and drop shit
Every time I kick a rhyme, Pun I burn my lip
Take another pull, bust another shot, y'all can't stop me 
Come through in a jail suit, and the new Beef 'n' Broccolis
Doin it, If I'm havin a good time and you ruin it 
I seen a nice casket that'll look good with you in it 
New improved shit, the year start with a 2 shit 
Next millenium, sell a million, clue shit 
Exclusive, to tell the truth, y'all useless 
'Cause I'm a dime that could rhyme you still on the deuce list

Remi Martin, dash, reminisce, slash 
Remi, cash like a check in a stash 
Me without rhymes is like a flynt with no flash 
Stripper with no ass, car with no gas 
Tryin to go fast, I love to hear the guns go blast 
(Blau, blau, blau, blau) I love the sounds of the shells fallin' down 
Love to smoke weed, stay blowin' trees, fuck liquor 
When shit get thick, I love to hear my bitches raise his clique up 
You sick, but I'm sicker, plus our guns is bigger 
If you really wanna kill us, do it nigga, pull the trigga 
How you figure, you could really come and take what's mine 
And all I gotta do is send a little letter to Rah 
He'll send the troops out
My brother don't hesitate to pull a tool out 
And I'm his little sis, so he taught me the same shit
Quick to flip, but your name should be prickless 
'Cause every time you open your mouth, you suckin' my dick 
Talkin' shit, as if you a soldier nigga 
When you a no cash, low class, doja nigga 
Y'all rock rocks, we bling bling boulders nigga 
Look over your shoulder I'm in the Rover, it's over nigga 
Inhale, cock back and bust, just because
I know none of y'all busters is touchin' us 
I got the thoroughest thugs and, baby reminisces 
That don't give a fuck, with a aim that never misses 
Hugs and kisses never, just slugs and stiches 
Thugs and bitches forever, check the mugshot pictures
Fuck the weather, I still got my tan Timbs on 
Just copped the pink mink, and winter been gone 
I been on this thug shit y'all can't seem to fuck wit 
My shit is hot dogs, to top it off, still spittin' mustard 
No fair, 'cause I don't care I go to war wit a musket

Sky's the limit, nothin' less if my guys is in it
For the right price, even Christ could get it
Fast life we live it, all my memories are vivid
I remember only minutes 
That's how I mentally get rid of all the enemies
The spirits that definitely mimic my every melody
And lyric which so heavenly rhythmic
In magic do I build, but math do be equally compatible
And secretively battle you to reach my peak in equilateral

You scared to death I'll make you twice as afraid of life

Ignitin' the flame, keepin' your third lid
Speak and observe with the mind 
What are blind sleep til they worth shit
I'm earth wind and fire, the first one to fire
Reppin' T. Squad since birth til I retire
I wire your jaw, wire the walls with plastique explosives
And riot the halls at the malls where all the crackers ? live
Keep flappin yo' gibs and I'ma come back with those kids
From the back of the bridge
I think two and touch means tackle the bitch
I rap for the chips, but I'm truly assassin
Four hundred pounds, six feet tall, brutally handsome
That's the pro, got beef with Pun, you gots to go
Mafia style, tear you a new ass-a-hole
Flash your dough, but you too cool for the captain
Cause I don't give a fuck if I was quadruply platinum
And to the 50 Cent rapper, very funny, get your nut off
Cause in real life, you don't know 
I'll blow your motherfuckin' head off (ooh yeah)

That's my motherfuckin' word, you understand?
Thought we was a fuckin' joke? Shit
Terror Squad nigga, you don't know me
You don't know my name, don't say it, you understand?
Told you before I ain't no motherfuckin' rapper understand?
Shit, I don't make no songs about rappers I don't like

Because up north you be tossin salads with maple syrup
I know you hate to hear it, but everybody know this one
Why you always gotta be right n****, why can't you ever be wrong

[Fat Joe]
Now it's on, from the Bronx where it's at
You was wrong, me and Pun brought it back
Now it's on, stay on with the gat
You was wrong, it's the Don, Joey Crack

Who the f*** want beef with Joe Crack
Make your body fold back
Lift his soul with the chrome mack
I don't chat on the phone, 'cause the phone tapped
You heard there's money on the block we control that
I got the work in the pot where that stove at
Cook it up 'til its wack, get my dough back
You n****s so wack, tryin'a compete
I blind you with heat, I'm the reason crime on the street
I die for my peeps, keep an open eye when I sleep
Let you slide when I coulda put five in your Jeep
Who's liver than me? I ain't know you really want it
I'm like Christ, n****s beg for they life when they see me comin'
Ain't nodoby gonna stop my shine, you out'cho mind
Don't make me have to c*** my nine, pop ya spine
Neva did believe in the Don's 
Since ninety-two I've been proving that y'all n****s was wrong

[Remi Martin]
Aiyyo, it's on, though I'd stay on the block
You was wrong, now Remi on the rock
So it's on, thought I wasn't gonna drop
You was wrong, I was right all along

I told these n****s, that I was the sickest b****
And everytime you spit, I'ma spit some sicker s***
Ridicoulous, I reminise when I blaze the track
Tight s***, make a n**** want to play ya back
I'm hatin that, but I'ma make 'em all believers
F*** hot, I'ma come and straight drop a fever
Cop a heater, turn around and pop your leader
And for the followers, I'ma leave their heads hollower
Make your wig twisted as if I was Oliver
Layin' in a hospital, hooked up the monitors
That's for the game, y'all lames just came to first
'cause I ain't neva heard a b**** straight flame a verse
I blame the church, how God let you lie like that
Who scribed you for, 'cause you ain't neva rhymed like that
How the f*** you gon' tell me that chick is tight

That leave MC's smashed but my Squad, is odd
Y'all never seen relish, but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas, rockin' the ? sweaters
The ones who paid with they life
I rock for forty days and forty nights, and every verse is tight
Better than before; rough, rugged, and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This ain't a game, I'll leave you maimed
Allow me to explain I thrive on the pain while robbin' your chain
Knahmean? Do him and the fiend, grab his wallet
Leave a trail-blazin like (Rasheed Wallace)
What's today's knowledge? Hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin' on the corner so won't speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money son that's all that it's about
No doubt, silence of code, violence of mode
Under control, can tell my real niggas really roll
On the low tryin' to blow trees
And for no reas', we hit a nigga up for mo' cheese
Better relate and start to think, or be the missin' link
I got my Hustle on like Larry Flynt

We brave in the heart, playin' a part, amazingly smart
Razor sharp, futuristic raps, state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars
First it was Nasty Nas now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low, business never personal
Just some words to know, if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state if death is my fate then cool I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me
Aight crew? (No doubt Pun!) Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, comin' with the thunder and the lightning
Invitin' the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, snipin' your moms, right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm it's the ghetto God
I rip a nigga heart out his frame while I scream TERROR SQUAD
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she'd starve on a diet instead I'm a God in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzlin' beer bottles by the dozen with Devin that's mi hermano

You ain't understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldn't think I did that shit
I'm from where the guns love to introduce thyself
Reduce your health, little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready, for this big dog who hold a nine steady
I'm John Blazin' when you see the arms razin'
Shit crime heavy already, I keep it sharper than the long 'chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers how you more ready and switch bigger
Than more berry I'm a cherry you a strawberry
If you lost that mean I'm on top of the whip
You plottin' to flip, fuck around and get shot in the lip

I play the streets with toast 'cause the thieves is close
Wanna keep your post then don't beef with Joe
Still niggas think I won't bring the heat out

Truth first, Terror Squad, shoot first

Now what's the problem, you ain't nothin' like you said on your album
I thought you was wildin bustin' your guns and runnin' the island
You wasn't violent, you was silent tryin to get college credits
How pathetic, did it to get out of the calisthenics

Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns, I'm on the serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit, I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mac in back of the Acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack

Your squadron'll be barred from rap like Adam and Eve from the garden
I'm carvin' my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed you see the ""BP"" shine off the board head
Reverse that, I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
Cause he ain't worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back, watch the earth crack
Hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin' I'm blacker than coal
Like Nat King, I be rappin' and tounge's packin

It's Big Pun! The one and only son of Tony Montana
You ain't promised manana in the rotten manzana
C'mon pana we be mob rhymers
Feel the marijuana, snake bite, anaconda
A man of honor wouldn't wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma, and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kinda grammar

When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan when I'm the rhymin' abomination

I'm pure adrenaline, uncut, straight to the gut, medicine
Raw cure for pain I coat your brain like polyurethane
Simple and plain, I'll explain it in layman terms
If you came to learn how to make fire, I'ma make it burn!

Involved in a life of crime (crime!) fuck it I like the shine (shine!)
Up in the white and lime (lime!) Comes with the pipe design
Plushed out! (No doubt!) Both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach, get the fuck out!
Take a hike, we can even battle to make it right
Go 'head lace the mic, you finished? Say good night
Head to head in the street, I'll leave you dead in your feet
Settlin beef, I'll even let you rhyme to the Benjamin beat
But it won't matter, you dreams still gon' shatter
It's a long ladder to climb, and mine is known to stagger
So get outta town, 'fore I hit you with the loudest sound
You ever heard; desert bird player you outta bounds

[Chorus: x3]

You know the Pun'll diss you if your whole steez is unofficial
I'll come and get you and let the desert eez tounge kiss you
With one pistol and two clips, I'll make your crew do flips
Like acrobatics, I'm charismatic, my gat is magic
It makes rappers disappear, whipser in your ear
Crystal clear, come here, let me kiss your tears
Everything you fear is here, you ain't got to search further
The first murder's the worst, now I thirst further
For reverse birth, every verse hurts, every curse word's
Already more offending than Eddie Murph's worst
I thirst for blood like a vampire
Any man claimin' his game's tighter, is a god damn liar!
I set him on fire, retire your train of thought
Drain a quart of blood out your brain and leave you insane in the dark
The king of New York! Lays his crown in the Boogie Down
And sprays the town, with a Mac hoodied down
I'm no joke! I soak your face with a sweeper
Die in disgrace, or face your death through the speaker

Lost it all
But that's the way the hottie was

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca

Oh, she'll push and pull you down
Her lips are a devil's red
She will wear you out

Oh, oh yeah

Big Punisher,"[Chorus]
Mamma I don't understand
Why he had to fuck with me, now I gotta kill this man
I said mamma now I'm on the run
Dear ma-mah what have I done?

Somebody save me, I think I just killed somebody baby
Shoulda chilled but money was really tryin' to play me
Couldn't hold it no more so I showed him the four
Duke was dissin' my girl like she was hoein' on tour
And knowin' I'm raw, money tried to play fly
""I said whassup to the bitch; why she couldn't say hi?""
That ain't right! I had to put him in his place
Remember them hollows I bought for three bottles?
I put 'em in his face
I didn't have to disgrace myself, hatin' myself
""Ahora a tu!"" blam blam, brace yo'self
That's the law, the streets are like basketball
But sometimes you shoot, sometimes you pass it off
Can't always take a shot, make one mistake you upstate for what?
Too much hate, time to break the lock
I hate the cops so I ain't tryin' to see 'em
I love a brother doin' triple life but I ain't tryin' to be him
That's why I be on the low, and keep my feet in the row
Cause they're tellin' me as far as felonies
You get life for three in a row
Then whadday'know? Last week at the flicks
I had to kill somebody, for steppin' on my kicks (stupid)

[Chorus]

I can murder half the world laugh while the other side hate me
But hurt one hair on my mamma head and I'ma, cry like a baby
She my heart and soul; what Jimi Hendrix was to rock'n'roll
Made me believe I could achieve the impossible
Now you know one of my weakness's, but Punisher keeps it glizz
So don't pull out 'cause when I pop oh what a relief it is
Send you where Jesus is, hold up, that's the gas chamber
Think before you put on that ski-mask and blast a stranger
Relax the anger, don't be so hard on yourself
That's how you'll end up twelve years old; 
Bein' charged as an adult
Terror Squad is here to help so you can learn from our mistakes
Cause power just makes you reject destiny and devour your fate
How many hours I waste, tryin' to figure the shit
Until I finally realized, we're just niggas and spics
That's what they feel, what can I do but just stay real?
Keep somethin' in the stash in case I gotta make bail
Cause ain't no brothers, runnin' shit in the system
You goin' straight to jail if you colored and fit the description
Fuck you talkin' about? I live here
This is my buildin' nigga, fuck you nigga!
That's my daughter right there playin fuck off me!
Get the fuck off!

[Chorus]

I don't have much time so I'm only gonna ask you once
To please forgive me mamma, I love you and I'm sorry I broke your heart
But I ask you to do me a favor and take care of my daughters
And raise them to be good respectable woman, like their mother
God bless her soul
And raise my son to be a good man, a better man than me
And for this I give you my soul, I love you

Another Darkchild remix
Brandy, RJ, Big Pun, Fat Joe, Terror Squad
Come on

Hear the truth shorty
With my fruit punch and my forty
Sweeter than candy, Brandy's the only one for me
You get it up
It's only the middle of the week
But when you called Joe and Pun
You kept it real with the streets
That's the true honor
Not the jewels or Garbana
Any fool can't accomplish just a few hundred dollars
That's paper thin, I got my mamma out the apron
I'm loyal to her from eight to ten
Make way for the twin

Who the twins that be making it hot
(Say what?)
Number one on you Billboard charts
Showing love to them thugs who be holding the blocks
And we be tearing up the club like the Three Six Mob
Joey Crack baby, ain't no time to react lazy
Brandy gave us a call and our track's gravy
Perhaps maybe we can ball with this
And all get rich, I ain't only talking ish!

Some people say that I am not the same girl
They think that I am in my own world
What makes them think that I have changed, yeah
A little dough can not erase my problems
Me, like you, I have to try and solve them
Yes everything is quite the same

Sitting on top the world
Sitting on top, no that's not so
Everybody changes, let it go
Sitting on top the world
I'm just one girl trying to live my life
But someone telling me what I like

Back in the days
when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

I wonder why it's often said that my life's
A fairy tale and everything is so right
I wish that you could know the truth, yeah
My life is real so please don't get it twisted
Problems the same and got to be dealt with
These are the things I wish you knew, ooh yeah

Sitting on top the world
Sitting on top, no that's not so
Everybody changes, let it go
Sitting on top the world
I'm just one girl trying to live my life
But someone telling me what I like

Ever since you wanted to be down
I wanted to put you on
But you ain't come around
Had no time for the don
Sixteen on the block
The latest phenomenon
Number one with a bullett
And your own sitcom
Brandy hand me one of the platinum hits
People talk but they don't know the half of it
Well the fact this is, we're in the worst business
And anything you have you deserve it miss

Encima del mundo
Follow the squad we never segundo
Tell el mundo, telling vatos of every remover
Word chula we packing men like Lollapalooza
From here to Havana, Cuba then Puerto Rico en scooter
Getting mula
Sitting on top of the world like A Buddha
Who the first Latin to go platinum without the basura
Big Pun the caputera with cheddar
Never settle for second best cause I'm primera, which forever

Sitting on top the world
Sitting on top, no that's not so
Everybody changes, let it go

Big Punisher,"Ready for war Joe, how you want to blow they spot 
I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop 
Hop in your Humer, the Punisher's ready, meet me at Beatles' 
With Noodles, we'll do this dude while he's slurpin' spaghetti 
Everybody kiss the fuckin' floor, Joey Crack, buck 'em all 
If they move, Noodles shoot that fuckin' whore 
Dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know 
That we riddled a middleman who didn't do diddly 
 
It'll be a cold day in hell the day I'm taken out 
Make no mistake for real I wouldn't hesitate to kill 
I'm still the Fat One that you love to hate, catch you at your 
Mother's wake 
Smack you then I wack you with my snub trey-eight 
 
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children 
Like Amityville drill the nerves in your cavity fillin'
Insanity's building up pavilion in my civilian 
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealing 
A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss 
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support 

I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves 
My brother from another mother sent from the above 
A thug nigga just like me, one of the best, might be 
Even better leavin' niggas kneelin' on they right knee 
 
Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture 
You small change, I'm blowin out your brains gettin' richer 

Hit you with the Mac (Mac), smack your bitch, nigga what? 
You gettin' stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck! 
Trunk jewels (jewels), cruisin' in the Land, pumpin' 'Cash Rules' 
Last crew to want it caught a hundred tryin' to pass through 
That's true, so who the next to get it? 
GS the best that did it (get it off your chest kid admit it) 

[Chorus] 
And it's 
Here, and you don't stop! 
Twenty shot glock with the cop killer fill 'em to the top 
Yeah, and you don't stop! 
Joey Crack's the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked 
Yeah, and you don't stop! 
We'll make it hot nigga, what bring it I blow your whole spot 
Yeah, and you don't stop! 
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop! 
 
Fuck the po-lice, I squeeze first, 
Make 'em eat dirt 
Take 'em feet first through the morgue, 
Then launch 'em in the T-bird 
The street's cursed, the first amendment's culturally biased 
Supposed to supply us with rights, 
Tonight I hold my rosary 
Tight as I can, 
I'm one man against the world, 
Just me and my girl 
Black Pearl Athena my sena who keeps it real 
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it 
Peep it it's no secret, 
Watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it 

Creep with me, as I cruise in my Beemer 
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena 
Kickin' ass as I blast off heat, and 
You never see me talk to police, so 
You should know that I really don't care 
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat, and I'll leave you right there 
So beware it's rare that niggas want beef, Big Pun speak 
And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets 

Fuck peace, 
I run the streets deep with no compassion, Puerto Ricans 
Known for slashin' catchin niggas while they sleepin, no relaxin 
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes 
Three techs in the Jeep Lexus just in case police estas 
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto stylers 
Fill the clips off, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers 
Better acknowledge or get knocked down until I'm locked and shot down 
Heather be couldn't make me put my Glock Down 

We lock towns like rounds in the chamber 
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine 
Every time plus I'm the crime boss of New York 
When we talk to walk the walk all my niggas carry chalk 
And stalk, I prey like The Predator, whoever want it 
Go and get it set it baby and I'ma bury ya 
So remember the Squad that I'm reppin' 
I pull a clip for my weapon and Punish niggas till it's Armageddon

Thinkin' of takin' a plane 
To take a flight out to the red light
And smuggle 10 pounds of weed
Make it home tonight
Be the number 1 smuggler in the area
Got enough weed to fill up and air craft carrier
Erb slanger, Hasila Incorporated 
State to state and over seas gettin' faded
Buddah king had seen the green proton
I'm bringing it on right back home to Don
Many different strains of erb in my brain
I'm slippin' through customs in my hydro plane
Skunk and the one chocolate ty bud
Niggas lets get high in the sky hit the blunts
And the bongs, fill up the lungs, niggas don't stop
Fools get sprung when they get there smoked up for crops
Like gettin' props, where all the soldiers in the board

Dime droppers will give ya fad time if you sleep
But momma single be mastera heater on city streets

Lacin' the china with Menida
To seller need repeater or be a leader 
Like a preacher or presume a steeper
Peep the shit that I be on, sippin' Don
Until I'm drunk with a million in my trunk like Nikki Vons
Come on I be the top extortionist 
Adopt adopted foster kids right out the mothafuckin' orphanage
Yea, I do it for the youth, I'm livin' proof 
All my peeps in the streets know I speak the truth.

No doubt, 
I be the crime story of all ghetto territory's
Soldiers at war be blowin' up niggas like glory
With pharmaceutical lavatory's
Major to chemistry, PHD in streetology
Degree in drug industry
Combinin' H²O with matter from crack batter
Rest it through molecules scatter 
Launchin' rockets to make the pocket fatter
Mind bitin' an arm starts a crime
G equals and MC dat ain't near the square son I gets mine
But yo the kill the fill with force fields and shields
And holy steel, a nigga keep it real
You know the deal, if the stakes ain't to high for me to grab
I got's to have, stack all the cabbage
From constructin' a drug traffic
Police a jam me in try to find a new pot to frame me in
Armenians so I resort the evil thoughts like Damien
This flame of fury to the D-A and the jury 
A hundred grand the judges hammer slams I'm a free man.

Pump you with pride, then guide you str8 to hell like the bible
I'm lible to start manipulatin' minds infiltratin' clown
'm out the pitfalls of life entice with nickle plated nine
It seems every time I'm dream I'm in a nightmare of fiend
Livin' a world of mothers and queens and men would fight fare 
(Hell Yea!) I wish I could, I wish I could
Never forget this whole damn world ain't shit I'm just a hood
Yo I change my life make my wife and get the chance for the pain
And physical abuse, give her back her best years
Grab my chest hairs, pound my fist on the hard cement

Shoulda chilled but money was really tryin' to play me
Couldn't hold it no more so I showed him the four
Duke was dissin' my girl, like she was hoein' on tour

And knowin' I'm raw, money tried to play fly
I said wassup? to the bitch, why she couldn't say hi?
That ain't right, I had to put him in his place
Remember them hollows I bought for three bottles? I put 'em in his face

I didn't have to disgrace myself, hatin' myself
""Ahora a tu"" blam, blam, brace yo'self
That's the law, the streets are like basketball
But sometimes you shoot, sometimes you pass it off

Can't always take a shot, make one mistake you upstate for what?
Too much hate, time to break the lock
I hate the cops so I ain't tryin' to see 'em
I love a brother doin' triple life but I ain't tryin' to be him

That's why I be on the low and keep my feet in the row
'Cause they're tellin' me as far as felonies you get life for three in a row

But hurt one hair on my Mama head and I'ma cry like a baby
She my heart and soul, what Jimi Hendrix was to rock 'n' roll
Made me believe I could achieve the impossible

Now you know one of my weaknesses but Punisher keeps it glitz
So don't pull out 'cause when I pop, oh, what a relief it is
Send you where Jesus is, hold up, that's the gas chamber
Think before you put on that ski-mask and blast a stranger

Relax the anger, don't be so hard on yourself
That's how you'll end up twelve years old, bein' charged as an adult

A nigga try front on his body he gettin' sent back
Don't resent crack, I'm just what you wanna be
Young, rich and famous bitches can't get enough of me
And they runnin' up on me usually in groups of them
But not just everyday but you could never be too used to them
I be abusin' them squeezin' fresh oranges
Breakfast in the mornin' get some strength and then it's on again

I just had to bring 'em back
Word you definitely know what I'm about
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
All my friends call me stout
I just had to bring 'em back
Flamboyant baby
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
I'm quick to buck a duck and I don't give a fuck about five O
A hard core life I toast to ex-flaw
Therefore I live raw and went to war with the law
My only pencil was a mug shot slugs were thugs got pot
Get swellin' hops from sellin' tops to da drugs spot
G's was clocked fat knots was in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop, got knocked when I popped the glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
'Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight

'Cause we put the guns down and go one round
With the hands but man I ain't the one, you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style, 'cause I'm versitile
Quick to burst a child I'm livin' worse than foul
I pack two techs in case ya crew flex
I wet up the set in a second yell who's next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like shaft
Turn ya staff into a blood bath to laugh
You'll get smashed like a deli snack, you softer than jelly Jack
I attack in black with a gat and a skully hat

I just had to bring 'em back
All my friends call me stout
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
Flamboyant baby
I just had to bring 'em back
[Incomprehensible]
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

No doubt I'm from the X and I seen it all
Shorties with dreams of playin' ball
For Seaton hall turnin' fiends a full
From me the word to Sacuon the same sad song
Is bein' sung, its like gimme a gun and I'm back on
Joey crack, Pun, TS, Bronx regulators
Stomp little niggaz to death for tryin' to imitate us
Y'all could never see us, be us, TS, kill the BS
'Cause Pun got more guns and funds than ideas
Un be us, I'm from the BX so I have to roll

Blastin' for crash ya door, smash ya hoe
Hack off ya skull, I'm stackin heads like totem poles
Blow a hole in ya colon throw you from here to Forden Road
Blow for blow, I toe to toe with the toughest
Bring the ruckus to the roughest motherfucker
It's nothin' but illustrous
My crews are cussin' to bustin' ass crushin' glass
In niggaz faces leavin' traces of red out this bloody bath
I want the cash off the jiddump, I cock and blast the piddump
At any piddunk tryin' to laugh at the briddonx

You ain't no kiddon for the terror squadron
You feel the fear of God when I steal a car
And flatten ya Pierre Cardin
I peirce ya noggin' if you startin' trouble
Spark the dot above you
And watch it blossom like a flower throughout the borough
No doubt I'm thorough with a parascope rifle extended rycle
Cycle that'll tear the whole Bible out
I'm sweatin' no idols a title's all I request
Best rappers know that pun and why the chaperones of death

I just had to bring 'em back
Word you definitely know what I'm about
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

Could it be you're fallin' in love
Right now, right now, right now

Could it be, it can't be Pun I'm callin' ya bluff
I must be high off this weed 'cause I ain't fallin' in love
All that I eva dreamed of was fuckin' a thug
So I could bust a few slugs and sell a little drugs
Be up in the Benz, chillin', rollin' ya blunts
Have the Spanish mommies illi' 'cause I'm sittin' in front

And niggas on the block sick like what cha doin' wit that spic
Y'all don't know? Puerto Ricans and blacks make the cutest kids
Ya hair, my eyes, ya nose, and my lips
If it's a boy, I hope that God bless him with his daddy's dick, shit
To tell the truth with you. I know, I'm safe and another nigga
Frontin' and get blown in his face and I like that

You give me love and I give it right back
But when you flip don't you think I ain't gon' fight back
Pun you got dough and you know, I got a nice stack
So when you mad, go ahead take ya ice back
I just throw on some lipstick and the stylistics break up to make up

And you know, I hook a steak up, take you breakfast in bed
Nigga, soon as you wake up, get my jewels back
And take another trip to see Jacob, lovin' the way I do this for you
And every kiss that I blew, poppy chew was a kiss for you
Stayed true, faithful, you can never say, ""I played you""
'cause you ma boo and I can never say, ""I hate you""

Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's life style
Could it be you're fallin' in love

I swept you off ya feet, you was just walkin' crossin' the street
And you was talkin' to me or was it my boys in the jeep
Either or she said she loved the way I play ball
Go after the bigger niggas even though there was nice and tall
Shootin' dice in the hall inside of my doorway checkin' my drawers

Up north style right next to ma boys, just the little things
Would impress her a lot like when I let her sit in the lex tryna
Guess, where it's at, God blessed her with ass
She had the perfect mix, she was Morena with an Indian twist
She had the cinnamon lips the edge was rimmy and crisp

I thought she was Dominican the way she was swinging them hips
I never had a clue that she wanna ride with me but I'm like Darnell
Shorty had eyes for me, it's a quarter passed one
But that's another song, what was wrong? Why you took so long
To put a brotha on? It was't long before we start bumpin'and grindin'

Crushin' her spine and had her soundin' like Busta was rhyming
Bustin' her hymen, the sight of sex she start bustin' out cryin'
Her bus went by and she was ready up in there rydin'
Cussin' and wildin', talkin' dirty in the back of the porch
Whose pussy is this? Come on, daddy, it's yours

Could it be, you're fallin' in love
With a thug right now
Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's life style
Could it be you're fallin' in love

Can't count how many heads I had to sever
Half the niggaz I keep, I put em back together

And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill

Laugh a little (HA HA) and dash in the S-Class limo
That's how we do it in the South Boogie
Where tough rough rookies get snuffed out, for talkin loud to me
Why should I even consider your crew? Shit on your crew
Get rid of your crew, what I'm fittin to do
I split you in two, leave you impaired when I blast the shotty
Grip you like dope and leave you there with half your body

Everybody kiss the fucking floor, Joey Crack, buck em all
If they move, Noodles shoot that fucking whore
Dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know
That we riddled some middleman who didn't do diddily

Like Amityville drill the nerves in your cavity filling
Insanity's building up pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealing
A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support

I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves
My brother from another mother sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me, one of the best might be
Even better leaving niggas kneeling on they right knee

Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture

Hit you with the Mac (Mac), smack your bitch, nigga what?

Last crew to want it caught a hundred trying to pass through

That's true, so who the next to get it?

Joey Crack's the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked
Yeah, and you don't stop!
We'll make it hot nigga, what bring it I blow your whole spot
Yeah, and you don't stop!
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop!

Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make em eat dirt
Take em feet first through the morgue, then launch 'em in the T-bird
The street's cursed, the first amendment's culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights, tonight I hold my rosary
Tight as I can, I'm one man against the world, just me and my girl
Black Pearl Athena mas fina, but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it

Creep with me, as I cruise in my Bimmer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kicking ass as I blast off heat, and
You never see me talk to police, so
You should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat, and I'll leave you right there
So beware it's rare that niggas want beef, Big Pun speak
And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets

Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion, Puerto Ricans
Known for slashing catching niggas while they sleeping, no relaxing
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three Tecs-es in the Jeep Lexus just in case police ask us
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars
Fill the clips off, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B couldn't make me put my Glock Down

We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine
Every time plus I'm the crime boss of New York
When we talk to walk the walk all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk, I prey like The Predator, whoever want it
Go and get it set it baby and I'ma bury you

Maintain in the family is a must, I would of died to
Do anything for my peeps
But it seems they would rather see me sleep six feet deep
But when I'm on my feet somebody got they hand out though
That'll feel me broke the heat be hiding the rain watch me soke
That's the millennium love if you can pay your way, maybe you can stay
In the mean time they hate you everyday
Want to see me and my baby girl break it off
Haters'll stop they self-defense friends every ten minutes drop it's off
When three's company and four is a crowd
And my situation is seven everybody else can move around
Look at your friends and your friends peeping, they burn bridges
In they household, come into your home and try to repeat it
Got you looking at your people meaning shit
When it's over you're lonely talking about I should of seen that shit

Take a look at my life, everybody around here so shife
No love, no sacrifice, fellas in the street ain't acting right

Watch your enemies dog, keep them close like your block
Most of the ones closest to you cause they want what you got
Long as you spending money on them and your buying the drugs
They gone be down like four flats and ain't trying to budge
Say they love you everytime you rolling up the doe-doe
But when your ends don't spend they tend to leave you solo
I know, that's why I love Z-Ro, cause ain't nobody else gone love me
I think of myself, why'all don't think of me
I'm all alone but guess what, that's alright
Even though they use me for a punching bag, that's alright
Even if my woman don't want me no more, that's alright
I got Jesus and I can conversate with him all night
Give me a split that's what I'm asking
Cause I get reary ducking haters as they passing
I wish I was a sociable person, but socializing ain't for me
I want to die by myself in these streets cause that's love

It ain't no love no more everybody about the dollar
That's why when I pass by the G-O-V don't holler
I pop my collar and don't follow nobody
Keep god first and don't need no killumanati
To put it on your mind cause I say on no pages
Stacking big faces and travel to many places
Sipping ski tastes straight out the gallon 
Why don't you take a lick and don't swallow ?
The games is backstabbing, crooked it ain't right
Friends or kin folk it don't matter we can fight
It's whenever when we were boss want to do
Cause I'ma pull dollar prime till I'm dead and I'm through

I can't believe my best homie ain't my nigga no more
Remember days of playing hookie in the streets for fun
Now I'm getting dirty looks got me clutching my gun
On the one, I'ma shine like the sun my nigga
If I'm so low when I'm riding with some thugging niggas

Cause I stay high all day straight abusing shit

Cause lord knows Z-Ro ain't got no regular living
Even though I'm, trying I feel as if I'm headed to prison
Or headed to the grave, could it be I'm running out of time
Feeling hopeless, I lost my mama then I lost my mind
Will I heal in time, scarred up with bruise and shot
But see the pain is in my brain, hitting like a stash spot
My life, my life, full of drama and bullshit
We burn this out of my foes pull quick, where the love at

How can I get so far gone
When can I move on
Dreading a world that'll never go on
If I took the time replace
Only mine erased
'Cause I feel as if I'm here but I'm gone

(Mr. Doctor)
I heard a lil' tale about to children sittin on the kitchen floor
They eatin mayonaise out the jar and they moms out smokin dope on the stroll
Man, you believe this
Life is complete for them
And it ain't no emotions, only instinct
And that's how they'll be raised by the streets
A boy and a girl
Just up the boulevard from your world
Oh it ain't all gravy where you at
'Cause that's where he gon' go to jack
Catch his first case at, become a disgrace at
But not in this world up the boulevard
I'ma see to hit that liquor, starts so easily
The difference people in my life are dyin and I see this
My question is, to what lengths do we go so that they live
'Cause I'ma reach this

But sometimes, you don't step up and take the reigns
Man, the world'll play you cheap, should I ride

Family car gettin repot because they couldn't cover the note
Nobody knows what's to eat because there's no groceries
And the baby suffers from a rash 'cause he hasn't been changed in over a week
The oldest keeps things together, by scramblin up some powdered eggs
She's only 5, so why her mom can't keep them pimps from out her face
How could they rape in that arrestin
The mother won't admit, but she's molested, diseased and infested
With wing worms, both of her legs covered with ring burns
She cleans up, but whoever heard of some clean germs
I seen the, hurt in her mama's eyes, she tramatized
Been beat up, ever since her father died, no harmonize

(Mr. Doctor)
It's hard for me to talk about the good things in my life
With all the things I did for stripes
And the way I made my gramps and my mama cry
This life is real, and I ain't got time to care about you
Just sell smack to you, and sell crack to you, and sell a sack to you
Never give back to you, unless you know me and you owe me
And never worry about your dreams, that's you the bigga the lil' homie
Here to corrupt you for sho', like my pops did and he did it wrong
Now he lost everything he owned and he lost everyone he knows
Here to corrupt you fo' sho'
Like a ??? showin you the ropes
And introduce you to all kinds of good stuff like alcohol and weed smoke
And dice games, take you to places you may die
And the whole time we rollin, I'ma say, man, this the real way to survive

Big Red,"Hier encore j'ai mal dormi,
J'ai cru entendre du bruit,
Le lendemain j'ai appris
Que les keufs avaient fait une sauterie. 
Fruit de l'opération, un homme mort dans un lit. 
Cela fait déjà une semaine si on en croit l'autopsie. 
Ça fait maintenant 1001 nuits 
Que j'ai le sommeil légué. 
Je n'ai fermé qu'un œil, les sirènes m'ont réveillées. 
J'ai vu des gyrophares bleus fuser dans toute la ville 
A la poursuite de voitures aux mains de conducteurs habiles. 
Mes voisins d'en face, je les ai jamais sentis, 
Car du soir au matin, j'entendais des cris, 
C'était le mari qui tabassait 
Sa femme et ses enfants. 
Mais le jour de son jugement, 
On lui a dit, t'es innocent. 
2 3 mecs de mon quartier sont partis s'amuser en boîte, 
Et pour pas finir dans la boîte, armés jusqu'au coup ils débarquent. 
Ça s'éclate un max, tout le monde est pété au whisky, 
En 10 secondes ça tourne en coup de bouteille et en coup de slash. 
Je suis choqué quand je vois dormir des SDF dehors, 
Allongés par terre, j'ai l'impression qu'ils sont morts, 
Perdus dans leurs cauchemars entre la vie et la mort, 
C'est à la morgue que cet hiver on retrouvera leur corps. 
Ça fait à peine 5 minutes qu'un détenu est libérable, 
Les murs l'ont rendus instable, 
Je crois qu'il a pété un câble. 
La nuit est à sa merci, y a rien de bon dans son regard. 
Le lendemain très tôt, retour à la case départ. 

Pour un oui pour un non ça prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui déraille
Gare à ce moment là, que les cœurs soient de taille
Je marche à un mètre du sol et je suis super fly

Pour un oui pour un non ça prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui déraille
Gare à ce moment là, que les cœurs soient de taille
Je marche à un mètre du sol et je suis super fly

A notre instar dans le ghetto c'est l'abattoir. 
Vaut mieux être vigilant et vivre sur ton trottoir 
Les espoirs sont minces, tu connais l'histoire 
Fais gaffes à toi le soir on t'attend dans ton couloir. 
Perdu dans une soirée où je suis même pas invité,

C'est un fusil à pompe nucléaire qu'auront les caillera
Avec un vrai laser que ton petit jouera
Tomberont par terre un à un tous les chefs d'Etat
Chacun tient son quartier et c'est chacun pour soi
Respecte pas le règlement et je t'arrache un bras

Mais sachez que nous disparaîtrons tous
Après ce jour il n'y aura pas de repousse
Plus de fleurs, plus de bactériens, niqués tous
Plus d'odeurs, de parfums de café et de mousse
Plus de comeback de terriens
Alors tu te la mets derrière l'oreille et tu tousses
Tousse bien...
