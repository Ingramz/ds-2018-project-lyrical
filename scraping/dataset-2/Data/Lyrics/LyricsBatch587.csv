Leo Reisman & His Orchestra,"I love to ride the ferry 
Where music is so merry
There's a man who plays a concertina
On the moonlit upperdeck arena
While boys and girls are dancing
While sweethearts are romancing
Life it like a mardi gras
Funiculi Funicula
Happy, as we cling together happy
As we sing together happy
With a ferry boat serenade

Leo Reisman & His Orchestra,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,2006
Leo Reisman & His Orchestra,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Leo Reisman & His Orchestra,"I'd wait for you
I'd slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly move
The earth for you
To prove my love, dear
And its worth for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along.

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you darling
Come what may
My heart is yours
What more can I say?

I'd lie for you
I'd sigh for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you baby
Come what may
My heart is yours
What more can I say?

I'd lie for you
I'd cry for you
I'd lay my body down and die tor you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along",(It Will Have to Do) Until the Real Thing Comes Along,2009
Leo Reisman & His Orchestra,"What is this thing called love,
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery? 
Why should it make a fool of me?

I saw you there one wonderful day.
You took my heart and you threw it away.

Now I ask the Lord in heaven above,
""What is this thing called love?""",What Is This Thing Called Love [From Husbands And Wives (1992)],2010
Leo Reisman & His Orchestra,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings,2012

Leo Robin,"I'll be in my room alone
Ev'ry Post Meridian
And I'll be with my diary
And that book by Mister Gideon
Bye bye baby,
Remember you're my baby
When they give you the eye
Although I know that you care,
Won't you write and declare
That though on the loose,
You are still on the square,
I'll be gloomy
But send the rainbow to me
Then my shadows will fly,
Though you'll be gone for a while
I know that I'll be smiling With my baby bye and bye
Bye, bye baby,
Remember you're my baby
When they give you the eye,
And just to show that I care,
I will write and declare
That I'm on the loose,
But I'll stay on the square,
I'll be lonely
But even though I'm lonely
There'll be no other guy,
Though I'll be gone for a while
I know that I'll be smiling
With my baby bye and bye
With my baby, bye and bye",Bye Bye Baby,1953
Leo Robin,"The French are glad to die for love
They delight in fighting duels
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat

Men grow cold 
As girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end

But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't loose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

Tiffany's
Cartier
Black Starr
Frost Gorham
Talk to me Harry Winston
Tell me all about it

There may come a time 
When a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice or else no dice

He's your guy 
When stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend

It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

And I think affairs 
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets 
If little pets get big baguettes

Time rolls on
And youth is gone
And you can't straighten up when you bend

But stiff back 
Or stiff knees
You stand straight at Tiffany's

Diamonds
Diamonds
I don't mean rhinestones
But diamonds are a girl's best 
Best friend",Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,1953
Leo Robin,"Night and you and Blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me
Lovely you and Blue Hawaii
With all this loveliness there should be love

Come with me while the moon is on the sea
The night is young and so are we, so are we

Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you

Come with me while the moon is on the sea (the moon is on the sea)
The night is young and so are we (so are we)

Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you",Blue Hawai'i,1997
Leo Robin,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner,2003
Leo Robinson,"Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita",Chiquitita,1996
Leo Robinson,"Can you hear the drums Fernando
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

I would, my friend, Fernando

Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando",Fernando,1996
Leo Robinson,"Half past twelve
Watchin' the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend
The evening on my own

Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so
Depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day

Movie stars
On end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win
It's so different from
The world I'm living in

Tired of TV
I open the window
And I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see
No one in sight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away

Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house

Leo Robinson,"I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

(Don't go sharing your devotion)

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride

At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf

Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo

I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to

Leo Robinson,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play
The winner takes it all, the loser standing small
Beside the victory, that's her destiny

I was in your arms thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool, playing by the rules
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here loses someone dear

The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain

But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same when she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide the likes of me abide
Spectators of the show always staying low

The game is on again, a lover or a friend
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad
And I understand you've come to shake my hand
I apologize if it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all",The Winner Takes It All,1996

Leo Robinson,"Lady, morning's just a moment away, 
And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Cause I needed you so desperately.
We were too blind to see, but then,
Most of all, I do love you",Still,1996
Leo Robinson,"Thanks for the times that you've given me,
The memories are all in mind.
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud!

Your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you.
Yes, your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!

When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart.
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you.
There's nothing to keep us apart
You're once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!
I love you !",Three Times a Lady,1996

Don't know here he's gone
It's been so long, but I'm on the road
And though it ain't been easy
At least I made it on my own
My tongue's been tied for far too long
And now your gonna hear me
At least I now where I belong

Hello hello, I'm on my own
Ah y'see everybody's got someone
To lay their troubled lives upon
I'm really glad I've only got my own
Once upon a time, well I had lots of friends
I moved freely through their lives
But two's a couple and, well three's a crowd

Hanging around
I've had as much now as I can take

Speaking on the mass
She talks in splice and splinters
She laughs not breaking glass

She says that she would have me
Spirit her away
Stealing all my images
Till there's nothin' left to say

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor
My heart is just a scar

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

She tells me that she wants me
Then she tells me not to bother
She tells me that I couldn't hold
A candle to her father

She knows that she's got me
When I start to rave about
She'll just smile and flash her eyes
And blow the candle out

Oh, Magdalena
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

Magdalena lying there
Could make a dancer stumble
Make a preacher bite his tongue
And leave him with a mumble

And if you think I'm crazy, babe
Or that I'm kiddin' you
Just pay your dues and lose your blues
When she gets her tongue in you

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor
My heart is just a scar

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

Well, I can't be forgotten and I can't be ignored
You find me with my poems and my songs
But if upon your journey, you're returning to L.A.
Won't you take this little red-haired girl along?

Leo Sayer,"Papers lie there helplessly
In a pile outside the door
I tried and tried, but I just can't remember
What they're for

The world outside is tugging
Like a beggar at my sleep
Ah, that's much too old
A story to believe

And you know
That it's taken it's share of me
Even though
You take such good care of me

Now, you say Morocco
And that makes me smile
I haven't seen Morocco
For a long, long while

The dreams are rolling down
Across the places in my mind
And I've just had
A taste of something fine

The future hides and the past just slides
England lies between
Floating in a silver mist
So cold and so clean

And California's shaking
Like some angry child will
Who has asked for love
And isn't answered still

And you know
That I'm looking back carefully
'Cause I know
That there's still something there for me

But you said Morocco
And it made me smile
And it hasn't been that easy
For a long, long while

And looking back into your eyes
I saw them really shine
Giving me a taste
Of something fine, something fine

Now, if you see Morocco
I know you'll go in style
I may not see Morocco
For a little while

But while you're there
I was hoping you might keep it in your mind
To save me just a taste
Of something fine
",Something Fine,1978

In moments when you're so far away
In the night when i reach out to hold you

But your smile has faded overnight
Will we stay like this for a lifetime
Gettin' nothin' right, gettin' nothin' right

Why do we always have stormy weather
Why do we have it so rough
Is it so hard just to stay close together
Why can't we ever have love

Oh, i knew from the first time i saw you
I just had to make you mine
Felt so sad when you told me
About your troubled life, all about your troubled life

So here we are just a few years further
Still tryin' to make it work
I've a feelin' what we really need right now, girl

I got 'em all now babe, but I ain't got you no more-ore

Still I remember
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say
When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away

I remember everythi-ing, the dresses you used to wear-ear
You were so light and graceful, you seemed to float right through the air-air
And me, I looked so funny dancing but you loved me anyhow
Now I wish I could find somebody to love me like that now

But I remember
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say
When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away

Standin' beside of the ocean, lookin' out across the bay
I should look for companionship but it just gets in my way-ay
All the lights are flickering, out along the shore
And I see people dancin' there but I just don't dance no more

Oh I remember 
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say
When we were two young lovers dancin' the night away

Let me see you dance, let me see you da-a-ance
Ohhhh baby let me see you da-ance
I can still see you da-ance, I remember you dancin'
Ohhhh baby let me see you dance
Come on let me see you dance
Let me see you, let me see you, da-ance, da-ance, da-ance

From those sweet soul bands

Standing by you I have seen so much
Ain't it funny how I found the one

Love escapes you and you watch them fall
Giving nothing you are left to bleed
Will you ever recognize I know what you need

I want to hold you tight
Give you the rest of my life
You are my heaven
The river flows to the sea

Dressed in silence
To disguise the pain
Pure emotion doesn't know your name
Love still haunts you

Oh you know, things will change

Cause I want to hold you tight

That's something that he doesn't understand

She left him with a token
The note he is holding in his hand

Is this the end of the game
And will you put out the flame
And fly away
Don't fly away
Now let's find out who's too blame
And start all over again
Don't fly away
Don't fly away
Way across the city
Waiting on a taxi
Holding cases
Standing in the hall
Thinking ""well if only""
She's feeling sad and lonely
Hoping 'gainst all hope that he will call
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Is this the end of the game
And should I put out the flame
And fly away, and fly away
And if I walk out again
Is it true that the pain
Will fly away, fly away
Fly away
The taxi driver's talking
But she doesn't hear a single word he says
Fly away,
The tears fall so easily
Keep falling 'til she climbs aboard the plane
And it's the end of the game
With only fortune to blame

And tried and then discovered

Leo Sayer,"Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Reflections of
The love you took from
Reflections of
The way life used to be

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Now baby, why did you do it?

Half awake and half asleep
Have you ever lain there thinking
Was it all in a dream?
But you reach out and she`s there

Have you ever stayed up waiting for a telephone call?
Just to hear her say hello
'cause you miss each other so
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'cause you`d die a little if she lied
When in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out?
But still she leaves you wondering what it`s all about

When she`s far away, you ever felt the need to stray?
And tried and then discovered it just doesn`t pay
And with her you can be true

Every time when I tell you like,
You know what I mean like,
Don't fucking go mad over your chick,
This that, this that,
It's for your own good,
Its called, na na, it is, its called experience.
Bruv, you know what yeah, what experience?
What so you've gone mad over a chick.
Yeah I have once, and I'm not doing that shit again,
You're fucking crazy.

There's no point in telling her the truth,
Cos she's not gonna believe it.
You know what I mean,
She's just gonna listen to her friends,
Her fucking friends, you know what I mean.
So like, just like, forget about her, let's go get some drinks,
You know what I mean, go check some more yetis.

Bruv why did she hang up?
I know there's still anger
I put my hands up ? yes I was a wanker.
I did lead with Tanya, when I left Tantra,
She had one too many so I called a cab.
I don?t understand her, I never did grab her
She?s listening to Amber, and we don?t get on,
OK before, I did get caught,
But to jeopardise us again, I couldn?t do.
Her friend, ain?t talking sense,
See me and Tanya we?re only just breadrins
Her friend, never saw anything
We got in, I dropped her off to her rents.

{CHORUS}
This morning it got light, but I?d still not been to sleep,
Thinking of what to do to ease this grief.
I know I lied but I had a reason please believe,
I fold the pillow, and try n squeeze some sleep


{Verse 2 ? Mike Skinner}
Please don?t delete, my phone number please,
I know you don?t need, to mope about me.
I did go with Lis, she phoned to speak,
She wants me back, but I want you.
Don?t shoot through, you?re going to lose
A bloke who?s truly devoted to you
I owe to you, to know a few truths,
Home truth truths, you going to screw.
Your friends, are not talking sense,
Are you sure your head ignores them?
Your friends, never saw anything,
We talked then, I walked to my ends.

{CHORUS}

{Verse 3}

Bruv I?ll tell you this for free, Ambers chatting shit again.
She needs to go on Trisha, with all her fucking shenanigans.
She?s just sad and bitter, cos her and her man split up.
So now she wants her and the girls to be a gang of spinsters.
And bruv, huh, I told you, you cant be chatting to Tanya.
So when she calls you, just blank her.
That night I went to Ten Rooms after Tantra,
But I didn?t think you and her would jump in the same cab bruv.
Listen bruv, just give your girl time and space.
Maybe a couple of days, to get her mind straight.
Serious bruv listen, ?llow it for a bit,
And if she?s got any sense, she?ll know Amber?s chatting shit.

Like, you know when you got a good girl,
Or you know when she means something to you, & you got like, a name. 

Here we go again
Here we go

Like I had a name for this girl, I used to call her ""ladybird"",
Cos she always played red, in connect four. 

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

Look, 
I call her nite nite
But we getting on fine right,
I don't wanna spoil it,
I don't why I can't commit to girls,
And I tell white lies, I'll find out the hard way,
Cos she got my favourite smile, her favourite style,
The first hotel, my favourite time, 
And maybe later we could have a baby, maybe a baby boy, my 
Favourite child,
""I'm way too tired"", my favourite lie,
I wasnt too sure of her favourite rhyme
The windows are steaming up like it's naked time,
Wait, we're way too bait,
I bought her favourite shoes, or they better be,
And she's even my favourite size,
And she knows I hate holding hands, and I'm hooded up when it's 
Bait inside,
So I guess she's my favorite, right? 

Right,
Cos nothing comes close to you. 

So numbers? No boys are taking yours,
And no girls are taking mine,
Groupies? **** that, I'm taking time,
We speak from like 8 till late at night,
When we gets on top, drop my favourite line:

Girl, I ain't going nowhere. 

I plain ain't going nowhere,
But, I like you, and it might take some time,
But really I'm like

But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

I call her sometimes, and I wake her up at some dumb times,
Touch my phone, and her number my thumb finds,
Cos she's ideal, like a nice meal,
And a night in, with a nice feel,
Maybe some wine,
Maybe sometime we could hold hands in the park, in the sunshine,
Sometimes,
Be patient with me if I got 3 raves in 1 week,
Or in a studio, away for a week, 
One we could book a vacation and leave,
But please: ""no drama"", I don't need beef like (? )
I'm just focused on making the peas, breaking the team, chasing a 
Dream,
I ain't on the street, maybe sometimes, 
But you can't say I don't make enough time,
We speak everyday and meet everyweek,
So I dunno. Maybe it's me. 
You? you got it planned out,
I don't make plans,
You know me, I wait and I see,
But if we were together, or even now,
If we weren't ""sort-of"", but were together,
Would you be faithfull to me? 
Treat me massage me and make me a tea? 
Come link me, lay and wake up from sleep, and look hot like 80 
Degrees? 

And you know I never say that sort of thing

See? that's an angel to me
I wouldn't have said that before, you get me?

I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,

But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, ow,
Baby we could do this again sometime,
I even have a special name for you,
It's ""long baby"", cos you always on my mind, yeah. 
I'll tell you straight, so straight, yeah,
I won't tell my mates,
No, no, I know, no, I know, oh

And your temper starts to rile up,
That's the time a fellow needs a song.

Doctor, Banker, Butcher, Baker,
You can be a merry maker,
If you'll keep on singing all day long.

If you're hanging in suspense from eight till five,
And you want to keep the sense of humor alive.
Just, whistle while you work (whistle)
Put on that grin and start right in, 
To whistle loud and long.

Just hum a merry tune (hum)
Just do your best,
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song.

When there's too much to do,
Don't let it bother you, 
Forget your trouble, try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee,
And whistle while you work (whistle)

Leon & Malia,"There was a time
There was a place I loved
That was my moment
That's just the way it was

Careless and crazy
Running to, God knows where
Now where is that heartland?
Where is the one who cares?

I can hear you calling
Wandering boy, come home soon
I hear the music
I see your face in the moon

Who am I fooling?
There's no need for me to pretend
I might sail forever
And never find that island again

I fight with my mem'ry
Find all the pieces I can
Of a beautiful woman
Who trusted her heart in my hands

Now what kind of sailor
Would let such a dream get lost?
Tonight we'd be sailing
Out under the southern cross

I can hear you calling
Wandering boy, come home soon
I hear the music
I see your face in the moon

Who am I fooling?
There's no need for me to pretend
I might sail forever

Laura, touch these lips you once desired
Lay your head upon my chest and hear my heartbeat
Gently run your fingers through my hair

Most of them, fulfilled and that's a lot
Let your soft gentle hands caress my body
And then tell me what he's got that I ain't got

Must be something I was born without
You took an awful chance to be with another man
So tell me what he's got that I ain't got

Laura, see these walls that I built for you
Laura, see this carpet that I laid
See those fancy curtains on the windows
Touch those satin pillows on your bed

Laura, count the dresses in your closet
Note the name upon the checkbook in your bag
And if there's time before I pull this trigger
Then tell me what he's got that I ain't got

Leon Ashley,"My little boy came into the kitchen this evening
While I was fixing supper
And he handed me a piece of paper he'd been writing on
And after wiping my hands on my apron
I read it - and this is what it said

For mowing the yard - five dollars
And for making my own bed this week - one dollar
And for going to the store - fifty cents
An' playing with little brother, while you went shopping 
Twenty-five cents
Taking out the trash - one dollar
Getting a good report card - five dollars
And for raking the yard - two dollars
Total owed - fourteen seventy-five.

Well, I looked at I'm standing there expectantly
And a thousand memories flashed through my mind
So I picked up the pen, turning the paper over,
This is what I wrote:

For nine months I carried you
Growing inside me - no charge
For the nights I've sat up with you,
Doctored you, prayed for you - no charge
For the time and the tears.
And the cost through the years, there's no charge
When you add it all up.
The full cost of my love is no charge.

For the nights filled with dread
And the worries ahead - no charge
For advice and the knowledge
And the cost of your college - no charge
For the toys, food and clothes and for wiping your nose
There's NO CHARGE, son
When you add it all up,
The full cost of my love, is - charge.

Well, when he finished readin'
He had great big old tears in his eyes
And he looked up at me and he said,
""Mama, I sure do love you.""
Then he took the pen,
And in great big letters
He wrote: ""Paid in full.""

When you add it all up
The cost of real love is - no charge.",Laura (What's He Got That I Ain't Got),1984

León Benavente,"Un día me eché a las calles dispuesto a cambiar de vida
Me había visto en el espejo y no me reconocía
""¿Podría estudiar otra vez?"" me dije ""Filosofía""
Quizá me conozca mejor y encuentre alguna salida
Así que dejé mi trabajo
Dejé pareja e hijos
Vendí mi coche, quemé mi ropa, fundí mi oro
Ahora lo entiendo todo
Ahora soy feliz
Siento una extraña euforia
Ahora soy feliz
Esto sí que es la gloria
Tan pronto se hizo de noche, entré en el bar de la esquina
Te vi con una compañera de mi antigua oficina
""¿Tú crees que estoy loca?"" me dijo mientras reía
Y una pequeña lágrima se escurrió por mi mejilla

Entonces fuimos a su casa
Hicimos lo que hacen los perros
Lamiéndonos las heridas
Justo después de corrernos
Fue como subir a una noria
Ahora soy feliz
Siento una extraña euforia
Ahora soy feliz
Esto sí que es la gloria
De allí salí dispuesto a destruir la mañana
En busca de gente que me explicara qué pasa en España
¿Por qué nos corroe la envidia?
¿A santo de qué tanta fiesta?
¿Por qué se intenta evitar todo lo que molesta?
Entonces pensé en el fútbol
En la democracia y la siesta

Y en lo que distingue a una persona de una bestia
Tengo la cara que me merezco
Tengo el país que me merezco
Y ahora soy feliz
Siento una extraña euforia
Ahora soy feliz
Esto sí que es la gloria
Hoy era un día para empezar
Desde cero
Hoy era un buen día para hacer un balance completo
Hoy bien podría haber cambiado
Mi destino
Pero lo único que he hecho es emborracharme y ser un cretino
Es una triste historia
Y ahora soy feliz
Siento una extraña euforia
Ahora soy feliz
Esto sí que es la gloria",Gloria,2016
León Benavente,"Nunca pensamos en cruzar tantas veces el charco
Al menos nuca para hacer este trabajo
Ahora hay dos taxis en la esquina para hacernos olvidar

Nuestra casa, la rutina y nuestro miedo a volar

De camino al aeropuerto alguien empieza a toser
Se queja de que en los aviones no se puede comer
Es temprano y en la radio se da a conocer
Al que estampó su coche en la sede del PP

Una vez más sin saber qué nos va a pasar
Algo se aproxima pero no sabemos qué
Edu se toma un café con toda tranquilidad
Y hablamos del futuro y la partenidad

Y justo al sobrevolar los Cayos de florida
Empezamos a pensar cómo a cambiado nuestra vida
Al fin y al cabo los aviones no están mal
Siempre que tengas a mano vino y Orfidal

Tras veinte horas de sol, vamos a aterrizar
Desde el cielo el D.F es descomunal
La gente aplaude las hazañas del piloto al posar
Semejante bicho en medio de la cuidad

Y a César le han retenido en el control de inmigración
Se asusta cuando va llegar dos tipos de la Interpol
Saben su vida y él empieza a temblar
Comprueban que era un error y le dejan marchar

El aire pesa como el plomo y nos cuesta respirar
Lo notamos justo cuando salimos a fumar
Ahora nos lleva una van a la Colonia Roma
El conductor tiene tres hijos, su mujer está en coma
""En estos baches pueden ver la corrupcción
Esto sólo se arregla con otra revolución""
En el hotel hay bienvenida con tequila y mezcal
Y unos chicos esperando una banda de metal

Habitación 615
Una cama gigante, mil posturas posibles
Una biblia en la mesa, un par de crucifijos
Y en la puerta Saturno devorando a sus hijos

Y ahora oigo a Luis hablar con España
Allí es invierno y su novia le extraña
Yo me pego una ducha y me quedo tranquilo
Y pienso en cenar y dormir contigo

Y en un cuaderno escribo lo que ha pasado
Y palabras que han cambiado de significado
Contrato, amigo, dinero, edad, música
Trabajo, ego, vanidad

¿Quien quiere seguir? ¿Quien se apunta a ir a un bar?
¡Por dios, si acabamos de llegar!
Uno se pone a reír, otro a organizar
A veces pienso que esto no lo vamos a aguantar
Y tras dos tequilas y otros dos mezcales
Empezamos a hablar sobre las multinacionales
Y salen cifras y porcentajes, estamos muy tensos, no hay quien se relaje

¿Y que queréis saber sobre las canciones?
Si estan bien hechas, no hacen falta explicaciones
¿Y a quién le importa nuestra opinión
Sobre el amor, la política o la secesión?
Y de vuelta al hotel escucho a Kozelek
Y pienso en una canción que podríamos hacer
Algo que sea real, totalmente real
Estos días recorriendo el Distrito Federal

Y entro a comprar un disco de Juan Cicerol
Y me dicen que recién, recién se les agotó
Y eso me hace feliz y me pongo a gritar
Ese tipo es el puto nuevo Johnny Cash

Y pienso en cuando nos dicen que aprovechemos
Que no sabemos cuánto duraremos
Enciendo el televisor cansado de esta jornada
56 canales en los que no hay nunca nada

Te llamé mientras despertabas
Y me dijiste: ""La vida nunca es lo que imaginabas""
Sé que tienes razon, sueles tener razón
Pero sigo sin llegar a una conclusión
Otro día de promo, de prisas y atascos
De gente que tarda en llegar a su trabajo
¿Y que tendrá lo que digamos de relevante?
Mejor leer a Gragera, a Tiqqun o a Carver

Y otra vez el vacío y la soledad
Y otro taxi que nos lleve a toda velocidad
A volver a beber y a bailar rocanrol
Y llamar a un contacto que nos haga un favor
¿Y qué nos puede quedar, a decir verdad?
Ya tendremos tiempo para descansar
Y por ahora es todo lo que os puedo contar
Quizá en un par de años pueda continuar",Habitación 615,2016
León Benavente,"No es que hayamos aprendido mucho de un tiempo a esta parte
Es casi imposible dar un paso sin hacerse daño

Ahá, nuevas tierras
¿Cómo es que decís que ha llegado el siglo xxi
Si aquí no hemos notado nada en especial?
Quizá un poco más de polvo en nuestros hombros
Busquemos otro lugar al que poder huir
Busquemos un nuevo lugar para destruir

Ahá, nuevas tierras

Ahá nuevas tierras
Ahá nuevas tierras
Nuevos problemas

León Gieco,"Los viejos amores que no están
La ilusión de los que perdieron
Todas las promesas que se van

Todo está guardado en la memoria
Sueño de la vida y de la historia

El engaño y la complicidad
De los genocidas que están sueltos
El indulto y el Punto Final
A las bestias de aquel infierno

Todo está guardado en la memoria
Sueño de la vida y de la historia

La memoria despierta para herir
A los pueblos dormidos
Que no la dejan vivir
Libre como el viento

Los desaparecidos que se buscan
Con el color de sus nacimientos
El hambre y la abundancia que se juntan
El maltrato con su mal recuerdo

Dos mil comerían por un año
Con lo que cuenta un minuto militar
Cuántos dejarían de ser esclavos
Por el precio de una bomba al mar

La memoria pincha hasta sangrar
A los pueblos que la amarran

La justicia que mira y no ve

Todo está escondido en la memoria
Refugio de la vida y de la historia

Fue cuando se callaron las iglesias
Fue cuando el fútbol se lo comió todo
Que los padres palotinos y Angelelli
Dejaron su sangre en el lodo

León Gieco,"El tiempo pasa
Nos vamos poniendo viejos
Yo el amor
No lo reflejo como ayer

En cada conversación
Cada beso cada abrazo
Se impone siempre un pedazo
De razón

Vamos viviendo
Viendo las horas
Que van pasando
Las viejas discusiones

Se van perdiendo
Entre las razones
Porque años atrás
Tomar tú mano

Robarte un beso
Sin forzar el momento
Hacía parte de una verdad

Porque el tiempo pasa
Nos vamos poniendo viejos
Yo el amor
No lo reflejo como ayer

En cada conversación
Cada beso cada abrazo
Se impone siempre un pedazo
De razón

A todo dices que sí
A nada digo que no
Para poder construir
Esta tremenda armonía
Que pone viejo los corazones

Porque el tiempo pasa
Nos vamos poniendo viejos
Yo el amor
No lo reflejo como ayer

En cada conversación
Cada beso cada abrazo
Se impone siempre un pedazo
De temor

",Años,
León Gieco,"Sentado solo en un banco en la ciudad
Con tu mirada recordando el litoral
Tu suerte quiso estar partida, mitad verdad, mitad mentira
Como esperanza de los pobres prometida

Andando solo bajo la llovizna gris
Fingiendo duro que tu vida fue de aquí
¿Porque cambiaste un mar de gente por donde gobierna la flor?
Mira que al río nunca le falto el color

Carito suelta tu pena
Se haga diamante tu lagrima entre mis cuerdas
Carito suelta tu piedra
Para volar como el zorzal en primavera

En Buenos Aires los zapatos son modernos
Pero no lucen como en la plaza de un pueblo
Deja que tu luz, chiquitita, le hable en secreto a la canción
Para que te ilumine un poco mas el sol

Cualquier semilla cuando es planta quiere ver la
Misma estrella de aquel atardecer
Que la salvo del pico agudo, refugiándola en lo oscuro
De la gaviota arrasadora de los surcos

Carito yo soy tu amigo
Me ofrezco árbol para tu nido
Carito suelta tu canto que el abanico
En mi acordeón lo esta esperando

",Canción Para Carito,
León Gieco,"Bajaste del norte 
Sin mas que cuatro hijos 
Y aquel cielo de tus ojos 
Y una mujer que te aprendió a seguir 

Buscabas el peso 
Sin darte por vencido 
Mas al final de cada día 
Las manos vaciás 
Volvías a encontrar 

Por eso te entiendo 
Cuando en un vaso te vas 
Quien sabe adonde 
Buscando eso que llaman paz 
Y aunque sabes que te dicen 
Viejo borracho sos tan bueno 
Que ni siquiera al diablo los mandas 
Los mandas",Bajaste del Norte,1981
León Gieco,"La cultura es la sonrisa

Mas la cultura se queda aquÃ­

Puede estar en una madre
En un amigo o en la flor

Manos duras de un trabajador

Con fuerzas milenarias
Ella espera mal herida
Prohibida o sepultada
A que venga el seÃ±or tiempo

León Gieco,"Justo ayer me di cuenta
Que solo es cuestión de plata
Mientras diez ventanillas cobran
Una sola es la que paga
De como piensa la gente
A veces la diferencia
Es tan grande que parecen
Seres de alguna otra tierra
Y que me dicen de esa casa sola
Que se ve desde un avión

Quizá en la soledad no haya dolor
De pensar, de pensar en nada
En la oficina del trabajo
Llegando el año nuevo

Algunos la viven de rosa

León Gieco,"Me pueden mirar de arriba hacia abajo 
Y yo de abajo solo puedo ver el cielo

Soy, solo soy un pobre agujero 

Ni siquiera soy el de una guitarra 
Ni vendrán los arqueologos en busca de un hueso 
Soy, solo soy un pobre agujero 

No tengo cuerpo ni me sopla el viento 
Para el arregla calles quizás no molesto 
Solo tengo adentro, soy un pobre agujero 

Hace ya tiempo soy amigo de un trapo 
Y de un solo gusano que el sol pone ciego 
Soy, solo soy un pobre agujero 

Después de las lluvias crio renacuajos 
Pero cuando se van quedo solo en silencio 
Soy, solo soy un pobre agujero 

Vivo tranquilo en mi solo bolsillo 
Casi siempre vacío o algún bicho pasajero

Corrientes estaba prendido,
y un solo grito se oyÃ³
cuando el correntino entrÃ³:

Atascado en el camino de la vida

Para obviar o no creer

Don't worry, be happy

But when you worry, you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo hoo-hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry

He may have to litigate
Don't worry, (ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha) be happy (look at me, I'm happy)

Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Be happy

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile

While we dance make romance
I'm enchanted by the things that you do
 
I love music, sweet sweet music
Long as it's swinging, all the joy that it's bringing
 
I'm so happy to be in complete harmony, I love you boy
And to hold you so close in my arms, I'm so glad you're mine
all mine mine
 
Nothing can be better than a sweet love song
So sweet so sweet so mellow
When you got the girl that you love in your arm
Oh honey I love you I love you yeah
Music is the healing force of the world
It's understood by every man woman boy and girl
And that's why that's why I say
I love music
Any kind of music
Long as it's swinging
All the joy that it's bringing

'Cause my love is secret
And it's getting harder to keep it
But I'll wait my time
Before I put my heart on the line
So no TV broadcast no overhead sign
That's not the way you'll find out 'bout this love of mine
You won't know how you know it but you're gonna know it
All in good time

So many ways to communicate
Tell me why, why do I hesitate
The words they get stuck in my mouth
It's up to you to read between the lines
Move closer baby just read the signs
But please make it soon

So maybe this Winter or when Spring has arrived
There'll come a day when this love I can no longer hide
But you're gonna know it I'll make sure that you know it 
All in good time

But one day you'll see that I was good for you, honey

But baby I can learn
I wanna leave you with the kind
Of exit you deserve
So lock the room and let's turn off all the ringing phones
Why don't we make it you and me yeah me and you alone

CHORUS;
See baby all I wanna do is leave my fingerprints on you
I wish we had more than tonight
To do the things we wanna do
I gotta go soon as the sun says hello
Goodbye the moon
So baby all I wanna do is leave my fingerprints on you

I wish I had the power to stop the ticking clocks
I wish I had a little more of every inch you've got
I'm waiting on the world to change
So one day I'll see you again
But now I'll take what I can get
Darlin' until then

See baby all I wanna do is leave my fingerprints on you
I wish we had more than tonight

And its far too late
You never saw,
The writing on the wall
Buts its no use
When the love is gone
And you try but you just can't carry on
When every right just turns out wrong

Now I am lost without the two of us
And your not the one to blame

Cause with you there was no Ordinary Day
No Ordinary Days
Yeah no Ordinary Days

Now I can't believe
I could be so blind
No I didn't see
I didn't see the warning signs

You were the light in my life
But you just could not carry on
'Cause every right just turned out wrong.

I've sung a lot of songs
I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life on stages with ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, I've treated you unkindly
But Darling can't you see There's no one more important to me
Baby, can't you see through me, 'cause we're alone now
And I'm singing this song for you, you taught me precious secrets
Of a true love withholding nothing, you came out in front
When I was hiding,
But now am so much better
An if my words don't come together,listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time, I love you from my life
Your a friend of mine, and when my life is over
Remember, when we were together
We were alone, and I was singing this song to you

I love you in a place where there's no space or time, I love you from my life

I'll paint my life before I loved you

And oh now

Like I'm Fred Astaire

I feel the grand allure
It happens every time
That you walk through my door

Leon Jackson,"Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood

Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long
Before we knew we could

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

Easy to despair
When all you hear is fear and lies
Easy just to run and hide
Too frightened to begin

But if we dare to dare
Don't wait for answers from the skies
Each of us can look inside
And hear this song within

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fear
But when your blinded by your faith
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small, but still resilient voice
Says hope is very near, ohh

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
(Now you will)
And now you will

You will, when you believe
You will, when you believe

Ice is forming on the river
The barges are held in tow
Cold grey dawn, chilling to the bone

Must be ten below
Somehow you feel lost and alone out there
Feeling like you ought to leave
Such hard living in the cold cold world

People its time to believe
Sounds tear through the morning
You pull yourself from your bed
Try so hard to quiet your mind

Dodging thoughts of that lies dead ahead
A chance to be dashed on the rocks
Fooled by friendly lights
Shining solely to decieve

Such hard living in this cold cold world
People its time to believe
I say people its time to believe
Remember when storm clouds come

Soon the sky's gonna clear
Just put your faith in Him
Let Him wipe away your tears",Time to Believe,1999

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Leon Redbone,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know how he came to life one day
There must of been some magic in
That ol' silk hat they found
But when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said lets run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin' catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to that traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Look at Frosty go
Over the hills of snow",Frosty the Snowman,1988

Leon Russell,"Gather round me people, got a song to sing
About that sweet magnolia thyme
The black eyed Susan made some catfish stew
And papa brought some homemade wine

Now, all the southern children like to rock 'n' roll
The TV mamas tell you why
They got it on the boat from Africa
It's that Dixie lullaby

And blind Willie Time, he had a dime shoe shine
Stand down on Beale Street
And Willie would stop and say ""Hello""
To all the shoes he'd meet

""Why are you so happy?"" said the clean white buck
""You got no reason to be happy Mr. Time""
But Willie just smiled and he dropped his rag
And sang a Dixie lullaby

Now you heard the story of my southern home
With a honeysuckle wine
Anytime you think that you might come yourself
You ought to keep this thought in mind

All you easy riders better watch your step
If you're walkin' down below the line
That Louisiana man is gonna get you, yet
With his Dixie lullaby

He's got a Dixie lullaby
Ohh, it's a Dixie lullaby, bye

From Lake Charles to see me at Pontchartrain

May his name forever stand

In the ports throughout the land

And I'm locked in this room with my sorrow
No escape, no way to get away
And my only connection with tomorrow
Is hoping that you might decide not to stay away

If I could only find sweet love again
To live my life this way is too much to bare

And they're looking, not afraid to touch each other
They're not afraid to be themselves or someone else
Or choose their friends with love and not by color

Honey, won't you always try to keep the love light burning
Sing a song of love and open up your heart
For you might be the prince of peace returning
Yeah, you might be the prince of peace returning

Oh, the love the blind and wounded as that you would yourself
And the businessmen in cells collecting pennies
Judge their wealth by coins that they give away
And not the ones that they keep for themselves for spending

It might be yourself that you're burning
Sing a song of love and open up your heart
For you might be the prince of peace returning

How many days until I die

With mythology and astrology
Has got some words to say
About the way we live today
Why can't we learn to love each other
It's time to turn a new face
To the whole world wide human race

Stop the money chase
Lay back, relax
Get back on the human track
Stop racing toward oblivion

About that sweet magnolia thyme
The black eyed Susan made some catfish stew
And papa brought some homemade wine

Now, all the southern children like to rock 'n' roll
The TV mamas tell you why
They got it on the boat from Africa
It's that Dixie lullaby

And blind Willie Time, he had a dime shoe shine
Stand down on Beale Street
And Willie would stop and say ""Hello""
To all the shoes he'd meet

""Why are you so happy?"" said the clean white buck
""You got no reason to be happy Mr. Time""
But Willie just smiled and he dropped his rag
And sang a Dixie lullaby

Now you heard the story of my southern home
With a honeysuckle wine
Anytime you think that you might come yourself
You ought to keep this thought in mind

All you easy riders better watch your step
If you're walkin' down below the line
That Louisiana man is gonna get you, yet
With his Dixie lullaby

He's got a Dixie lullaby
Ohh, it's a Dixie lullaby, bye

South of the border down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when stars above came out to play
Now as I wander my thoughts ever stray south of the border down Mexico way
She was a picture in old Spanish lace
And for a tender while I kissed the smile opon her face
For it was Fiesta we were so gay south of the border down Mexico way
And she smiled and she whispered Manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied and I whispered Manana for our tomorrow never came
South of the border I rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
And the mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border down Mexico way

Don't misunderstand her or play with her mind

I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme

There's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time

And I knocked on my door
And I called to my love 
As I often had before
And I knocked and I knocked 
But no answer there came
No kisses to greet me 
No voice called my name
And I couldn't believe it was true 
Oh Lord, I couldn't believe it was true
And my eyes filled with tears 
And I must have aged ten years
And I couldn't believe it was true

The shock was so great 
I am quivering yet 
I'll try to forgive 
But I cannot forget
My heartbreaking loss 
Is another man's gain
And her happiness always 
I hope will remain

A song of old San Antone.

Beneath the stars all alone.

Enchantment strange as the blue up above. 
A moonlit pass only she would know, 
Still hears my broken song of love. 
Moon in all your splendor, know only my heart 
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone. 
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart.

Sprinkled cayenne pepper in your sugar bowl

Hear the mating call of the morning dove
Like Romeo angels in the roof above

The winter of your discontent came twenty years too late
If it was love and I was there I've forgotten where it lives
We both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge
You came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing
Reaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air

And yeah I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes

Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands
Your cloak and dagger legacy's gone home to no man's land
The marquee lights are flickering your poster's fading fast
Your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass

And yeah I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page

There's a change of guard every day
When you're clinging onto a driftwood boat

Just a chain link fence full of birds
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay
You'll be rolling through the pages lost for words

I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight

With a broken sun above the clouds
Caught like Jonah forty fathoms down

A far cry from a tattooed rose
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho

When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I said to that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord, I hate to see here go

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I went back home, my home was lonesome
Missed my mother, she was gone
All of my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

We sang the songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Newspaper says to look for rain today
No one around for company
And so I turn to memories to pass the time away
Each face that flashes back to mind
Seems as it was untouched by time
I can't recall quite all the names
Each one is precious all the same
How strange to think
How many friends were lost somewhere behind

[Chorus]
Where are they now
How I miss those companions
Who walked the canyons of the night
By my side
Where are they now
Like so many crazy dancers
We live only for the answers in a song
But that was long ago
Where are they now
When love was new and wonderful
There was no word impossible
The future we saw with our minds
Was something of our hearts design
Between today and yesterday
Life came between us all

My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open, yes it was

I was trapped in my mind
A prisoner of my own design
Lost in a world
In a world of confusion

Couldn't find no help nowhere else
Thought I'd call up the hotline
But there was nobody there

When you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my chimney
Laying on my trampoline, looking at the stars
From my fake space fog machine

From the push that you had
I said I loved you, said it back

That we was sippin on our sushi-ridden dinner date
Oh, you think you special now?
Other bitches trippin' now
Cause we're fleeing to the moon

All those boys gonna step aside
When they hear this old ex-gator play, Listen

When I'm human

And everyone's gonna bow down to me

I want just the life I had
A great big party every night
That doesn't sound too bad

A brunette on my right
A blonde or two to hold the candles
Now that seems just about right
Eh, Louis?

When you're done, you're done
We're on this earth 
To have some fun
And that's the way things are

And I'm gonna be
I'm gonna tear it up like I did before
And that's the royal guarantee

Your modesty becomes you
And your sense of responsibility
I've worked hard for everything I've got
And that's the way it's supposed to be

When I'm a human being
At least I'll act like one
If you do your best each and every day
Good things are sure to come your way

What you give is what you get
My daddy said that 
And I'll never forget
And I commend it to you

And we're gonna be

I'm gonna live the high life

I'm gonna do my best 
To take my place in the sun

I see it, you see it,
What we have is made of gold
We're so filled with meaning,
Nothing can make us shallow
So I hold it, and you hold it
The promise of tomorrow
When we make love its overwhelming
I just touch the heavens
You're an angel, you're an angel

I said this world, this world
Could leave us any day
But my love for you, it will never go away
And I don't wanna go to sleep
Cause you are like a dream
For every night I say a prayer,
And I swear you are the answer
You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel

I don't need three wishes
Oh I just need one
For us to never be finished
For us to never be numb
When they say it's over
We'll just say I love you
And when they say it's finished
We'll just keep on building

And I said this world, this world
Could leave us any day
But my love for you, it will never go away
And I don't wanna go to sleep
Cause you are like a dream
For every night I say a prayer,
And I swear you are the answer

Whatever it takes, I'll try

Know that I will be on time

Your pink dress on the setting sun
You were going to Grandma's house, I was too scared to come

I had to run to catch you,

With your cute little smile and your silly laugh,
God gave me love at last 

My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Tell me all the things that I want to hear

Right now I wish I had

I hope you'll still be there

Where do I go when I'm so alone?
Where do I turn when you are so close?
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears I've cried, I'll survive

I'm stripped, I'm bare
I'm left here with nothing
I hold the wheel
And know where I'm going
Your face, I see, in every reflection
No time, no space
I've lost all direction
And there's no turning back this time
Gotta stay alive

Where do I go when I'm so alone?
Where do I turn when you are so close?
We try not to crash but we still collide

I'm gonna get there someway
Through all the tears that you bring
And any road I can take
Just to get me some place
Where all the stars on my heart
And all the lies in the dark
Disappear in my head

Lights so bright, tonight
Gonna drive them away

And watch this life pass me by
So unhappy

Of letters that I never could write
Now I know love isn't painless,
But it's worth the risk, it's worth the fight
Playing it over and over
I wish that I could turn back time, baby
We were wrong, but we could be right

Why do we say things we can't take back
Why do we miss what we never had
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost, it couldn't be found
Why do you tend to forget whose vain
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around, love ain't the enemy
Don't you want to be lost then found
Lost then found, lost then found
Love ain't the enemy
We could be lost then found

Empty glasses on tables, echoes fill these rooms
The memories go where we go, they're like the suitcase that you never lose
If the good lord's eyes upon me
I swear to make things right
Whatever we lost, I know we can find

Why do we say things we can't take back
And why do we miss what we never had
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost, it couldn't be found
Why do you tend to forget whose vain

Get in the shower, and make my bed alone
I put on my makeup, talk into the mirror
Ready for a new day, without you

And I walk steady on my feet
I talk, my voice obeys me
I go out at night, sleep without the lights
And I do all of the things I have to
Keepin' you off my mind
But when I think I'll be alright
I am always wrong, cause

My hands don't wanna start again
My hands, no they don't wanna understand
My hands, they just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find
My hands, they only agree to hold your hands
And they don't wanna be without your hands
And they will not let me go
No they will not let me go

I talk about you now
And go a day without crying
I go out with my friends now
I stay home all alone
And I don't see you everywhere
And I can say your name easily
I laugh a bit louder, without you

And I see different shades now
I'm almost, never, afraid now

I cannot fake, 'cause when they cry I'm unspoken
They miss holding my baby

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge

Just can't let it go
Just trying to play my role
Slowly disappear, oh
But all these days, they feel like they're the same
Just different faces, different names
Get me out of here
I can't stand by your side, oh no
And watch this life pass me by, pass me by

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
'Cause I'm just trying to be happy, oh, happy, oh

So any turns that I can't see,
like I'm a stranger on this road
But don't say victim
Don't say anything

So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge

On somebody's face

Quickly cover up your head
Don't you lock the doors
You know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way

Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

When we're skating in the park
If the storm cloud makes it dark
Then your rosy cheeks are gonna light
My merry way

Now the frosticals appeared
And they've frozen up my hair
And so we'll lie by the fire
Till the sleep simply melts them all away

Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

When the snowman brings the snow
He just might like to know
He's put a great big smile

So if Santa brings that sleigh
All around the Milky Way
I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow
Then he may decide to stay

In my window the trees they sway 

And it's so hard to find you in this cold world 
designed to bleed you grieve you 
and the dark nights proceed through 

He has a mean, mean way don't listen to his 
heart what to say 
Goes to the river, crosses the bridge 
Leaves his possessions, if they don't come with 

And it's so hard to find you in this cold world 
designed to bleed you grieve you 
and the dark nights proceed through 

So hollow without you 
I have a girl's girl play 
When I say go I mean stay 
You should know this by now 
How many women does it take to 
show you how? 

And it's so hard to find you in this cold world 
designed to bleed you grieve you 
and the dark nights proceed through ",Weak Strong Heart,2001
Leona Naess,"Come come come come
Run run run run
I'll meet you halfway
What do you say?
Paper thin was my heart
'Till you tore it apart
Now I'm a weak strong heart

Belongs to no one
No one belongs to me

So,
Come come come come
Run run run run
You know it ain't much fun
Chasing after you hon
So forget about you and me
The remains are too delicate to see
And I only wanted to hear your name

Dance through my window
Like sun stretched across my bed

Pull me away
You keep on pulling me away

Come come come come
Run run run run
It's more dizzy than fun
Chasing after the warmth of the sun

And I know I will survive
What don't kill you only makes you more alive
And I hate to hear them say
Time will heal you
Steal you from fear
To ever love again

You keep on pulling me away

Oh oh oh

Pull me away
You keep on pulling me away",Come Come,2001
Leona Naess,"Walls are building
Bridges crumbling
Summer's caving in
Seas are rising
And friends analyzing
Well, someone's letting go
And I'm somewhere in the middle of the shadows in the meadows
Trying to let you know

He's somewhere out there
Straightening his tie
Looking for the answer
And the question is why
Still I love him the most
My favorite ghost

Young boys are chasing
Old men are racing
Women will let them go
Days are lazy
London's hazy
Where's my sullen glow

He's somewhere out there
Straightening his tie
Looking for the answer
And the question is why
Still I love him the most
My favorite ghost

Walls are building
Bridges crumbling
Help me let you go

He's somewhere out there
Straightening his tie
Looking for the answer
And the question is why
Still he loves me the most
My favorite
My only
My favorite
My only
Ghost",Favorite Ghost,2001
Leona Naess,"I'll never feel the weight of your hands
Inside mine like diamonds
Lace so fine ballerina
Cupcake and my earthquake
Wakes me from my sleep that
Never comes, are you breathing
Waiting for me

I didn't really want you
But I want you now
Was so foolish of me
Feel you tumbling down
Into that empty room, the lights went out
I want to rescue, want to scream out loud

I didn't think I needed you
But I need you now
Was so empty in me
Feel you crashing down
Into the empty world, the music stops
I want to rescue, want to scream out loud
You will always be mine

The room spins 
they pull you from me, my body burns
Tell me all the rainbows
The colors that the rain throws
Ballerina, dance softly
She knows when to come only
When she's called on slowly coming to 

I didn't really want you
But I need you
Was so foolish of me
Feel you tumbling down
Into that empty room, the lights went out
Want to rescue want to scream out loud

I didn't think I wanted you
But I want you now
Was so empty in me 
Feel you crashing down
Into the empty world, the music stops
I want to rescue, want to scream out loud
You will always be mine

So so sorry 
Just come back for me now
So so sorry
Just come back to me now
Or soon

I didn't think I wanted you
But I want you now
Was so foolish of me
Feel you tumbling down
Into that empty room, the lights went out
Wanted to rescue, want to scream out loud

I didn't think I needed you
But I need you now
Was so empty in me
Feel you tumbling down
Into that empty room, the lights went out
I want to rescue want to scream out loud
That you will always be mine",Ballerina,2003
