Raybon Brothers,"You won't regret falling, the bruises you get falling, will all fade away
Don't analyse falling, don't try being wise, falling
Forget all your plans, they're out of your hands
You're falling, falling, falling

Blindly you go falling, the last one to know you're falling, you suddenly see
There's no way to fight falling, no rescue in sight, you're falling
You let love inside and hope she'll abide, you're falling, falling, falling

The world that you face is some other planet in space
You taste something new every moment
It thrills you, fills you, you're falling

I have to defend falling, 'cause if you should end falling
I hope you'll be free to spend time with me
Falling, falling, falling, just falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
",Falling,1997
Raybon Brothers,"You know the cards are stacked against this 
As we surrender our defenses
And I've torn down all my fences just for you 
And you feel it too
What do we do
Do we run or see it through
The longer we're together
It just keeps gettin' better
And you hide your little love letters
Around the house for me
And it's plain to see
That you'll always be all I'll ever need

[Chorus]
The webs we spun
Wove into one
And left us tangled up in love
You squeeze my hand I understand
About a woman and a man
I love the way you make me feel
You got me tangled up in love
The webs we spun
Wove into one
Left us tangled up in love

[Chorus]",Tangled Up In Love,1997
Rayden,"Veo tu nomada en peligro
Y eso me hace sentir vivo
Pero te adivinaré
Nervio, estoy al filo del cuento
Me doblo pero no tercio
Entre la espalda y la pared
¡Sabes que me tienes a tu merced!

Furia, que se convierte en lujuria
Quiero ser lo que desnudas
Pero no sé como lo haré
Nada, la loba nunca se apaga
Me roba aquella mirada
Dejé la espalda y me paré
¡Sabes que me tienes a tu merced!
¡Sabes que me tienes a tu merced!

Esta noche nos vemos
De cerca o de lejos
Y alguna botella de celestina
Esta noche nos vemos
Con ropa o sin ella
Y alguna botella de celestina

Viva, haré que no me alucinas
Y pruebas tu medicina
Y así sabes lo que es
Salta de mi cabeza a mi cama
Y déjate de mandangas
Dame algo de beber
¡Sabes que me tienes a tu merced!
¡Sabes que me tienes a tu merced!

Esta noche nos vemos
De cerca o de lejos
Y alguna botella de celestina
Esta noche nos vemos
Con ropa o sin ella
Y alguna botella de celestina

Esta noche sabes como acabarà
Se nos escucharà de Malasaña hasta el Raval
Quiero que estemos en distancia negativa
Medicina para superar el vertigo horizontal
Ai celestina, tengo un plan que no podrás rechazar
Entrar hasta la cocina y entre bambalinas
Pegar pegatinas y con serpentinas celebrar por todo el festival!

Esta noche nos vemos
De cerca o de lejos
Y alguna botella de celestina
Esta noche nos vemos
Con ropa o sin ella
Y alguna botella de celestina

Esta noche nos vemos
De cerca o de lejos
Y alguna botella de celestina
Esta noche nos vemos
Con ropa o sin ella
Y alguna botella de celestina",Celestina,2015
Rayden,"Podré perder el norte
Podré perderme en donde tu espalda pierda su nombre 
Y tú le des otro sentido
Podré perder el ritmo, los modales, los estribos
Pero no las ganas de sentirme vivo si hay motivos
Perder la cordura cuando estamos en el cuarto 
Contestando a la pregunta de a ver quién calla más alto
Supe perder trenes, altura y el contacto 
Pero qué le voy a hacer, me pierde el camino más largo

Perderme en tus ojos cuando me miras por dentro 
Como el que apunta en un pelotón de fusilamiento
Sin miramientos; hoy los tendré abiertos 
Prefiero morir viéndote a no ver quien pudo hacerlo

Perder el aliento y la razón 
Cuando el corazón y la cabeza siguen con su lucha
Seremos ese tema de conversación del que todo el mundo habla 
Pero nadie escucha 
Escucha

Perdernos solo para reencontrarnos
Dejar que se vacíe el cargador 
Y poder contarlo 
Mientras gira el mundo a nuestro alrededor 
Oh, sin importarnos

Podré perder el miedo al miedo
Perder las formas, enredarme y perderme en tu pelo
Perder el tiempo 
Y en el descuento el liderato
Marcar un tanto en proclamarnos campeones de invierno en este infierno a ratos 

Perder hasta el anonimato 
Y que creas conocerme por saber quién era
Perder la cuenta en ese cuento con letra pequeña 
En la que mi mirada era como un libro abierto y tu cara era un poema 
Perder hasta la compostura, en tus posturas
Perder el significado de tus nomenclaturas
Librándote de términos, poniéndote los míos 
Llamándole a tus labios Venús y luego Nilo
Y luego vino y después duda
Hasta que se vaya la luna y se te lleve al amanecer
Perdernos de vista y no volvernos a ver
Y saber que ni aún así no hubo nada que perder
Porque nunca me vas a perder

Perdernos solo para reencontrarnos
Buscarnos sin tomar la decisión
Tirarnos para siempre y desde cuando
Dejar que se vacíe el cargador 
Y poder contarlo 
Que probemos nuestro fuego a discreción
Oh, y poder contarlo 
Mientras gira el mundo nuestro alrededor 
Oh, sin importarnos",Imperdible,2017
Rayden,"Se han vuelto a encontrar mis ganas y tus tonterías
Se me ha vuelto a hacer mañana mientras tú dormías
Porque la casualidad no suele hacerme compañía
Se han vuelto a encontrar mis ganas y tus noches frías

Buscándote, se me pasa el tiempo
Pensándote, me cuesta tanto controlar
Mirándote, fallo en el intento
Callándome

Que quiero que se junte el hambre con las ganas de comer
Que quiero que se rompa el hielo y se derrita por la piel
Que no quiero que dejemos uno por el otro la casa sin barrer
Quiero que me quieras sin querer

Si yo te contara que estoy a tiro
Que quiero todo más si es contigo
No hacer como si nada
Hacerte aquello que no tiene nombre
Y que a partir de ahí le pongan tu apellido
Que si de algo hay que morir sea por fuego amigo
Como se diga
Porque tú eres vida
Eres de todo menos de mentira, que ironía
Qué diga todo lo que siento hasta formar aludes
Y que ni aún así te des por aludida

Buscándote, se me pasa el tiempo
Pensándote, me cuesta tanto controlar
Mirándote, fallo en el intento
Callándome

Que quiero que se junte el hambre con las ganas de comer
Que quiero que se rompa el hielo y se derrita por la piel
Que no quiero que dejemos uno por el otro la casa sin barrer
Quiero que me quieras sin querer

Que quiero que me quieras sin querer

Buscándote, ahora que te encuentro
Pensando que, es la hora de actuar
Mirándote, casi sin aliento
Gritándote

Que quiero que se junte el hambre con las ganas de comer
Que quiero que se rompa el hielo y se derrita por la piel
Que no quiero que dejemos uno por el otro la casa sin barrer
Quiero que me quieras sin querer

Que quiero que me quieras sin querer
Que quiero que me quieras",Malditas Ganas,2018

There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' alright
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

[Nas]
Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth is holdin' those
Briefcases, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', got no,
My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smokin' that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creepin' in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll  take her
And I'm late to a dite with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walkin' through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire pride stop

There's a war in the streets tonight
And all this drama's got me feelin' uptight
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo

Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight

Yeah, Nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's cryin'
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashin'
New come, I caught verbal assassin runnin' with
Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight
But we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib
Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment
Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers,
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world,
Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy
I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me

A descendant of London
I watch as people are falling like rain
Encouraged to seek other options
I don't need other options
You either eat it or you spit it out
You're either silent or you run your mouth
You breathe in or you breathe out
I'm so cold but the sun's up
Like it's winter all year around
So welcome you to it now
Oh, wait, that was my sound
Could you dig it up or sweat it out?
Could you give it up and sit down?
But after that, I hope you know your place
'Cause you just gave me the damn crown

Watch me as I wear it now
I'm a ride this money like a wave
This money like a wave, this money like a wave

Now I made it this far, but this far ain't nothing
If we're talking ambition, I think you should know that I don't wanna settle for nothing
I wanna know that I got myself
I wanna ride my money like a wave
My money like a wave, my money like a wave, yeah

I want the future, I want the best view
I'd like to buy all my day ones a house too
Collie, Ben, Jodie, I got you

Make that dumb guy regret what he did do
Then he'll be calling up my phone like ""I miss you""
Then I'll be like haha, you can go now

I'm gonna make something of my life
Believe that, yeah babe

And I'm a child of '97 so I plan to be on time

I wasn't gonna tell you, but I thought I'd let you know
That I just got us both a mortgage

Now it's top floor with these fancy reservations
I don't even like it, I'm just here for observations
Tryna tell the difference from my people and my pagans
Cuh' the last time that I slipped, I had a sticky situation
I will never slip again, you can put that on my savings
They wait for me to fall, I keep on waiting
This feeling is amazing, how's it feel to hate the kid
But deep inside, you know you rate him? Man, that shit must be frustrating

I would be the girl to lose this one
Seeing as you know I'm the baddest loser
And if I wanna win, I've got to lose her
I won't be the girl to lose this one
So I begin to find the distraction
The distraction, the distraction, the distraction

I just need to find something, a way to stop me wondering
I just need to find something, a way to stop me wondering about you

North London, I'm in North London now
Decided, you don't get a home and now
If you like, you can always call my phone
Hear the dialling tone and then the answer phone
I'll be fine if I ignore the sound, when you call to see if I'm around
The moment that you think that you have won
I will have found the perfect distraction",Distraction,2016

But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

And all this love is waiting for you.

I kinda want to drive Lexuses 
Sit back and live life high with the best of shit 
with a wrist full of ice in my president 
And a pocket full of Debbies that you can't imagine 
Guaranteed to make the best of it 
To have a yacht on a lake with water beds in it 
And a whole to of women that are singin' to my shit 
With they hands up in the audience screamin' they want it 
They want T! 

When I was a lot younger 
I liked to sit up at the park & drink on St. Ides 
Drunk as fuck, I used to wonder why some niggas roll 64's on D's 
And some niggas let their khakis hang to their knees 
Will I end up just like one of these? 
Or smoke trees overseas and rock wimbley? 
Bring back a black Bentley full of Henessey 
And earl gray tea sippin' it with Naomi - And they on me! 
I wonder how it happened so fast 
To go from 33b to first class laughin' 
And all you haters are hurt bad 
Imagine 

[Chorus]

Before I go to sleep at night 
I say a prayer to the Lord above and I'm hopin' that he shows me love
Cause my shit be hot enough to have the world dancin' 
Smokin' weed on the beach in the sand 
and all my ladies look well in Chanel and Donna 
If I trip, they got my bail, so farewell your honor 
Ain't got no time for drama 
Too busy chillin' with the mamas in the Bahamas 
and everybody got they own bag of ganja 
And you can go & roll a bleezie of you want to 
Ain't got to worry 'bout nobody all up on ya!

Give me a house in Fayetteville and a blue five hundred 
Next door to Evander, In the tub with Michelle & Samantha 
And a black pet panther 
And you ring the doorbell, I don't answer 
And you can't stand it 
And you askin' ""TQ why you act that way?"" 
Cause it's too many haters with somethin' to say 
I'm too busy blowin' up with my homeboy J!

Raymond Burke,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Raymond Cohen,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,2001

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

would ever make me feel this way

Et dans la nuit
Bat le coeur des guitares.
C'est le chant des errants qui n'ont pas de frontière,
C'est l'ardente prière
De la nuit des gitans.

Où vas-tu gitan ?
Je vais en Bohème.
Où vas-tu, gitan ?
Revoir l'Italie,
Et toi, beau gitan ?
En Andalousie.
Et toi, vieux gitan, mon ami ?
Je suis bien trop vieux, moi je reste ici...

REFRAIN
Avant de repartir pour un nouveau voyage
Vers d'autres paysages
Sur des chemins mouvants,
Laisse encore un instant vagabonder ton rêve
Avant que la nuit brève
Le réduise à néant.
Chante, gitan,
Ton pays de Cocagne ;
Chante gitan,
Ton château en Espagne.
C'est le chant des errants qui n'ont pas de frontière,
C'est l'ardente prière
De la nuit des gitans.

Deux jolis yeux qui s'ennuyaient,

A San Cristina leur souriaient
On aurait dit qu'à San Cristina
Sous le ciel rose de juillet,
Cachés dans l'ombre des colines
De San Cristina ils m'attendaient
C'était la fin de mes vacances,
Mais quand ils ont croisé les liens
Dans ces yeux là j'ai vu d'avance
Que le bonheur me disait : viens?
Et le soir même à San Cristina
On a pu voir sous le ciel bleu,
Bercés par la brise marine
De San Cristina, deux amoureux !

Il y avait à San Cristina
Un vieux clocher qui s'ennuyaient
De ne sonner que les mâtines
Quand San Cristina se réveillait
Mais après cette nuit divine
On l'entendit sonner un jour
Même jusqu'aux villes voisines
De San Cristina pour notre amour
Je vois la mariée que j'importe
Et le petit chalet de bois
Dont je lui fais franchir la porte
En la tenant entre mes bras?

Je pense à chaque instant que tout peut m'arriver
Mais mon cœur ne peut changer il sera toujours vraiment content

Raymond Lefevre & His Orchestra,"Il y avait à San Cristina
Deux jolis yeux qui s'ennuyaient,
Pourtant les hommes j'imagine
A San Cristina leur souriaient
On aurait dit qu'à San Cristina
Sous le ciel rose de juillet,
Cachés dans l'ombre des colines
De San Cristina ils m'attendaient
C'était la fin de mes vacances,
Mais quand ils ont croisé les liens
Dans ces yeux là j'ai vu d'avance
Que le bonheur me disait : viens?
Et le soir même à San Cristina
On a pu voir sous le ciel bleu,
Bercés par la brise marine
De San Cristina, deux amoureux !

Il y avait à San Cristina
Un vieux clocher qui s'ennuyaient
De ne sonner que les mâtines
Quand San Cristina se réveillait
Mais après cette nuit divine
On l'entendit sonner un jour
Même jusqu'aux villes voisines
De San Cristina pour notre amour
Je vois la mariée que j'importe
Et le petit chalet de bois
Dont je lui fais franchir la porte
En la tenant entre mes bras?

Vous verrez que je ne mens pas,
Et que le bonheur compte double
Quand on le trouve à San Cristina !",Love in Portofino [A San Cristina],1998

Je m'moque de ce qu'on dit car moi je trouve que c'est normal
De t'aimer follement mon amour, de t'aimer follement nuit et jour

Je pense à chaque instant que tout peut m'arriver
Mais mon cœur ne peut changer il sera toujours vraiment content
De t'aimer follement mon amour, de t'aimer follement nuit et jour

Un jour si tu le veux, on peut partir tous deux
Partir en se moquant de ceux qui enragent en nous voyant
Nous aimer follement mon amour, nous aimer follement nuit et jour

Ah que la vie est douce quand on est amoureux
Un rien me rend heureux, le ciel est plus bleu et tout me pousse
À t'aimer follement mon amour, à t'aimer follement nuit et jour

Mais quand tu n'es pas là, je pense encore à toi

We shared the moon in all it's splender
You pressed your lips to mine, and by the way
 
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am living for you alone?
Did I remember to say ""I'm lost without you""
And just how mad about you I've grown?
You were in my arms and that was all I knew
We were alone, we two, what did I say to you?
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forever more you are mine?

Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,

Now he hard, he buff,  he tough, doo rag and Timbs
Kinda hard to get a job back out on the block
Charge that to the game
Young girl she grew up in a rush
Had it bad, no dad, she don't know who to trust
Every man she ever loved only want to crush
Charge that to the game
But it's all gravy, hey baby
Shots get popped, the cops shut down the party
Jeans sag low, blow smoke out of Dutches
We've got love for y'all but y'all don't love us
So we swerve in the Suburban switchin' lanes
Spend up all our dough on them chrome and thangs
Name our kids some funny names
Don't hate on us, we're fabulous
Prepaid cellies for local calls
Lil' don and divas up at the mall
Rockin' cornrow twist, that's how we roll
But don't hate on us, we're fabulous

They met, he said how she was a dime
So naive that she believed every single line
17, first time slipped up, 'bout to have a child
Charge that to the game
Was just us and mom, single family home
She did the best she could, did it all her own
Met a man but he won't raise a child that's not his own
Oh, no, oh, no, no
But it's all gravy, hey baby
Shots get popped, the cops shut down the party

With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

Came into my life and made it brighter

I was the kind of man to play the field
Never new that love was real
?
Never the truth it's always a lie
In front of man well she was like shy
Now his back is turned it's a different story
Partying till light hit the sky
Coming home at half past five
Yes she has an alibi
It's her friend Patsy
I don't want no girl to think I'm out for a fool
Better you take it nice and cool
Don't you treat I man like the mule of a donkey
I don't want no girl to think I'm out for a clown
Wheeling up town and down town
The word is that you'd run around
Your with everybody

Jackie is the kind of girl
Who loves to fly around the world
Flying from New York straight on to Paris
Driving in a Mercedes Benz
Living life and making ends
Lots of people lots of friend
That's what makes her happy
I don't want to be the one to stand in her way
I miss her nights and I miss her days
But she's the girl that loves to play cat and mouse games
Now then I'm afraid I'll have to say goodbye(ME)
I did my best and yes I've tried
She left me for that other guy

I'm a player on the prowl
I don't mess around
Cause I got to lay you down

Just like a story in a magazine
Tear jerking movie that we all have seen
Was like an angel if you know what I mean
I wasn't staid by this Nubian Queen
See I'm a player, a honey hound
My feet are normally on solid ground
A thief of hearts, I've stolen many crowns
Now I'm the victim of the turn around

All I really wanted was to hit and run
How she did me I could swear she was the one
Never thought I'd be the one to feel so used
Now I'm standing here girl and I'm so confused

All I really wanted was to hit and run
How she did me I could swear she was the one
I was thinking this was a one night stand
Never really plan to be your man

Despite the fact that we've become so tight
I know you wanna make me see the light
But I can't stop from putting up a fight
Through heart of stone, I don't have much to give
Hitting (getting) honies, that's the way I live
I make my money and I spend my bills
Be hitting slots and putting in my bids

I know what you tryna do man,
I know your tryna do,
All that stuff you doin',
I'd a been,
I'd a been through all that you know what I'm saying,
You know your messed up right,
You know your messed up,
Oh, so how you gonna get yourself otta this kid just a second,
We need to talk,
I don't like the path that you've chosen to walk,
I'm not trying to swoop down on you like a hawk,
I just don't want to see mapped out on chalk,
I know what your thinking I see all your thoughts this glory your after I already saw,
But all that you fight for will add up to naught,
Disaster runs faster your gonna get caught,
People will tell you what you wanna hear,
Just means their clever,
And don't face their fear,
I hope what I'm telling you comes across clear cause this is your life,
There's no second chance here,
I don't think I'm perfect or anything near made some mistakes of my own through the years,
That you don't learn from that is my biggest fear,
Don't make me a feeler,
It's too much to bear

[Chorus]

Stains of all my childhood sorrows on the walls of my mind,
Are there any bright tomorrows,
Pain is all I seem to find,
How did I ever get to be here oh the truth cuts like a knife,
Pappa used to tell me about karma that's the story of my life
Sure you believe that I won't understand,
Turn to your friends cause you think that they can,
Remember I wasn't born as a grown man,
These problems been here ever since I began,
You ain't wearing diapers I can't hold your hand,
You've fallin' just let me show you how to land,
If your friends really loved you then it would be grand
Then why ain't they here when you sinking in sand,
Cause been where you wanna go that ain't no joke,
You only hurting your self with all that stuff you smoke,
Shots where you wanna shoot,
Tokes where you wanna toke,
Done my drunk drivin' in it my license revoked,
Did my shop lifting,
Hid stuff in my coat,
Suddenly found myself being a ? skank ho,
It only takes a pebble to start rocking the boat
When trouble comes guess who put the knife to my throat

Tell me, baby, are you new in town?

Razed in Black,"Oh I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go
My party piece

Oh I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes
When it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go
My party piece

But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs
Pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and
Stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both us knew
How the ending would be...

So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round
And it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

Now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart
And I'll feed it to anyone
Crying for sympathy
Crocodiles cry for the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone

Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle

Forever Haunting
As the sword thrusts through my chest
I direct, inject for pleasure

Don't know why self immolation
Tempts me, it's something I can't explain
As I step out to the edge
This overflow's up to my head

The dark comes dressed
In a lavish winter gown
Laced with the rays of the sun
Shined with the glaze of the moon

My cell will fill once again

Never said I'd see it through

Hurt by the stone
Suffocate my mind
Cast by all I've ever met
Why must this happen all at once?
I feel, I feel I wanna
I can't handle it
Die, go away
Why must this happen all at once?
Surrendering inside
Peel away my skin
Ready to say goodbye
Pounding at me all at once
Feels as if...if I had a gun

Wall of metal shakes the place
Total volume, full scale attack
Once you're here ain't going back
Now the power's in your hands
A message for all metal fans
I know this sounds a little cliche
But I don't give a damn anyway!
So let this be a lesson to you
Though we leave we're never through
If you help to keep metal alive
The underground will always survive

I promise: metal will thrive
I swear: myself to the cause
I'll teach: all the metal laws",Iron Hammer,1985

Bright lights, now you can see where you are
Far, out in the universe

Now, you, try to escape from this spot
Hot, ready or not
Take this torch

Experience the torture, pay for all your sins
Taken to the stairwell, taken to a cell
Scorches all your body, taste the wrath of hell",Take This Torch,1985

Welts all over my chest

Inflict me with bruises and watch as I scream with delight
Humiliate me, I last for your violence tonight
Kiss me, then hit me, then tease me, then boss me around

Hurts good.

Light a few red candles, I'm gonna spend the night

Fed up with your butthead friends and hat your smart-ass smile

And the hinges will buckle

Dragging their dead weight from the other

And death comes through these streets like a scandal
Bent up and beaten, oh, a bitter body blow

Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1997

Lo que podemos compartir
Cada minuto de la vida
Se pierde como un día gris

Es por amor que brilla el sol
Es por seguir al corazón
Que gira al mundo
Why no se detendrá
Why por amor hay que salir
Quizás sin miedo a la frontera
Why dejar la puerta abierta

La lluvia trata los recuerdos
Los hare nuestros hasta el fin
Ya nada es como queremos
Cuando dejamos de sentir

Es por amor que brilla el sol
Es por seguir al corazón

With you there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there

You washed away the best of me
You don't care

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You are wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

Sometimes shattered
Never open
Nothing matters
When you're broken
That was me whenever I was with you

Always ending, always over
Back and forth, up and down, like a roller coaster
I am breaking that habit today

Sorry doesn't cut it babe
Take the hit and walk away
Cause I'm gone

Doesn't matter what you do
It's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth
Now I'm gone

Subiendo la radio, respirando el sol
Contigo escapé del mundo en tu coche azul
Viviendo el destino que, siempre has sido tu

Dejales decir que no es de verdad
Se que nuestro amor siempre durará
Que piensen lo que quieran pensar de mi
A mi me da igual, yo vivo por ti

Si te tengo a ti, ya no necesito nada mas
Yo vivo por ti, why no necesito nada mas

Voy a esconderme en tus brazos why escuchar
Solo a tu voz why asi soñar
Por celos quieren separarnos de nuestro amor
Pero somos tu why yo, un solo corazón

Dejales decir que no es de verdad
Se que nuestro amor siempre durará
Que piensen lo que quieran pensar de mi
A mi me da igual, yo vivo por ti

Digan lo que digan, ya me da igual
Solo necesito lo que me das
Que piensen lo que quieran pensar de mi
Se que es de verdad, yo vivo por ti

Not too sure which way is right

Remember the time, when I got to know you
December, all these little scenes arc coming back to me

Fear is never in my heart, it lives and dies with you
Time, I can not make it right, I'd turn it back for you

Remember the time, when I got to know you
December, all these little scenes are coming back to me
Remember my eyes, they want to show you love

It exceeded expectations
Distant stars of wonder, feeding to my hunger
Hidden in the thunder, lifting me towards heaven

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But living in the city it's do-or-die

They wonder where me bailing and don't really understand
The reason why me take me law in me own hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
Me gun goes click, me gun goes bang
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach
Them riot in they Lakers and don't really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricade us like Beirut
Me don't show no love cause it's us against them
Them never ever love me cause it's sport to break the,
And kill at my own risk if I may
Delay to spray with my AK and put it to rest

Yes we have. There have been riots, rioting, well I don't wanna say
Rioting but there's been looting downtown, but right now Bree, what I want
To show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street

How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do?
What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

What they told us today, in other words,
You're still a slave. No matter how
Much money you got, you still ain't shit

Sitting in my living room calm and collected
Feeling that gotta get mine perspective
'Cause I just heard broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row, is bailing
Laugh now but cry much later
Ya see when niggas get together they get mad cuz they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They find that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's thumpin, nigga it's time ta rob and mob
(And break the white man off somthing lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love them so they can't love me)
Yo straight putting down getting my scoot on
Let's jump in off in Compton so I gots ta get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or something
Got a VCR
In the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop

There has been videotape and you can see of the, aah, some of the crowd
Throwing things at the officers
And swinging at them as well. Like there was a young woman there.
You see she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand

How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do?
What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

Or get prints so my Uzi witta spray

I ain't no dead do', I'm high off the indo
Creeping with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on that donut
And cracker so now he best to back up
I guess I gots ta pack up, filling the clip up, I zip up-
Town, the motherfucking cops are all around
Helicopters flying
These motherfuckers trying
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no's the poor black refuse to go

Fires have been, aah, ignited. I mean, from here to the, aah, to the south

A dude named Eligh, caught up in the driveby
Tears of a mother, watchin her son die
Set-trippin somebody slippin, bullets zippin and
Eligh gone for good, now his momma's livin
No need for cryin, not dyin, Eligh is dead
Point blank he took a nine cap to the head
Eligh, the wannabe gangsta from the hood
He wasn't that bad and he wasn't that good
All he understood is get crazy blitzed
So he bought some of that (uh) to get some of this (yeah)
This got him that but that went to them
and them, bein they who made his head lay
He didn't obey, he said he made this cash
CRACK from the gun, Eligh lays in ash
Smash, it hits the front page quick
Now business is conducted by this fool named Mick
Mick, fell for a trick
Soon to be dyin, and his mom, gon' be cryin

She ain't even think I was gon' graduate in high, school
FOOL, that's what I used to say
when them off-brand busters was mobbin my way
Nigga, whassup?!  This L.B.C.
Had shootouts in shop cause my focus G.D.
Back in ninety-three I still ain't gang free
I lyrical gangbang, ""but it's just a G thang""
Now who want to set-trip and flip?
I do my driveby of sorts with, hollow point thoughts
Don't get it twisted, foes ain't hollow, when I swallow
you into the hole, six feet under
I wonder, why you blunder then thunder crash
and ass gets burned to ash
Bullets are flying, asses are frying
and mom's will be crying, mom's are cryin

Think about the words of those who want static
Leave 'em lyin' limp in clean free sheets

Cling free beats, so why you still clingin'?

I kicks when I grip the mic and kick shit

Ain't nothing but a buster
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumping slugs in motherfuckers

Feel the shotgun, Kurupt, inmate, cell block one

No prevention from this mention of sorts
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps
Dr. Dre will kick the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter

There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead
I plead guilty

Buck em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Laying lain with the shame, who's to blame

On when I'm coming from the D-E-A-T-H in

To my motherfucking homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbing with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy

No I'm not flagging, but I'm just sagging
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G

You know you can't fuck with my motherfucking DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G

On W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch!

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth

Want your fingers sliced, now you pay the price
Put your light on the line if you feel get that nice
Running bullshit over here, get you shot

Exits more the spot, that's everything that's hot
Walk right upon you and run everything you've got

Let's see some titties
Boogie words for shitty birds, I learn from the smartest
Treat the bitch like a bitch, treat the queen like a goddess
I coast it, bum bought it, weighting me down
Sleight the razor to your throat, what can you say to me now?
This is dope out above law, thousands of pounds
Keep the crowd in a chokehold, deliver the rounds
I'm going from living with clowns to rocking a crown
It protect my self silence oppressed the sound

Making how you got knocked down the talk of the town
Stick around for the fireworks, apocalypse now

Welcome to the aftermath
Like we always do about this time
Welcome to the aftermath

The aftermath, a second growth
The period immediately following an unusual event
This is brought to you by the makers of funky music
Coming directly to you from The Soul Kitchen
So let's get deep, you ask how deep is deep?
Can I ask you how deep would you like to get?

No matter what sign you throw up
Wait, we're on some other while you're still slippin'
Bringin' you all bangin' speakers for sparks fly out the car system

Off the tops, snatchin' props and the proper the tops we touch
We're hard to knock, we got it locked
From every angle of music, the different sound view
R&B, Rap, whatever flavor, kid, it's all new
So say we bring it with the East and the West

The final results, the aftermath touchin' every coast
So when the bar blows then the DJ spins
And we don't set trip, we set trends
Love to the artists, in fact they be the smartest
If they business is tight

'cause keep it real means moving the cash markets
And constantly buildin' and stop destroying
Everything that we touch
And leave somethin' for our children

Only stars above you
To see I love you.

Oh, give me that night divine

RCA Victor Orchestra,"Love came to me
Gay and tender
Love came to me
Sweet surrender
Love came to me
In bright romantic splendor
Fickle was she
Faithful never
Fickle was she
And clever
So will it be forever, forever
Softly, as in a morning sunrise
The light of love comes stealing
Into a new born day, oh
Flaming with all the glow of sunrise
A burning kiss is sealing
The vow that all betray
For the passions that thrill love
And lift you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love
And let you fall to hell
So ends the story
Softly, as in an evening sunset
The light that gave you glory
Will take it all away","Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise",1991

RCA Victor Orchestra,"Granada, I'm falling under your spell
And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow clad Sierra Nevada
For soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Habanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday romantic and gay.","Granada, for voice & orchestra (with chorus ad lib)",2003

se van quedando tras de mi
un cigarrillo,una cancion
las fotos de un primer amor
recuerdos en mi habitacion
se van quedando tras de mi
quedando tras de mi...

tengo un mapa que me lleve a otro pais

una historia y muchas ganas de poder

Off ya, tryna make me depart ya, from my thought-a
Coffin's for you, and the nigga that brought ya
The hatin' start in ya, release from our father
The people at the alter, saying ya better off
You don't wanna see a demon, come out of a humen being
Recent being the sience, and to him it's too extreme

Or in that Tahoe like Christopher, no
Poppa gon' keep poppin' Cris on you hoes
And piss on those, who exist as my foes

Funny style niggas never down with me 
Type that go to the bathroom, sit down and pee

Baking hot, and you can sled ride down my wrist, neck, and hand 
When it comes to coke, I can make a snowman, shit

Re-Up Gang,"It's a mystery inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinking 'bout so many ways
Of how to conquer these rainy days

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

The war is on, yo
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice, or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes Leon, pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mock socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Mack's milk, blast the year
That was Bill Bill, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy Jake's, Starks is back
Niggas want work, now I pull back off a G-Pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops living gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks
The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese blind
Sipping on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined
(Raining) Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay these
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship
Meat heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now talk shit nigga, what??

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes
The beat breaks, cause all my niggas to break son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once though, the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats cats and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-ville
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

Word up dun
Peace to Philly, VA, these days
Word up y'all, word up
The sun moon and stars fly cars, word up y'all

No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life, street life
No cash flow, no more dough

Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway

Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Now we're just working for the shirt and tie 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
But it's not right 

Crawling up your life in a sleeping bag
Setting up your tent on the main drag 
There was a day I though I understood
Now I see my own face underneath the same hood 

Did we loose what we were coming from?
We used to sing till our voices were gone
Drinking our fill from a half-filled cup
Turning it up 'cause it's not enough 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
I hear the music coming through the floorboards
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You said music don't live here anymore

Whatever happened to my hometown?
Part of growing up was falling down
We used to dance until the morning light 
We used to live, we used to love life

Rea Garvey,"She said she doesn't wanna get a reputation
A sweet, sweet smile's not an open invitation
She wants respect for all the ladders she's climbed
She doesn't want to be classified
He's a shirt and tie who's afraid of commitment
A desk jockey who had a good standard of living
Likes, laugh, love but we'll pay the price
He cleans up well and he's all so nice

Time stands still for no one
So get up off your knees
Stand still for no one
And no one's greed

Is it love, is it love, or are you just fooling around?
'Cause enough is enough, you put your head in the ground
Look up, look up, your world is crumbling down around you
Oh, wake up

'Cause enough is enough, you put your head in the ground
Look up, look up, your world is crumbling down around you
Oh, wake up

She's done well for herself, her cheque's grade A
She tried love once but it just got in the way
Got the hired hands and the house on the hill
She swapped her social life for a sleeping pill
He's married now but he still goes wild
His wife's at home, expecting their third child
He said, ""the perfect life is just a matter of time""
He'd know what he wants if he could make up his mind

Time stands still for no one
So get up off your knees
Stand still for no one
And no one's greed

Is it love, is it love, or are you just fooling around?

Keine Instagram-Romanze
Zurechtgerückt und orchestriert, im echten Leben
Kommt es vor, dass ich nicht immer dein Held bin, du
Hältst mir den Rücken frei und hier alles zusammen, bis ich wieder komm'
Egal, wie kompliziert, du sagst, es wird schon, dis ist unser Job
Ich halt' den Kopf raus, schieb' hier Filme, als hätt' ich nicht schon genug gechillt
Verkacke was und fuck dich ab und frag' dich, warum du nicht willst
Du sollst dich auf mich verlassen können, ich will da sein
Doch tu' als wüsst' ich nicht, dass du mich von heut auf morgen verlassen könntest
Ich hab' nie gelernt auch anzukommen, musste immer weiter rennen
Fühl' mich gleich eingegrenzt von allem, ich verlang' von dir kein Verständnis
Geb' mein Bestes, ich will nix mehr hinterfragen
Denn die Zeit, sie läuft, und vielleicht willst du nicht mehr warten, keine Ahnung

Knew that losing you would be like kissing death
I caught your smile as I was catching my breath
I put the coins in and pressed 22 F

On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

Reader's Digest Children's Treasury,"Once I was happy but now I'm forlorn
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn
Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn 
Betrayed by a maid in her teens
Oh, this maid that I loved she was handsome
And I tried all I knew, her to please 
But I never could please her one quarter so well 
As the man on the flying trapeze!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
He'd play with a miss like a cat with a mouse
His eyes would undress ev'ry maid in the house
Perhaps he is better described as a louse
But still people came just the same
He'd smile on the bar to the people below
And one night he smiled on my love
She blew him a kiss and she hollered ""Bravo""! 
As he hung by his nose up above!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks 
While she spent her time the with the circuses freaks
The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
Alas and alack and Alaska
I went to this fellow the blackguard and said 
I'll see that you get your deserts
His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer  
He sneered once again and said ""Nortz"" Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night to his tent he invited her in 
Filled her with compliments and kisses and gin
That started her off on the road to ruin 
She made the supreme sacrifice
But even tho' I loved her I said ""Take my name  
I'll gladly forgive and forget!""
She rustled her bustle and then without shame she said
""Maybe later , not yet""!  Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night I as usual went to her dear home
Found there her father and mother alone 
I asked for my love and soon t'was made known
To my horror that she'd run away
Without any trousseau she fled in the night 
With him with the greatest of ease
From two stories high he had lowered her down 
To the ground on his flying trapeze!
 
He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
Some months after that I went into the hall 
To my surprise I found there on the wall
A bill in red letters which did my heart gall 
That she was appearing with him
He'd taught her gymnastics and dressed her in tights 
To help him to live at his ease
He'd made her assume a masculine name 
And now she goes on the trapeze!
 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease
You'd think her a man on the flying trapeze
Her actions are graceful, all girls she does please 
And that's what's become of my love

Sounds of the motherfuckin' men
Tryin' to get your chain
Tryin' to get cha chay-e-ain!
Flush this down the drain
I'm the new raw on the streets
You can get 10 years per each song
Catch a contact, what I write from the arm
Now little white kids bring pipes to the prom
I was supposed to quit, be an influence
But, the weed is like (Nike) -- I JUST DO IT!

Yo, I keep the ghetto in me
I love the sweet taste of revenge
I'm focused, my soul's been cleansed
Now I know who the enemy, and who to friend
But still, with my eyes closed, they both blend
I'm not a follower, I start the trend
Y'all can follow that dummy
I'mma follow this money
Now I'm at the age, where I need to get paid
If a nickel bag gets sold in the park - heyyyyyyy!
Did I stu-stutter?
I got the guns and butter
My craftwork be movin' the numbers
I keep a (Roscoe) like Kurupt, brother
Hang out my window - BLAOW!

But if you violate, I'll play the violin well

Light up like Showtime when they about to fight
How bout dat, boy, when that truck ride 38's
Your middle finger up at the light, I'm nice
Doc ride or die, I bubble up when the pouring peroxide
It's dirty, lookie here
Still sharp like I'm back in school
It's like Wonder Blade, cut a nigga smooth
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo, who let the dog loose?
Whips and chains, I don't wanna argue
The big whale that's writing fishscale
Like me, better believe, I'm too hard to harpoon
My goons, think like Chris Wallace
'Give me the loot' and I don't wanna talk about it
When my niggas 'get 'em', that's when I
Crush the building, how about that?

Look at my shoes, how about that, nigga?
(My car, how about that, nigga?)
Getting money, how about that, nigga?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

How about it, any nigga realer than me? I doubt it
Catch Ready hop out of v, low mileage
You see the way I play with money, I'm so childish
And, so stylish, looking like Gucci my sponsor
Kicks crazy, jewelry is bonkers
Whether in the club or you see me in concert
I go hard, who created a monster?
Me, Gilla be the click that I ride with
Talk slick, get flipped like a Sidekick
You wonder why your bitch is on my dick
'cause the boy flow doper than five bricks
The MC wishing I simply
Be remembered like Big Pun, Biggie or Pimp see
And when my niggas say 'get 'em', that's when I
Blocka blocka, how about that, nigga?

Look at my house, how about that, nigga?
(Sour dies', how about that, nigga?
Big paper, how about that, nigga?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

How bout that, ten years plus in the rap game
And still getting cream like a fat cat
Plus, I'm grossing money off of ASCAP
Plus, my publishing, yea I owns that
First of all, my royalty come quarterly
My hoes, my niggas, all move accordingly
Streetlife, I'm so international
My foreign exchange, but always in the capitol
Straight cash advances, while you be calling
Your label all day, hoping someone answers
I flow with no auto-tone, just me and my bitch
My blunt, my beat, my microphone
I shine with no jewelry on, another star is born
Watch me perform, beyond the norm
And when my niggas 'get 'em', that's when I
Brr stick 'em, haha, stick 'em, how about that, nigga?

Fuck what it cost, how about that, nigga?
(I'm a boss, how about that, nigga?)
Straight pimping, how about that, nigga?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Pimp game, soak it up, you dig?
Hope your haters want beef, 'cause I don't touch the pig
How about that, boy, I'm a G, ain't another MC
Or pedophile that can touch the kid, I do it big
Like Chris Wallace, big bank, big wallet
Got a flow that go straight to the pros, forget college
I still got it, if I got an issue, I flow the pistol
And I'm official, just like them niggas that low the whistle
Word, man, I shoot to kill 'em, you heard?
If you nasty, I shoot 'em with penicilen, you heard?
I'm like Cali, so carry, when I'm flipping the words
Flip the script on your bitch ass while I'm flipping the bird
Meth sick with the pen, stick a few in your men
Then again, stick with my pen through the thick and the thin
Look, when my niggas 'get 'em', I send 'em to hell
And ride with 'em, how about that, nigga?

Look at my crew, how about that, nigga?

At 6 the milkman comes around
Another day in anytown
I wake up with a frown
Another day in anytown

We took my dog spot to the park
We watched him run and heard him bark
Then spot ran way into the dark

I said, ""Anytown just makes me sad.""

He said, ""I must be going mad.""

But I am not afraid of these things

We live in a world of pleasure and pain

We won't get caught like this again
Love is an anvil, life is a candle and it burns you
Just when you feel fine
Just when you can stand alone
Just when you feel good
Just when the fear ends
Just when the tears end

Real Live,"(Ain't love in the heart of the city) --> Bobby Bland

[ Verse 1 - Larry-O ]
Gun claps erupt from the back alley way
The heat in the streets stress a nigga every day
Cops raid blocks like scenes from Red Dawn
The American Dream in the ghetto is more gall
I knew this kid cold out of luck
No loot or nothing, you know that other fuck-up
Well, if I ain't got, I'ma take
I got a burner in your face, son, ain't no escape
from the mental prison that I'm in
I want to break out but I'm committin mad sins
We got the city under siege, how
Gang-land style, juveniles running wild
Niggaz come, niggaz go, niggaz die
My man could've been a ball-player but he gettin' high
It's dangerous out here, son
'cause yo, the average motherfucker's living under the gun

[ Verse 2 - Larry-O ]
My peoples in the streets is dying, son
Coke is a commodity and so is the gun
It's time to cultivate a plan that's guaranteed to hit
Flips some cook-up, stack a 100 thou and quit
My 9 to 5 ain't saying shit
Niggaz' joints are too mean and hoes are too thick
So now I gotta locate my click
And rise to the top till the cream turn thick
I'm working with rocks, lives are stopped
Rebels breaking pebbles and mobilizing all blocks
Undercover Rockefellas get paid
Dope lines be long, yo, the loot be minute-made
It's ill when you think about the plot
When playing in the game is designed to get us knocked
What's my attitude when I see a jake drop
Buck, buck, buck and you don't stop

[ Verse 3 - Larry-O ]
No turning back now, progression can't stop
It's like everytime I look up my neck be on the chopping block
A kid got murdered for a ring
Beef throughout the street be like a everyday thing
A warzone with gunfire sounds
We gunnin each other down like motherfucking killer clowns
Living conditions is out of order
A shorty slaughtered her daughter 'cause she couldn't support her
Yo, niggaz be making big bets
Clowns with short paper get killed for big debts
And little shorties on cellular phones
Knots with rubber-bands, rims dipped in chrome
How long does the good shit last?
Niggaz that die young be niggaz that live fast
I dropped a gem and hit you off with the deal
I only live one way and that's motherfucking real",Ain't No Love,1996
Real Live,"(I see the gimmicks, the wack lyrics) - The Notorious BIG

[ Verse 1 ]
I'm usin mics like bangers, victims get hit
Verbal homicide, razor blades spit
It's mad kids trapped up in the game, ain't nothing pretty
We all on a quest to have the tightest jam in the city
Or the fattest sound for the nine-pound
Shoot a 100 grand, I'm rollin headcracks on the ground
My mind is under siege from Chucky Black
I made my white-out fat with about three fourths of a 20 sack
Now I gots to blow the spot one time and in due time
You'll find the illustration of true crime
Too many niggaz fakin moves today
Too many brothers gettin blown away
But I be makin licks anyway, everyday
And still hold a toast just in case of foul play
You always had somethin to say
Man, I know you wasn't shit from the very first day

I ain't a rookie, son, I'm like a decorated soldier
I earned mad stripes, slugs hit you like a boulder
The K is all-pro with the MP-60
And I'ma stimulate like a monster hit a blow, so
Now it's time to pay some dues
You got to show some skill before you talk about a Uz or a Tec
And I lost mad respect
And if the wack shit don't stop
I'm shuttin down shop
You took a turn for the worse, you're like a curse
You never come clean in your verse
You got players on the street gettin down for real
Gettin down for coke, gettin down with steel
You ain't a thoroughbred, you ain't did no caper

I'm going crazy, kickin' down doors 
Breakin' in homes, and with my nine, I'm robbin' fuckin' liquor stores 
I'm droppin' things on you punk ass bitches 
From the streets and I keep 'em all listenin'
Suckas tried to play the P in nine-one
I came with fuckin' rhymes like a shotgun
I'm breakin' 'em like bouldas 
A million plus fans and mother fuckas I told ya
That the P would come through like a bullet 
Cock the mic like a gauge, grab the handle and then pull it
Don't give a fuck about the radio nigga 
Gangsta lyrics that make my mother fuckin' partners bigger
I roll around town four niggas deep
Bumpin' shit like fuck the police
See I can never fuckin' sell out
I was born in the ghetto, so the ghettos what I talk about 
One wrong move in the game and your fucked 
And if I think your going do me, I'm gonna shoot your ass up

Now the same record company's at my window 
I guess they want to talk, talk about what 
Heh, makin' me a star 
Well you gotta pay me
Cause to the Underground alone I done sold hella tapes 
Thanks to my hookup, my concerts are booked up 
The same companies mad they over-looked us 
Thick ass contracts to get a nigga stuck 
And then my lawyer say you ain't legit, I gotta shoot you up

So I refuse to get fucked like a hoe 
That's why a nigga make shit for the god damn streets bro
Now the underground I rule 
Success came fast but I done paid hella dues 
a lot of rappers try ????, like sayin' they in jail, to make they tapes sell
Or poppin' that nasty shit 
Show some pussy on the cover, and talk about eatin' a bitch 
But I can never just stunt
I make that hard-core shit that niggas want to pump
I'm puttin' hits on niggas in the rap game 
I'm takin' 'em out just like the fuckin' dope game

But hold up bitch all your getting is a luck pass
Trying to gank me for my ducket
I tried to put you down with the ski & cmt you said fuck it
Only came around when things was kinda cool
But did you really think I'd go out like a fucking fool
Oh hell no, I kept my shit tight
Now the ski & cmt is sitting on something right
Your like a gold digging bitch from the neighborhood
That's why I slide on your ass cause it makes me feel good
All this shit you talk when I'm not around
Get your crown on nigga but you still ain't down
I got something for ya'll
A nin-millimeter that will drop you to the floor bitch
Cause if I trust ya for a minute
You would have had a motherfucking knife in my back then bent it
I gotta get ya first

One by one in this century
Brothers are dying getting killed
And sent to penitentary's
And your right hand man could have been a snitch
You think like a hoe you go out just like a bitch
So face 'em to the facts bro'
And end up dead like this other nigga I used to know
I guess it's kinda sad g
But it really didn't face me til the funeral car passed me
And what about them tagalongs
Them mother mother fuckers that are driving with the lights on
Could have been the killers
But nobody really cares he died on dope dealers
But that don't mean shit, cause a nigga like me pack a 9 and 3 clips
And I don't trust a soul from them nigga by my house
To them niggaz down by the store
When niggaz say they like me
That's the same motherfuckers in the game that tried to shice me
Mama say boy you have no friends, ha
I should have listened then
Dour niggaz rolled up with the ski-masks
Pointed the tech-nine out the window but they didn't blast
When niggaz said freeze p
I thought to myself, huh, this nigga knows me
But I didn't find it funny
Pulled out my motherfucking 9 when they asked me for my fucking money
But he didn't even shoot
He must have didn't have no bullets in the gun no time to think
I'm steady pullin' I blast for the driver to the passenger
Four niggaz dead in the car I laugh at ya
Now I gotta see, pull of the ski mask of this nigga that was calling me
I guess it's kinda sad, a tear rolled down my eye cause I knew his ass
His name was little peewe
That's the same motherfucking nigga I was trying to help g
Good thing I thinked fast, cause if I think a nigga gonna do me
I'm gonna do his ass, cause a bitch will get you killed
Niggaz like to steal, and ain't no thing is a good dope deal
So I live just like john montgotti, ha
I trust nobody

I say what's your name, do ya got a name,
And since she crossing the street
Can a mack hold ya fuckin hand?
But this shit had fucked me up at first,
Because she smiled with a smurf and turned
Around and said that will work.
She was a perfect 36, 24, 36.
She had ass like a stalion bro.
She kept this muthafuckin look in her eye,

And let my feet hang out the car door.

But she make me feel logic.

I'm hating them bitch's like hoes.
But that was my girl so you know a nigga gotta go.
When niggaz started acting funny talking shit
Bout your one and only chance to win back his money.
I had to put this punk in line,
And when he turn his back I told silkk to pass me my fuckin 9.
Because I ain't the one to be fucked with,
And you know that the p don't take no bull shit.
But I live kinda strange,
But you know there aren't no fuckin rules in this fucking game.
But can't a gansta fall in love,
I don't know. because niggaz only serving fiends and thugs.

When I woke up I had soaked up the feeling
So I’m a telling ‘em
You can’t clip these wings, you can’t clip them listen
Any styles that you bring I dismiss them

Don’t let catch a fire these words will make granny clutch her pearls
Heaven is here, I aint waiting for death I’m getting mines here on earth
This revolution seems to be being played out on our T.V. screens
Listen closely you can hear the president running away screaming
People getting free, is a must bound to happen eventually
Oppression makes anger, anger is heat
Burning up inside your belly
Heavy to deal with cant hold it steady let it go
It’s hardly a surprise really they should know
People they want justice, and it shows
Is the only way to go the way it is going

When I woke up I had soaked up the feeling

Reality Check,"An urgent sense of regret and now I'm caught in the zone
My mind arrested by fear and so I go it alone
A metamorphosis conceived by the early light
Distraction of self comes out in the night

Fabricated, I'm constructed of opinions and lies
Which only leads to failing in my own eyes
Sinking to the depths while I'm masking what's inside
A bittersweet existence and I cause my own demise

And I wonder if you've ever seen life through
The eyes of one who understands what it mean
To be free, freedom comes when you can let it go
But I guess you wouldn't know

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Mind reflects the meaning to things that are jumbled
Resting on the first, making time to rehearse
Intricate persona, controlled animation
Visually impaired, clinging to pain immersed

Mentally scarred, cosmetics dripping down
Life in forward motion, exist in reverse
Instable at the seams, trying to conform
Trapped in a maze while sin is at its worst

And I wonder what your gonna do, when your
Disguise comes crashing down and yourself
Comes shining through, are you gonna hide your face?
Or let it rest in the hands of grace, grace

It's such a shame, the game you play

Blood spills still we do not see
The horrors of one thousand wars
Those who died without a cause

The battle rages on and on
Without victor without end

As we live in luxury
Countless starve upon the streets
Children crying out in pain
Children dying who is to blame

Does no one listen to their calls
Victims of the endless war
Pools of blood, flood city streets
Another victim, lies lifeless at my feet

He was stabbed to death
When he did not confess
He swore he was innocent
Now he's a bloody mess

Caught in the crossfire, bullet to the head
Rushed her to the hospital, D.O.A. dead

In the name of God almighty
They sent their child to die
Martyr with no fear of death
A promised paradise

Countless bloody victims
Scream in misery
Slaughtered without reason
Bound in agony

Without victor without end

Does no one listen to their calls

Land of dreams, set me free

Falling star burst into flames
Slice through the walls of yesterday
I stand before the oracle
Unveil, my destiny

Overland I reach and tear the sky
Truth pours through the hole and drowns my heart
I cannot breathe the tears and understand
Strolling through the refuge of the end

Aus dieser geht hervor, dass es sich bei einem Drittel der knapp 250 000 erfassten Fälle um sexuelle Gewalt gegen Kinde handelt. Laut BKA dÃ¼rfte die Dunkelziffer aber deutlich höher liegen.

Das Bundeskriminalamt hat jÃ¼ngst seine neuste Statistik Ã¼ber sexuellen Missbrauch in Deutschland veröffentlicht. Aus dieser geht hervor, dass es sich bei einem Drittel der knapp 250 000 erfassten Fälle um sexuelle Gewalt gegen Kinde handelt. Laut BKA dÃ¼rfte die Dunkelziffer aber deutlich höher liegen. Es wird vermutet, dass jedes Jahr Ã¼ber 200 000 Kinder unter 14 Jahren sexuell missbraucht werden.

Reaching for his arms
But there's no one there

She feels so old
She falls apart
As she fights back tears

And then she curls up small
And feels like she's alone here in Hell
And then she starts to scream

I deserve more
She's running out of time
She's running out of time

Oh tonight
Is just another night
Just like any other night

And then she climbs inside
And orders him to drive
Drive anywhere

He said
Hey you there's no need to cry
He began to stare

And then she curls up small
And feels like she's alone here in Hell

Blinded by the neon lights

She stands up straight
And takes some air

You've made a mess of your life
You won't make a mess of mine

Just like any other night

Oh tonight

She never took the train alone, 
She hated being on her own,
She always took me by the hand,
And say she needs me.

She never wanted love to fail, 
She always hoped that it was real 
She?d look me in the eyes, 
And say believe me.

But then the night becomes the day, 
And there?s nothing left to say,
If there?s nothing left to say, 
Then something?s wrong...

You killed me with your smile,

So beautiful...

Oh tonight, 
You killed me with your smile,

And as the hands would turn with time, 
She?d always say that she was my mine,
She?d turn and lend a smile, 
To say that she?s gone...

But in a whisper she?d arrive, 
And dance into my life,
Like a music melody, 
Like a lovers song!

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with a brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye 
The kid don't play
And if there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla  
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point, no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I bust a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead, yo 

So I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot, wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine, all I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla
Ice ice baby, Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic when I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla 
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla ice

Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother

Ice ice baby (too cold)
Ice ice baby (too cold, too cold)    
Ice ice baby (too cold, too cold)       
Ice ice baby (too cold, too cold)     
Ice ice baby (too cold, too cold)       
Ice ice baby (too cold, too cold)

Rearview Mirror,"This plan of yours it's so devious
You will get caught see what you did to us
I'll watch and laugh as you crash and burn
To hell and back, yes you will take your turn
And bring it down where you can comprehend
So thinking hard, you only want to defend
Last chance to change your life, life

Your expected solution so hard to find, you need to look deeper
Well don't you feel so guilty now?
The blame's on your hands, they figured out somehow
Well don't you feel so guilty now?
The blame's on your hands
It's written on your face? I'll watch you from above
Your pain declared to me

Can you feel there is no love, and your tortured ways inside of me?
Everlasting virtue of hate
I get so sick of all of your shit
I wish all your ideas would fade
I hope you never throw, I hope you never throw another fit?
Well don't you feel so guilty now?
The blame's on your hands, they figured out somehow.
Well don't you feel so guilty now?
The blame's on your hands

Of course you know they found your fingerprints
on everything you stained with your identity
Gave you your fame, your fame, your
Don't you feel so guilty now?
You're so guilty and it's on your face? Long turn down
You're something so high
It's all over now? Well don't you feel so guilty now?
