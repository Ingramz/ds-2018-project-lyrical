World Party,"Now here comes the world,
Here comes the moon and the sun.
From the top of the pyramid
You can see everyone.
Overe here is the desert,
Over there is the frozen north.
In Sweden they are blonde.
In Africa they're black,
For what it's worth.
The eagle's getting tired,
The bear cannot flap his wings,
People are running scared
As the little girl sings
What goes up,
Surely must ome down.
Don't keep your head in the ground.
Let the kingdom come.
And there's always more ...

Forever, Forever, wandering around my cave.
Forever, Forever, walking past my window.
Forever, Forever, wandering around my cave.
Forever, Forever, walking past my window.
Forever, Forever, wandering around my cave.

Finding the girl,
Follow her down to the stream.
Well you're scanning the walls,
Seaching for stills from your dreams.
You know the pandas are skating
On very thin ice.
If you understand me tap once, babe.
If you don't, just tap twice.
Please let the Kingdom Come.
Let the Kingdom Come.
And there's always more ...

Forever, Forever, wandering around my cave.
Forever, Forever, walking past my window.
Forever, Forever, wandering around my cave.
Forever, Forever, walking past my window.
Forever, Forever, wandering around my cave.

Yeah, the money is so different,
These computers are cute.
You better phone home right now,
See if they can find your lost parachute.
Well the best lack all conviction,
While the worst is yet to come.
You got to pick the politician up,
Kick his bum.
Roll over Beethoven. Let the Kingdom Come.
Let the Kingdom Come.

Don't it just flow through you.
Don't it just flow through everynoe.

Do you find yourself in light?
That's a question I want answered
Could you answer me tonight?
Could you give me some directions
In this cave of afterlife?
Do I struggle with my conscience
As it struggles with my life?
In this blackness that surrounds me
But doesn't give me any room
There's so much that I forget...
Is that the curse of the mummy's tomb?

We're all the bold explorer
We all seek gold and fame
Out asking for directions
To the house that knows no pain
And the casual traveler wonders
Who led us all astray
As he leans against the bar
And watches children play
In the blackness that surrounds them
Where there's never any room
But he's following his own quest
For the curse of the mummy's tomb

There are riches here you cannot sell
So value them we don't
There are spies at every corner
Please help us they say ""won't""
There are special traps of wisdom
Devised to seize the fool
To entomb him with the mummy's gold
There are demons who shout ""duel!""
But I'm too busy with my conscience
I'm too busy with my gloom
Can you rid me of the fever?
That's the curse of the mummy's tomb

We started out together
Our expeditions linked
But every student has a theory
The best he's ever thinked
And our vanity betrays us
And our nerve it disappears
After crossing the dark threshold
Into loneliness and tears
Could I travel into caves unknown
Hear the dullest thud of doom
Can I wander noisy silence?
That's the curse of the mummy's tomb

Buried deep within the mountain
In the Valley of the King
There's a passageway that leads there
Where the wind whistles and sings
Of a time so long forgotten
But it seems like yesterday
When the queen was in her palace
And the king was on his way
To the bosom of his family
To the holy golden womb
What was that love?
That's the curse of the mummy's tomb

If you want to know what happened here
There is writing on the wall
There are strange signs and ornaments
That'll really tell you all
But they're easy to misunderstand
You have to tell the truth
That's how you find the secret
Of her eternal youth
There are curses that are blessings
There are clues in every room
It's up to you now
That's the curse of the mummy's tomb

Nobody there to help you
As the apparition nears
Nobody loves like she did
Could take away your fears
Was this what you were afraid of?
Life without the queen?
Forget it, just remember
This life is but a dream
And you know that hope's returning
Like a new bride to the groom

There's no curse...

Hercules, remember me fool?
Me and you used to go to the same primary school
And I remember school then. You was the bully
And I was one of the children

You used to treat me like dirt and hurt my inners
I already knew the school paid for my dinners
That's right, flares were worn, shoes were torn
I was the subject of scorn, wondering why I was born
While you - you had it all
You was the rude boy plus the bad boy at football
You couldn't be touched with a barge pole
You was the captain of the ship and we was the cargo
You used to play pat ball, you hated me so much
Much so because I gave you low cuts - the cuts below
''cause it was my only defence, against
A Hercules figure that was this much bigger
Extra, extra, vexed and sorta very violent
That's why it was best to always keep quiet

You was up North and I was definitely South

Kiss chasing all the chicks, pocket full of 'Swizzle Sticks'
'Bazooka Bubblegum', 'Space Dust' and 'Wham!'
Technicolour bed fluff meant I wasn't the man
For kiss chase, now that was real life trauma
Girls would break down and cry if I caught them in the corner
I guess it was my Elvis Presley sheep skin jacket
And my holy toes were peeking outside my socks and outside my shoes
Got a lot of stress from you and you and you
Still, life's a game, and I guess I'm a learner
Used to fantasize about my neighbour's 'Rally Burner'
All I wanted in life was a 'Grifter'
Got fed up, went and stole one with my sister
We rode all day, at the end we put it back
Couldn't have took it home, I would've received slaps
On my D-O-M-E, you see my mummy
She would've slapped me on my be	 stroke S-I-D-E
For trying to do such conforming to other peoples needs
Now I'm learning the game with speed, Hercules
Trying to do such conforming to other peoples needs
Now I'm learning the game with speed, Hercules

You mean those days when everybody laughed?
Well, how did they ever, ever slip away?
Just like rolling off a log!
As we say goodbye to God.
Yeh, the animal still feels odd
Asleep inside.

At the end of every day.

And we still don't believe

About a vision that I saw
Drawing water for your husband

Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,

With sweat,

As they ride on, hear their cry.

Une épaule fragile et solide a la fois

On sera jamais des ""standards"", des gens bien comme il faut

The will to go on when I'm hurt deep inside
Whatever the feeling whatever the way
It helps me go on from day to day

Nos filles sont brunes et l'on parle un peu fort
Et l'humour et l'amour sont nos tresors

I can give you my voice bred whith rhythm and soul

The songs that I love and the stories I've told

Worlds Apart,"We never said forever
And if we did I never
Expected leases to sign
But still I felt so sure
Whatever comes
She's a friend of mine
So friend turns into lover
How quickly we discover
The ground we're trading on
Is mined
Love takes no prisoners
But when I reach for her
She's hard to find
Inside I cried
(But she won't know)
(Never know)
Tell her
Just say I said hello
I thrive on isolation
An independent station
I'm in a unit of one
Don't blow my cover now
I know this solo
Has just begun
Don't say you saw me crying
Please don't say
You know I'm lying
//and I pritented all is fine
Just say I'm strong and free
Don't tell // and you won't be
A friend of mine
Inside I cried
But she won't know

Just say I said hello

It is seldom that a dream comes true

That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along

And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember

Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke

Wrathchild America,"Ticking away the moments
That make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground
In your hometown
Waiting for someone or something
To show the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying here to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
There's always time to kill today
And then one day you'll find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun
But its sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in the relative way
But you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way
The time is gone the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say
Home, home again
I like to here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell",Time,1989

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1977

Underneath your Pac-a-Mac?

Whispered 'gay Paris'
And looking ever-so French the bohemian dream
You said 'bonjour mon ami'

When I moved into my studio flat?
Hot sticky nights
In the summertime in bedsitland 
Do you remember
When you sold your paintings in the gallery?
And they said 'mais oui ce soir

Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears

Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun
Pining a way in a heat wave there
Hoping that I won't be long
I should be lying on that sun swept beach with her
Caressing her warm, brown skin
And then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

Fall or floss, small or cry could mean slow suicide
On these streets scratching for my keep, grinding for my people
When you're not treated equal, it's so hard to live legal

Will my seed deceive em, to this never ending saga
Fascinated by cash cars, and clothes just like our papa
Taking mo' gambles than Pac did, in pursuit of the dolla
On the verge of crapping out, from money and power

Having big body dreams, and wood grain wishes
Trying to taste the good life, cause it looks so delicious
Man the pressure's tremendous, so I smoke on spinach
Trying to find some piece of mind, than get caught from behind

Mashing for the finish line, in this cruel millennium
Make mo' shine than lime, I'm spending more than time
Rocking pie with dimes, keep the top reclined

And if I turn my back now, then my kids won't eat

My wolf pack won't sleep, until we slay all prey
Get vicious without perdition in this Y2K
This feddy is in my vision, in this hectic paper chase
Wrecking my lyrical weapon, pimp the pen at a steady pace

Wrekonize,"Bad day with my bitch
Negativity on my phone is ridiculous
Limo shine up on the real Tech N9ne
They talkin' 'bout I'm the sickness
Comin' at that shit so vicious
Get up out of my bed, I'm sick of feelin' restricted
Fans sayin' I switched
They can tell I was hurt by lookin' at my Twit pic
Got a call from Stevie, y'all know his steezie
Said he's 'bout to come to KC, wanna have a get together, that's easy
Got a little Cabo Wabo, some biz and Cîroc, yo
They wanna have it at my house, is there room for Frizz and Picasso?
Hell yeah, come on down
Told Makzilla be done on rounds, we gotta get more liquor, spread the fun around
We 'bout to kick it with family, put the gun on down
Nigga, I ain't kicked it in eons
'Bout to be cooler than Freon
Got another call from my homeboy in Denver, named Dion
He just pulled into KC sayin' he's double fisted, with bottles
I told him I was on liquor duty and ?Stone'em? was on models
All of my niggas ready for action
When I woke, I don't remember this crashin'
I can try and tell you in the next verse
But I don't really know what happened

It's just a blur, blur, blur
The whole thing's just a blur, blur, blur
It's just a blur, blur, blur
The whole thing's just a blur, blur, blur
The whole thing's just a blur

Woke up, got sick, ain't nobody sleepin' in my shit
Looked in the mirror, that's fucked up
Because busted is my top lip
Real busted, real puffy, like a nigga punched me the fuck out
I don't smoke by my mouth taste like big ? like my nigga Yukmouth
I think I remember two chicks, one thick, another was a toothpick
I think I was takin' shots with 'em, of Patrón, I don't do this
KC Teas, ghetto suds, talkin' to the chick with ghetto butts
She was trippin' when another beautiful widow cut
In front of me when she was talkin', I said ""Oh, fuck!""
Everybody keep sayin'
But I don't remember even seein'
But I heard if you really wanna please
Put one, two, and maybe three
Glimpses of a house full of bitches and dancin'
And some losin' their pants, romancin' each other
And eating each other, and beating these brotha's
My publicist almost stuck a bitch
Cause she punched my nigga with her fucking fist
But he kicked her out, instead
???
Then somehow when I touched her
My lip hit her big head


Scenario, what happened?
That nigga keep laughin', cause he made all the drinks potent
My lip is fucked, I'm not jokin'
Said she's made up with hips out, she 'bout 5'1"", hell pretty, but cripped out
Said she got a little cocky, called me a demon and I flipped out
Said her body was boozed up and her earlobes had a few cuts
I told him I don't hit women, I don't do stuff
I came downstairs, all my niggas still sprawled out
The makings of Caribou Lou, now there's a loose screw

The night was going perfectly, all seemed well
I woke up in the darkness dizzy, feelin' like hell
I don't feel like myself, oh no
I've never ever felt this way before in so long

Odd when I bust, K.O.D. put em in Necropolis
Givin' this rod to the good broads, and they givin' they bras to us
With the gift to break up a couple that's monogamous
Stop with the probs and take off your effin' draws, bitch and rock with us

Pick a million pricks and I'm pretty sure that you missed the one

Go up in it deep as she was feindin’ when she saw my weiner

She told me she like to play with the pussy when she get lonely
Homie if I was only right there instead of a sony
You claimin' the pussy wet, but dont tell me baby, just show me
She ask if I’m comin' up with the mask in my entrance
Sinner in a second real spitter like every sentence
She was there for repentance, ever since i was an infant
I’m damagin' the vagina, remind you I’m filled with vengeance
Hit 'em whenever they ever wanna run up
And they doin' it cause I rap and shit
I really don’t care, whatever it takes, to get 'em up on the mattress
I could have been the one that’s huntin run for bustin a gun
But this is way more fun to get up in these motherfucking actresses
In bikinis and suckin' on my zucchini
She told me she wanna be me while sippin' Apple Martinis
Fuck it if I'm a meanie she probably would never leave me
Shit I can play eenie meanie from sly and cuff on my weenie

Open up the vein get a bit insane better train
Jane to be shelling me in sentimental cellophane
Wrek is aimed higher than the heavens on a weather vane
Better stay ready meng if you sleeping get a lane
Wake up time to get a better brain
Fly over rooftops i don't need to shed a thang
Lighter than a feather when I fly cause I'm clever
But I still drop bombs like a military aero plane
This'll be epitome of energy get up
And get it physically or bleed for the remedy
I think it's gonna be a murder of the gimmicky
Silliest motherfuckers who been acting like they getting g's
Let the conquest go critics and cynics in it to bomb Wrek's flow
Millions of minutes we get them all left low
I been on that show with a Comcast soul
I'll connect you get your extra decks to lecture necks snapping the best of
People in Miami out over into the rest of the world wide sector

I never felt this free before in all my freaking life
These inhibitions clearly need to cease to be denied
It's you and I we'll ride until the sun is in our sights
I don't know how else to describe it but it's nice
When it's all up in my bloodstream
Deep inside my bloodstream, I can feel it in my bloodstream
It's been released into the bloodstream
Let's hope this kind of feeling never dies

You can feel it in your veins, adrenalin
Shake shack vibe with a payback line
Tell em to leave him be in the cave that's fine
Reclusive dude with loosey tunes a nuisance
All up in the business with an 8 track grind
I sat up with a boombox and threw thoughts
In Hollywood Miamis little version of the boondocks
We beat up on the trash cans and who thought
I'd take it the level we all know only a few rock
Better than the beef ends
Tell 'em to get packing with the backing of the defense
I wanna just see a sequence decent
These motherfuckers coming up to challenge us in sequence
I came to change the lame brains
Refrain the same game and stake the name claim
Let's see if they can get it with no credit overzealous
And they bet it all down on the fake estate fame

I never felt this free before in all my freaking life
These inhibitions clearly need to cease to be denied
It's you and I we'll ride until the sun is in our sights
I don't know how else to describe it but it's nice

Kill 'em and kill 'em again
The shots slow your life, you should’ve known the price
Killer that holds the knife to your throat and slice
And when I’m creepin’ by, dippin' the ‘Lac
Homie the reason I’m rippin’ the gat is to go BRRAT BRRAT
Then your people die, nigga, blink your eyes
I'll put you on your back quicker than that

I never felt this free before in all my freaking life
These inhibitions clearly need to cease to be denied
It's you and I we'll ride until the sun is in our sights
I don't know how else to describe it but it's nice
When it's all up in my bloodstream
Deep inside my bloodstream, I can feel it in my bloodstream
It's been released into the bloodstream
Let's hope this kind of feeling never dies",Adrenaline,2013
Wrekonize,"Yeah, I know you
You from that, you from that group, right?
I've seen y'all going all around the country and shit
Y'all got it poppin' right now, shit
How does it feel to blow up, man?
You got that easy money, shit

Lemme get my grind on I been moving like a cyclone
Through the years keep my rhyme strong
All to eat and keep the motherfucking lights on
What your problem is shit we got jobs
Will saying that they just high profile
Speaking to eat and keeping the street
Under your feet whenever kids
Are trying to beef cause they got no style
I see you touring the show making the thickest of women get low
Must be the shit so motherfucking legit
To get a grip from the hip exit get the dough
Shit I got boo coo fees to relieve
I ain't free still gotta pay taxes
Still gotta meet Uncle Sam's demand
And god damn still hide a couple stacks under the mattress
What you think this is?
You really think I got balls in the lotto
You think I got a money tree full of leaves
And I bleed out green got a cellar full of bottles?
This is life ain't it? Money come money go cause it quite tainted
All nuttin' but a thing cause it ain't really

[Chorus]
No such thing as easy money
I don't care what they say
No such thing as easy money
I don't care what they say
No such thing as easy money
Still I spend it away
Let 'em hate, easy money
I don't care what they say
There's no such thing as easy

Money will come and go quicker than the air that's gets up into your lungs
Breathing heavier than normal and it's steady for months
My lady just wanna see me more than a second for once
It's a fucked up game full of pain huh we all working through the process
My conditioning's conditioned cause I'm steady on a mission
For the better life and getting all these objects obsessed
What a life, we all paying a price to be bathed in the light
I been wanting to know if you feeling alien tonight
Cause I never really seem to feel that safe in the sights
Wall Street fucks with they suit and the tie
Getting bread but to get it they be losing they pride
Always kept cool even when they ruin my tide
I've always envied those who just came out to shoot at the sky
I been hustling since I was old enough to get a buck
And live up to the meaning of a dollar
Got a job pushing shopping carts and taking bullshit
From a jacked up douche in a collar
Huh I was fifteen acting like the money would be better
For the status of my karma
But nothing's easy and I keep telling my momma

[Chorus]

See everybody wanna be the man
With the master plan that's on the top
They want the cars, want the clothes
Want the broads and the bottles to pop
But when ya sittin' out on the throne
Laid back chillin' being the king
With the watch and the chain and the pinky ring
You better watch your back for all the hate it bring
See everybody goon love yo ass
When you broke as a joke and you not a threat
But soon as you get that bread and you start turning heads
Watch how jealous they get
When your status is elevated
You kind of made it and you get some change
If they don't get what they think they suppose to get
Then motherfuckers start acting strange
Pointing fingers, talking down
Acting funny when you come around
Next thing you know you the talk of the town
Use to have a smile, now you got a frown
You ain't know that's the price of fame
And that's what it cost to be in this game
You better be built for it or stay in your lane, mayne

Wrekonize,"I fill my teacAnnotateup with a bunch of stems and watch them heat up
This whole work week sucked, I really need to ease up

Through the map and chew the fat all from the back of my mind
Sometimes it's business but most the time it's purely pleasure
Seeing things that gets ya double checking what your next to
Try to keep the dosage underneath the limit dexter
Or otherwise I'm leaving off the couch out on a stretcher
Trying not to freak out wallpaper walking

Belladonna ballerinas bouncing on my brow
I'm sitting on the porcelain the walls are melting down
I'm back out at the gathering and hanging with the clowns
Wait it looks just like my living room I must be coming down
Got an angel on my shoulder oh no wait it's Cheech Marin
Got a stripper on his lap who tells me that she speaks Italian
My ceiling fan is a demons hand that is leaking lambs
Anthony Hopkins greeting fam with a piece of spam
Ok now get a grip Wrek, you know you're tripping nuts
Don't forget about that magic drink inside your sippy cup

Flipping tripping space balls fly soaring solar rocks

Wrekonize,"She said some crazy shit, and I was like, you're a freak
Ha, freak, you heard me? You're a freak!

And I truly wanna come and see what make you tick
Thick hips and a pierced lip, let me dip quick
Shit, get this dick I'm gonna give
My mind, that's one hell of a grip
For a woman looking semi-innocent
You been waiting for the minute you could live
And get me all up in your liver and your ribs
This is not for the women talking bout a little romance
I mean the women not afraid to get both hands
Close and, down on a grown man
She got toys and the wax
All down to her back and her outfit - latex
But it's feeling quite dangerous
This ain't never really felt like safe sex
But we do it anyway, with a bit of Henny
Get a medic ready for the blade, you're an outcast
I'm vinny on the case
Would never diss on a Marisa Tomei
Get down, like I know you wanna wrassle
I'm livin' out my life never bashful
Give it to me with the lace and the tassles
And let 'em hate, tight lippin' assholes
Give me a safe word, it's picnic
Tie you up and give me the jailbird, my hitlist
Needs you to get this, sick shit
Right up from the gutter bring another for the L-word
Take a breath, and I'm gonna accept
Your best bet is to blow my mind
Could put your back out, but I'm sick of that route
I'mma have you tryin' to get up with a broken spine

And everywhere that we go
You're never fittin' in with all the regular folks
You're a freak, you're a freak, you're a
You got your bad habits, but I ain't mad at it
Some people don't feel right being that average
You're a freak, you're a freak, you're a
You're a freak

Hella pale like Twilight, had to get her up
Into my room and give her my bite
When the sky's bright, she never deny pipe
But we get really horny lovin' and fly by night
She so like a freakshow, other people
Speak no, peace show full of ego
She so, like a d-bro, with her V though
That'll have a nigga weak in the peephole
Everywhere we go people spot us
They yelling (You're a freak)
But I love it, she's beautiful
Rough and rugged, you're a keep
And when I put it up inside of her
She say to me (You're a freak)
Cause when I'm bangin' inside her
Ways, I'll be in it ballsdeep
If you want this thing and
You ain't trippin' it, you bloody (You're a freak)
If you like to put yourself
Where she be muddy, you're a creep
If you want me to stick in between your boobies
When you're lickin' it (You're a freak)
If you want me to be normal
Stiff and formal, then you're a geek
Invite them all, and I pipe with all, of my might
I'mma be a fight to y'all, cause I bite the broads
And I knife them all in my sight
Never be ordinary, stick the more the merry
Go that far, we stay cray
Everyone look at you stupid when you're an F-R-E-A-K

And everywhere that we go
You're never fittin' in with all the regular folks

Hear the music and I'm coming out to face it
In the place where they may get face lifts
Instead of trying to get a bit of entertainment
Walk a thin line on an incline
All above a little bit of sentimental circus
And we thought this what we we're owed
I think these motherfuckers maybe getting nervous
I'm on some take what's mine

You all crooked and your whole team shows it
We break crews like you for the focus
This is a message for all of those trying to hold me back

'Cause they preserve the day it's due
So we can get it tasting new
I can't speak good
Because I'm raised to just behave
Instead of go and seize the day
They told me learn to be a slave

You can keep it with it's shitty little owner own up
I'm on some take what's yours
Gimme bass in the core with a taste of the war
It was safer before when we wade to the shore
Just to get another fate from The Lord
I be running round and trying to figure out the cycle
With a bit of bullshit an a rifle
When I spit an pull shit get an eyeful
This strange mans not a god damn idol
You been so busy just chasing the dream that they sold you quick
Bend over back up and just slowly drift
On top of that pack of exploding dicks
They say us passive will get fucked along the line

You ain't gotta take it all, you know
We too have seen the balance of the positive and negative
And I've wanted so bad to get even for no reason
When it's just that easy now to wanna let 'em live
Shit I'd bring EMJ back lost 'em on the road and I still hate that
His kids are still at home and trying to trace back
That daddy's never coming and it's time to face facts
That we can be his breathing keep his energy in each
And every season speak what he believed in, breed this heavenly kin
And keep his music banging on the speakers all weekend
I Know what the fuck is going on
I see what the news is making you believe
They got us wanting now to follow them and all
Even when it end up forcing us to bleed
This is the way that we say we will not sit here while they bury us and leave
They program us to hate up on each other
But it's easy to discover that is only they disease

Well Heaven knows
That sometimes it's just hard for us to smile
So come with me, cause you and I
We will walk this road awhile
I've seen the lost without a cause
Redefine against the odds
Hold your head up and be strong
'Cause we will rise in spite of all

I know some people that are stuck inside they own mind
And they won't try peace unless they find somebody on time
Or even hear another voice up on the phone line
You ain't alone, you know
We too feel the balance of the positive and negative

The prosperous but you acting like your own nemesis
I know that troubles around and it gets tough
To really know if motherfuckers are down
I better be getting on now this is rugged and I'll
Need a second just to set the record up on a cloud lifeless
Looking up to Leanne's likeness
I see my mom's mom looking down on us like this
And wonder if my own godless beliefs
Are somehow damaging the ones close to my license
Might get sticky but the facts remain
We gotta stay and keep it moving or collapse in pain
I'mma craft the game back up relax and claim

Or Ratty when he had the cold Jeep
I swear everyting they wore was on freeze
I mean everyting they wore was on fleek
See the jungle where I live is concrete
I'm just tryna be a Mowgli
And everybody's trapping 'round me
But nobody ain't styling on me
I turned into the older that I always wan' be
I copped my first Q from C's
I'm tryna build my line, I can't sleep
Then I built my line and now I can't sleep
Now my neighbors dem are getting nosey
Cah I'm in and out, can't pass three
And my baby mother's getting lonely
And every day she says she wan' leave
Now the next ting, she saying she ah breed
I can't breathe
Cah now I gotta make some more P
But it's getting cat and mouse with the police
I just got a chase, had to dash a lil B
Came back couldn't even find E
And then the fucking feds even tried to take Z
And when they came back, man, the fuckers took P
They raided 6 yards it was 6:30
Federali looking like the army
So now I got the feeling that they're tryna swarm me
So now I'm only rapping on beats

Even my mum put pressure on me
And then my son put pressure on me
Even the slum put pressure on me
But pressure makes diamonds
Even my mum put pressure on me
And then my son put pressure on me
Even the slum put pressure on me
But pressure makes diamonds

Look what the pressure made
It made you make it
Singing ""Started from the Bottom""
'Cause you started from the bottom, in the basement
Look at what the pressure made
It made you make it
Singing ""Started from the Bottom""
'Cause you started from the bottom, in the basement

Now I got my whole fam banking on me
'Cause if I don't provide then nobody don't eat
The Lord made a giant out of little old me
'Cause pressure made I, man
Now I got my whole fam banking on me
'Cause if I don't provide then nobody don't eat
The Lord made a giant out of little old me
'Cause pressure made I, man, yeah

All the stresses, yeah
For us, adult adolescents
I been getting paid just to finish off my sentence
Same time my little brother's trying to finish off his sentence
We just wanna shine, we put diamonds in our pendants
Truth is, we're just trying to find some independence
Our descendants probably look and think we look horrendous
Which side is your preference? Love and hate got four letters
Those who wish me death, I just say they got a deathwish
Call them toy soliders, I can eat them for my breakfast
Put them in my eggs, leave them running till they're breathless
Or put them in the pan, let them sizzle till they perish
I'm a diamond and I'm precious, my diamond's from the pressure",Pressure,

Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

And I write my own verso
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper

Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow)

From day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back

Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a French church tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen?
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week,
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife,
Right now it's better than it's never been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me,
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak,
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it.
They chase dreams together like a slumber party,
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading.

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.

You better wake up cause I am making moves,
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms,
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training,
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze.
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading,
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception,
cause they try to hit misses with my direction,
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike,
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night,
The haters know where the family lives,
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger.
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it.
They say sleep is the cause of death,
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs I'm N/A reading.
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next.

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
They watching me! They watch me sleep!

Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality,
And daydream about losing my sanity.
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow.
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed.
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat.
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep.
See, all the dreams I'm fonder,
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I Mr hard worker,
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up,
And I missed my chance worst luck,
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah, and I walked from ish,
thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.

Let's take it back there, time to go in
Tell 'em Wretch, tell 'em Wretch

I'm on some off with your head shit
I keep firing, I'm not The Apprentice
Devs told me to go in, ah yeah
So I wrap blocked all the exits
Yes I'll be here forever
The chair's so far I'll leave here in leather
So dark, so cold
With a couple girls sitting on my lap
I'm never gonna say I'm back
I'm a little too in love with plaques
I moved in to the hall of fame
So I wipe my feet on tracks

I'ma kill it, I'm a killer
See me with one glove, it's a Thriller
I already had a number one for my dinner
Me and Devs go in there, inner

And we're out of here, I doubt you're near
I've already been a thousand 'ere

Had to give 'em so dough to get a pizza

Every day I have to take away
Tomorrow won't be the same today
I don't score when I'm at home
I strike more when I play away

Shut down the asylum
Before I creep through the exit, find it
Jump any fence inside then drag a man
Out of a car that he just was driving

And then put the pedal to the floor
I'm back and I'm ready for the war like a Viking
I ain't gotta tell 'em any more, me and Wretch
Already killed this UK Grime thing

Mind what you're talking, I might dissect

With scissors and severing ties

Now I need loot, this a like to my figures on YouTube

Test me, then I'm running out full of anger
And envy and stamping you out in my blue shoes

'Til you put 'em in the frame

Now I'm home alone in my owner home

Rome then roam
Came home smelling like hot Cologne
Had a success overdose, woah

You see my roll-on flow
And I'm so sure that I can't be old
Yet all my heels I carry on toe to toe
When we take this game now, so cologne

You couldn't play my post
I'm an old soul like an ancient ghost
That created his name in the game and he
Took shit to another level on the whole

I can't really explain my brain
But if you peeked inside of my skull
You'd see shit so deep in my rear
Eye low deep, know why I feel this cold

And I feel like the caped crusader
Here on the brink of a dangerous caper
I'm always collected and calm in battle
Can't be rattled, go sample a shaker

OT, I'm an out taker
I'm taking out any men that are minor
And think that they're major, there's a devil and a
Wretch that just broke out of the chamber

Yes, now I'm going for the hat-trick
One singer, one model, one actress
But I might disappear if you're acting
Or singing me a new tune on a mad pitch

Back to my rap shit
I'ma go hard this year
Can't be looking at the past this year
That won't help me get past this year

In an extra zone next to tracks
Multiple hits but with extra swag
I've divided my time
Royalties won't forget to add

And I ain't adding nobody on my BB
iPhone when I want you to see me
I plane, You tube
See me on Wretch32 TV

I'm getting flashbacks from the past
Head full of hate and a mouth full of bars
Me and Wretch just stretched this game to a next span
Taking the extra yard

We're going extra hard, no I can not be barred
Say what you want, but you couldn't keep Devs out
Anyways, I've already broke through the fence now
And I'm quite relentless when I vex out

Everybody wants to the the best out
But he gets stripped like a bitch when I dress down
Think you're a face round 'ere?
Get left lying face down in a next town

Wretch 32,"Baby don't hold it back
You've been screaming your feelings all night
Then you don't say one thing, one thing
You ain't all that
But I give you my heart, I'm down on my knees
And you just say nothing, nothing

It's a four letter word, and it's what I deserve
But you keep on sayin' no way, no way (no way)
You think you're so tough, you're protesting too much
And that's what gives you away, away

You love me, you love me
I can tell by the way that you're looking at me
You love me, you love me
I know that you love me
You love me, you love me
And I know that this is where you want to be
You love me, you love me
Stop holding back from me

(You love me, you love me, you know that you love me)
(You love me, you love me, you know that you love me)

You love me, you can hide the words from your mouth
But I can read them, read them
They found me, you don't need to say them out loud
But I can see them, see them

It's a four letter word, and it's what I deserve
But you keep on sayin' no way, no way (no way)
You think you're so tough, you're protesting too much
And that's what gives you away, away
(You know it gives you away)

I can tell by the way you're looking at me
You love me, you love me, I know that you love me
You love me, you love me
And I know that this is where you want to be
You love me, you love me
Stop holding back from me

(You love me, you love me, you know that you love me)
(You love me, you love me, you know that you love me)

I'm the type to replace 4 letters with 6 words
I found my treasure in a diamond in the thick dirt
It ain't ironic she's got thick curves
Always sayin' that she'll die for me, we've got to live first
She wants me to put a ring on it
That's why anytime she calls, let it ring a bit
But she'll be crying me a river, I can swim in it
I got a breast stroke, baby, if I want to live a bit
And it used to be a riddle when we used to be poor
Now we see sea shells on the sea shore
Said you saw me less when I was on the streets more
Now we on our road to riches, had to take a detour
From the tower block to the Eiffel tower with a view
Keep your standards like your heels, I'll be towering with you
You've seen my winnings baby, how we gonna lose?
And if the energy's the chemistry, the powers got to fuse

I love you, I love you
Baby I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Do you love me too?
Baby I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you
Do you love me too?

I love you
Baby I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
Do you love me too?

Oh boy I love you
You know it's true
And you know I'll always love you my babyyyyyyy

I can tell by the way that you're looking at me
(I can tell by the way that you're looking at me)

Wretch 32,"I'm going through a break-up again
I see a dozen women and I break up with ten
I put 'em back together then I break 'em again
That's a match made in heaven or the thin line between
Love and hate that we cross 'till it makes us repent
I'm tryna let you know that this plays on my head
So you don't have to wait 'till I'm dead
'Cause patience ain't one of your strengths
I waited a lifetime just to end up in the limelight
I write rhymes so they won't consider me an Einstein
While they was nominated for a Grammy for the ninth time
I was shedding tears with my family in the nite nite
Night time's over, I see man acting like Scarface
But they won't survive like Sosa
The night I woke up was when that black car rolled up
I was like nine years old, blud
Shopping for my mother, went to buy a tin of corned beef
Car lights flashing, is this when me and the Lord meet?
Tints rolled down, he shook his head when he saw me
I guess it wasn't for me
I've skipped death more than you've skipped breath
In your gym sesh, cardio won't make the kid wretch
I've seen the prince cry when the king left
Is the Queen gonna check mates or keep him in check?
Now I've seen a gunner ball rolling like him with Cech
Screaming ""suck your mudda"", incest
It makes you wonder where the kid went
When gunshot lick all our in friend
But fear won't allow you to be yourself
I'm Cool J in a Kangol, yeah, I did it well
Don't wanna see us bond, guess they'd rather I Stringer Bell
So that's why I punch above my weight 'till I beat Adele
I am Shakespeare with great hair
I'll probably be the next Wayne Hector in eight years
Tinchy had to break a few records to break here
Drake really had to take the pressure to Take Care
Take care of you, take care of me, take care of us
Take care of Mum, take care of everyone
You see how fast the hate turns to love
When everybody has to rate what you've done
Man will throw shade on the slums
But I rate what it made me become
See, I could have been wasted and dumped
Stuck with about an eighth in my lungs
Yeah, I pray the fuckboys keep their distance
I'm listening to Beres, putting up a resistance
You can keep your merits, man, I come for distinctions
I'm from the type of home where my brother's my sister
But that don't make a difference cuh I love her to bits and
We're just some have-nots tryna master the system
I had a mega drive when I was running the infants
Young Fire, Old Flame, you'll get bun in the distance
Wait for me
Mummy, won't you pray for me?
Heavy like I'm carrying a slave on me
But I'm just carrying the game on me
It's just a game
They say it's just a game, they say it's just a game
Well, if this is just a game
Why we dying just to play?
It's just a game
They said it's just a game, they say it's just a game
Well, if this is just a game
Why we dying just to play?
And for you, this might be another eight
But for me, this is just another day
Just another race, in a race with the racists
Tryna make it off the slave ship
Can I get a break? 'Cause I don't want another chase
'Cause I'm tired and there's no one to relate
Nor can nobody relate
My grandmother was a great
I had to put her in a grave, now my shoulder still aches
I had to carry her away
I'm still carrying the pain

First of all I hate the way you talk to me
But I fucking can't stand when you're ignoring me
It's like everyday you want to go to war with me
You're crying over spilt milk and trying to wipe the floor with me
Everytime I ring you, your phone was in your bag
But every time I'm with you your phone is in your hand
Yeah I get annoyed and you'll say I'm paranoid 
And I'll send another message like, ""I'll never phone you back""
And why would you say, ""Cool"" to that if you ain't cool with that?
You make me feel like it was all a plan
Like there's a man up in your yard 
And you're waiting for the chance to let a couple hours pass just to call me back
And you don't never sound the same when you're in the wrong
Kinda sound like you're staring down your intercom
Just waiting for him to leave, said you'd tell me if you did cheat 
And I'm breaking what we could be so I'm guessing it's make believe
Still I don't believe you but I'll run with it
'Cause I'm out 'ere keeping up some fuckery
And just because I beat doesn't mean that you can beat
Because two fucks don't make a right and it could never tarnish me
Sometimes I wonder if I've ever rocked your world
You care about your lashes and you care about your girls
The one you're always chatting, but she always does your nails
Talking about your fashion, ""It's gotta be YSL""
Even though I think the dress couldn't be shorter
Kinda makes me wonder, how the fuck were you brought up?
Hearing conversation about your love for the altar
Still I never listen 'cuh I've done it with all ya

I don't think that you respect me
I kinda think that you expect me to be here waiting for you coz its easier
Coz we've got a child together, went the extra mile together
But still there ain't a picture where we ever smile together
How many times do I have to say, how many times
I'm getting sick and I'm tired and I'm tired and I'm crying my eyes out, I don't know why
And then you've got the cheek to come and dry my eyes
Avoiding me don't mean jack now
The toilet seat can go back down
And you can back down
You say your upbringing made you never trust women
Well it's funny how we're both from that background
And I trust you with my life
And you've hit me twice
And both times I came back crying
I wish you knew the kitchen just like you know women
I wish you knew the dishes just like you know whippin'
Between us there's a big difference, I might reply to a DM but you go the distance
Said I want a baby you were scared, I could tell
But when you slept with that hoe you weren't protecting yourself
And that's disgusting, imagine if you gave me something
Probably just say your favorite word, say nothing
And don't try and lie because I know that it's true
It was one of your friends fucking telling on you
Plus the fact, I could fucking smell it on you
You treat me like I'd never do better than you

I had to jump in there like ""Yo, chill""
He tried to beat the nigga for like 35 dollars
But the fiend was on some slim Bruce Lee shit
He had his sneakers was tied tight
That's how I know niggas was fighting, 'cause it was tight
All of a sudden that nigga slammed Berto like duh duh
Had him on the floor
He was like ""Yo, yo, get him off!""
Had to get the nigga off just in time
Pounded on him for like 2 seconds or whatever

Wu-Tang,"They did not tell us that all of that, being my own person and my being independent
Would lead to separation, loneliness, celibacy, and lesbianism
They didn't tell us that if you give up the man, you're gonna take one of these things
It gets worse and would destroy your nation
They made us think it was some kind of glorified position to brag about the fact that 
I got my own job, my own credit card, my own car so I don't need no man
I don't even know how we got that mixed up
Ain't none of that got anything to do with having being with no man
We have some serious relationship problems
You know, over 60% of our women are single, widowed, separated, or divorced
They don't have a man 
They need fathers, they need protection 
To raise a child, you need a parental coalition of a man and a woman
We have sons, by not having have a father in the home, they don't know how to respect women 
They may bring the welfare system in and tell us in order to feed, and clothe
And house our children, we have to give up our man–we have to put the man out of the house
When the white farmwife goes to the government for subsidy for the farm
They don't tell them to get rid of the farm and they keep that family together

I've been a hard rock before they added the Arm & Hammers

No type of slander but tell them hoes ""I'm not your Santa""

Wu-Tang,"I have nothing but respect for our young people and what they're doing
My thing is, we adults did not stand strong
And on our square to bring our young people through this process
I know, I was the young person that had to fend for himself in the streets of New York
I know what happened, with our young people
I say, ""Look I ain't mad at you"" know no matter what I hear
I know that you are moving through a process because they are attempting 
To destroy the community so they're using you
They are buying you out
But we as adults, get to buy them back
I'm ready to compete with anybody for our young people's minds
And what we have to is change the paradigm of how we're interacting with them
Deal with them from a heartfelt place where they can understand
You see because whether you realize it or not, it's you they're shooting in the streets
You, young brothers, they're the ones that are being shot
So with this entertainment or with this music, maybe I don't like what I hear
Maybe that I don't like some of the words I hear
Maybe that I don't like the direction
But I think they're doing a pretty good job considering that
We, as men, the adult men, did not cover that when we should've covered that
And protected them when we should've protected them
And brought them up that so when we see an artist acting in a most inappropriate way
""Where is the father in this?""
""Where is that male mentor that can be there?""
We, as black men, must take on the responsibility 
As the honorable Elijah Muhammad told Malcolm is that
A nation is only as strong as its weakest family

We have to create relationships between the African man and the African woman

Young niggas racist, smokers is basing
We seen the eyes laying up, playing the cut, what?
Stay in the truck, something told me duck, folded me up
My shoulders struck out of luck, fucked the Pradas up
Fell in a daze like a Golotta snuff, niggas tried to body me up
I'm in the lobby bleeding, niggas in the waiting office probably eating
And sprinting and beefing when they heard the shots called the precinct
And seen barber nieces beast, some niggas shot Shallah features
And shot through his Ellesses, bent the spinal cordless creatures
I'm gagging and flagging a cab down
Guess who in the Benz wagon, dragging my sound down macking
It was Dale Breedy the greedy, conniving-ass snake genie
Cop with a bikini who murdered Tosh and Benini
I'm feeling wheezy and I'm drained from the cheeba grieving
Ain't even looking decent, seeing police niggas reaching

That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my

Fleeing the crime scene speeding
Beefing leaving behind cream, not even peeping that I was leaking
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
Still jakes are creeping, don't blow your spot, stay the weekend
Keep the Ruger peeling who's squealing few knew the dealings
Keep the steel concealed in 'cause we got no time for feelings
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro
They boost his ego found him broke down, reduced to zero
Cops fill reports hoping I'll reveal my source, source

That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my soul

Five cherry-faced faggots tried to cash in
They keep laughing Ghost, you'll get your face bashed in
Who gave you these privileges son? Why you maxing?
And we, fiending to take those
Move slow, I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose
And I heard you keep a banging hammer, golden brass
Diamonds embroideries that was stolen that you haven't reported, G
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup
Don't make this big stick up bigger, me and the boys
I thought for a second, then chose rather than froze
Had the Gem Star in my hand yo, what the fuck?
Yo, that's when I ripped Timothy, snatched and dipped
Jumped right in back of him, had the mini axe tool, faxed him

Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope

Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

After laughter, comes tears
After laughter, comes tears",Tearz,1993

Champion gear that I rock, you get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit that lock shit down

Charged by the system, for murdering the rhythm!
Now, lo and behold, another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode

Slammin' a hype-ass verse til ya head burst
I ram shack dead in the track, and that's that

Flashback's how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw! I repeat, if I die
My seed'll be ill like me

Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shooting that ""that's that shit!"" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimey, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growing all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend, jetting the Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt the God got crazy clout
Pushing the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up
Better watch your back and duck
Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up north, now he got the law
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playing, get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put em in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot

Doing duets with Rae and A, happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of busting off shots, having to rock knots
Running up in spots and making shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hanging on my living room wall
My first joint, and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, getting my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
Cause I find myself in the place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone, and everybody's doing bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passing away, I gotta make wakes
Receiving all types of calls from upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure

Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?

Aiyyo aiyyo, come on yo yo yo I'ma shoot over here 
On that AIDS thing 
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm gonna just slide in the studio quick 
Yo, yo 
And get this done 

Verse One: Killah Priest 
When you're sexually frustrated, plus waiting for a long time 
You both had strong minds 
Combined with feelings, she seems appealing 
for each other, discreet lover, no longer keeps brothers 
Smothered under deep covers 
Erotic programs, Moet and slow jams 
Enough to make you hold hands 
And plus you a bold man 
You fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow 
And bullshit ego, of fly negro 
Whole garden sour, polluted with a dead flower 
Months later, he's layin on a respirator 
Depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving 
And start losing sight in his right eye 
In weeks he might die 

Verse Two: Raekwon 
Yeah, uh-huh 
I know this dope-fiend cat, word up, his name is Javier 
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs 
Wise guys disguised as a fly guy 
you gettin high right? Weeded up with red shit in your right eye 
Youse a menace, your brain cells finished 
Begging forgiveness, calling that up top shit syphillis 
You know what you was gettin into 
Try to guess on what I've been through 
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you 

Chorus: Raekwon 
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo 
Coming from the Wu, it's real 
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo 
Coming from my crew, it's real 

Verse Three: RZA 
My nigga Chuck, he loved to fuck 
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks 
Like Nancy, who liked the fancy tickles 
so he put popsicles on her nipples to make her sex passion 
triple quadriple, until she bust 
Overcome with passion, big ass want lust upon him 
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom 
Fuck it, he said AIDS, was government made 
to keep niggaz afraid so they won't get laid no babies be made 
And the black population will decrease within a decade 
German warfare product against the dark shade 

Chorus: 
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo 
Coming from my crew, it's real 
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo 
Coming from the Wu, it's real 

Verse Four: Master Killer, Inspector Deck 
Caught by the gravitation earth rotation 
Six in the sex is deep, when you can't see clear 
through the sheer brassiere, toke back 
Smoking a spliff, sippin cognac, God 
you know my two love songs, Bobby Womack tracks 
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back 

Yo, as she lay, she wore a silk gray neglige 
Alehze pours, the radio play, Marvin Gaye 
What's Going On? As she screams Sexual Healing 
Couldn't fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling 
Hittin all positions dipped in for quick love 
She's professional she does this shit in strip clubs 
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Now misery is the Syndrome 

Outro: Raekwon and others 
Oh shit, God that's wild 
Damn, that's some cherry flavor shit going on though kid 
For real, knowhatI'msayin?

",America,1996
Wu-Tang Clan,"Shaolin shadowboxing, and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true,
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

Ghostface, catch the blast of a hype verse
My glock bursts, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Ya head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'
However, I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick damage ya whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous, cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas

I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore
Hittin' sound, watch me act bugged, and tear it down
A literate type asshole, songs goin' gold, no doubt
And you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that
Carryin' gats but yo, my Clan
Rollin like forty Macs
Now ya act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo sew, represent
I wait for one to act up
Now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what?
And that's one in the chamber
Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin'
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Segal, Out For Justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot ya knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on ya ass like your dad, bring it on

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp!
A mud hole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through ya back swish
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin' prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You want to bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' gain, I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin'
Roulette, slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin' ruckus

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

So bring it on
So bring it on
So bring it on
So bring it on
So bring it on
So bring it on
So bring it on

Wu-Tang Clan,"What y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?
I'm the Osirus of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
It's like this ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back, what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what?  Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar court by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission hold the
Fuck up, Allah fasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, Black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese
Is that so?  Caesar needs the greens
It's Earth, ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Hey yo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul off
Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While, my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see ya, the number one traffic
Sit down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex, the white-gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God, substantiala

Skip the introduction
Proceed the lip function

Splatter your melons like some Attica felons
Use a firearm good
Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm
Yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the phantasm
Verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
Exotic wine, holding nine, Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now, limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down you crown renowned kings

There's no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical
Stack like Genovese, the four devil tempt mad men
But not these
We profound hardcore sound
To MC's thumbs down, prepare
Killa bees it be warfare, this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here
Hold the square
If we go there we go gritty
And spread fear through this rap city, call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stares
The smell of fear makes my nostrils flair
Truth or dare
Ask yourself can you compare
To these niggas in the hood, Johnny B. Goode
Or he be gone yeah

Can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang hovers one thousand notches above MC level
Yo, I stay high as like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose pedals
Arresting and holding, penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MC's only lasted one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style
Your weak proposal
Aim the official, initial is Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
All that other bullshit ain't permissable
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang manual
Handles to keep this hip-hop shit tangible
Illegible, every egg ain't edible
My tracks remain Unforgettable
Like Ol' Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Throw chairs to deck a skyscraper
Understand that the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black man from the enslaved labor, Wu-Tang

The weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
Victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That can't be contained, Wu-Tang

Einstein birthed a hit, now nurture it

Purify, cleanse, ran into some beef up in the men's
Fix your sawed off

All you saw was white meat
Skin hanging off

Some call it six up
The Betty Crocker, Marvel cake stakes admissor
Wax janitor, black Jack Mulligan from Canada
Slam dance, tarantula style, you'se a fan of the
Monopoly king, Slavic poetry
Carnegie Hall's off the hook

Complete silence, what surround us
What's the finest, wrapped in cold sheets
Vanilla apple heat, flutes play jazz music, puffy pillow suites
Breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats
Sunset level, suprise sunrise, sail
Lay on the couch, while I clip your toenails
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells
Soft spoken gospel, Barry White acapell
Violin, good medicine, sound swell
Sunshine life, love right without the hell
Taste sugar, quiet storm, seasick
Slowdance drink, like nights over Egypt
Having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling
Company, ice cream licking now we holding
Gentle force, warm tingle of the golden
Open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly
Alcohol, palm trees, peanut butter jelly
Almond twirl, fantastic melodies
Soon, taste these spoons
Wiping me with toon, fly wine, quiet storm
Now it's high noon, raspberry spices
Cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best
Sounds of the shore, every winter is a war
Paradise life, recipe now pour
Musicness, model, gentle mental
Wash away your sorrow, Fantasy Island
Put the message in the bottle
Carry you through, the threshold, do my duty
Happy ending, go to rest Sleeping Beauty

Yo, this is that body shop shit
Love love slam
Edible underwear, champagne, bubble bath
Have your snack on that ass like that
Know what I mean?
Massaging these melodies
Put that gangsta shit on the shelf
Blow winds, blow, through your hair
Sea breeze sticks and shit

Wu-Tang Clan,"The world is shifty, we living just enough for the city
The rough witty Killa Bee sting just like the jiggy
My Family Stone, foes attempt to gradually clone
Labelled MIA and I send the casualties home
In closed coffins, Wu storming like the light brigade
Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon inside the cyber age
Crime pays, the law's long arm be tryna strong arm
Walking time-bombs who thrive on firearms
The charm smoker, I hit the dread with a poster
We told 'em to show him love and exposed the black toaster
Composer was shook, I took your bad looks for joke
Get your back broke, deep throat this Murder, I Wrote
The antidote be seeking like a buried treasure
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector
Wanted Dead or Alive, Rebel I escapes
Across the desert sand, leaving no footprints to trace
Keep a war face, your place conceal the baby knives
On the North breaks, I still shine in shady times

We living just enough (living just enough)
Just enough for the city (for the city)
Just enough for the city

In the jungle, I make moves like Iron Monkey
Plots to bump me off, D.O.C. be on the hunt for me
We stay hungry for money drugs and guns
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs
Know the science be my guidance
The facts tell, gats sell like sex and violence
And break the project silence, a vision
This is way beyond four corners, escape this mental prison
Before we're all goners, now embrace the world
Before the World War explosive bomber, visionary soldier karma
My code of honor, mind still scarred from the drama
Trauma sent to victim, witness them run, scream in horror
Military chopper come gun down the slum
The outcome do or die son, it's bound to come
Mentally aware I see truth within the square
The future's here catch me on computer software
Warfare's inevitable, Rebel I hold several government official
Issue .38 specials, that step through
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle
I may die in the scuffle but I'm taking 40 devils

We livin just enough
Just enough
Just enough

Stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded

A nickel-plated bammer, spit forty-five caliber grammar

Pass me the black velvet embassy suite killin me

From California to courts, it's over God so, taste the soul food

Microphone post tone like a rotary phone
Ancient poems and poetry, old sloans
Explosive head bullets, black hooded
Timberland footed ninjas, who full metal jacket clips
And know how to put it in you
Surrender your goods and your merchandise
For no purchase price, I'm certainly a heist
For your ice and curtains and vice
Come quietly, Wu-Tang Clan rules society
Because of variety, so maintain your high anxiety
And lead them to defy me, diary, ya Irie?
I need 18 points for my next joint, this high annointed king

Steve Rifkind must have been sniffin'
To catch somethin so dope, it left Monica Lynch pussy drippin'

And built with thousands of scholars

Legal kid brown in Nicaragua
Gave birth to MC's, thieves and bank robbers
We drove expensive whips and took worldwide trips
And my dick's been sucked by the finest lips
Fancy delicatessens, and the world's best refreshment
But none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons
Or my queen and my seeds, in the home that I rest in
Enter my zone get blown to 99 sections

Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
And spray, an array of shots

Wu-Tang Clan,"So get your egg crashed, by my Hellz Wind Staff
While the feature broadcast is splashed to tell the news
Like Katie Chung, how the bullet collapsed his lung
His father watched the horror as he swallowed his tongue
Another youth dead, before the age of twenty-one
Left his son to grow, in the ghettoes of the slums
With a shot that go, for twisted metal for cash flow
React slow nigga and get, P.L.O
By the lone gunner, who took revenge for his brother
Who got slain last summer by a cocaine runner
A new year is dawning, new crews is forming
Rival gangs warring blood steadily pouring
The streets are deep Son every day is like a rerun
So I reach out and try to teach one
But eighty-five percent uncivilized content
No tolerance so a lifetime is spent
Behind a cage bent smoked out on a park bench
Killer instinct slave rap niggas get lynched

So yo break that nigga arm fast as a fuck
Tell Ra, Goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
To all you slow footed penguins, duckin from these
Hot rocks that's flamin, chocolate for all you rap Damian's
Spraying cards ex-pionage, dodgeball square hard
Strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
And a mink in, next album ""Blood on Chef Apron""
Keep a Gambino PlayStation in your playpen
Discovery Channel, cats the Book of Daniel
Coke blunts hot as a FUCK swatted bamboo
High school dropouts, baseheads get knocked the fuck out
On the regular for robbin a good nigga house
Rough cut raw doses, the unexplainable
Hot rock lava, gringo throw the Frusen Gladjé

Ha ha ha ha, yo
What you know about this, specialist armed dangerous
Hit you close range with this madness
Unique design shine like a deep dish
The beat kick technique split all your weak shit
Yes, the rhythm, the Rebel
Alone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal
Living legend, veteran known to set trend
Lethal weapon, step through your section
With the Force like Luke Skywalker
Rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
Live performer, bit the mic sayanora
Borderline to insane, I rain firewater
Tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
I got my sword cross your throat you joke

We on the run with the golden guns, get you none
When it reach out and teach someone, blaze they buns
Now I'm guilty by association
Times of blackness eclipsin the sun, target practice
Commence when I throw these darts at these rappers
Ricochet, hit the charts, bloody your matress
Hold me down, Wu bloodkin, I'm goin in
Shootin bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction
Blend like chameleon
All these niggas want cheese, is we mice or men, word up
We can go platinum but then, still can't get no satisfaction
Once again, back on the block crumb snatchin
Blowin backs in cold
Blunted non-assassin, time for action, Johnny Unitas
Handle that like arthritis
Still, hold a golden touch like King Midas

Drownin problems in Heinekens imported from Holland
Gettin boosted off of killer bee pollen
Stone columns get trapped by drum tracks mac loud as gun claps
Pin a crab nigga to death of a thousand thumbtacks
The Wu Sensai fold, it bees the Wind Ninja scroll
Soul edged blade controls your Interpol
The fig newt', fruit from the forbidden tree root
I stay secluded in the Chamber trainin new recruits
With Fatal Guillotine, the black hooded team what it means
When bullets scream from the hot Glock like rock from a sling
(""Sometimes..."") Pushed through like George Bush Operation Whoops
Shots get popped on the block cause them blood to gush
From digital to analog, the Wu-Wear camoflogue
The entourage squad we stompin through Zanzibar
Like herds of cattle, RZA plays the wall like a shadow
Connectin Brooklyn/Shaol like the Verrazanno-Narrows

Stash the cream though, Iceatollah ice style gleama
Lex graffiti name Ramo, hold em we rollin
Askin me though, raps is hotter than, hot tamales in Toledo
Pussy that shit she passin off to me though
We wax Ajax niggas with a axe, Maxamill
You could crash a meal, got you back steel
Scold em and fold em like the thousand dollar bills
Sit back eyein y'all niggas out
Fakes that delegate we spittin fire out
Verb burgular, design the Wally shoe store reserve
A jet status, Guyanese bird up on my mattress
Watch me mack this, Ralph Lauren goose inside a fashion
Yo, these hands is flooded and they mad quick
Strong approach like magnets, custom wood crane name
Stylin rich, RZA made the waves in one chain
Feelin mics like, wheelin a bike, slide like
Step on his Klondike, get your dart right
We movin on it like, wind breaker niggas get they face broke

Wu-Tang Clan,"Yo fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate, living irrelevant
The most benevolent king, communication through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted, Allah's heard and seen
Everywhere, throughout your surrounding atmosphere
Troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth, crystal clear
Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenements
Eighty-Five percent tenants depended welfare recipients
Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through, third eye as bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes, robotic probes
Taking telescope pictures of globe, babies getting pierced with microchips
Stuffed inside their earlobes, then examinated
Blood contaminated, vaccinated, lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization, Food and Drug Administration
Testing poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the inauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan, so I come to slay men
Like Bartholomew, cause every particle is physical article
Was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A spaceknight like Rom, consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron

United Nations, gun bias style patient
Formulating rap plural acapella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon, military bomb fest
We want sanitary food, planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati hit
Dreams is free and escape is sleep
For a fool peep jewels, keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
The sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate
The whole Babylon, times up, move on
Kings on your pawn, checkmate, no fakes
Supposed through the gate, case closed
Things get froze, when it comes time, chosen ones
Will holding guns, we take flight with no fright
And attack, never fear cause our words is clear
What's been done can't be undone Son, we can't care
Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown, by the righteous ones
Divine minds bind, we unified as one
Half of black folk, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlasting essence stay flying over Egypt

For you to defeat, the Gods
Impossible, you can never defeat
The gods
Impossible
For you to defeat, the Gods

Call an ambulance, Jamie been shot, word to Kimmy
Don't go son, nigga you my motherfucking heart
Stay still son, don't move, just think about Keeba
She'll be three in January, your young God needs ya
The ambulance is taking too long
Everybody get the fuck back, excuse me bitch, gimme your jack
One, seven one eight, nine one one, low battery, damn
Blood comin out his mouth, he bleedin badly
Nah Jamie, don't start that shit
Keep your head up, if you escape hell we gettin fucked up
When we was eight, we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks
In Sixty-Nine, his father and mines, they robbed banks
He pointed to the charm on his neck
With his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
I opened it, seen the God holdin his kids
Photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one, oh shit, here come his Old Earth
With no shoes on, screamin holdin her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
Rubbed his hair, turned around the ambulance was there
Plus the blue coats, Officer Lough, took it as a joke
Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin', Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car, Dirty Tasha are tellin
But suddenly a chill came through it was weird
Felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
Laid on the stretcher, blood on his Wally's like ketchup
Deep like the full assassination with a sketch of it
It can't be, from Yoo-hoo to Lee's
Second grade humped the teachers, about to leave
Finally this closed chapter, comes to an end
He was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at twelve ten

Now what my man is trying to tell y'all
Is that across the whole globe
The murder rates is increasin, and we decreasing
So at the same time, when you play with guns
When you play with guns, son
That causes the conflict of you going against your own

Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin' off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin' your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
Rhymin' while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparallel advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

Bitch ass niggaz counterfeit the funk
I smoke the feet of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk, Ya head, get shrunk
The touch of skunk, I be fuckin' bitches by the chunk
My name black, do words wanna play in my dirt?
Bitch stop my momma serve, free lunch from the church
I come like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus, makin' the fuss, I gots tough love
Unglove the news, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze
I don't walk, I get carried
Gold and platinum frisbee's on my wall, lookin' properly

Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuing to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, Glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and who's liable
For this harrowing experience
You scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
And proceeds of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery

And why would I bring you such physical harm?

Yo, mind arson, my squadren, surround the Sound-Garden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I, Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave, past the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a hairful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make you feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state

Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent Range whippin' soul controller of the lynch
Mackin phone rings, Stephen King trauma down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut jewels, wore no color shoe, knife annual
Moses lost his sandal, hidin the manual
Blow the vandal buggin off of Bon Jovi hits
Grammer lo-ve, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seize posin in Oshkosh, guzzle cries
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat, cause every word is choppy
My logic crunch all crows to death, Kobiyashi couldn't stop me

Wu-Tang Clan,"Knew this bitch named Traj, she had a hella fine ashcan ass
Blew my hole in the past
Niggarette gave me gonorrhea
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina
Boy you shoulda seen her
She had a Babyface creamer Purina's
Called up talkin' Tina
I put my dick in her womb
She blew my head like a balloon
I had her walkin' on the moon

Yo, I seen you at the five and dime wastin' your time
Oh you shine, I'm lookin' at your ass from behind
You walked by smellin' like watermelon
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swellin'
My nuts start yellin', excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick
My medicine is can I walk with you, fantasy
After that we can cheat
Laid on the bed, handcuffed with hard meat
Long stroke smack it, smack it then broke
Nothin' can't stop my continuous poke
Compound porno flick music
Daddy came with it when I wrote it

Dirt Dog be bouncin' on bitches like frog
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch
I'm up my jacuzzi, peepin' this smoothie
My bitch is a floozy, Dirt Dog ain't choosy
Pussy move me, pretty black dick up in the booty
I like it muddy or swampy
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky
Don't got no fuckin' room me and my momma and my TV
Blackberry squeeze, bitch who a tease
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese
Now to blow fifty G's overseas
I'm doin' the breeze, in my 850

Suicidal
She been in more hotels than bibles
Idle worshippin' bitch wasn't the type to make bridle
Sprung, on how the bitch maneuvered her tongue
From the top of his dick, to the bottom of his ass split
I told the God to jet quick this wicked bitch was a harlot
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web
She wasn't choosy fucked for a movie and a loose leaf
Cigarette, pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons
Big ass in tight denim
Had the most faithful niggas sendin' her gifts to women and enjoyed
To watch relationships get destroyed
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void and shameless
Her attitude was blameless
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list
Her obsession, caused niggas to get, the ass cheek injection
The bitched lied, said she had urinary tract infection
I tried to warn em, and bomb em, but she conned em
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom

You people are all trying to achieve the impossible

And eventually we shall succeed)",Maria,1997
Wu-Tang Clan,"These things just took over me
Just took over my whole body
So I can't even see no more
I'm calling my black woman a bitch
I'm calling my peoples all kinds of thing that they not
I'm lost brother, can you help me
Can you help me brother, please

You see what we did, we lost the love
I'm talking bout the love
The love of your own

But brother, but brother, but brother, check this out
I still don't understand man, I'm all high off this shit man

Well, what I'm trying to say my brother
Why, why do we kill each other
Look at our children, what kind of a future

This is the training that's gonna be given to you by the Wu, brothers and sisters

The revolution, the revolution will be televised, televised

It's time to rise, and take our place so we can inherit the universe
The planet Earth belongs to God

This is nineteen ninety-seven

Every square inch of it
That he chose for himself
Is the best part
Behind every strong woman you'll find a strong man
And behind every strong man you'll find a strong woman
The universe is not completed without the sun, moon and stars
That's man, woman and child
To all you fake-ass niggas who think you gonna survive out here
Without your Black woman, you're wrong
They have attraction powers on the planet
We are original man, the Asiatic Black man
The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization and daughter of the universe
The population was seventeen million
With the two million Indians
Making a total of nineteen million, four billion, four hundred million
All over the planet earth
Arise you Gods, it's the time for the revolutional war
That's the mental war
That's the battle between God and devil
Take the devil off your plane
Take him off your mental mentality
Take him off your brain
Leave all the cigarettes and guns, the alcohol and everything
That's the mental devil that exists within your body
That's destroying and decaying your mind
The mind controls the body
Everything within must come out
Don't look towards the sky cause there's no heaven above
Don't look down beneath your feet, there's no hell below
But heaven and hell exist within
Heaven is what you make it and hell is what you go through

There is only one God
There is a whole new one, faith
There is a only one
One revolution yeah

At one time it was told to me
That man came from monkeys
That we were swinging from trees
I hardly can believe that unless I'm dumb, deaf and blind
You ever heard about, the ape man and the ape woman
You have a mankind, that has a beginning to him
And his ending, is about to come

If you take one step, I will take one with you
Through the storm and pain, swim the deepest sea, with you my brother
I know you got to be strong, gotta hold on

Now the story is about to close
It was a hundred percent of us
That came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our people was uncivilized
Poison animal eaters
They're slaves of the mental powers
They don't know who the true and living God is
Nor their origins in the world
So they worship what they know not
And they're easily lead in the wrong direction
Ought to be lead in the right
And now you got the ten percent who are rich slave makers of the poor
Who teach the poor lies that make the people believe
That the all mighty true and living God is a spook in the sky
And you can't see him with the physical eyes
They're also known as blood suckers of the poor
And then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous teachers
Who do not believe in the teachings of the ten percent
Who is all wise and know who the true and living god is
And teach that the true and living god is a supreme being black man from Asia
Otherwise known as civilized people
Also Muslims, and Muslim's sons
Peace we out

I have given it much thought
It seems, disaster must come
At best, only postponed
Shaolin Kung-Fu
To survive must now be taught, to more young men
We must expand, get more pupils
So that the knowledge will spread",Wu-Revolution,1997

Only way, I begin to G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rollin' with this one
And that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolas at sixteen
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is ruff and tuff like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out

A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin' going upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base
Smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild smokin' sess drinkin' beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected, for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted

Never doubt the life
Yo
Who the fuck are you to criticize me
Yo, I slap, yo, I slap dick ta' ya' wifey
Yo, respect, that's my word

Another Wu tradition, Street vision, listen
All my life I've been poverty stricken
Always took what's mines, never was given
A second chance just to rap sheet a bad decision
You can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin'
Quick to stick the clip in, blow you out position
Street jurisdictions, nigga, no restriction
Concrete composition for emcee's in submission
Special edition crash course mission
Push through like the task force and crush all competition
See you from a distance, dry snitchin', whisperin'
Greet your man posted up like two little bitches
When you get the heart, step live or catch stitches
Or find yourself with Del, sleepin' with the fishes
I got no love for fans that's fake ass niggas
I can't stand the bid when it's all in my business
Wu-Tang Forever and a day, don't get it twisted
I get lifted, I just shoot somethin' from hot biscuit
These street kids, we can't lost, we terrorize you district
Leave no finger prints and no survivin' witness

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide
Street Life, Homicide, nowhere to run to

[Chorus:]
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O.
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!

Yo, thoughts sharper than a Japanese kitana
Ninja coma, piranhas crack teeth on my armor
Scandalous, I ran contra-bomber, stalker like rebels of Rwanda
Death before dishonor, snake charmer, persona of one who makes drama
Godfather 4 type saga, tuckin' a revolver in my parker
Bombin' unprepared for departure, might talk but strike harder
Fear the bow of the silent archer
Sure shotter, pass the rock to your starter
Poison darter, news photographers document the horror
While I bounce Shaunda with Tiwana and I from blue Honda
Honorable scholar, rockwilder, rip mic's for top dollar
Your highness, the crowd holla
Got your head rock, feel the brain trauma
Crowd sponsor, hotter than Bahama steam saunas
The Rebel of opera, popped off the chocolate and the gosha
Monster truck crush you impostors

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide
I.N.S., Homicide, nowhere to run to

[Chorus]

I'm the four mic emcee with five mic potential
Overlooked cuz y'all can't understand what I been thru
You ain't got to love me, or even pretend to
Actin' like the street, they ain't got no street credentials
Crack villains, raps be killin' instrumentals
The caps pealin' and slap a feelin' out ya dental
Underground, sound, for ghetto residentials
Up shits creek lookin' for some more shit to get into
Got the clan jewels as I continue
To serve you everythin' on that's on the menu
With chef John Jacob, remember sons Of man told you wake up
My nigga smell the coffee, I'm too hardcore to kill softly
Come to free the mind and get the bullshit up off me
The jedi, only use the force if ya force me
Shaolin what 
Don't get it fucked up and cross me
Rappers gettin' stuck for actin' stuck up and flossy
Say it ain't so! Bust the callico
Rap from the island called Stat', here we go

Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide
Method Man, Homicide, nowhere to run to

Wu-Tang Clan,"I smoke on the mic like smokin' Joe Frazier
The hell-raiser, raising hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh, tick tock keep ticking
While I get you flipping off the shit I'm kicking
The Lone Ranger, code red: danger!
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're saying Goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax won't smile
Rae got it going on pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'mma get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip, and
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got
Going to war with the melting pot, hot

It's the Method Man, for short ""Mr. Meth""
Moving on your left
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a Gat
I wanna break, fool, cock me back
Small change, they putting shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame, my style will live forever
Niggas crossing over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a ""soo""
Enough respect due to the one-six-ooh
I mean ohh, yo check out the flow
Like the Hudson, or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt makes me eughck

Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with the ""soo!""

C'mon baby baby c'mon baby baby c'mon baby baby c'mon

Yo, you best protect ya neck!

First things first, man, you're fucking with the worst
I'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit packed: jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking
Ason Unique rolling with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rolling with a stash
Ain't saying cash, bite my style I'll bite your motherfucking ass!

For crying out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejecting styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love Gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fucking with pros and there it goes

Yo chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buck us style
The ruckus, 10 times 10 men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one down, G-g-genius
Take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's getting stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meaning of ""dope""
When he's looking for a ""suit-and-tie rap""
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
Bam! Aw, man! I, slam, jam, now scream like Tarzan
I be tossing and flossing my style is awesome
I'm causing more Family Feuds than Richard Dawson
And the survey said, you're dead
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fucking head
MZA who was that? Ayo, the Wu is back
Making niggas go Bo! Bo! like I'm Super Cat
Me fear no-one, oh no, here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to the eardrum

Put the needle to the groove I gets rude and I'm forced
To fuck it up, my style carries like a pick-up truck
Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shining sea
I slam tracks like quarterback sacks from L.T
Now why try and test, the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
And eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state

And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus

Straight from the motherfucking slums that's busted

Hah! Step up, boy!
Represent! Chop his head off, kid!

The Meth will come out tomorrow
Styles, conditions, bizarre, bizarro
Flow, with more afro than Rollo
Coming to a fork in the road which way to go just follow
Meth is the legend, niggas is sleepy hollow
In fact I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt for dolo, Bogart coming on through
Niggas is like ""Oh, my God, not you!""
Yes, I, come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my flavor, coming from the RZA
Which is short for the razor who make me reminisce true
Like Deja, Vu! I'm rubber, niggas is like glue
Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you

Avenging eagle crooks, rock the ""W"" and ""Spiegel"" books

Staten Island's bayside of teachers of Elijah
Thrown out the temple, non-calodic wit the father

My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in

Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryna get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime

Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowing without any knowing

For those that murdered me shall stand before God
To fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

Feds jumping out their jeeps, I can't go to sleep
Babies with flies on they cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep

Stop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot
Drove past y'all niggas again, you took a cheap shot

They shot Malcolm in the chest, front of his little seeds
Jesse watched as they shot King on the balcony
Exported Marcus Garvey cause he tried to spark us
With the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers
Oh Jacqueline you heard the rifle shots crackling
Her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in
America's watching, blood-stained ink blotches
Medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
What's the science? Somebody? This is trick knowledge
They try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
Walking through Park Hill, drunk as a fuck
Looking around like these Devils
I'm ready to break this world down
They got me trapped up in a metal gate
Just stressed out with hate
And just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate
What should I do, grab a blunt or a brew
Grab a .22 and run out there and put this fucking violence in you

Eighteens with the whip, smoke gray
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh, smokin' all the way
Hahaha
With my all-star team, bitches see our shine
Yo son we gotta make that cream whether raps or Nixon times

They call me Rollie, watch me polly with the wide body Dinali
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey
I swarm like paparazzi, she popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block
Sippin' on Lime Bacardi got me toxy
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape like the Roxy
Ever property, Monopoly, big shotti
Snatch the cream, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giulianni
Like I'm still coppin' big eights from papi
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me

I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky
Kamikaze, might karate chop ya head like a naughty
Dread then call myself Collar Ratsi
Professionally trained, I am for your artery
I give the autographs but charge for photography
Not hardly kid, you awkward God body
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wallys
Spark the broccoli, spaz off this ghetto opery
Or catch the hot seat, you're bawty boy without ya posse

Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons

Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons

Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons

They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?
While the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart
Brought to a halt from a front full assault
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
The audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
It was layin' in the zip drive from chest five

Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons

Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons

Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons

Come, come, come

Light is shinin' beauty sunshine
Here comes one-time the ball was so fine
Heat is blazin' the kids were playin'
His partner was shady tryin' to slave the babies

Hey yo they didn't know the cop was crooked, he had blow out in
Brooklyn
All this while he let the fiends cook it
The base heads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin'
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens
Even though her leg was bitten
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins
Paleface cop who done popped the desk
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block
Some niggaz know him as the Godson of Gotti
And his black partner, he was scared to speak
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin' his beat
They call him desk duty, Robocop
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the
Block

[Chorus]

Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor
His partner turned red in his waist, Mase done smacked her
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her
Heard she was dusted, musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid
Wavin' her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks
He grabbed her by the air, she broke his jaw it cracked
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five
Wildest niggas just smilin' cause it look live
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me ?
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid

[Chorus]

You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin'
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about
Livin' in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store
The bum holdin' the door, the mugging no one saw
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position
Transformation from critical to, stable condition
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical
Watchin' you like salt-water sharks that's tropical
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin' or a wet up
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts
And for some, another way out, is music and sports
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock

Two On Da Road on this, 12 O’Clock
I love my brother to death that old hip-hop
Catch this! Hot Nix’
You know? Big tits

I love my brother to death, nigga pussy to the rest
Shared a pair of Guess and an Eddie Bauer vest
A bitch named Celeste
I met her when I was goin to cash a Def Jam check
She had some big ass breasts
I had to catch her like a shortstop on the Mets
A nigga high off a dime from Gates and Best
Remember grandmother live on Louis and Lex
I remember Dirt Dog crashed his white Lex
I remember me and Meth won a dice game against Ghost and Deck
Remember Portland had Clyde Drex’
Remember 12 O’Clock is a vet
Big Dogs we put 'em to sleep, keep 'em on a leash
I move like days in a week
Niggas don't know the face and names on my teeth
Niggas carry a chrome piece, and separate the heat
Ain't scared of the motherfuckin' police

Guns jammed up, I'm cramed up in my lab
Six niggas, six bitches, two fifths and eight bags
One toilet, three weedheads, an alcoholic
And two niggas hooked on pussy
And in the corner, was this brother who would study his lessons
And learned how operate the Smith and the Wesson
Still cut class and played hookey
Threw freshmens in garbage cans, gave 'em nookies
Rolled the, back of the bus with a gun in his socks
Big forehead, had ears like Spock
He was mightier than a truckload of gats
And bound to make a bitch cum in six minutes flat

What up kid? Stay winnin', seen you look good
You look live in ya linen and you survived ninth innin'
The hood got us off the prop without women
All my niggas that ride that provide to the end of this

Ain't nothin' but the real
Ain't nothin' but the real
Ain't nothin' but the real
Million dollar deals
Rollin' on Chrome Wheels
Ain't nothin but the real

We gamble the dice
Remain humble, scramble through the jungle of life
While the we rumble with the foul and trife
Shots fired on the block in threes like Glen Rice
Made men think twice about the sacrifice
Black on white, write it for the world to hear
Write it for my fam who not here who do care
Glance and stare, why when you can't compare?
From the bottom of my feet to the end of my hair
Move rear, cop the blue steel bare, groove to the snare
Bass and drums, see my face in the slums
Pedia Brown, media surround my sound
When you see me in the hood of ya town, respect my sound
Sample with black, criminal, chemical rap
Assemblin hat, laced in a suit from Phat
Two On Da Road, got them bitches screamin', ”Who Dat?”
Two with the plaques, two with the gats, it's like that

Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block

It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me

I give the autographs but charge for photography

Spark the broccoli, spas off this ghetto opery
Or catch the hot seat, you're bawty boy without ya posse

Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons

They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?
While the stage catch shells from forceful gun play
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart
Brought to a halt from a front full assault
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
The audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
It was layin' in the sip drive from chest five

Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie
And keep dough on the flip, a hoe on the strip
And roll dick throw on the flip
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun, understood?
Far from ya Hollywood
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the hood

What made you fuck it, yo son these niggas gotta owe

We paintin' pictures if it's ? I seen a lot of those

Known to blast, paramedics couldn't close the gash
Floatin' past in an alley with the oak dash
Show the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair
They goin' mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads
Crabs want to play me close and grab
Can't believe you on the canvas, I'm just throwin' jabs
Where the powers you supposed to have, hand in your soldier rag
You posin' bad, show your ass son, you won't last
With heavy weights that elevate the whole mass

Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin niggaz want to eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin wider circles of destructions
So we attack, with the pen and blaze in
From the terrifyin to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
They heavily defended airfields
But they bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
Oh that water was my liquid of choice
Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet

Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

Hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
Week self-captivity became months
Those who were holdin' it down they hold a pump

Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin' niggaz want to eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin' wider circles of destructions

So we attack, with the pen and blaze in
From the terrifyin' to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits

They heavily defended airfields
But they bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
Oh that water was my liquid of choice

Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
Powerful projection, noise is deafening
Carrier battle groups, that's threatening
Higher level bombing, plus

The shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
In the same crucial manner but different style

Better wipe your feet before you step me, or it's yourz!

Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin'
Yo, spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo, yo, pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit yo

It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get Jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gun play I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise

[Chorus]
I got my Uzi back, you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my Uzi back, you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back

Take it back to the ? leanin' gettin rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin' joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin' me now respect get your fingers off the glass

[Chorus]

Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin' for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin' yo, big fat nigga bleedin'
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought Fubu
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

[Chorus]

Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin'? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crabs test, can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin', feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

Started smokin' woolas at sixteen
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is ruff and tuff like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out

Smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth

To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain

To kick the truth to the young black youth

In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe

On some loud howl shit, to insert a fiend
But it was yo ock, the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes they get hurt

Shit's played, like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt

With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think

I drop megaton BOMBS more faster than you blink
'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Through clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance is if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in da front want it

Struck a match to the underground industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the earth
Wicked niggaz come try to burglarize the turf
Scattin' off soft-ass beats them niggaz rap happily
Tragically, that style, deteroiate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions to best known competitions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition

Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual
Demonstrate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall formed the mural
Took a look shot the manifestation of it was plural
Rhymin' while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparallel advantage
With all D P that's impossible to manage

Bitch ass niggaz counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead and the skunk tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk you get shrunk
The touch of skunk I be fuckin' bitches by the chunk
My name black do words wanna play in my dirt?
Bitch stop my momma serve free lunch from the church
I come like a thousand doves
Bitch she's crazy at the bus makin' the fun I gots tough love

Unglove the news watch a niggaz transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse heavy at the booze
I don't walk I get carried
Gold and platinum frisbees on my wall lookin' properly

Talk strange like Bjork great hero Jim Thorpe
How can I put it? It's like my video footage
Hard to edit my niggaz that never understood it

I'm too impulsive my dosage it's hard for you nigga to notice
I come through your postage
I don't play the rap souflee for the day

Shooting that ""that's that shit!"" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimey, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me

Pushing the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up
Better watch your back and duck
Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up north, now he got the law
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playing, get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put em in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot

Doing duets with Rae and A, happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of busting off shots, having to rock knots
Running up in spots and making shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hanging on my living room wall
My first joint, and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, getting my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
Cause I find myself in the place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone, and everybody's doing bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passing away, I gotta make wakes
Receiving all types of calls from upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure
Settling for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way to

From metaphorical parables to fertilize the earth

Scattin off soft-ass beats, them niggaz rap happily
Tragically, that style, de-ter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where i come from, gettin visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural

You're jealous over me because you're not a competitor

All negative on the mic, i dislike
Try to rock the mic but only will reduce
Try to get loose, you juice as a youth
Not knowin to yourself that you shall be frozen
I'm the mc warrior, who has been chosen
To rock and shock beats, polite when i recite
Sulfur mc's, you are down right, out right
Try to be talkative, there's no alternative
Hide until i forgive, this motive

I maintain the paradise on this earth

Like a skeleton, growin back ya skin?
When i was young, i was taught how to produce
The science of babies gettin loose
I turned white boys to springsteen spruce
Black to spooks, gave the chinese bruce
I can't help it if my style is foggy, monster boogie
Get ya high on my patio, all come to see me movie

I want you to listen carefully
Kindness and faith, are the foundation
Without them, we can't become good people
And with justice, we know we can lead a good life
And how can I be a good man then, eh?
Well, first of all, you have to practice honesty
Uhmm...
Keep your temper, never lose control of yourself
Keep control...
Be patient, if you learn to do these things, you can master anything

We gotta get more cake together, so we could branch out
Preserve land, get a boat and a ranch house
Call me a dreamer, but I hustle for real
You thought that I fell off but now I'm attacking the field
All in Chicago, grinding, putting it down
Crush blocks of MC's, I ain't playing around
Yo, you heard me on The Bassment, giving it to 'em
Fake dudes hiding they self, but I could see through 'em
Diggler, what? I'm trying to live and raise kids
While you throwing up ya sign, I'm laying 'em down, kid
Plus, I'm back home now, doing my thing
Thirty dollars to Medina just to cop me a ring

Back when little J got shot, pops was whooping 'em
Little noses dripping with snot, ock, now look at 'em
The ghetto got a hook in 'em now, drugs, stay pushing 'em
Used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em
Used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em
Get cash, get that ass, or put a foot in 'em

A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up
The flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather
Yet heavier than weight, when my mind state starts to break, take cover

Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight wilding
Robbing everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms, who fuck niggas, got four babies
Yvette jabber her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her

My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark
In the aisle, busting them paper towels and wiping my Wally's down

I stood up to face a barrel, he's holding a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
That bitch is crazy and uh, she brought her baby
She knew I hard the murders, a smack, it killed her man though
Now I got his fucking nephew gripping his gat, you'se a bitch...
You better kill me... you know you're booty...
You pulled your toolie out on me... motherfucker!
First thought was to snatch the ratchet, said fuck it and fucking grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fucking laughing
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint so I fucking bit him
Shots was whizzing, hitting Clorox bottles
Customers screaming, then the faggot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about

Shame on a nigga, I heard the reapa' done came to get'cha.

You was the chess piece on the board that made us look true.

You da pearl in the ocean, I'm up on the land pissed.
Now you movin' more prestigious. Me? Hittin' the streets,

It was hard for me to believe that my brother retired.
Suddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinnin',
How can he walk off the field durin' the first innin'?
I cried like a baby on the way to his pace of death,
Hate not bein' there the minutes before he left.
Now I'm in the booth 10 feet from where he lay dead,
I think about him on this song and what he might have said.

When I first heard the word I needed air to clear my head.
I know you didn't say what I thought you said, my brother's dead, you crazy.
Another dirty prank to get the family cranked up, niggas shouldn't play like that.
I know how you feel god, but it's real,
And I still can't believe, and my heart still grieves the loss,

I popped a bottle on your ?? dog, tried hard not to cry.
I still can't hide the scars,
And I still ask why to God,
Alalyzin' ya form, as I stood ther beside ya moms.
And I share the blame, cuz you was callin' for help kid
Shoulda, coulda, woulda, had the time, I was selfish.
I carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me,
I really miss you Russel, hope you forgive me Dirty.

Yo. Yo, yo, yo
?? On the crash, and put my fist through.
Shout out to Dirty that the whole world missed yo.
Reach out and kissed you in your coffin, my heart races,
I drop tears and watch my nigga fall form greatness,
It's all wasted, flushed down the drain, and
Soon as the news hit me, I bust out with pain and,
Rivers I cried, my brother just dies,
Imma see you my nigga, on the other side

Ah, man, how do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die.
It's hard to live without you, God.
I said no doubt you, when you said that the passion of Christ was all about you.
From the God-mobile, to ?? to Brownsville
Florida to Ohio, to Portlan to Park Hill.
You interrupt the Grammy's, said Wu for the kids,
Took four five shots when they rushed in your crib
?? Crack ya ribs, cops shot ya whip,
You been chased by the pigs on a four year bid
Crashed cars, still came out without a scar,
They try to keep your free spirit trapped in a jar, So you'll keep your mouth shut,
And won't tell the world who's who and what's what, and prolly go nuts.

Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt
Check the total amount of MC's inflicted
With torture, from moving with work that's restricted
We criticize producers til they joints are right
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light
Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions

[RZA]
I'm the 7 in the center of the sun, I keep shinin
My inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds
That be twinklin, while my love be sprinklin
We stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinklin
ALLAH's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious
Seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless
Embraces all races, all caste and all cases
In every spec of life he's the substance of all traces

[Break]

The answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions
Of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection
Who gives you all and never ask more of you
The faithful companion that fights every war with you
Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical
He's the all and all, you searchin for the oracle
A mission impossible, purely philosophical
But you call him on your death bed when you layin in the hospital

[Break]

And as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil
Like armies of ants carrying stones of soil
Building a home for themselves and storing food
At night we praise ALLAH and adore the moon
In sync like the flow of the Nile, the growth of a child
Only fearin' GOD, we great a ghost with a smile
That which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh
Meaning life has no partnership with death

[Break]

Yo, I've been highly misunderstood by those who met us
They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce
Mentally dead, essentially lead by the false teachings
And eventually pledge their allegiance
To that which was against them and exempt them from the truth
Then juiced them and pimp them to givin them ties
So the church can rise, while their babies home hungry covered with flies
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Trying to harness the wind
ALLAH's the father from without and within
On Christ return, who will announce him?
Every tree is numbered, but who can count them?
The name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them?
ALLAH is the father of all, why do you doubt him?

The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts

Welcome to the fish fry where niggaz get burnt to a crisp
Jump out the pot, ""Yeah yo I got this""
Long armor, construction's on, I'm pro-drama
Catch me in the wildest beefs, I bring bombers
Bearded like Talibans, booted, my black ninjas
'll come through, tuxedos on with the gold llamas
Priceless like emeralds, check out the ski mask
King Tut's nephew gave it to me for three bags
Of heron, Don Baron, sniff a bag of blow
Fifth out, runnin' up in Saks with the ill army
Shake feds, play dead, yo check out what Rae said
Lay on ya hands, let the Branson break bread
High energy, all my niggaz a kin to me
Regardless how it go down I still get ten a ki
Beware of my enemies, y'all remember me
Nikes with the low goose on and I've been a beast
Wilding in my headphones, red in my stones
Good ganja out, if I die fill up my headstones
With water, dough, acid and gold classics
All my niggaz who pump, the spirit'll jump out and grab shit

Down low in the 'jects, got it locked in ya area

And the cost ain't cheap, my advice is priceless
Bring back the life that ya thought was lifeless

Behold, P.L.O. the click, man, it's over with
So quick, notice how we bang with the knuckles bare
Wu-Tang, keep it fresh like tupper ware
The Jungle, Animal House, gat in your mouth
Polly with the wild life, cannibal out
Give this five course meal in effect, reel to reel or cassette
Or with the mask on, peelin' the tech
Killah Hill, man, you feelin' my set, feelin' my rep
Annamette with the top down, wheelin' the 'Vette
Scoop me downtown, cop the brown and back to the bids
Twist a blunt in front of Jake and still mash on the strip
Face sick with the rap shit, stacking them chips
In the pits, stick shit, cats packing them grips
Bad bitch with the black six, after my dick
She like, this your pussy, and she smash my click
Not a fake, not a fraud, see my name on the wall
Niggaz straight, like an inmate, try'nna make the board
Snake waiting, dudes came for sure, I lay law
Stay raw, cause a 'massacre' with no 'chainsaw'
Half y'all talk about it, but you don't want war
See my wolves eat the bones and we still want more
We be foaming at the mouth, even, I doubt we leave without eating
So without reason, pounds are squeezing
The lifestyle of fiends and beans, big dreams and CREAM
Bitches ride like the Scream Machine
For a taste of it, the chick strip, clean out the jeans
Next thing she was smuggling coke between the seams

If real niggaz is listening, the life we living in, is wrong

But if we run the race like a thug
We would lose that mind that we made of

You kept the weapon concealed like a magician's secret dollar bill
Liable to pull a knife from out of his heal
Snatch the sword from the rock with one hand
One finger, bzzz, turn ya body to sand
You'll be hoping you'd be Spidey, to get away from this
You be hoping you be whitey when the judge get pissed
One man, can't uplift the land
Like Method Man standing on the hands of fans
See the Captain and Lieutenants, true descendant
Splendid, unprecidented, hip hop vintage
Started from the park benches, before the NARCs could snitch us
He was God Cypher Divine, trying to spark the wizzes

The quintessence, father of the hip hop renaissance
My slang been around before baton and Benetton
I've been on, fingerprint, two finger tips
So when I squeeze the rubber grip, release the clip, then leave the clip
C-Cypher Pigs can't identify it

The most complicated 'formance of life, we simplify it

Flying dagger, make 'em stagger, then I take a swagger
Ice cold Jägermeister, take a dragon hold
Bo county crook, slide like the Nike swoosh

Can't nothing harm me, yo, I move through any project
With logic, few semi's, hide in the cockpit
Scream out, Shallah and I'mma tap in, harder than Tinactin
Don't try to play the fella, I'll blacked in
Moving all miraculous, the slap smiths of the rap game
Say my name backwards, you'll get back changed
Black man, black hooded, moving through the city
Like you Batman, still you so pussy, like Catwoman
Don't bother the Legion, more squeezing, more reason
To light a new block up, cause me to cement shit
Powerful block shoppers and all niggas getting that gwop
Dare you to try to find my weak spot

I stay on the 64 squares, while patrolling the center
Trading space from material, the time zone, I enter
It's calculated by movement, from pushed pieces
Advancements and development, once the pawn reaches
To 8th ranked, now heavily armed with a tank
My opponent's base is threated, soldiers cut with shanks
Moved all my small pieces, MC's are driven back
Unable to avoid capture from the attack
Such movement, is naturally quite unsound
Men is badly placed upon dangerous grounds
Loosening their position, before they were strongly posted
Before the double rooks had approached it
They must of been quick to ignore the principles
Rock a V and an effective God is invincible
A strategic plan, just the way I envisioned it
Many fallen soldiers in complete imprisonment

Study like lessons, niggaz in the game biting the grain
You knowing where it came from, stop it
You thought we wasn't coming? You dumbing, you blunted again
Watch Lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
Can't nothing move when I rhyme, when I drop lines it's law out in Egypt
Love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
The only niggaz that'll glow'll be us

We keep it hot, keep the heat on the block
We never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
Raining with the patchwork of puzzles
That was written in the year of the dragon
More raw than you could ever imagine
How much of a great blessing to a rap city
Where the youth is organically fed, from the Witty
Unpredictable, Talent And Natural Game is lyrical
Analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
A Cuban Link Chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
RAGU nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
He gave y'all niggaz whiplash from bling bling
But my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings
Math shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it
For the lower level creatures that can't peep it
I observe MC's, regardless
From a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...

Let the track wind and ya mind flow free
Remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
Infinity, back to the source of which it came
Energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
On and on and on and, travel with me
Not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
For those who can't adapt, I lived it, shitted it back
We have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when I'll squeeze
The brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts
Fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
Enough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down
Underneath the white T lies the four pound
This is forty-five minutes of menacing
Dismantling, any MC opponent stepping in the zone
Get ya face blown (Get ya face blown)

Shooting out at the mouth without Chap or Blistec
Here's a mothafucka, I didn't flunk diaper rash
I'm verbally toxic, metal-piercing, forked, hollow point tongue
Dumb dumb, pow, shot from gattling gums
Hooked on phonics, packing a vicious vocabulary
Malicious, with malice and mayhem
Fuck a dictionary, give me the mic and I'll slay
Them and literally poetic symptoms
Pissing me the fuck off, missing me with that shit
I stick a venacular foot so far up in ya ass
You won't be able to pass verbal gas
So far in ya ass that one of my knees will rise so far above ya head
And you drown of a poetic ass kicking
Leaving lyrical lacerations on your lungs, from a verbal hangnail
That hung on my big toe, as I flow upward
Kicking yo on ya eardrum, you wanna hear some?
Tap dance on ya tonsils, leaving kiwi shoe polish on ya breath
Cavity in ya best rhyme, and I'm the access on the rest
Call me the proverbial verbal menacing dentist
With the drill, I got lyrical skills
I could perform oral root canals
It's unwise to fuck with me
Kick ya wisdom teeth down ya throat
Leaving you to choke
On where it hurts, unspoken vocals
Tying down ya vocal cord and windpipe tight
With toe jamming and ya mothafucking hemmoroids

Stay on the low with a M-16 flow
In the Benz with a dime bitch, puffin hydro

My raps is like cheap keys straight from Mexico
Yo, I flow like a UFO, All-Pro
Rich kid, get my dick sucked in a Tahoe
When I hear a beat it's like putting tims on my feet
Then run a track meet away from the beats, fuck police
I run the street with a Mack Milli for rappers who act silly
Cock it back, then smoke a Nigga like a Philly

When you goin' through mad shit
And it just seem like you get out of it, nowhere and shit
You thinkin' you puttin' your shit in and you thinkin'
You gettin' over, and doin' all this other shit
But before you know it, your whole world just caved in on you, pa
Check the joint, it's, uh-huh, yeah, I walked into the place

Over, and then my life (the masquerade)
I know it's over (the masquerade)
Uh-oh, over (over) my my my good day is over
(Over) the masquerade is over (over)
It's over (over)

Back in '95 when I was juggling bitches
Pumping coke out the spot, smacking fiends in the kitchen
All around dick sucks whenever, blowing chronic out of Philly's
Getting flusty in the Cub' Link era
Niggas telling me my spot is hot
They like I think any day now, playboy, shit going pop

Back then I was the fat Ghost, them came March 1st
My eighth platoon got murked, got burnt for all our work
After the funeral, I played low, counting my last ten g's
Three weeks later, yo, I'm back in the P's

Gathering up information, checking faces
Keeping a forty-five auto' loaded like it was bases
When it get dark, venom will leave my mark (over)
I heard a voice through a bullhorn, a white man he said ""Yo, Starks!""
You're surrounded, put down your gun, look at the rules
There's nothin' but cops, nigga, you better not run""

[Chorus]

Yeah, you see how that went right?
That episode got deep and all of that
Know what I mean? Then it just go on and
It just don't stop, I don't care what town you from
What hood you from, it just all goes in, yo, check this episode

11:40 A.M. in the best Western
I'm with my bat, blew her ass back and chest in
Slob my knob, yeah no question, this my main bat
She thorough like that, so we don't use protection
But the night before, my wiz must of check my phone
How the fuck she get the codes, I don't know

Next thing, she laying in the hotel lobby, spotted me
Tipping the doorman, holding hands with my bitch besides me
My heart drop, everything stops, scared to death
Told my broad to keep it moving, cause I just got knocked
Don't turn around, as soon she did, she bust a shot
Plus she talk, security drop when she touch the glock
I had the gum-face on, long face on
Didn't say shit, not even cough or spit, my bitch was gone
There goes the car, house, rhyme boats or jewelry
Court date judges, my shorty tried to screw me

[Chorus: x2]

You see, sometime it don't pay
What goes around comes around in
In many different ways and
You can guess what happened
That's right y'all, you know how it get down
If anybody got it locked, it's God, that's right

Put a salon up in the fucking hood, son I can't even make no money no more, man

If they could put a Ms. Pac-Man or something in the back

I control 26,000 men. Except for dope, we operate in all aspects
Of organized crime. And if there's one thing I'm sure of
It's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home
In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin

We eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs
In the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams

Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms
Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns
You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips
Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis
Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties

 Amplify sample through vacumn tubes compressions

All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinkin', the tears in your eyes are twinklin'
Because the heart gently weeps

Snowy night, fiends basin', a raisin' in the sun was amazin'
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck

Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight whylin'

Robbin' everythin' in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms who fuck niggaz, got four babies
Yvette jabbed her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her

Lester, smoked Chester sister Vest, I heard it was a mess
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all eight trainers
Who got reluct', think fast and blast from Beamers

I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushin' the cart
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's
That's what I get, not focusin' from hittin' that bar
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark

In the aisle bustin' them paper towels and wipin' my Wally's down
I stood up to face a barrel, he's holdin' a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again

That bitch is crazy and uh, she brought her baby
She knew I hard the murders, a smack
It killed her man though, now I got his fuckin' nephew grippin' his gat
You's a bitch, you better kill me, you know you're booty
You pulled your toolie, out on me motherfucker

First thought was to snatch the ratchet
Said fuck it and fuckin' grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fuckin laughin'
I wrestled him to the ground, tussle, scuffle, constantly kicked him

He wouldn't let go the joint, so I fuckin' bit him
Shots was whizzin', hittin' Clorox bottles
Customers screamin', then the fagot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about
Next thing you read in the paper
A man who came to kill gets knocked out

I don't know why nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry
Though we're just babies and you're so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life

You on your way to the store nigga
Grab me a Dutch, I'm mad as fuck
My dude, my count was short when I was baggin' it up
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
What's up with Officer Brown?

The other day he tried to shackle me up
He killed Kase and now he hasslin' us
This motherfucker got balls
Even the gall to try and pattin' me up

Time to re-up, let these niggaz
Know we back on the block
With three hundred off a G-pack
Crack in the spot

See, I was raised out on these mean streets
I'm from the projects, right, where poverty and hell meet
I'm searching everyday to find a better way, I've got a
Hustle still to get my pay before I hit bottom

Now some might say that I'm already there but who are
They to judge or question what I do? Son, so I don't care
Tired of eating cheese sandwiches with no meat
Tired of watching all the playas from the same seat

So it's a life of crime, some might sing or rhyme
To escape the ghetto before the flatline
Choices to make, what am I gonna do?
Got to use my talents, they gonna pull me through

Now with success, I become a target, they wanna set me up
I guess, more money equals more problems
They wanna get me, wanna hit me, strip me of my riches
They wanna cut me up in pieces, leave me deep in ditches

And I can't take it but I'm gonna make it
Yeah, oh, I'm gonna make it
Yeah, ohh, fight to stay alive

I was raised out on these mean streets
You know where poverty and hell meet
Brothers get jail and life's for sale, cheap
Since momma held me in her arms to tell me

That it's a cold world, I done held heat
And held myself down, lotta bodies and shells found
And niggas into taking everything, that ain't nailed down
We fell down, ain't hard to tell now

I ain't trying to see the cell now
Or see momma put her house up for bail now
So I'm a give all I got, to try and get that gwop

Go 'head and get the cops
I use my talent to get more figures
Unlike these little corner store niggas
Go change your drawers, niggas

They wanna diss me, want a clip me, leave me stiff in ditches

Few rise, many drop, True Lies, semis cocked
Fish scale, already rocked, heavy shots, that we drop
New guys on every block, blue eyes and red dots

Pregnant mothers, broke fathers, more money, more problems
So hungry, won't starve 'em, work hard and so pardon
I got mouths to feed, I got pounds of weed
I need some more, another store, another house, indeed
An X amount of G, the reason pounds'll squeeze

And strip you naked, basic, trying to make it out the P's
Don't ever doubt a G, and have me spaz like
Face with the K and my nose all powdery
It ain't about the streets, it's 'bout the beast within
That won't give in to 'lice, down to bleed, G

And I can't take it, no, no but I'm gonna make it
Yeah, oh, I'm gonna make it, ooh, yeah
It's a cold, cold, cold world
I got my hand on my gun, they got a brother on the run

Yeah, it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive
This ain't a game, this is my life

Keep pushing me to the edge, I'm gonna push back
And you won't like that, it's guaranteed you won't like that
When ya laid down, laid flat

Wu-Tang Clan,"We are the G, O-D's
And we came to rock, the spot
Like Ironman Starks
They be the illest MC's, in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Bees

Say peace to cats who rock mack knowledge
Knowledgists, street astrologists
Light up the mic God, knowledge this
Fly joints that carried your points
Corolla Motorola holder
Play it God, he pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Rapel on fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Drake
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck your union
It's the same style, RZA trainable, jump the turn style
On the alley tried to challenge God for the new vials
Especially that, aluminum bat in the act
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black
The Mac-10 flex white cats like Windex
Index finger be sore, busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing em, jet to the stash and now Jerusalem
Abusing em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em
Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older God, build with the Son and the Star

All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us

Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps
Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit, like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbin niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be metal like Von Harper radio bubble
Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Philippines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Body chemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slap box with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zooming like binoculars, the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex, with sparkles, Chef ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man no cheap cash metal I'm steel alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes
Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us

Give me the the fifty thou, small bills
My gold plate, my slang kills
My Benz spills, what up Lils
Murder one Dunn
Killer bee stung, guess who back home Son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, probably wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, lord of dooms, in fat pussy wombs
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill
Check out the mad skills
Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it
And keep it, jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang
Sweep it out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten Don is too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is handcocked
Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot

All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest
But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us",Daytona 500,2008

Wu-Tang Clan,"Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam nine diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback, Norte Dame
Golden Arms is bronze, buddah palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mean stream be the theme
Supreme team, America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome
And split the bone, wig blown off the ledge
By the alledged, full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc(ious) handheld trigger cuts
Acapella spitting shell paralyzed when you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld tote mm-hmm

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more

A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of, hot raps and hot tracks
A duffle bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks just like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster

Yes the shit is raw, coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show, it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learned how to
Fuck up yo' anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the men-tal
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python

Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravangza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, trying to get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick Hip Hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over, by the Method Man jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cos you weak in the knees, like SWV
Trying to get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA Rob name printed in the tablet

Sometimes I pull my boxers down, ya'll, with one Timb on
It be times, you know I stay away when her friends on
For some reason, she be really hot, when her friends gone
That's when I slide on over with a Guinness on the stouffer
To talk a little shit, then get a little closer
Like, what up boo, you know that Ghost loves you
I get butterflies when we hug and kiss, do you?
Huh? Answer me, let me if it's the truth now
That pretty mole above your lips looking cute now
Ooh child, I'm patient, my mind's telling me
To stay calm, I wanna get it off like a G bomb
On top of your skin, I'm sliding it in
When I'm done, you can wake it up and ride it again
Then we can hold on through the night, fan on and covers on
It's bright from the TV light, peace, good night

Looking out my window, sun shining bright
Birds are singing, trying to make things right
Now I got music, oh, on my radio
And I can hear love songs playing, behind closed doors
Now I don't want no one, on the catch me side
But ever since you left, said goodbye

[Chorus]
I wish you were here with me
I said I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here, with me

And thinking bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seen our love, is never gonna find me
And I keep looking, oh, for that brighter day
When all I see is, time slipping away
Oh and I got to talk, to keep myself together
But all I see is stormy weather

Now I got to get, get myself together
Cause I can't take no more, of this stormy weather
Now I wish you were here with me
I wish you were right here
I wish you were here with me, ooh

Night falls and I call for you, love
But there's no one here to answer

But there's no one there but my reflection
No, oh I said I wish you was here with me",I Wish You Were Here,2009

Knowhatimsaying, you know the type of person you is

You bout to catch this vick
Yo, you bout to catch this vick

Old sad ballads and gun permits was invalid
Raspberry vinegar, red dripped in spinach salad
Sippin' bitches, Cabanet grape, steaming halibut steak
Gold plate is stainless, four forks scrape the silver plate
Chased by a shot of Scotch whiskey, brew brisky
For sixty years, misty bottles of Crysty in the freezer
Red twist leaf, melted in spliffy, Cali blunt piff
Now we lifty, MC dread head, split up and smoke swiftly
Then if we empty the safe we can all catch fifty
Vanna piece put eighty five in jewelry
Two sixty in deep, a half a gallon Digi
When dog mentioned hingie, then when they tempted me
All up a nine milli', I brought my wild cousin Billy
This fucking Wu hater, from off of Decatur
Bout to get smacked silly, Kinetic was like
Yo, Bobby, don't act illy, let me handle this shit
We rolled the candle sick spliff, we hopped inside the whip
And through the gear on shift, about to catch this vick

It's the season of the vick, bitch, you getting hit up
With so much weight, so much lead, you won't be able to get up

Yo, kick in the door, spit a lungie at him, son, tried to bungie
Grab 'em, through 'em on the floor, smacked 'em, my dudes bout to stab 'em
Bitch was in the bathroom, screaming, hot bubble batch, steaming
You can tell from her face, she just finished swallowing semen
Shut the fuck up, open the safe up, no time to waste up
Heard you been hating on Wu-Tang, we should burn your fucking place up
He was like 'Yo, Bobby Steels, chill, for real, please spare me'
Billy put the gun to his face like 'Bobby, go 'head, try to dare me'
I was like 'Nah, son, chill, ain't necessary'

Can you hear me? Can you hear me now?
We need a miracle
Destroy the FDA for holdin' back cures so they can get paid

If a miracle, could save us from
The travesty, that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We shall overcome, overcome",Miracle,2014

I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home

They want me locked down, fryin' in jail
Before you hear that I decided to tell, I'd rather die in a cell
I was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
Still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
Prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
Scorin' money like the meter on the Yellow Cab
Give the witness an unexpected visit
Make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
Couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
Like, ""I was on the ground, I ain't see him bustin'""
Now the DA chasin' a plea, they hatin' I'm free
The case is mistaken identity

Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back
I push a cap, before '93, I pushed crack
I'm hood, black, you know me well, what's good Scrap?
I'm smokin' rappers, you are a L, what's good Smack?
Hold up that's goods rap, pardon sir
I just like good rap, but when I see goods I give his goods back
I rap for writers that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
To 25 to lifers that jack MAC
We movin' ratchets, no Kat Stacks, it's magic
The way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
I'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
When life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress
Before you try and get my head, get you some Pampers
Then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
Kick in my vicinity, I'm what rappers pretend to be
Charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity

Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy

Fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
Two suitcases, dangle on his hands
He opened up the door, headed up the stairs
Thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
First sight he saw, struck him by surprise
Two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
Windows blown out, no prints on the door
All he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
Blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
Cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
But he was bangin' Mrs. Prixy at the Motor Lodge
He got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
The screw fit the judge, he might take the fall
Someone set him up, a botched robbery
Mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be

17 years old, I'm headed back to the hole
Mistaken identity, every way was sold
I look like a hoodlum, I rock a lot of gold
They lockin' everybody up, ship your ass up the road
I ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
Court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
Tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket
The beast pat me up, they won't let me off

Na-n-n-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
It could never been the G-O-D, not me
You terribly mistaken, son, I ain't the one
We could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
What resemblance does he strike? So my mic Fahrenheit
W for my a-alike, your DNA match tight

They still tryna get it right, mistaken identity

Wu-Tang Clan,"Brother, I think that necklace is causing you too much trouble

My necklace had the whole crowd on some next shit
The guest list full of real niggas that's hectic
The charm piece made my niggas move like calm beasts
Palm beats, two jostling niggas with long reach
Keep your eyes open for them strong on thieves
Out here looking for ice to put in they teeth
Chain glowing shining and I'm ready for beef
Like my nigga 2 Chainz, cappuccino from the east
From the Wu-Tang Clan, my necklace and my heat
Bang bang, different robe every day of the week
2 Angels, dinner plate, fat dollar sign
Universal flag on, nigga, I got shine

I keep my neck frozen, .45 loaded, please don't approach this
Rope is so ferocious, diamonds that shine in oceans
Keep you arm distant from my carats, silly rabbits
Make me get my barrel, spazzed out and cause havoc
Iced out Cubans, exotic stones from Africa
This the real thing, big bling, the chain swing
Try to swipe mines, that's a no no, the God's loco
Jury truckin' fancy spend stacks upon Delancey
Exhaust pipes coffin horse kicks
ACP's dress up the flesh, now the crime scene's gorgeous
My links is unbreakable, told y'all on the Purple Tape
40 inches hang from my neck, nigga, I'm wealthy

Why you say that?
It's real, kill a nigga for this shit
Aha, yo relax sis

Dinner plates rings, smothered in 2 pounds of dope
Eric B on the cut when it blings
Scrubbin' chain down in Colgate, double edged bangers
On they hips I wait in the jaw break
The snakes and the violators, Dracula style takers
We got a bunch of gold balls, but we ain't the Lakers
Hey bitches, stay lickin' my necklace
And I ain't even put the dumb bitch in the guest list
That's what you get when you throwin' on Cuban's
Drawers that's made from silk, a robe and a Ruger
Crack heads catchin' a sweet vix on a scooter
Catch me for my chain, it belongs on a shooter
Lucky my shit blow like a horn on a tuba
You might as well do me now cause I will do ya

God-Cipher-Love-Divine in math 79
Bright yellow and dense in its gift and shine
Still the same when exposed to air and water
Like when amongst thieves you travellin' across the border
The brink of the metal link when in transition remains solid
The message was lost in transmission
That's often in a free elemental form
Nuggets and grains and rocks and things that's norm
Malleable ductile metal on many levels
Get you shot for a Flintstone, killed for a pebble
Lieutenants and Generals move with criminals
The pride for all in line, they hunt for mineral
The scope is on the rope, claws on the table
Brass knuckle, knees buckle, legs unstable
And it's sold by the weight
Shaped into a plate with food on it
The hungry wolves lie and wait",Necklace,2014

Allmighty [?] to the insidious
Plan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand
We never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show

Never let go of your mind
It’s a terrible thing to waste
To lose, but it’s very hard to find
Being that ignorance is lethal
We must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
Never let go of your plan, execute
So when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
Never lose knowledge of yourself
For it may become risk to your health
And great loss of wealth

Never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
Players retire, but they never let go of the team
If you a rider then you never let go of that thing
Pull up your mans’ like you better let go of that bling
This life’s crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
Fatherless babies on the block but they father 380

Both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
We hood legends, misunderstood
These lessons, learned
Growing up for manhood
Keep focus on the prize what you better do
A little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
States what’s ahead of you, always on the schedule
Smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
Letting go, is something that I never do
Those who let go, live life regrettable
Never let go of your hope or your rope
Eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
When I’m in jail, never let go of the soap
Hold on, boy, never let go

Never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
Never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
Never let go your heart, or the place you started
The feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted
The old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs
I never let go the love I have for thy father
Never let go the glow
The more I know the more that it shows
I won’t let go, even if I decompose
Your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
Pass the baton, life is just the marathon
And ain't' playing to win it, it’s an epidemic

Time after time, line after line
Our stock increases, rhyme after rhyme

Found Q-Tip's wallet in El Segundo
Prolly been spotted on Telemundo
With more wild cards than a box of Uno

Holler at the moon, my goons at Coachella

Insert the beam on my Glock, got that lean in my bottle

But let it be my life story if they ever do tell
Know I died for what I live
An intimate connection for that infinite reflection
That's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid
So now my stock's high and shots fired
My niggas who was tight with the kid
I'm hot as Hell's Kitchen with the oven on
Deck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don

Backs that'll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back

The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man

Yo, pa, I got a lady, I'm 'bout to make her my baby
Might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
She know my style wavy, I'm circlin' her Mercedes
Father, father was a preacher, I'm almost certain he hates me
But he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
And she decides on her own who resides on the throne
I'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
And she understands the fact that I'm even right when I'm wrong
When she was prayin' in church, I was playin' in dirt
That's 100, I admit that we both was playin' at first
When opposites attract, I ain't always sayin' it works
I'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
It's Wu-Tang, baby, my crew bang
And she's the preacher's daughter, I just call her my boo thang
And we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
Man, sometimes I tell your parents just don't understand

Yo, you mean Pastor Brown's daughter?
The preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?
I used to see her Sundays comin' from church
We used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
Yo, her parents didn't play
She couldn't even come out to play on a school day
Thought she was gonna give me some on April Fool's day
(But no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)

The preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
She know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
She married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
See her in the market place loud and boisterous
With tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
She a seductress in the form of a goddess
Never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
Breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
Man, that's how she molest you
That's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
Cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
Never sin around righteous people
Black widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you

The only girl that could ever please me

The only girl that could ever please me

I met her on the bus stop with black eyes
That's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
I cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
Her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
Brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
So she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
Them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
Never knew the science of virtue, Ecclesiastes
Like, a time for peace, a time for war
A time to laugh though, she never felt God before
Eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
Between me and her, it don't concern you

A wild fire engulfing every home

And a curious culture full of superconductors

Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen

Got the cash it takes, I might flash my face
Half a eighth got me floating like I'm trapped in space
Not safe for your workplace, a basket case

Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money not, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weight it up
Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money not, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weight it up
Quest to success with my mind on my money
Came a new rhyme saying ""Wu-Tang is the best"" music",Don't Stop,2017
Wu-Tang Killa Bees,"Yo, yo one two one two, yo live in effect 
We got the king Ruler Zig-Zag-Zag Allah 
Commonly known to why'all as the RZA 
Yo before we go into side two or side be	 of this double CD 

Knahmsayin I want to give why'all a little announcement man 
For the last year there's been a lot of music comin out 
The shit been weak, knowhatI'msayin? 
A lot of niggaz trying to take hip-hop 

And make that shit R&B, rap and bullshit yaknowhatI'msayin? 
Or make that shit funk 
Fuck that, this is MCin right here, this is hip-hop 
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang gonna bring it to you in the purest form

Sunz of Man, Royal Fam, Killarmy, Gravediggaz, 12 O'Clock 
Yo, we want to let why'all niggaz know somethin man 
To my people all across the world; Japan, Europe -- knowhatI'msayin? 

Canada, knowmean -- Austria, Germany, Sweden 
Yo, this is true hip-hop you listenin to right here 
In the pure form, this ain't no R&B with a wack nigga takin the loop 
Be loopin that shit thinkin it's gonna be the sound of the culture 

YaknowhatI'msayin? (That player bullshit) 
YaknowhatI'msayin? All that player dressin up

YaknowhatI'msayin? This is lyrics, MCin 
And yo, to why'all niggaz who think you going to become an MC overnight 
YaknowhatI'msayin? Better snap out that fuckin dream 
Man it takes years for this you Cat in the Hat ass rappers 

You Dr. Seuss, Mother Goose, simple minded 
(Stop runnin up on niggaz with all that wack shit) 
Word up man (I'm talking about you MC's) 
You ain't no MC; niggaz ain't made for this yaknowhatI'msayin? 

This shit was Only Built 4 Cuban Linx -- we told why'all niggaz back then 
And then everybody wanted to change their motherfuckin name 
YaknowhatI'msayin? We come out with a style 
Now everybody want to imitate our style and all you producers out there 

YaknowhatI'msayin? It's all good to show love to a nigga 
But stop bitin my shit, yaknowhatI'msayin? 
Come from your own heart with this shit 
And all why'all MC's, stop biting from my niggaz 

We told ya'll niggaz on the fucking Cuban Linx album 
Don't bite our shit, why'all niggaz keep biting 
Yo, I'm going to tell why'all something man 
It's time for the Wu revolution right here 

To all my niggaz across the world 
Raise your motherfucking fist in the air

I'm at the bar, Long Island Iced Tea
Double shot of Hennessey for this pretty piece
With pretty feet smelling like Victoria Sec'
I could see her bra and panties were pink
Looking Spanish or Greek, finest thing I seen all week
Moving with her cousin and niece
I'm moving with my mans Monk and P
Stand at the wall, long chrome 3-3-3
Pussy for free like ODB, high off the eves
Bitches looking like Pamela Lee
Butt-naked on their hands and knees
Roll up the trees, burn somethin' 'fore we leave
Give your friend your car keys, slide with me

Hey vagina, use my name Davey Crocket
I'm king of the wild frontier, your sex hostage

Bottle for the Wu years and I'ma hit the flow after a few beers
Just tell the DJ the Black Knights is up in here
Wu-Tang is in here, the whole Killa Bee Gang is in here
And ladies holler when we in here
Cause they know it's Big Pimping going on in here
And in the VIP, ho's take it off in here
So get at me 'cause I know you want to spit at me
And I'd be a fool to let that fat ass pass me

You want to ride in the 600 baby
With your head out the window like ""Hey hey""
Tell everybody in the hood you my lady
We big up for life so you crazy

[Prodical]
This killer dog puffin green gandy, ready to sink through some panties
Caught some eye candy, sipping on Coke mixed with Remy
Yo Monk, shorty got a lot of junk in her trunk
Now she surfing through the crowd for our weed and skunk
A nigga 12, dropping treasures like the jewels of the Nile
Twenty-seven, man-child from the Isle of Shaolin
We sky Sushi bar, Meoshi par, finest cigars
And the ladies in the place want to know who we are
Gumah Oz Dubar, my hand all in her bra
So what's the deal ma'? Can me and my Clan Bar Mitzvah?
Call your girlfriends, after-party, house on the hill
Come and do real, she said ""I'm burning heart off the pill""
Drinks for free, I got my own VIP
Two or three, or it can be just you and me
Let's get it on and popping, crack-a-latin with no debating
No time for the faking, baby girl what's shaking?

[Monk]
Catch Monk in the midst of party cracking, don't dance
But I boogie to the beat low key, I stay splashed
And drunk still drinking, popping major with the ho's, I'm grooving
With this fat bitch, she stuck with my slang and my dress code
I got close, whispered ""What's up with the Bar Mitzvah?""
Then I grabbed her ass, she laughed with a porno look
And pussy popped her ass on rhythm with the beat
But passed, she with her man but her friends came two cars deep

About my dirty habits, I got to have it, the super-glow
Deuce Bigelow - Male Gigolo
Gold hands crush Coke cans and Michelobs
Style is Nino, black Benzito, Valentino
Nine needles - voice; evil steelo
Hit, like the bull, more pull than Magneto
Crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the Eagle
Nine dirty strikes, leaped up off all you people
Burn therapy, chemo, seap hoes
See you through the peephole - in the crime lab
Countin Ginos, cut-tin dime slabs
Then he bagged up Chino, rushed through the crowd with a hee-ho
Slapshots, jackpots, and pe-nnals
Throw graffiti on the wall, throwin up Reemo
Gambino three dice, headcrack Cee-Lo
In ya earhole, let the snare roll go low
Lower than low, lower than zero

Bobby Digital, half-man and half (?)

With high-heel shoes and tattoos on side titties
Shorties swallow up the apple cider
Ra' doin a buck forty in the yellow Spyder
With the black interior, my mack superior
to your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria
I used to cut class and bang lunch tables
With four finger weaves and long chunky gold cables
Now I'm known to smack drum machines, carry +Guillotines+
Watch my bullets scream (""Pheeewwwwww!"") and hit the target
You can't trace the path of air for Richard Starlett

It's the return of the bad boy, the mic Sean Penn
Floss gems across the globe with my nine Sourceman
At a speed that excedes your convertible Benz
From a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens
Stay hotter than a ex-con dodgin the pens
Killa Squadron, known to start a popular trend
And the emblem, symbolize the wisdom
certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom
Shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom
Kings of our kindom, reppin from our hoodlums
Gotta whip them problems, 'cause yo we step on toes
Bangin heads knockin teeth loose, welcome to the pros
Flash quiz, do that nigga handle his biz?
I spin a song like Michael and Diana in the Wiz
The rough shit, I bust it for the republic
Government, you ain't lovin it, whatchu fuckin wit?
Manifesto, light it like a techno club
Outside I don't expect no love
Man this grip, make the fans flip, don't chance it
Cop the goods, while my hundred hoods run rampid

Sippin on a cold one, Rollin on them gold ones
The chrome was the old ones, I sold them

Can I get a drum roll please for my gold D's?
Hundred spoke Daytonas, wish we all could be California
Smokin bank in the corners in a black six-deuce
Hittin switches, dippin, switchin on that ackrite juice
Act like you, wan' try and take my D's
Watch how fast these slugs in this thang gon' leave
Watch how many holes in ya body it leaves
Watch how much pints of blood you bleed
May the fake thugs retreat, pop up barkin the heat
Caravanin nine-to-ten cars deep
Down the 'shaw where Knights is known to breakin laws
And if a bitch is ridin with me she's takin it off
Now get off ya job, if not bitch I'm layin you off
'cause I guess the last nigga that you fucked with was soft
That ain't me, it cost just to floss with me

Bouncin off this deuce-deuces, fat like Polo gooses
Eighteen-inch woofers movin studio acoustics
Rim tri-star, chrome on my side-bar
Don't hate crab 'cause I caught ya bitch eye par
Platinum grill, re-enforced solid steel
Superstar engine, force of an eighteen wheel
That'll crash through brick walls, smash intersections
Move through ya city escorted with police protection
Heated polished seats with back massages
You gotta know how to roll in more like Kenny Rogers
Tinted glass, PS2 plus Dreamcast
Smoke screens, blindin high blasts
GPS satellite navigation
Automatic lock doors drop jackers to the station
You got beef you get fed to Doc Doom
Goon, you can't fuck with Wu Killa Bee Clan platoon
I might get Holocaust to come and cough on you
My nigga Crisis might love to let one off on you
Or Rugged Monk rolls up another blunt
The great Digi goes and lures out another cunt

Ain't got no money or love for you funny fools

Stick dick to hoodrats, make gangsta hits
I baptize my sticks, ice skate on seventeens
On the phone with five-oh, don't you love them D's?
While they spin, you freeze in ya souped up paint clean
Fifties, amps, six by nines and thangs
Comin down the block, let my sub straight bang

I used to kick my new rhymes to him when I made them up
We'd smoke a blunt, and build on shit was real growing up
Going through the same things, we seeing eye to eye
And no matter what happens, promised to let nothing die
So was born when he got bagged for 56 dimes
I'mma give his girl commissary money all the time
He caught this disease and couldn't stay out'ta jail
Locked up when his mom died, shit really got real
He came to the wake in handcuffs
Dear God, Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
His girl eight months pregnant, a nurse assistant holding him down
Faithfully on every visit, food packages, she bring him trees and everything
A down ass bitch is a thug's everything
I'm day he night, we the same blood type, brothers for life
I fly him kites on the regular

Wundersch,"O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
Asleep on the hay

Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

And mail it right away

Wyatt Lowe,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin',
And down in the dips she started to rockin'.
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that hot rod Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln,

I guess I need a change of attitude
So many times I've thought that I knew best
Guess I'm no better than the rest

So I'll tell you in this simple song
I'm not asking for your sympathy
I just want you here with me

There are times I know
Maybe I should go,
and other times I should stay

Do what they feel even if it's wrong

This time it's a all or nothing thing, yeah

Every time I cry
So our dream won't die
Now you can't justify
The guilt got me tongue-tied, oh no, no
When I say someone please call 911
That's 'cause I realised the wrong that I've done
Emergency, somebody shot my heart down
But two wrongs don't make it 
I was blind but now I see
Took an L but now I'm G
You could never be faithful, but you were my religion
So I believed you when you said you were changed
You were playing me like a game
When I said I want TLC
Didn't mean somebody that creeps
Now I'm ghost and you say that ya haunted
'Cause all you think 'bout is how bad you want it

This will be the last time, the last time
This will be the last time, oh
So look me in the eye when you tell me lies
This time it's a all or nothing thing
Said, this'll be the last time, the last time
This'll be the last time, the last time
Look me in the eyes when you tell me lies
This time it's a all or nothing thing
Oh, this'll be the last time I pretend
This'll be the last time I give in
Look me in the eyes when you tell your lies
This time it's a all or nothing thing

Wyclef Jean,"[Intro]
Yeah I wanna dedicate this to everybody that love hip hop music
Cause without hip hop music I wouldn't be here today
Preacher's son, yeah

[Verse 1]
Imagine if Biggie and Pac never got shot
And they both still were rulers of hip hop
And Puffy and Suge was roomates from college
And Big L never got found in the alley
Nas and Jay-Z they were still homies
Squash the beef with Ja Rule and 50
Benzino shook hands with Eminem
And on the same record I heard Eve, Fox and Kim
And sometimes when I dream, that's when I wake up
I kinda hoped that The Fugees didn't break up
And when they walked into the studio I prayed they didn't spray
Cause I miss that scratch from Jam Master Jay (Whoa oh oh!!!)

[Chorus]
Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see
What we see is reality
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow
Soon they won't live to see tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Imagine if Big Pun was still alive
I could see Fat Joe screamin Terror Squad
Imagine if there were still four survivors still in Destiny's Child
And TLC never lost they Left Eye
Imagine Refugees never needin a passport
And John Forte never at Newark Airport
Million Man March, man, that was a start
Now I need a million more to meet me at Central Park
When the revolution start y'all 'gon have to play this
Imagine Slick Rick not gettin deported (Whoa oh oh!)

[Chorus]
Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see
What we see is reality
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow
Soon they won't live to see tomorrow

[Verse 3]
In the club never though Shyne shot the gun
But in the limosine JLO had to run
Paparazzi snappin shots through the mirror
That's when I saw a smile from Princess Diana
Back and forth and forth and back
Like Miss Aaliyah man do I miss her
The war goes on with The ROC and The Lox
Murder INC, G- Unit it's a fight to the top
Stop! We lost too many soldiers like Freaky Tah
While they get the cover of a magazine who got to die

[Chorus]
Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see

It's been three years (AH!), livin this fast life

Once by my mom, pops the other two
Child abuse kid, ward of the state
I know it was the past, but I just can't shake
How you had a kid, beat me like a slave
I was only three, how could I misbehave?
I didn't know better, you could teach me first
You said fuck that, then you beat me worse

Close one, I almost went up in a blaze

Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect caller from Jeff

""Yes, what's the deal, son?""
""Yo, I got bad news""
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the I'll street blues

She said your brother he just died
Well I told him not to go outside
He said he had to fight for his country's right

Because the war is not over
Until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence
But I smell gunpowder (pow)

My brother's been dead ever since
I didn't beleive it, but when I saw him I was convinced
Two shots to the head he was already dead Lord
I headed for revenge in the city of Port Au Prince
Screaming bro-brother

I wanna know why ghetto people pray for a new day Hey, hey, heeey
And its still the same way
But the preacher man told me
Good things come to those who wait (Do good things come to those who wait?)
I wanna know tell me
Good things come to those who wait (Do good things come to those who wait?)

And if your busy, I wouldn't mind taking Saturday

You to crank up your volume
We want all the ladies to sit back, relax, let your hair out
Wyclef presents the Neville Brothers in the house tonight

I know a girl, she ruled my world
Whatever I need, she supplied
Living in paradise
She ruled my heart, till death do we part
(Her love was like ecstasy)

At least that's how I thought it would be
(So Neville brothers what you telling me)
At least that how I thought it would be
(One question, what was her name)
Mona Lisa, you called my name
Laid it apart but I did not respond
And you ask me what I am thinking of
In the morning I'll be gone, no more loving after dawn
No longer can we share the love that was never there
When the moon has lost its light
And the stars no longer bright
And no longer can we share, the love that was never there
(Ain't no need to cry girl, its gonna be alright)

Girl don't you cry
(Girl don't you cry)
Please dry your eyes
All you ever been was faithful in my life
So I apologize
I hope the future brings us back together

And the stars no longer bright
No longer can we share, the love that was never there

Right about now if you are in dance
I want you to hold your girl real tight
We got the Neville brothers in the house tonight
Along side Wyclef, you know how we do it
I want to apologize to you
I never wrote a love song
This is my first one",Mona Lisa,1997

Do you know it reminds me of the summertime 
In the bungalows of Spain, all night in the park.

It would be on the eighth floor,
But the pongos they reach up there, man!

You got guns (you got guns), I got guns (uh-huh)

You can ask, on the block, fool ? ain't the one to test
Street Jeopardy (here we go yo, here we go yo, here we go yo)
Have you ever played Jeopardy

Not me, it could never happen to me
Professor says what you wanna do? Sell drugs or get a degree?
Looked at him and smiled with 32 gold teeth
And said what you make in a year, I make it in a week
Elementary at the time, I don't think of gettin caught
Sellin with degrees, pickups at the seaport (come on)
Once caught, you know the drill, it's military
I can't lie, it gets scary, you screamin' for your mommy (come on)
Truth or dare, beware, the game is never fair
I'm fallin and I can't get up, like a dead hare
You stare like you seen me before
Yup, you put the gat to my gut, stuck me up in the truck
And said, ""Don't nothin move but the goods""
Caught an arrow in your back fuckin wit Robin Hood

This street life'll get you if the hustle don't fit you
Paranoid crews don't choose, nigga stick you
Arms and foldin macks to ya back tryin'a vick you
Belief in my crew wishin' foes never get through
And if so, Shalom, bless my soul, I'm home
I lived my life to the fullest, neighborhoods now known
A stone face is outta place when discussin B.I
If I have a second thought, you ought not reply
I fought hot and sticky summers when the game started heatin
Competition, mega jail, and the well, who was eatin (oh well)
And every cell in the bang had a tenant
With each of them regrettin they was in it

Yeah, yeah
I got up, sunny day, hood callin my name
Strange, I feel nauseous, memories of a pine cauffin
Seemed to me that I was dreamin
I'd been struck by a crazed fan after the concert, damn
Slugs form and I hurt, hopped up, checked my physical
But the pain was all mental, I slipped into
The shower, hopped out, got dressed, hit the blocks
Swarmed with cops, mad shots, hot shells dropped
You ever heard the sound of a .44 at your door?
Before, many times, I answered back with a milli
Now what? Now give me mine
It ain't no games like B.D.P

To all the girls I loved before
To all the girls I cheated on before
To all the girls I loved before

To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson
You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson
Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions
To fall into seduction while playing a temptation
I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last
The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas
Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside
Stress brings me pain, I gotta hold my pride
When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide
Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives
You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her
I found myself in a blur
Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared

Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story
I got married at 24 in New Jersey
You know the feelings start nature take it's course
Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce
When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar
With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future
Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right
Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night
Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table
Thin Line Between Love And Hate is on cable
I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear

You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you take her friend
Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend

Break it down right here

One love, you're lucky to have one love
It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug
One heart, one mind, one soul
She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bank-roll
Keep your money, she make her own cheddar
All she want from me is respect like Aretha
Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter
Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November
Have you seen her?
I think I did
But what I did wrong was take a love for granted
Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust
Easier said than done, I lust and I must
Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss
We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts
Like species, she called me an animal
So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal

I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh

I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

I'm not a ho
(You don't believe me though)
I know you're diggin' this
Is it OK if I play my guitar right about now, is it alright?
(You don't believe me though)

On Flatbush got my first sneakers tooken
Learn the game quick so I got my first device
Mom moved to Jers' so we could get a better life
But little did she know a ghetto is a ghetto
Good times found myself like Jimmie Walker sayin' ""Cello""

Yellow cheese bus gettin' beatings if I cuss
Lay away another day in stripped Lees and Le Tigres
But the lyrical bomber momma tried to stop
Paranoid cause this boy around my neighborhood got shot
Name plait hair, straight metal braces on my teeth
Fat laces on my feet when crack first hits the streets

I use to push up on a girl Salt 'N' Peppa Push It Push It
D's in school cause the music was my focus
Jokes in class but when I learned I didn't pass
I knew it was my ass with my mothers leather lash
Belt buckle said Nelly Nel similar to Melle Mel
Hits the third rail Beat Street made Gazzels sells

As the tale gets poetic watch the streets turn magnetic
Tawana Brawley's rape is alleged
Hang out in hooky places watch streets corners turn to oasis
Young men aspire to be Scarfaces

In the year of the dragon lots of men disappear
Quiet as it's kept they won't be back next year

Late at night the light was bright on the [ave]
I went to pick up cash from my cousin little Kev
He told me Joe had a dream in jail he got steamed
His wife became a fiend fuckin' little Raheem
Damn, drugs will make you do terrible things
He told me when he get out he's murdering by any means
The day came I saw him on the train
He pulled his gun and aimed and started firing like the son of Kane
I saw civilians runnin' for their life
Like the devil on judgement night running from Christ
Ice and Amaretto please as I fell to my knees
Being shot by Ferguson the vigilante

In the year of the dragon lots of men disappear
Quiet as it's kept they won't be back next year

Clef it kind of remind me of this chick I once knew
Use to be a dime now she's strung out in Bellevue
See the serpent played tricks run game like the Knicks
Build you up just to lose the championship
I seen her reminisce over Wu-Tang could It Be that Simple
She lost her Prince cause there were Thieves In the Temple
Tragic depression made her lose all her teeth
Lost and turned out gave her body to the streets
Sweet Mary don't you weep
Still waters run deep
So be careful of the company you keep

In the year of the dragon lots of men disappear
Quiet as it's kept they won't be back next year",Year of the Dragon,1997

Without you, when you're gone

How long can you stand the heat

Runnin' up in niggas cribs like I paid the bill
Make you squeal the combination to the safe for wealth
I lace your grill with the fire starter
Hit your wife with the ? from the ? shower powers I devour?
I'm all about the fundamentals, like Pun and pencil
A piece of paper, a decent caper and someone to strafe you
My mental's compatible with the radicals
My oddessey type, qualities allow me to poli' with animals
Niggas is canibals and the ghetto's a jungle
Where you either bet all your bundles or struggle on the simple and humble
My niggas'll rumble with any man for a Benny Fran
Try to imagine what they can sacrifice for twenty grand
Niggas'll slice you and dice you into a thousand pieces
And pound out we jettin' to the ground Uptown
Up in the Boogie Down, ? swallow the team, pile on the green
Surrounded in green like flowers in Spring
For now I'm a King, so it's more than money, all the honies
Used to call me Punny 'cause my fam was always hungry
But now we rollin lovely, and you feel worse, want my money
Let your steel burst, 'cause I'd rather see you in hell first

[Chorus: x2]
Mucho trabajo poquito dinero
I'm selling perrico
Yo what's the deally yo?
I'm Uptown making moves just like Castro

Yo, yo, yo keep the lights keep the camera all I want is the action
The battle's on, where I roam in composition
A hardcore crowd, waitin to see, if I break
Like your first time in jail when you got fucked by an inmate
It'll never happen, I'm on balance like a Libra
And if I get murdered, Don't Cry For Me Argentina
Pour me a cup of vodka, bury me next to my father
In three days, I rise like Christ and still sober
Now my eyes open, in my hands I got the Gatling
I'm looking for the guy that sent me to say hi to Satan
Fists of fury, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry
I turn Mr. Rogers Neighborhood topsy turvy
Foes and enemies meaning the same in the dictionary
This ain't Pictionary, all you see is the cemetary
Bodies, from World War I and II is there
You don't want a third war, that's nuclear warfare
So Big Pun, count the stacks, make it fast
Illegal money turns legal now we runnin' a laundromat
Your hunchbacked and wack rap is packed in your backpack
Your better off in D.C. with the mayor smoking crack
Yo, this ain't a diss, Wyclef bomb threat
Run out of the building or get blast in your Guess
Tec for Tec, or we can go text for text, oh
I forgot, you don't read, so take this hole in your chest, blaow
Hide the blood, give you the gun, run and hide
So when the DT shows up, he thought it was a suicide
Suicide it's a suicide

I'ma push you further back than your hairline recedes
New York City, don't get it confused
Your song will last as long as your part in ""Krush Groove""
Body moves, the battles, bullets, the lesson
You write about being a veteran, but not a legend
Back from the war with thirty-two medals of honor
You claimin' underground but never been to Bobbito the Barber
Gimme them medals back, since you forgot how to rap
Call DJ Bobcat and ask him where them old records at
Like Channel Five karate, my kick is gonna reach ya
A new episode where the student kills the teacher
Any last words before I send you to your dream?
Hold my hands and pray

You don't got knowledge yourself
So you don't know what that mean, a'ight?
Who suped you up to do the record in the first place?
It lacked taste, you get ""The Gas Face"" like 3rd Bass

Lickin' Lyles, Lickin' Labels, lickin' they balls

I worked too hard, for this life is serious
This ain't bulls-eye, I ain't your target practice

Yo, this my question

What's your question?

What's Clef got to do with this, got to do with this?
What's Clef?
I'm not a Bob Marley impostor
What's Clef got to do with this, got to do with this?
Tell your ghost writers, ""Go write something better""

If you need help, try, try again
Try again

Guess who? Uh-oh, uh-oh
Here we go-o, uh-oh
Every two records you do scenario
You get the best MCs, how? To rhyme first
Of course you rap last, so you can show off your skirt
I guess it didn't work on ""4 3 2 1""
You got out done by Canibus the young gun
Your last weapon, is to call out Wyclef Jean
Not knowing that you callin' fire for your cremation
Jammin' and cool, sumpthin' like you
Jamaicans say, ""L.L. a fool""
Kids wet too who do the pool
Let bells ring like Sunday school
L.L. Cool J is hard as hell?
So hard at night he's Jezebel
I heard the teller, Himmemel
How you think he wrote the song?
Rock the bells!

Yo, Clef
I know you got styles, but get back to the issue kid
This is real!

Yo, don't get me angry, like the Hulk, I'll turn green
Your marriage is a cover up, 'cause you use Vaseline
Fun love of hip-hop, these lyrics got you steamed
Knowing damn well that bad men don't wear g-strings
Another side of Clef, the face you won't seein' oppressed
I even got the Devil worshippers sayin', ""God bless""
You star struck, and I'ma buck you like Carlito
And when they say, ""Who did it?,"" you tell them Benny Blanco
Wyclef, preacher's son, check the revelation
Polygram buy Def Jam for twenty million
MCA buy Polygram for eleven billion
I come to Sony and get pimped by the Haitian-Sicilians
And I'll even, get you an ad in ""The Source""
You'll be the first rapper selling products for hair loss
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
The return of Jack the Ripper was only to meet his death
The next time, you wanna dis me for kicks
Get off my dick, go somewhere and lick your lips, bitch!

If you need help, try, try again
Try again

Rest in peace!

What's Clef got to do with this, got to do with this?
What's Clef?
I'm not a muscle man impostor
What's Clef got to do with this, got to do with this?
Watch what you ask for, 'cause you just might get it

Yo, this is Naomi Campbell chillin' with Wyclef
I just wanna tell you L.L., your record is wack
L.L., why don't you just give up?

If you need help, try, try again

Hey, yeah
Ooh

Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place, another time
Touching many hearts along the way, yeah
Hoping that I'll never have to say
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go (illusion)

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Follow your emotions everywhere
Is there really magic in the air?
Never let your feeling let you down
Open up your eyes and look around
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go (illusion)

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Can it be a picture in my mind?
Never sure exactly what I'll find
Only in my dreams I'll turn you on
Here for just a moment then you're gone
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go (illusion)

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again (yeah, yo, yo, yo)

Hey, yo I don't write love songs leave it up to Luther Vandross
How I choose to live, you don't wanna know the cost
I paid to be the boss, hear it straight from the source
Fortune 500 is how I like to gloss
High side, Korneesh Style, joy ride
Blowin' candles in the wind like Princess Di
Get at me, mom, tell me how you really like it
'Cause we could fly high, I'll be your co-pilot

Hey, yo back to the girl with all the razzamatazz
(Hey, yo, I love you shorty) You talkin' all that jazz

Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go
I know you want me but you play me like the lotto
Use and abusin' so there won't be no friction
I gotta leave, I can't be in this illusion

Oh, oh (It's just an illusion)

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Another one from Jerry Wonder
Another one from Thirty Cash

Every two records you do scenario 

You get the best MCs, how? To rhyme first 

Of course you rap last, so you can show off your skirt 

I guess it didn't work on ""4 3 2 1"" 

You got out done by Canibus the young gun 

Your last weapon, is to call out Wyclef Jean 

Not knowing that you callin' fire for your cremation 

Jammin' and cool, sumpthin' like you 

Jamaicans say, ""L.L. a fool"" 

Kids wet too who do the pool 

Let bells ring like Sunday school

Yo, don't get me angry, like the Hulk, I'll turn green 

Your marriage is a cover up, 'cause you use Vaseline 

Fun love of hip-hop, these lyrics got you steamed 

Knowing damn well that bad men don't wear g-strings 

Another side of Clef, the face you won't seein' oppressed 

I even got the Devil worshippers sayin', ""God bless"" 

You star struck, and I'ma buck you like Carlito 

And when they say, ""Who did it?,"" you tell them Benny Blanco 

Wyclef, preacher's son, check the revelation 

Polygram buy Def Jam for twenty million 

MCA buy Polygram for eleven billion 

I come to Sony and get pimped by the Haitian-Sicilians 

And I'll even, get you an ad in ""The Source"" 

You'll be the first rapper selling products for hair loss 

The W-why-see-L-E-F, Wyclef

Hey kids, gather around, it's Wyclef and Melky Sedeck
I got a story to tell, heeeeeeere we go

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be at the party gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose

Hey yo, hey yo, my pen's in my hand, what should I write next?
Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect call from Jeff
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""
""Yo, I got bad news""
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the ill street blues
""The friends will make you, then too can break you
They plan an execution like Fu Man Chu""
""Who?""
""You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)""
""Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you""
""Hey yo, your cousin Rohann...""
""Uh-huh""
""Who used to sell bang""
""Uh-huh""
""DT's found his hand in the back of Binnigans...""
""What?""
""In a plastic bag with a note attached""
""Saying what?""
""A million and a half or he won't be back""
""So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp""
""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?
I jumped into my car, there's gotta be a joke
Traffic's backed up, who's in town, the Pope?
S-s-s-s-someone blew the horn, I turned and looked left
To my surprise, it was my sis, Melky Sedeck

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be at the party gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose

You're shootin' in the opposite position
I'm thiniin', ""Should I fire or hold back on ammunition
On your wig transition?""
My mission, like Take 6, is to spread love
But all you screwed mugs got me wearin' black gloves
You up in my face, I see the fear in your eyes
You wanna feel the pain like a grown man gettin' circumcised
Shalom, shalom, pardon my left
But my right hand's on your throat, massaging you to death
You provoke the cycle, call Michael
You're lookin' in the mirror, well, I'm in your window, oh oh
You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple
Like the colour, you holler, ballin' for your mother
No-one hears you even though you knock
You used to walk around the block with the daily rock
Things done changed since your spark got hot
Now you got your knot wocked with your very own glock

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car

He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be witcha girl gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your goose

Yo what's this I hear about the police in Brooklyn? 
Turn this jam up, yo, yo 
This the type of jam that be getting no airplay 
I want the whole world to hear this joint right here, yo 
This the type of jam that be getting no airplay 
You asked for it buddy, here it comes 

One two, watch out for the man in blue 
Three four, I keep it raw and hardcore 
Five six, you're beating us with nightsticks 
Seven eight, I'm forced to pack a thirty-eight 
Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could 
Do it all again, I'd probably bust your chin 

I'm from a land of black bats, alley rats and cats 
Scratch up my car, set me up for the carjack 
Under pressure, I gotta leave the gat 
Two straps, a total of sixteen caps 
Say something positive? No positivity 
More positivity, more positivity brutality 
Thugs get angry, the violence increase 
You want peace, make Wyclef chief of police 
Riding through the hood, it's the same ol story 
It's either you play ball or you drug dealy dealy 
Standin' on the block when the spot get hot 
Guaranteed to get set up, by a crooked cop 
So I'm sittin' back, rhymin' on instrumentals 
Anything I touch, it turns monumental 
Me and Jerry Wonder, we keep it credible 
For the streets, at the same time, we gotta eat 
When we commercialize it's to enterprise 
We guarantee to sell a hundred mil before we die 
But Jerry is broke, that's the situation 
Nine-seven, it's like no more eviction 
No more war milk, no more government cheese 
Police keep on shootin' at our bulletproof Bentley 

Yo this the type of jam that be getting no airplay 
The Brooklyn Bridge about to collapse, apocalypse 
This the type of jam that be getting no airplay 
The ghettoes are fed up, we got the arms in the air

Seven eight, I'm forced to pack a thirty-eight

Yo bust this 
Forty caliber, seventeen through your character 
Waterworld's world, underwater, Sub Mariner 
Derringer, twenty-two one in the challenger 
Seven, four-eight, 23rd on the calendar 
My word verses, burst raps you rap nervous 
It's worthless, you get smashed up, on the surface 
Projectile, my forty-four style, blood on silver 
The red ripper, fill up the reservoir nigga 
Armageddon, you smack dead on, a world crisis 
The nicest, for sixteen bars, of preciseness 

One two, watch out for the man in blue 
Three four, I keep it raw and hardcore 
Five six, you're sticking me with nightsticks 
Seven eight, I'm forced to call Canibus 
Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could 
Do it all again, I'd probably bust your whole chin 

You got a gat nigga, use it, go 'head pull it 
Scientists got raw footage of me dodgin' bullets 
I walk the streets with heat, three biscuits 
Outnumberin' niggaz twin glocks with triplets 
When I spit shit I lace it, you get punched in face with 
Puncutations of five-knuckle phrases 
I assure you the vocalist standin' before you 
Will destroy you with temperatures hot enough to flame broil you 
My tongue moves much faster than yours do 
Every three thousand styles I change my voiceboxes oil 
Embarrass you in front of your crew to annoy you 
If you know some chicks that suck a good dick, then I'll employ you 
To this hip-hop shit, Canibus stays loyal 
That's why every Killuminati I battle somebody for you 
I'm warnin' you, me versus you, I hurt you 
My balance enables me to square dance in a circle 
Your head'll spin so fast you'll catch whiplash 
I practice lyrical witchcraft on your bitch ass 
Make your hard drive crash to see colon backslash 
Go back to the roots and reprogram your wack ass, nigga 

One two, watch out for the man in blue 
Three four, I keep it raw and hardcore 
Five six, you're sticking us with nightsticks 
Seven eight, I'm forced to pack a thirty-eight 
Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could 
Do it all again, I'd probably bust your whole chin

I'm lookin' for my wifey 
Cats always love me, till they girls start to like me 
They don't know I'm sheisty, and all my jewels icy 
Tryin' to settle down Ma, stop actin' all feisty 
Cause 'I don't want to be a playa no more' 
Know it's soft, but I came with a core 
For the love of Money, Charli, whoa It Ain't My Fault 
Like Silkk, it's so timid, my trunk, it go wit' it 
The whole Squad is Terrorin', cats is No Limit 
And I'm a diplomat, I'm a diplomat 
Where my honies at? Where my money at? 
That's why we act like that

Hot as hell, I'm trickin' in 
Shorties sharp as nails, the official chick 
Reppin' Uptown to Harlem World, where we at 
I'm up coughin' in the ambulance 
From way downtown, they got the Horses and the Carriages 
For forty bucks, you can ride and get ya hug on 
Another twenty, puff lye and get ya crush on 
It's all love, just like the Bud when ya hit it 
Cause way downtown, you know the fuzz is tryin' to hear it 
So when ya spark, ya make sure it's in the dark 
And most importantly, stay away from Central Park 
Cause cops live, just to put away a thug 
But not today, cause me and my baby in the Cabaret of Love

Like Lil' Kim, didn't know they had it in me 
Don't you know don't you know, we pull up from a show 
Cam and chrome bag the hos, in Prada bags all the dough 
And caked out, break out, uh

How we handle them dumb dumb's

And I'm down girl, but I could ball with or without the chick

Now I ain't the C-E-O, but I ain't far from it 
So if I ain't far from C-E-O 
That mean I ain't far from havin' C-E-O money 
Can't discuss what I'm worth, but I'm worth this much

I asked her what's her name, she said, 'Guantanamera'
Remind me of an old latin song, my uncle used to play
On his old forty-five when he used to be alive
She went from a young girl, to a grown woman
Like a Virgin, so she sex with no average man
Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide

To no sele-xion, smooth complex-ion
The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the Grounds to Apollo
and then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power
Sweet persona, Venus Flytrap primadonna
Que sera que sera she turned dinero to dinera

And take him shoppin to the Bahamas, and hide with mobsters

And I didn't want the Marvin route

You want to tip? 
Don't let them pimp you like Goldy

Is as hard as these four walls I wanna break
I told the cops you wasn't here tonight
Messin' around with me is gonna get you life
Oh yeah, yeah
But everytime I look into your eyes
Then it's worth the sacrifice

If this is the kind of love that your mom used to warn you about
Man, we are in trouble 
You're in real big trouble 
If this is the kind of love that the old folks used to warn me about 
I'm in trouble 
I'm in real big trouble
You got anything to say, girl?

Someone please call 911, yeah yeah (pick up the phone yo)
Tell them I just got shot down
And it's piercin through my soul (I'm losin blood yo)
Feel my body gettin cold

Someone please call 911 (can you do that for me)

Wyclef Jean,"Yo this is the Rock kicking it with the Refugee camp
And you're bout to smell what the Rock is cookin'

Yo this is strictly a club record
Dedicated to everybody who used to stand outside in the cold
When the F-L-E-X was spinnin at the Red Zone, hooded down
And these tired bouncers would not let me in
YouknowwhatI'msayin?

Yo, yo, yo
I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies
(It doesn't matter!)
I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees
(It doesn't matter!)
I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin

Back in the days it was all about the clubs
And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love
The girls, they wouldn't say HEY!
Unless you bought 'em champagne like it was they birthday
Me, I used to stand outside
Hustlin my way in I'm on the guest list plus five!
Who's performin tonight?  He said Shabba
Mister Lover Daddy he be the selector
(Stop drop the Rock's up in here)
Disrespect emcees and catch a smack in your left ear
Light up like Vegas when it's time to gamble
Girls scream for me like I was part of the Beatles
But I'm not honey, but I could be your Paul McCartney
and ""Ebony or Ivory"" into my Jacuzzi
Foundation like Kool Herc, or DJ Red Alert goes bezerk
The needle ain't skip the record jerked
Cause y'all jumpin' too hard
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies
(It doesn't matter!)
I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees
(It doesn't matter!)
What? I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio
(It doesn't matter!)
Yo cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin
Yo Rock I just bought a fresh Bentley
(It doesn't matter you just bought a fresh Bentley!)

How many of y'all ever been to a barbecue
And you always got an aunt or uncle
wanna show you how the old dances go
And they start it off like this
Electric slide on the dance floor
Freaky-deaky like Studio 54
GIRLS!! Until the IRS raids it
Drug money get converted into music
The dope man becomes an entertainer
Leave that crack alone! I told the customers
I'm into bigger and better things Mr. Fiend
You want a hit? Give me a guitar and a drum machine
And the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump
I can smell it in the air, the smell is funk
Excuse me I gotta cough
Girl you wearin' so much ice you could freeze New York
You're man must really love you, what does he do for a living?
(He works on Wall Street he's only home two nights a week)
That's when she said a little too much conversation
Think she want to indulge in lyrical masturbation
So I proceeded with the conversation, I said
Can I offer you a glass of Merlot Mrs. No Name?
(Let's get it straight huh, my name's Veronica)
She had the ass the size of South America
She said ain't you that kid that sing Guantanamera
way before Ricky Martin sung ""Livin' La Vida Loca""
What hood you come from?
I was raised in Brooklyn, but did my studies in Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem yup, that's short for New Jersey
Checked my watch it was a quarter to three
Slid to her crib when we opened the door
Her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44

Now what it look like, it ain't really that
(It doesn't matter!)
So he cocked the gat at my top hat
(It doesn't matter!)
Are you crazy? You was married!
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in your hood and they take everything you wearin

Yeah that's when shorty walked up to her man
And she said I gotta go I can't be here no more
And she said this

Take me home, to the place
I belong at the Refugee Camp
And the Booga basement
That's where I live, oh

Come on
Yo Rock I sold like seventeen million records
(It doesn't matter how many records you've sold!)
Alright I'm with you, yo check it out
You wanna go get diamond rings?
(It doesn't matter if the Rock wants to go get diamond rings or not!)
Man listen, listen
I just got two new Grammy's man
(It doesn't matter about your Grammy's!)

Wyclef Jean,"Yo 
As the universe expands 
I contemplate whether it was God or the Big Bang that made man 
Sometimes I wonder how come 
We can't live without guns 
What would of been the outcome if the South won 
Think about that son 
What in the hell caused the assassination of Malcolm 
The federal communications commission listens to politicians in the position 
To Make certain decisions like puttin minorities in prison 
To decimating the population of women 
It's called socialism 
From the United States to the United Kingdom 
Aahhkk, spit into the sky and extinguish the sun, but how come 
 
In the future 
The location is planet Earth 
The time and date is 1999, December 31st 
11:59 p.m., the anticipation of what I think's 
About to happen got my heartbeatin 
We got less than a minute left before the planet Jupiter 
Is united into a star 
I know it sounds bizarre but it's mathematics 
A specific sign for some of the planet's inhabitants 
Those who understand know what I'm sayin is accurate 
Our country is corrupt from the president to the cabinet 
In the year 2, followed by three 0's 
The space probe Galileo, will welcome us all to channel zero 
But how come",How Come?,2000

I serenade the girls with my accoustic guitar
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, fellas havin' problems with the chicks?
I want you right now to turn the lights down low
Pull your girl up next to you
I want you to sing this to her

If death comes for me tonight, girl
I want you to know that I love you
And no matter how tough I wouldn't dare
Only to you I would reveal my tears
So tell the police I ain't home tonight
Messin' around with you is gonna get me life

And Flex couldn't save you even if he dropped a bomb in this

I'm a fiend for the S-500 I want it
Used to stay high and blunted, but all that had to stop
Chick like me be chasin' after cops
And they don't stop at my block after the Diallo shootin'
Soldiers in waitin', marksmen recruitin'
Salutin', thug confederates, rhyme and reason
Time and treatin', Air Force One we leavin'
Panama red, holdin' 52 hands for ransom
My man Johnny Handsome, itchin' to cancel 'em
I'm like hold up, wait a minute, let's get down to business
We could shoot up everything soon as the deal is finished
Blah, blah, I got two hours to kill
We want like 5 mil in a private jet so peel

Supreme see been after mean figures, ask my lil' nigga
Since back in the days, before he was raised
Ain't nobody puttin' fear in my heart, who need a jump start
My art sharp, shoot your posse apart
Nigga take you on one by one, gun by gun
Son by son, done by done
Whoever come murder fest, one of the best
I'm gettin' assets, collect ass bets, squat by your address
I come to kick it wit' you, walk beans stickin wit' you
Why try to hide from accomplice vibe
Yo we break bread, break heads, my people shake feds
Gamble and scramble, F what your man do
It's all about this husltin' game, muscle and fame
Tussels in rain, take aim, blush you with game
My language is unexplainable, switch, changeable
And I stay remaindable, with bigger guns aimed at you

Keys they goin' in the trunk

Fiends they don't give a uh

I run up in Da Cypha heavily armed with endless bars of metaphoric harm
A python with poisonous charm, extending my arm
Pushing figures way to the back
Out of your reach, excessive like Fatal Attract
Freeze, a renegade bar stroke, an ace of spades
I'll kiss you wit' a blade when I think I'm gettin' played
Made woman, you never in bed with the same woman
You say you want it, you don't want to see the omen
When my sixth sense start flowin' I bless like holy water
I don't want to die 'cause I'm my daddy's only daughter
But yo, sometimes I see the writin' on the wall
You know the ghetto testaments, the shootouts, the brawls
Close frames in the hall, will you stand or will you fall
Your whole click is on the run now would you tell it all
About the night shifters, me, I'ma cypher drifter
My sixteen bars is up so peace to the mixes

October 31st I was standing by the sour
These thugs don't want to talk they want these Pumas I just bought
Fresh outta school, picked on 'cause I'm bilingual
I barely spoke English but the gun language was universal
Ran in the grocery store, spoke to Gabriel
He said, you have problems, here's a feezy from Israel
Ran back outside, just before I could say another homicide
Threw the biscuit in the bushes runnin' like Jesse Owens
Police showed up, but I was nowhere in existence
Back in the crib thinkin' bout what I just did
I'ma police of defense but I'm bound to catch this bid
My hypothesis was right, they knocked the door, homie
Like a super in the projects wantin' rent money
Just when I thought I get my life straight in the states
Is when I found myself climbin down the fire escape
Bodies found in Virginia under the dumpsters, no
18 shell cases in front of the grocery sto'
Flee the scene of the crime before y'all kick the door
No your honor that must be some old rhyme that I wrote
And lyrics sometime man they misinterpretate it
For example when I say gun I mean my pen and paper
And every time I wave and spit the crowd jump
'Cause I'm still Digital Underground like ""humpty hump""
Feel the funk comin' through your elephant trunks
I ain't even ""Kriss Kross"" my clothes yet
And yet y'all want to ""Jump, Jump"" in Da Cypha, ""Jump, Jump""

Underground hip-hop yo (*foreign singing*)
This one's a gangsta tune, whassup fosha?
I'mma send this one out to all the refugee gangs around the world
Signal, signal, y'all need to chill with the drive-by's
It was the fourth of July I heard the cherry bomb bang
Stay in the house that's the sound of the gangs, clef
By the time we figured out what happened
I was in an ambulance tellin' my cousin keep breathing

Don't wear your colors here, that cemetery gear
I got my gun and nine, killing's my appetite

Don't wear your colors here!

True, true, yo hollywood got a lot of kids twisted
Jumpin' in and out of limo's thinkin' is his ass really gifted
The only gift y'all possess is workin' with the triple six's
Y'all disguise yourself with bandanas and diamond necklaces
Mosta y'all can't even go back to the hood where y'all grew up
Actin like y'all drink alcohol and all y'all do is throw up
Talk about when y'all blow up y'all gonna visit the project floors
But the last time they saw y'all was 1984
Now y'all wonder, why they got on hoodies screamin' ""freeze""
Get out the navigator, godfather iii in the dvd
They hop in, they take your car for a spin
It's cold outside so all you feel is the wind
There's no cell-y phone, so you can't phone home
Oh lord, here come those criminals maleek & jerome
(""yo, who you know here, you got family over here?"")
He a rap artist
(""I don't care, he got the wrong colors over here, no fear"")
Now you look shook like that mobb deep song
I'm surprised, cause on all y'all records you was al capone
And come to find out that you never held a chrome
And you escaped the draft and never bust a shot in vietnam
Now you standin' in the form amongst the children of the corn
Like the son of man stood with a crown made of thorns
The only difference is for you there'll be no resurrection
Cause it's a traffic jam, they got you locked up in a intersection

Don't wear your colors here, that cemetery gear
I got my gun and nine, killing's my appetite
(but that ain't right y'all)
Don't wear your colors here! (colors)
That cemetery gear (chicago, chicago)
I got my gun and nine from hollywood, to your neck of the hood

Yo, hollywood has half-man be hollow to you
How could you have slipped through
While I was detecting the trick that's in you
Pretending you pitbull, when really your candy-ass is poodle
We wouldn't of hit you, hammers have already been
Cocked and cleaned, yo, it was who?
It's click-up, click-up, north cackus, commence to stick up
That's what's within us, cack and lack, clap, buck killers quicker
Stick up the forest misters then head up to chickens with 'em
Adrenaline's givin', when I riff with the fifth to your chin-in
You never knew bout how we play these innings
But you about to play the commission
Waves are spinning, I'm out the glaze I'm sh...ing
The real is missing but the fraud is evident
Ever so clear, but you got the nerd to come around here with pounds of fear
Your colors wrong you must rock edible dons with that huh?
Damn paul, what's that huh?
Let me get that, with the quick snatch
If it's a little man in you then I better put the trick back
And if it's anything killers is fearing, I know my clit stacked for realer

Don't wear your colors here, that cemetery gear
I got my gun and nine, killing's my appetite
(but that ain't right y'all)
Don't wear your colors here! (colors)
That cemetery gear (detroit, detroit)

Cuz ""My Love's Your Love"" will be my slugs wit blood
For any thug that wanna bang and play orangutang
Find yourself in the river with the rest of them
Wake up, wake up, I'm in a nightmare dream
Where I found myself loadin magazines after magazines
Ski mask on my face, gun on my waist
Fine pens shakin in my hand as I write this next line
You look strange, shootin victims at close range
And saw his vein burst from his neck, as I snatched his chain
Is this a Bible, I used to read the Gospel
Until I got betrayed by one of my twelve disciples
Which one, look through the crowd son
You could spot the traitor wit a tatto on his arm
The symbol is a microphone, an intellectual
A wannabe Rakim, but too extraterrestrial
I heard he's lethal and I'm too rusty to battle him
Me being rusty is like Biggie not being ""Born Again""
It never happen, watch who you call fam
On MTV, he painted himself as the tin man
Predicted platinum, way before it happened
So that's why when you ship gold, you only sold aluminum

Enough of this rap stuff, Sedeck take his watch
If I wasn't rappin, I'd take that stash in your left socks
Don't make me raise my voice cuz I'm masterin a coo
So, and besides when they find you you'll be bones
Mom say watch my peers, hangin like chandeliers
Orderin Don P, you couldn't pay for one beer
Perpetratin, a fraud, oh god, you aint hard

You want Wyclef Jean, bring your same thug guys
Here's my advice, leave the ring with your bride
Cuz you aint comin back no more
We gon send you to a vacation for two, with crabs on the seashore
You freeze up, hold up I really thought you was psychotic
Is that tears in your eyes? You cryin for your life
Kid you tellin me what you did, you didn't wanna do
Watch what you say on record cuz it might come true

However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts
Your body carried out the church
Mom, she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin... (oh my baby!)
They shoulda took me first
However you want it, you don't want it, cuz when you get it it hurts

Mmmm mmmm, fo' real
You know, you messed up, I'm not laughing
All y'all beats is soundin the same, y'all rhymin the same
Some of y'all even wearing the same jewelry
And y'all doin the same videos
Shut up, you know you messed up right?
That's why they brought me back in this game
To bring it right back to the essence, mmm hmmm
Oh yeah, and all this kill this, kill that, kill this
Lemme tell you somethin, [what, what]
The real killers, they're standin right over there
Waitin for you to act like a killer, so they can kill you
Yo Sedeck, do me a favor yo
Yo tell everybody on this side of the stage
To just move back a little cuz it's about to get real rowdy
in the front yo, they comin yo
I could never forget the underground hip hop
I'ma dedicate this to everybody that knew me when I was broke
Workin at Burger King, hustlin dime bags on a twelve speed bicycle
All the projects man, youknowwhatimsayin?
Yo

Every time I keep pullin out, y'all keep pullin me in, sin
Kick a little somethin for the New Jerusalem
Let people know you aint forget where you came from, 
where you came from
Every time I keep pullin out, y'all keep pullin me in, sin
Kick a little somethin for the street DJs
Let people know you aint forget where you came from, 
where you came from

Yo, yo this probably the hardest verse that I ever recite
I'm in the studio with a gun in my neck it's all right
Surrounded by gangsters, I don't know how they got here
But I feel like the Haitian Frank Sinatra, in his young years
New York, on my way to Kennedy airport
L.A., I was told wear colors wherever you walk
Dirt, dirty south, I heard they run up in your house
Shakespeare, no time to jive blast your girl through the blouse
What? MCs, y'all aint nothing but assassins
Every two lines is killin, or incarceration
Murderation, closed casket cremation
Closest you got to prison was seein barson television
But I'ma go long as this thug phenomenon
Pass me a bandanna, two shots from my Mag-num
All of that, to get your attention
Here's a few things I been dyin to mention
Anyone talk about guns, I'ma buy the cartel
Any more beats soundin the same, I'ma put your MPC to cell
Listen, reminiscing on Nas, ""It Aint Hard To Tell""
Still feel like somebody's watching me like Rockwell
Talk about diamonds, I'ma kidnap Jacob
Talk about the Fugees, I'ma break up the make up
Put your stake up, I'm about to work my way back to the streets
And y'all wanna bootleg cuz y'all will get Jay-Z

Every time I keep pullin out, y'all keep pullin me in, sin
Kick a little something for the projects Clef
Let people know you aint forget where you came from, 
where you came from
Every time I keep pullin out, y'all keep pullin me in, sin
Kick a little something for the hip hop fans
Let people know you aint forget where you came from, 
where you came from

Hip hop fans, y'all like the woman in my house
No matter how faithful I am, y'all still have your doubts
Talkin bout, is he real in this relationship
Or did he go pop, and on the side get a mistress
My mistress is a guitar, classical like Mozart
Paint murder on the wall just to show y'all some art
And y'all wanna start, and lose body parts
I suggest you start walkin, tell your man stop talking
You know the scenario, the innocent is always the first to go
And Dorothy sings somewhere over the rainbow
Kum Ba Ya, got you trapped in barbed wire
Dope delivery, but I'm the ghost writer
Tall tribes of Juda, deeper than books
Watch what you cook cuz you might get hooked
Man... I miss real MCs
Like Kool G Rap, written in graffiti
Before the plane, I used to take the train
Watch fiends puttin up they vein, moms raisin caine
Able's on the roof, cook like a goose
To calm my nerve, I drink Vodka 180 proof
I'm back in the shack, lay flat on my back
Two choices, sell rap or sell crack
Chose sell rap, but watch my back like I'm sellin crack
Cuz the music industry is the same street format
I sold y'all Nappy Heads, to The Score, to The Carnival
But yet y'all still wanted more
Since Sedeck went back, came off wit a break
I blend so perfect, that you would want it for your mixtape

Every time I keep pullin out, y'all keep pullin me in, sin
Kick a little something for the brothers up north
Let people know you aint forget where you came from, 
where you came from
Every time I keep pullin out, y'all keep pullin me in, sin

Yea, oh!
Check me out, look
It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain
Four albums in the can and I'm still in the game (what up?)
And last album, they don't like me to tell this
Debuted at number one and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)
That's what they telling me, switch up your melody
Through with misdemeanors, they trying to give rappers felonies
So they can lock us up one at a time
But true writers stay free in every one of our lines
And if you not feeling I'm the cream of the crop
I'll knock rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!
Still you looking at a man that's financially stable
Only nigga getting checks cut from four different labels
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as fuck
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody
It's cause I'm thinking 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty
Me and shaka still starving and looking for meals
And heads up! Ludacris is almost out of his deal
I'm over ten million sold, every album is crack
And for now I'm bout to carry def jam on my back
Mad rappers I hear you talking way down at the bottom

I said ""Yo, girl let me talk to you real quick""

I don't pop pills, I never did no LSD
but I wouldn't mind a kiss from Ms. Mary

She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard
She's homegrown and you can get a kiss in her backyard

I remember when I was a young boy
I waited for my grandad, ""So daddy can I get a puff?""
He looked at me, he says ""Son, man, you're too young kid""
""When you get older now and you understand that""
""I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary""
'Cause

She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard
If she allows you to you can roll her up
She's homegrown and you can kiss her in her backyard
She's homegrown - I like to be with you Ms. Mary - in your backyard

That's when she looked at me and she said 
""Wyclef this' what I want you to do son""

Exhale - inhale
Inhale - exhale
Now hold it now
Inhale - exhale
Inhale - exhale

I'm homegrown and you can grow me in your backyard
I'm homegrown and you don't need to worry for my backyard

That's when I said, ""I'ma get in trouble, I gotta go girl""
This' what she said

Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher

I'm about to take it higher

(New York city y'all)  Police are at the door
the Magnum was by the ashtray
(Look at shorty y'all)  He bout to go out like Scarface

Until I heard WOOP WOOP, that ""Sound of Da Police"", should I pull over?
He had the dark shades on, but he ain't look like Stevie Wonder
His face was, pale and long - he looked like cold day in December
Now let me ask the truth or somethin - 
should I slow down and be a good camper?
I heard a young thug scream, 
""It depends what you got in the beamer!!""
Now I got two choices I could blast and become Most Wanted in America
Or I could slow down like the man in the Bronco 
and get Johnny Cochran to be my lawyer
Ohh Sonya, hit her on the Motorola
If I get locked up I ain't getting out 'til Tuesday
Cause this is Saturday, and it's a holiday

Wyclef Jean,"Uh huh, uh huh
Feels good to be back at the essence where it all started you know
Uh huh, uh huh
What up
Uh huh, uh huh
Turn up my headphones man, uh huh uh huh
I got a few things I want to tell the people out there
Yo, yo, yo

All I hear is Fugee this, Fugee that
Where Fugee At? I need Fugees to spit up on this track
Lauryn if you're listenin', Pras if you're listenin'
Gimme a call I'm in the lab in the Booga Basement
Y'all know my style, I'm still mini, money, mini, mini
It ain't all about the money

When I was hustler, two dogs by my side plus a black pistola
Loud MCs, feel the silencer
Y'all still rhymin, y'all cuckoo, I send cycles to Belvue
This ain't a sequel son, but I have you ""Scream 2"" (Ah!)
Real live cinema of the streets produced a junkie
Put back on your shirt man you lookin' like ET
You're cracked out, for dough, some blow on saxophone
You're rhymin' off beat even with help from my metronomes
See, y'all ain't MCs, you a CM
Common Motherfucker rhymin' about Lexus and Benz
The same Benz you got jacked in, drunk off of Gin
You woke up in hell gettin' sexed by Marilyn Manson
You lie, you deny, pass me the microphone
I guess like Eddie Murphy you was givin 'em a ride home
Yeah right, 25 mics, material in The Source
While your rap crew's on steroids lookin' like Full Force
Your girl she's buffed, puffed, in daytime don't play rough
The freaks come out at night so that's when I bring out the cuffs
Grand Marnier, CD player number two
Sade's in my bedroom singin ""sweetest taboo""

All I hear is Fugee this, Fugee that
Where Fugee At? I need Fugees to spit up on this track
Lauryn if you're listenin', Pras if you're listenin'
Gimme a call I'm in the lab in the Booga Basement
Y'all know my style, I'm still mini, money, mini, mini
It ain't all about the money

We used to rap, now y'all want to come and get me with a bat?
Y'all must be smokin' crack, with Pookie from New Jack
How could y'all forget, I'm the reason y'all MC
But y'all flip like Pharisees and charge me for blasphemy
You know who you are, eight bar superstar
Karate cars, buy up the bars with the credit cards
You want to impress some young chick you just met
First thing she say, ""Ain't you used to roll with Wyclef""
Look surprised, see your flesh outside your vest
Yeah you could fight, in the WWF
'Cause in this arena ain't nothin' but gladiators and haters
Hopin' they kill me and roll and feed me to the tigers
Oh Lord, protect me from the devil
They open the book of life, y'all readin' like the anti Christ
Your weak kid, stop lyin' to the public
You wanted it so bad that you took all the production credits
Some MC's in the underground, mad at me 'Cause I'm above ground
Counting English pounds
I tell ya what, success don't come overnight
I was in Noah's Ark for Forty days and Forty nights
Contemplatin' what should I write, what should I recite
'Cause ain't nobody here but thugs and chicks wit' ice
That's when I daydream into the twilight
Girls wit' they man, screamin' ""I hate life""
Baby girl look in the opposite direction
'Cause my class is the Misedu'

All I hear is Fugee this, Fugee that
Where Fugee At? I need Fugees to spit up on this track
Lauryn if you're listenin', Pras if you're listenin'
Gimme a call I'm in the lab in the Booga Basement
Y'all know my style, I'm still mini, money, mini, mini
It ain't all about the money",Where Fugees At?,2000

Yo, this is Whitney Houston
Yes massive this is the original vocalist 
I'd like to say rest in peace to Dennis Brown

If tomorrow is Judgment Day (light is in the air)
And I'm standing on the front line (aiyyo!)
Um, and the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I would say: ""Wyclef murdered a sound boy"" (yo, huh!)
If I wake up in World War III 
(If youo believe in the most high hands in the air!)
I see the destruction in poverty 
(East coast, west coast, hey, hey!)
And I feel like I want to go home (South side!)
It's okay, as long as Wyclef is with me
(North side, Jamaican, Caribbean, Haitian
Hands in the air, everybody, hey!)
My love is your dubbing, my dub is your dub
It will take eternity to break us
And the change of our start? (Listen to me!)
As myself is yourself
'Cause the refugee sound is the only sound
It will take eternity to break us
And a million sound boys will die before us 

This for the hardcore, before I had the record deal you kno what I'm sayin'?

Let's go
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in the cage

Whether you listenin' to hip hip-hop
Or you tuning to rock
Refugees on your box
We gonna take over your blocks

Let's go
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl 
Year after year
Runnin' over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here

(Yeah)

Whether you listenin' to rock
Or you're pumpin' the hip hip hop
Refugees on your box

Critics don't mistake this for just any cover tune
I'ma take y'all to the dark side of the moon
Kickin' in my mom's room, this song was just a thought
A young refugee labeled, just come with a passport
Dad used to tell me about the American dream
My dream was waking up in the projects
A young teen listening to hip hop
My brother tune me into rock
Put me up on Pink Floyd, a band from the British blocks

Yo, if you ain't never been to Hempstead
Then welcome, where chickens cluck cluck day and night

I see these chickens getting busy all up in my cage
I'm about to pluck two weeks
I'm up in my pay
Cluck, cluck, bodies rocking all up in my crib
Anybody want to know, the party's still sick
Somebodies knocking, knocking, knocking at my door
The same chick that you slept with
She played my minutes coming home from my bed
She said, after tonight, she got to be with the kids
The kids, the kids, the kids, kids, kids
I don't want to cause you complications
I just want one night of satisfaction
After tomorrow, we can act like nothing happened
Take this invitation
With the metro card at the train station

She said, I do, I do, I do, I what
She said, I do, I do cluck, cluck
She said, I do, I do, I do, I what

She said, after tonight, she got to be with the kids
The kids, the kids, the kids, kids, kids
I don't want to force you to stay if you don't want to stay
I just want to thank you, girl, for making my day
But just in case you change your mind
I got a king size bed with a bottle of wine
I'm bad for really because I knew she was comin'
And I didn't want to waste my time

[Wyclef Jean]
Yo, it's the innovator
In twenty years I'll be among the greats
Came in grimy
Now all my dogs are telling me
So all the cluckers want to know if I'm going to front them
When I flip out and turn into the werewolf of London
You all can't get no money even if you gave me money
You dig?
It's the iceberg slim philosophy
Wyclef, G and B up in your area
So many chickens fighting
It looks like riots in Africa

Yo, engineer turn me up, yo

I started off in the underground
From mono to stereo, now I'm surround sound
Blowing through your tubes, leaving holes through your speakers
Cracking through your tweeters, my frequency's off the meter
Jam packed arenas from here to Bangkok
I'm ahead of my time like Jimi Hendrix playing Woodstock
Me, I'm playing Hoodstock before I had the dreadlocks
I use to reminisce ""Should I do music or sell rocks?""
Wrote my own props, living in the PJ's
That's when the Angel Gabriel said ""It's all a Masquerade""
Eyes with no face, speakers with no lace
I feel that Earth's spinnin, but I'm standin in the same space
With no trace of what happened last night
I seen two fiends fighting over a crack pipe
Now I'm watching TV, my antennae was a close hanger
Blurry vision, Mister McGee Hunn, David Banner
Flip the data, the kids was wearin bandanas
Totin hammers aimin at your medulla oblongata
Blaow blaow, a young thug with a slim figure
Romantic type like the movie Casablanca
Herb seller, once but busted by an undercover
Buyer, my supplier was a Gypsy cab driver
That's when I realized I need to find a new hustle
Living in the jungle the guitar became my muscle
I strive through snake eyes who wanted me crucified
I thought that I was drowning but I was getting baptized
Now behold, I heard you sold 20 mill'
But with no street credibility, your overkill
You ain't real, talkin bout keep it gangsta
Phony, if you knew the gangstas sent me to shank you
Gank you, yank you, tie up your ankles
And if that ain't enough, I call Henchman's to lynch you
Now, at the funeral, I can see the Priest bless you
But in the after life, I'ma still touch you
Knockin on heavens door, your beggin to get in
That's when the son of man greets you with the face of Satan
Now you look frightened in the belly of the whale
That's when the warden say ""I want to welcome you to hell""
Fools, is 5 bucks, get off the phone, times up
I seen him cut from his head to his nuts
You wish you wouldn't, wish you couldn't, wish it got to me
Cause you screamin' so loud that a deaf man can hear
Back to the silence, no more droppin science
Er'body rappin about diamonds and violence
And A&R's, all they do is charge credit cards
And when the bill comes, they blame it on the rap stars
Now how you figure? I ain't rent a car
I wasn't at the spa, I ain't by the bar
Now here's a jewel when you get your first record deal
Don't subject yourself to the mass appeal
First Class, caviar in the vel'
In the new S Class with the Jordan wheels
Remember, the music industry is like the streets
You know the cold of the streets, er'body tryin to eat
The evidence is concrete, I'm tired of the same song
You take me how, you must be high off heroin
Sharper than I ever been, this one gon get a 10
Rappers, I'ma murder y'all with your own medicine
I move with faith, I never have doubt
I'm so hungry you will think I'm just coming out
But I been here before, from ""Blunted"" to ""The Score""
To ""The Carnival"", Ecleftic World Tour
I'm causin whores, waitin in the back doors
They want me to rock they boat and shift they more short
That's when the Father said ""Take heed to this lesson""
They want to cut your hair like Deliala did Sampson
I felt that, so I went back to my format
Raps and backpack, gats for carjacks
Hats for pussycats, cause Aids, I don't want that
And for the DJ's, here's something y'all can scratch
Technique 12, the needle hits the wax
Hypnotize the crowd, the dance floor is jam packed
Now sing along like a negro spiritual
No one got shot tonight, it's a miracle
What's this I hear, y'all want to take my spot?
You got a better chance putting a gorilla in a headlock
I'm too focused, I can see through your lens
You ain't a G, just a want to be, Kingpin so
""The next time, y'all want to pay for protection
I suggest that you hit up the Haitian Sicilians""

Uh, I'm outside looking in
I could feel it through the wind
From the streets' shore
I could see the shark's fin
They ain't eat nothing in a week
And they hunger is the reason why the blood drips on the concrete
So run your juice
Pit bulls drew
They gon shoot you in the head so what good is your bullet proof
Unless your bullet proof-la what's your affiliation
You just a rat handing out information
You wanna run and said Clef took my paper
Clef ain't take your paper
Clef is just a narrator
Think I'm a singer
I'ma have you call a operator
911 now you breaving through a respirator
All that gun-clapping yapping meet me outside
You never seen a ghost until you seen the other side
So think before you speak or blood is go leak
You shouldn't have no problems understanding
I ain't speaking Greek

I need a hundred grand
And I ain't talking bout no candy bar
Take over your strip like it's Kandahar
You gonna see so much red you think your man on Mars
That concrete that's under your feet goin' land on hard
I got goons that stand on guard
Post up waiting wit the toaster
Hit you from close up
Bare face
No black mask
No silencers
On the burners everybody hear the gat blast
Bodies found chopped up in black bags inside incinerators
I got power like generators
Slugs wit names on it
The message I send to haters
In my hood I'm know as a menace to neighbors
Me and my men for paper
We don't fear the morgue
Only thing we afraid of is we scared to starve
You can't stop the shine
Play a black cloud in my dollar signs and be a victim of a violent crime
For real

The flows is death defying
Act real and ya neck be flying
Brains and guts like I was saving private Ryan
Test the iron
And I show you a wall, cat
That's filled wit bodies
See where your balls at, if you all that
And I show a wall, cat, that's filled wit bodies
And yours could be the next
Number 19, erased out the projects
I progress everyday I'm living this life
I won't stop till I'm buried, dog
I'm living it right
Just gimme the price and I'm willing to take a chance
I keep it ass hard
Cause this sh? in my pants
And if you wanna dance you need to jump to these lyrics
You feeling the physical form as well as the spirit
Don't try to compare it
Just listen and love to hear it
And if it's fire you know not to come near it
I keep it flame broil enough to make your brains boil
Put you in a stash where nobody could say they saw you

Check, G.O.D. put it down like it's burning hot
Execute you on the spot no warning shot
Coming Timothy McVay I burn down your block
First I kick in your door cause in war we don't knock
I got no competition
Only man that could see me is the man in the mirror
Keep wishing
Keep fishing
Get a hundred and fifty stitches
Your last rights
Last meal
Last wishes

I spit ten words blow you to molecules
I'm under your skin cells and your hair follicles

I saw hip-hop became a MC
Then I saw the streets became a OG
Then I learn to see myself became G.O.D.

We get them packs off often
I'm on the block where it's scorching
The life that I live'll make you nauseous
Most of our niggas see a coffin
Most of our shit see abortions

And it's us against swine and they loosing they mind
In the van with my grind
And thirst to gimme time

make it anywhere else, man

Oh, what a night
Late December, 1993 (what happened?)
Who thought he would rule the industry?
What an MC on the grind

Yo, I ain't always have whips, I ain't always have yachts
I ain't always have chips, I ain't always have rocks
Matta fact I was a grimey little negro
Who said if music didn't work, I'd sell diesel
What cha'll thought, I wasn't raised in the projects?
First of the month waitin for that PA check
Lived on the first floor
Were so poor that if you rung the buzzer the roaches would answer the door (who is it?)
I went from boy to man in one night
When I saw my life flash like light from poltergeist
What made it worse, I couldn't speak English
But from his facial expressions, he wanted my Adidas
So hurry up and come out and play
I'll be damned if I leave bare-footed in this hallway
And I got big plans, so beg your pardon
Cause next year this time I'ma sell out the Garden

Yo, yo, I ain't gonna brag and boast and say I did it all
But I'm the only rapper to play Carnegie Hall
The first rap group, video cost a million
First rapper to ever rep for the Haitians
And sa fa say, na boolay
Grammy night, we took 3 away
22 million sold, I can't believe this
There's still ain't a rapper alive who could achieve this
But I ain't satisfied, when back to my home contemplating
How could I become the next Quincy Jones?
That's when Jerry hit me up on the horn and said
""Clef, your on the cover of
the cover of The Source by The Rolling Stones""
No more struggling, good life we loving it
You could live it too, if you only publish it
So here we go, so what's the scenario?

Whether you free or you going through incarceration
Inhale, exhale herbal meditation
Put the fire arms away
Cause we don't want no confrontation
Not me, I'm talkin bout you jerk
Cause when you die your life ain't even worth the paperwork
So, peace God, even through war we bring peace
And after the blood shed then your first son deceased
And you will understand I'm the beginning of the end
The alpha, omega, the present, and the future
So hold on to your Winchester
Cause the hollow tip penetrate lead through your polyester
Peace God, even though we ice the wrist
Guzzle the fifth
Protect us with a crucifix, Lord
And bless me with an extra clip
So just in case one jam release my twin from my waistband

[Chorus: x2]

Aye, yo peace God
I ain't tryin' to see the graveyard
But in this game of life I was dealt the wrong card
I wasn't born this way it just came to be
Sellin' crack through a alley where the fiends rally
Where the dealer was the president
And the fiend was the voter so they voted for the government
And stick ups was only natural
It seem every other day a new gun pointed at you
Peace God
Yo only God got the answer
And sorry bout ya mom dyin' of cancer
But congratulations, I heard you no longer a runner
You a big man now, the black Tony Montana
But watch out cause I heard wealth bring envy
Trust me I did sing for the Kennedies
Until we meet again feel my words through my pen
And stay pure in the city of sin

So I gotta rep for the PJ's

Bangin on the project walls, all day

Yo if it wasn't for the PJ's y'all probably never heard of me
Y'all be like, ""Who the hell is Wyclef, and what's a Fugee?""
I'd probably be standin on a corner, watch you approach
Steal ya dope, sell ya coke, then snatch ya rope
Run for brokes with the cash and the jewels
Bulls eye, I hold my breath when I shoot
The reason you should hold ya breath; 'cause most thugs
When they breathe and shoot tecs, they aim right but shoot left
Now they flesh being swept off the surface
If you ain't B.I.G. then you ain't Notorious
So why ya man reckless, side-ballin like he holdin heat
Someone bring him a bed, to the permanent sleep
Weight beneath Jacob's Latter and the Aftermath
Don't matter if you use a desert eagle as your armor
Blood splatter, glass shatter through the project slums
Another one in the obituary column son

So I gotta rep for the PJ's
The elevators with the pissy hallways

You can hear it in my speech, I'm from the PJ's
The PJ's! PJ's

Before I was signed, I used to move on the grind
All I wanted to do was rhyme, rhyme, rhyme
Line for line, I make the blind man walk in a straight line
To prison and take a message to Shyne
Peace God from the PJ's to Ground Zero
It's a ""Hardknock Life"" but ""The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow""
Walk with a shadow through ghettos, playin in every borough
You would think rap was rock they way I carry heavy metal
It such a shame, cocaine in ya veins, screamin
""Team Spirit"" grippin the shottie like Kurt Cobaine
In the projects God, nuttin come easy
Gotta deal with the grimy, greasy, the sleasy
Move like a professional, young thug funeral
What ya thought this was another Pepsi commercial?
Nah it's the art of war, when you least expected it
Wyclef the president, the PJ's elected him

So I gotta rep for the PJ's

You can hear it in my speech, I'm from the PJ's
The PJ's! PJ's

Yeah, and to the teachers that said I wouldn't live
And my remains would be found under the Verizano Bridge
Well I'm alive teach! So put ya theory to rest
I ain't Makaveli but I might fake my death
Make no mistake, I'm a hip-hop artist
Before the diamond in the Billboard, the hood charted it
Surburbia bought it, we bootlegged it, we couldn't afford it
'Cause in the PJ's we undergroudn like black markets
The 'P' stand for public housing
The 'R' is for respect that ya get, when ya hold down ya set
The 'O's for ounces that we flip into keys
The 'J's for the judgement handed by the ju-ry
The 'E' is for enter, at your own risk
You know the 'C' that's for the cats that's out to get rich
And the 'T'  trust no one
And the 'S' is for the snitches, you know the outcome

If you ain't treatin' your girlfriend right
Trust me when I tell you this
One day you won't be missed
Someone will replace your kiss
You want to be hardcore
Like the rapper Jadakiss
Or a thug like me will be up in your house
Cookin' breakfast in the morning
I know you heard these words before
But you never heard em quite like this
You gon' find yourself livin' all by yourself
Who woulda ever thought wit a stranger she would share her wealth
Now a stranger like me is lyin' under her sheets
This is a warning red alert emergency
If you can't find your girl that means she's here wit me
She said you had an argument
So I brought her roses
You know what comes next when the door closes
You don't like her smile
So you treat her foul
You only give her attention when I'm on the prowl
And now your guilty conscience got you actin' wild
And now you want to flip mode like you Busta Rhymes

This is a warning red alert emergency
If you can't find your girl she's at work wit me
Yo we eatin' brunch while you havin' lunch
You don't even call to see what she wants
You don't like her smile so you treat her foul
You only give her attention when I'm on the prowl
And now your guilty conscience got you actin' wild
And now you want to flip like you Busta Rhymes

This is a warning
It's a radar warning
My dogs I'm talking to you right now
You need to hold her and console her
Never, never, never be afraid to tell her that you love her

Get on the phone and call your girlfriend right now
You shoulda listened to her
Shoulda listened to her
You shoulda listened to her
Shoulda listened to her
Oh, you should listen to her
Sometimes you should listen to her
Take her out for dinner
Shoulda listened to her
Take her to the movies
Shoulda listened to her
She lookin groovy
Shoulda listened to her
That kinda girl ready
Shoulda listened to her
Yo you should listen to her
Shoulda listened to her
Sometimes just listen to her
Shoulda listened to her

Love ya baby, drive me crazy
Let me be your sugar daddy
Looked into my eyes
I was convinced
That he's real

Girlfriend 
Ever had a boyfriend
Looked to be your best friend
Turned out to be a one night stand

He loves me
He loves me not 
He screams my name in bed
Makes me feel so hot 
But once he's out the door
He's already forgot
The promises he made 
At the break of light
To love me
Protect me
Not leave me
Or hurt me

I was so foolish
And so blind to see
That all he wanted to do was to use me

Love ya baby, drive me crazy
Let me be your sugar daddy
Looked into my eyes
I was convinced
That he's real

I love him
I love him not
I still scream his name in my bed at night
But once he's out the door
He's already forgot
The promises he made
At the break of light
He said he's needing me, 
But he's misleading me
Sayin' he loves me,
But he's mistreating me

I was so foolish 
And so blind to see
That all he wanted to do was to use me

Love ya baby, drive me crazy
Let me be your sugar daddy
Looked into my eyes
I was convinced
That he's real

But don't feel sad, bad, mad
'Cause I've too been
Through the rain
And I can feel your pain 

Mama told me 
There'd be days like these
So I'm telling you ladies

Take me to the bridge, Sarah Connor!

Sitting in my room I'm all alone
My friends think I'm crazy
Cause I'm waiting for your call
Was it a dream or reality
When you said you'd be with me
For eternity

Holler, lend me your ears
This is the wickedest combination
Since Sonny and Cher
Say here girl,
Take these dozens of roses
And let me part the red sea like I was Moses
Love is love
Two wrongs don't make it right
So let's make love in the dark
Till we break daylight
Then hit the autobahn
You and me in a Ferrari
Fall asleep in Germany,
Then wake up in New York City

Love ya baby, drive me crazy
Let me be your sugar daddy
Looked into my eyes
I was convinced
That he's real

But don't feel sad, bad, mad
'Cause I've too been
Through the rain
And I can feel your pain

There'd be days like these

Maybe the money when I didn't have a dime
Maybe a way out before committing crimes
Coulda been Lauryn, perhaps it was Pras
Probably the mirror looking dead in my eyes
Coulda been reggae, or the love of hip-hop
Maybe my fans at the show saying don't stop
Probably the struggle of all refugees
Maybe the sign how the diamonds bling-bling, ching-ching
Ring ring, there's a call from my wifey, whoo
Perhaps I gotta make it home but music keep calling me
And maybe it's all I know, whatever it is I'm grateful for being

Coulda been Pablo, king of Yayo

Wyclef Jean,"Yeah I wanna dedicate this to everybody that love hip hop music
Cause without hip hop music I wouldn't be here today
Preacher's son, yeah

Imagine if biggie and pac never got shot
And they both still were rulers of hip hop
And puffy and suge was roomates from college
And big l never got found in the alley
Nas and jay-z they were still homies
Squash the beef with ja rule and 50
Benzino shook hands with eminem
And on the same record I heard eve, fox and kim
And sometimes when I dream, that's when I wake up
I kinda hoped that the fugees didn't break up
And when they walked into the studio I prayed they didn't spray
Cause I miss that scratch from jam master jay (whoa oh oh!!!)

Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see
What we see is reality
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow
Soon they won't live to see tomorrow

Imagine if big pun was still alive
I could see fat joe screamin terror squad
Imagine if there were still four survivors still in destiny's child
And tlc never lost they left eye
Imagine refugees never needin a passport
And john forte never at newark airport
Million man march, man, that was a start
Now I need a million more to meet me at central park
When the revolution start y'all 'gon have to play this
Imagine slick rick not gettin deported (whoa oh oh!)

Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see
What we see is reality
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow
Soon they won't live to see tomorrow

In the club never though shyne shot the gun
But in the limosine jlo had to run
Paparazzi snappin shots through the mirror
That's when I saw a smile from princess diana
Back and forth and forth and back
Like miss aaliyah man do I miss her
The war goes on with the roc and the lox
Murder inc, g- unit it's a fight to the top
Stop! we lost too many soldiers like freaky tah
While they get the cover of a magazine who got to die

Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
Y'all can't blame it on hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see
What we see is reality
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow
Soon they won't live to see tomorrow

Now I'm drifting in the darkness, Heaven hold me down

For a lying ass but yo forgive us in a while
And I'm sorry, never let me forget that I'm your child

Flowers and candles decorating all the pavements
No, the perpetrator ain't seeing no arrangements
Nobody cares about the feelings of the poor
Man they suffer while we spending eighty billion on a war, uh
Cutting school budgets, US stockmarket plummets
Condition's only worse and I wonder what become it
Metal detectors replace music classes
Angry little kids want to beat their teacher's asses
The red and blue's, somebody gotta lose
Reality TV be reality for who
I don't question what the Lord found in me
I just pass it on to folks with no boundaries

Wyclef Jean,"Gotta find me an angel
To fly away with me
Gotta find me an angel
Who set me free
My heart is without a home
I don't want to be alone
Gotta find me an angel
In my life

Too long have I loved
So unattached within
So much that I learn
That I need somebody so
Still I'll just go on
Hoping that I'll find someone

Gotta find me an angel in my life

I know there must be someone, someone for me
I've lived too long without the love of someone
And there's no misery, like the misery I feel in me

Gotta find me an angel in my life
She'll be there, now don't you worry
Keep looking now just keep looking",Angel,2003

[Intro - Timbaland - talking]
Oh!
You know what?
([Wyclef:] good good good)
I go through a lot, since my baby girl's not here
Life ain't been the same for me
Lately I miss you very much
I want you to hear my pain that I go through (go through ...)

[Verse 1 - Timbaland + (Wyclef Jean)]
It's been three years (AH!), livin this fast life
I think on it, I know one day I won't have life
People don't know me over the time be	
They don't want to know me, they want to know my G's
Le I quit, things ain't the same no more
But I'ma do my thing 'til there ain't no more (yeah)
I got a plan, I wonder how far I can go
I demand the best for myself, that's all I know
I, done seen the world become
Products of a revolution that we begun (yeah)
Make me want to split a swisher, I need me one
They keep on copying what we done done
That's why I say ..

[Break - Timbaland]
I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes
And would you be prepared to see (would ya?)
A life full of money and a life full of girls
But a heart that's really in deep (feel my pain)
A lot of people yellin (""we love ya Timbaland"")
But I know why'all really in need (ooo)
I don't know who's in my corner, don't know where is my corner
But I gotta grab all these leaves
So I must ..

[Chorus - Wyclef Jean]
Hey, Timbaland you gotta hold on (hold on)
But you got to be strong
Though the pain almost over

You gotta hold on, you got to be strong

Look towards the sky, there's only one Jehovah

[Verse 2 - Magoo + (Wyclef Jean)]
Pain, can't you see the pain in my eyes?
The lie behind my cries, don't you sympathize with me
You don't have to wonder when I come
You label me a bum, you fake it ain't suprisin me (yeah)
Funny how Oo got money, people come around
Soon as Oo fail, kick 'em to the ground (yeah)
Not just neighbors, the whole damn town
Own flesh and blood, said I was a clown
But as the world turns, my life can too
And like a gun kills, a knife can too (yeah)
I was stabbed thrice, how 'bout you?
Once by my mom, pops the other two
Child abuse kid, ward of the state
I know it was the past, but I just can't shake
How you had a kid, beat me like a slave
I was only three, how could I misbehave?
I didn't know better, you could teach me first
You said fuck that, then you beat me worse
It's pain in this verse, hard to go on (yeah)
Oo is a man, so I must hold on

[Break - Timbaland]
I know you like my shoes, cause you walk in my shoes

I've seen prom queens, turn into prom fiends
Sometime I ask myself what happen to Dr. King's ""Dream"" (yeah)

What made it sad, I had to sing at the eulogy
So hard for us to say goodbye
So I puff the lye and stay high (yeah)

Told me not to give in
Told me that you would never love me

I told them mind their business
Cause they not in my position
When I said that I was in love
They said I was trippin
I cut the haters off and I got into my man
Cause I take him for all he is
And he takes me as I am
The way I feel about him
It was god's perfect plan
The only one I need and I'm his girl

(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All she wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)

Cause I'm a tell you like you told me
Cash rules everything around me

Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a thug
For triple times the money and spending it how they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a draught in the block
You move slow
You getting' pressure from cops
you don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

Cause I'm a tell you like you told me
Cash rules everything around me

Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It drives the world crazy

She used to be

She used to be the sweetest girl
She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Now she like sour Amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him
Where my money at?

Cause I'm a tell you like you told me
Cash rules everything around me

Some kill for the bill
(Yeah, where my money at?)
She wined for the bill
Grind for the bill
(Whoa, where my money at?)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill
(Yeah, where my money at?)

""When the East in the house, oh my God""

[Wyclef Jean (Sizzla)]
Yeah! This one's for the world right here
Sizzla! (Mr. Kalonji just walked in the buildin')
Big up to the far East rulers

[Intro: Wyclef Jean (Sizzla)]
Welcome to the East! ""Oh my God""
""When the East is in the house"" sometimes I ask myself
Will the violence ever cease ""Oh my God""
(You know you gon' like it, Kalonji, Wyclef)
It's too hot on the floor man ""Oh my God""
It's too hot on the floor man
It's too hot on the floor man ""Oh my God""
It's too hot on the floor
They got the M-15's ""Oh my God""
We got the M-16's ""Oh my God"" (that's dangerous)
It's too hot on the floor man
It's too hot on the floor

[Verse One: Wyclef Jean]
Check it out
I saw the ski-mask I didn't see the faces yo
Saw the grenade, heard the explosions yo
It get worse yo, I can't count the hearses
That come out to masses, to churches, the verse is
Do unto others as you would have done unto you
Well welcome to the devil's penthouse, overlookin' hell's view
David slew the philistines with a donkey jawbone
The same jawbone, I used to make microphone
The same microphone I use in New Jerusalem
To tell E.T. MC's they gotta phone home
Girl I see you in the club but your eyes full of pain
Your man a wife-beater, find a new man
And for my little sisters in the misery
Sweet sixteen you ain't alone in the pregnancy
I pour some liquors for my homies that passed
Sit back while I'm writin' watch you fade in the paragraph...

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Welcome to the East! ""Oh my God""
""When the East is in the house"" sometimes I ask myself
Will the violence ever cease ""Oh my God""

[Verse Two: Sizzla]
All things she plant the explosives with fuel in line
We pe dimed, that's too much screwin time
Cuttin you off, the halls reach the governor
With pass enough plastic and the found for substance
I prophecy they gon' call on the attack
Must I see there and keeping this a back
Each can play guitar, cause those bands a saluting
Everyday someone forments these drive-by shootings
Will there ever be peace on the Earth
With human acts we shall not have peace on the Earth
Be good leave it up for firm and just
What's going on in neighborhoods today is not respected

Be a man, no matter what the circumstances

Wyclef Jean,"Cartel's so wasted, yeah
Wyclef's so wasted, yeah
It's the way the world is going on, man
We might not make it to see the future

It's 2:45
The baby takes his first breath
The mother never knew he only had a few left
And the father gets a call in the middle of the night
His breath gets short and his chest gets tight

But he's sixteen and he's driving too fast
Takes a turn to the left
It would be his last
Nobody knows what happens if he turns to the right
Nobody in the car would have died that night

But he's thirty-two and invincible
The cancer he had, it was visceral
He never saw it coming
Thought he had his whole life
Sick in the morning and he died in the night

But we're all so...
We're on the run
But we are aware, oh, oh

We're wasted
No, no, no
We're all wasted
We're wasted
No, no
We're all wasted

Seven years old
Got his bat in his hand
He's looking for his father
And he doesn't understand
Cause dad's too busy
Got some deals on the way
His son sits alone as the children play

And he's eighteen
He couldn't wait to move out
His parents wonder what all the rush is about
They never bothered with his dreams
Only thinking of theirs
Wonders why he doesn't call
And why he doesn't care

But he's thirty-two and invincible
With everything he is based on principle
He never had a truly happy moment in his life
He didn't want the kids
And he didn't want his wife

We're wasted
No, no, no
We're all wasted
We're wasted
No, no
We're all wasted
We're wasted
We're all wasted

Nuclear: North Korea
Bloodshed in Iraq

""Send the troops back!""
Turn the microphone up
You gotta hear the feedback
No more war
Too many wasted

Twenty-three now
Got his life in his hands
He's looking all around
And he doesn't understand
Cause life's too busy
Things get in the way
We all feel alone every single day

And I'm eighteen
I couldn't wait to move out
It's been five years
And now I'm starting to doubt
Whether all my dreams are just aimless stares
Looking off to some place that isn't there

When I'm thirty-two, will I be miserable
With everything around based on principle?
Will I have a clue?
Wouldn't it be nice
To never be alone in this wasted life?

You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop
But tonight where gonna reggaeton the whole club.

I see you party in the streets,
See my myself climbing in the
Seats the hood is like heaven now reminiscing
Them days when I thought about throwing on a towel
The night before the month was like Christmas
This kid keep hustling me sometimes I felt
Like I couldn't breath I would have to sit back
And play naive and it hurt watching my mum struggle
Trust me when you broke and hungry it's hard
To stay out of trouble it's a survival of the fittest
Whatever it took to bring money to the table
I did it even my girl lost faith in me
Left me out trapped in this negative energy
Listening deeply but I have to keep on
Moving I refuse to let this darkness, cath up to me

She asked me do I love her that recorded song
By si si si bunoes bonita.

But tonight where gonna reggaton the whole club.

Dowled up but it was just a distraction
Even the streets never gave us a little time to relax
Writing my rhymes to a vibe scap in the corner
Wrapped me like a cake I'm trying to be this super man
In the ghetto get this paper take this music
To a whole new level trouble found me now
I found myself in Puerto Rico spy got hot
I had to roll living with my paps
I really don't no missing my lady try not to tell it show
Her new man telling her I would probably never blow
Wanted to tell to the flow I know robbin' it stay in the zone
And move hard or go home open my eyes now
I see myself on the rock miens bonitas
Everywhere I wanna ride

I never thought I would see the day
That I will be getting money making music
So these hatters wouldn't take nothing off me
When the chicks wouldn't holla I just
Play them back all I had was a flow and a ball
Cap, watch right across the room
Thinking they will be dancing to me soon so
I'm in the game selling the streets though rapped
So hard that I'm in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico

What the world thinks about us, baby
(Yup, one love, one love, one love)
Cause in my heart I will always believe

That we were meant for each other
Love ain't got no color
It don't make any difference to me
Yeah, what they see

Baby, things have changed but it's still the same
We gon' find a way so we can maintain
Even though it might get a little difficult
Always remember, girl, that we're inseparable

(One love, one love, one love)
What the world thinks about us, baby
(Yup, one love, one love, one love)

ah ah ah ah

[Wyclef Jean (Lil Wayne)]
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She whine for the bill
Grind for the bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

[Verse 1: (Wyclef Jean)]
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)

[Chorus: Akon (x2)]
See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)

[Verse 2: (Akon)]
Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for some dub
Then triple times the money and spending it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line

But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow
You getting' pressure from cops
you don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

[Chorus: Akon (x2)]
Cos' I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)

[Bridge: (Wyclef Jean)]
Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It drives the world crazy

[Verse 3: (Lil Wayne)]
[Niia] She used to be
[Weezy] She used to be the sweetest girl

She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Now she like sour ameretta
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks off the track right by school
She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him... where my money at?

[Chorus: Akon (x2)]
Cos' I'ma tell you like Wu told me
