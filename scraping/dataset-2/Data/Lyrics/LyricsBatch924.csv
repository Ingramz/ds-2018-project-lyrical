Richard Desjardins,"Un clin d'œil que l'on ose
« How are you bloc de fer? »
Le type et son papier rose
Devant le fonctionnaire

Une femme abandonnée
À l'orée du climax
La chanson terminée
On remballa le saxe

On m'a oublié

Un perroquet fané
Dans l'back-store du pet shop
Les amoureux cernés
Dans un champ de gyprock

Le client dans le club
Inversait son destin
Les passagers du tube
À cinq heures du matin

On m'a oublié

Un poupon rêvassant
Près de l'étang chimique
Une abstraction du sang
Sur l'écran cathodique

Le patron du réel
Qui switche à pepsi
Le kid dans la ruelle
Entre les mains d'un psy

La pluie sur Andromède
L'horizon dans une craque
Le barrage qui cède
Dans une époque opaque

On m'a oublié

Un rouge, un jaune, un noir
Sous la loi du yankee
Au fond de l'univers
Un arc-en-ciel kaki

La gogo obligée
Même quand la place est vide
Androïde naufragé
Au pied de l'an deux mille

Comme l'âme d'un chien
Sucée par la marée
Quand il n'avait plus rien 
Ni chienne pour s'amarrer

On m'a oublié",On M'A Oublié,1988
Richard Desjardins,"J'ai roulé quatre cents milles
Sous un ciel fâché.
Aux limites de la ville
Mon cœur a clenché.

Les gros flashes apparaissent
Dans mon âme égarée,
Les fantômes se dressent
À chaque pouce carré.

Revenir d'exil
Comporte des risques
Comme rentrer une aiguille
Dans un vieux disque.

Y a eu ben du progrès
Ben d'l'asphalte, ainsi d'suite;
J'me demande qui je serais
Si j 'tais resté icitte.

Une peine imbuvable
À qui la faute?
J'étais juste pus capab’
D'la voir avec un autre.

Mais c'est tout oublié
Chu r'dev'nu un homme;
Le ti-cœur pomponné
S'en vient voir ses vieux chums.

Salut les Apaches,
Salut les crottés.
Vous me trouvez le stash
Moi je paye le party.

J'entends la fonderie qui rush;
Pour ceux qui l'savent pas
On y brûle la roche
Et des tonnes de bons gars.

Les grandes cheminées
Éternelles comme l'enfer;
Quand le gaz m'a pogné
Chu v'nu tout à l'envers

Entendez-vous la rumeur,
La loi de la compagnie?
«Il faudra que tu meures
Si tu veux viv’ mon ami».

J'ai poussé mon p'tit change
Dans l'trou du téléphone;
Sentiment étrange
Je r’joins pus personne.

«Time flies» que j'me dis,
M'en vas faire de mon best.
J'ai marché dans la nuit
En cherchant un orchestre.

J'prends ma chambre à Capri
J'aboutis dans la même;
Mêmes brûlures su'l tapis,
Même vue sur la «Main».

Comment dormir dans un lit
Où t'as baisé des anges?
Je sens monter la folie :
Je descends dans le lounge.

Dans la flamme d'un briquet
Un visage intrigant;
C'te gars-là je l'connais,
Bonyeu, mais c'est Satan!

Long time no see
Fait pas chaud là, mets-en.
J'ai passé proche l'embrasser
À force que j'étais content.

Y m'dit: «La gang est splitée,
C'était rien qu'une époque.
Sa valeur est tombée
Comme le prix de la coppe.

Qu’est-ce que la loi veut pas.

A peut v'nir me chercher
Pour m'passer les menottes;
Quarante ans d'liberté
De nos jours, c't'une bonne cut.

Y a personne qui m'encule
J'ai gardé mes bons nerfs;
Comment ça vaut ça, calcule!
Chu déjà millionnaire.

Côté cœur, ben content;
Y du monde su' la ligne.
Quand les chums sont en d'dans
Moi j'm'occupe des darlings.

Tu t'rappelles, ton gros kick,
La belle Rose-Aimée.
M'as t'en pousser une comique;
Moi pis elle c'est steady.»

Je veux ce que je veux
Tu veux ce que tu veux:
La guerre des baisers

Le velours de tes bras
Le coton de tes draps
Quand tu les ouvres
Et que tout est facile

Lucky lucky
D'en arriver là

Richard Desjardins,"J'ai marqué d'une croix
La clôture de ta cour
Je suis rentré chez moi
Par la sortie d'secours

Je me suis dit tout bas:
« Non ce n'est pas mon jour
Son cœur est un détroit
Ses yeux un carrefour »

J'ai pris l'harmonica
Descendu dans la cour
Et dessous le lilas
J'ai chanté sans détour:

Quand j'aime une fois
J'aime pour toujours

« L'amour est un tournoi
Où tombent tour à tour
Les guerriers maladroits
Noyés dans la bravoure »

Si c'est ce que tu crois
Si tel est ton discours
Sois sûre qu'une proie
Deviendra ton vautour

Alors que fais-tu là
Enfermée dans ta tour?
Je veux briser les lois
Qui règlent tes amours

Quand j'aime une fois
J'aime pour toujours

Tu entendras ma voix
Dans le ciel du faubourg
J'avancerai vers toi
Avec les yeux d'un sourd

N'entends-tu pas déjà

Ouvre ta véranda
Annonce mon retour

Aux pattes de velours
Je veux toucher du doigt
La peau de ton tambour

Richard Desjardins,"Au moment de sa disparition
Elle portait 
Des souliers de toile
Jupe blanche et t-shirt noir

Au moment de sa disparition
Elle portait 
Un collier d'étoiles
Et son cœur en robe du soir

Au moment de sa disparition
Il portait des bottes de travail
De la sueur sous son chandail

Au moment de sa disparition
Il portait la vie sur son dos
Et sur son cœur, un gros piano

Au moment de sa disparition
Elle portait
Un enfant vivant
Une robe couleur de sang

Au moment de sa disparition
Elle portait la terre à bout d'bras
Et son cœur dansait 
Dansait, dansait 
Dans ses pas

Au moment de leur disparition
Ils portaient 
Un drap d'hôpital
Des culottes courtes
Un bel uniforme
Un sac de linge sale
Un paquet d'tabac
Un numéro nul
Une poupée sans bras

Et rien dans les mains

Richard Desjardins,"Quand j'étais sur la terre
Sous-locataire
D'un kilo de futur
Des monsieurs incomplets-veston m'ont invité 
À une grande déception

Maintenant je ne pleure plus
Je ramasse des vies

Et dans mon cœur-bunker
Je frappe monnaie à ton effigie

Va-t'en pas
Dehors les chemins sont coulants
Les serments de rosée

Va-t'en pas
Dehors y a des silences bondés
D'autobus tombés 
Sur le dos

Et vaniteux qu'ils sont
Aux bouquets de clés
Aux bijoux de panique
Ils vont t'asseoir dans un bureau
Pendant qu'ici 
Il fait beau

Ils perceront l'écran
Pour t'offrir une carrière
Où noyer ton enfant

« Ils briseront les lois
Les cadenas 
Et les os »

Va-t'en pas
Dehors y a des orgies 
Jusqu'au fond des batteries

Va-t'en pas
Dehors j'ai vu un ciel si dur
Que tombaient les oiseaux

Tu sais que je lis
Sous les robes du temps
Et dans les lignes du ciment
Toi tu as des yeux
Qui trahissent le sort
Tu mérites l'amour

Maintenant que tu vois
Ce qui n'existe pas
Et si tu veux venir
Neptune me guide
Où j'ai semé des larmes
Mes armes sont en fleurs

Activités pour tous les goûts;
Game de bowling à cathédrale
Le son était bon, d'mande à Réal

Menoum menoum à volonté
Sébastien Bach au piano bar;
Une p'tite salsa muy picante

Si t'as d'l'argent ça coûte une piasse
Sans ça tu mets ta pelle dans l'cash;
À grands coups d'marteau dans l'cochon

Un cimetière climatisé
Pour les bobos béqués longtemps
Un paradis privatisé
Pour l'assassin du président

Y'aura de l'alcool

Un truck de bière supplémentaire
À soir y'a une attraction spéciale
Une vedette du tonnerre

A voit, a lit dans les pensées
Phénoménale Philomène!

Huit heures et demie, horloge Molson
Y'a d'l'empilade devant l'entrée
Les victimes entrant une par une
Ça m'donne le temps d'les présenter

Le boss d'la place mange des pinottes
Pour faire passer les petites crampes
Le cash y brûle, le show va êt'hot
À soir ça va brasser dans l'camp

Les deux qui rentrent et pis qui sortent
C'est pas des livreurs de pizza;
Concessionnaires d'émotions fortes:
Tite-Ligne Gagnon pis son homme de bras

Assis au bar, une gang de guiboux
Des amateurs de vérité;
À soir sont pas mal marabouts
Sont pas tout seuls dans l'monde entier

Docteur Cancer et son épouse
Propriétaires de belles pelouses;
Ben ben du monde su'a loi Lacombe
Une aut' bad luck pis c'est la tombe

Là-bas, là-bas, dans le coin sombre
De petits couples très open;
Le bonheur n'est qu'un songe
Amène, amène-lé ton bacon

Une nouvelle fille à chaque soir;
Y'a pas la mémoire des visages:
Un coq, ça monte par en arrière

Toute la journée y a niaisé là
Gros char à porte, limousine noire

On s'croirait dans une grande parade
Des hommes de rien pis des grosses poches;
Y'a même un bouquet d'gardes-malades
Un Harlequin dans chaqu' sacoche

Bon ben là, j'commence à êt'ben tanné
Place au spectacle, place à l'akchune
C'est l'heure de la vérité
Le monde se ferme, le stage allume:

« Mesdames, Messieurs, l'hôtel Central
Présente la vedette de la semaine:
Directement de Causapscal
La Phénoménale Philomène! »

La star surgit dans' boucane bleue
Su'la musique de Peter Gun
Costume gypsie, tout' c'que tu veux
Pareil comme dans l'temps d'Babylone

A nomme le nom de toutes les têtes
Dates de naissance, les N.A.S.;
Le monde a resté un peu bête:
« C'est une sorcière, c'est une déesse »

« Ah ben l'affaire est dieu-fifi
Dit un guibou désobligeant
Philomène j'te mets au défi
De m'dire combien c'qui m'reste d'argent »

« Si y faut qu'j'enlève tout c'que vous d'vez
Su'l'running bill d'l'hôtel Central
Ne vous demandez pas pourquoi que vous buvez
Votre allocation familiale »

Un avocat crie: « Objection!
Philomène, ça pourrait vous coûter très cher
Atteinte à la réputation:
C'est criminel, la loi est claire »

« On m'a d'jà fait le coup, Maître Barreau
C't'avocat-là l'a ben r'gretté
À l'heure qu'on s'parle, y'est à Bordeaux;
Moi ce que j'avais dit
Tout ce que j'avais dit
Rien qu'c' que j'avais dit
C'est la vérité »

« Ô Philomène, demande Sophie:
Serais-je heureuse, un jour, dis-moi? »
« Pour ton bonheur, un homme suffit
Répond le coq, chus là pour ça »

« Chère Sophie, dit la voyeuse
Je vois pour toi un long voyage
Au bout duquel tu s'ras heureuse;
Cette nuit même, fais tes bagages

« Astheure Le coq, c't'à toi j'm'adresse
Moi, à ta place, j'parlerais pas trop;
Pour les mots doux, ça va, mais l'reste
Trois quatre 'tits coups pis y tombe su'l'dos »

Les femmes ont crié: «Ha! Ha! Ha!
Y'a même pas d'os dans son jambon! »
Les hommes sont restés stupéfaits;
Ça peut v'nir long la vie d'chapon

Un type jaloux se vide le cœur
Piqué à vif comme un cactus
« M'as t'la couper! Ti-Coq soqueur!»
Y tombe su'l'dos: un infarctus!

Docteur Cancer, vite su'l'piton
Se dit: « All right, y'a une piasse à faire »
En s'débarrassant d'son veston
La cocaouine tombe drette à terre

« Tout' ça c'est rien qu'd'la poudre au nez
S'met à crier Tite-Ligne Gagnon
Philomène, tu sais qu'la vérité
Ça va me m'ner rien qu'en prison »

« Plus vit' tu penses, lui dit Philo
Parles-en un peu à ton complice
J'ai une 'tit' nouvelle pour toi mon beau
Ton partenaire y'est dans police »

Le faux pusher dans son cerveau
Savait plus trop qui arrêter;
Y met la main sur son rocheleau
Ben trop nerveux, y s'tire dans l'pied

Les guiboux disent: « Traite générale!
C'est la vérité qui paie la note »
Le boss d'la place mange des écales
Pour faire passer les grosses pinottes

Le rastaquouère, sans qu'ça paraisse
Descend dans' cave, coupe le courant
Y r'monte en haut, ramasse la caisse
Sort dans' ruelle, ben tranquillement

Docteur Cancer pompait dans l'noir
Les gard'malades cherchaient l'tit sac
Le monde commence à êt'su' les nerfs
La star déclare: « O.K.! L'entracte! »

Un peu plus tard dans la plaine
Une limousine roule dans la nuit
« Le ch'min va êt' long, dit Philomène
Sors le 'tit sac, ma belle Sophie

Richard Desjardins,"Caroline, que fais-tu
Dans cette maison perdue
Au bout du monde
Au bout du monde?
Tu es grande et tu t'ennuies
La lune brille dans ton ventre

Caroline, le vois-tu?
Dans le printemps revenu
Un oiseau tombe
Un oiseau tombe
L'oiseau avait fait son nid
À la fenêtre de ta chambre

Ô Caroline, que fais-tu dans ce château disparu?
Le puits est sec et l'amour est bu
Caroline, tu n'iras plus pleurer dans le jardin
Caroline, fais de beaux rêves
Caroline, fais de beaux rêves
Tu t'en vas demain

Laisse-la derrière toi
La prière de ton père
À genoux 
Sur le prélart
Son souhait ne sera qu'un souhait;
La vierge n’est qu’une image

Laisse-la derrière toi
La chanson de ta mère 
Prisonnière
Dans le trou de sa guitare
L'amour est un oiseau qui se tait
Quand on le met en cage

Ô Caroline, que fais-tu dans ce paradis de glace?
Ici la vie n'est plus qu'un songe, qu'une trace
Caroline, tu le vois bien qu'ils ont fermé leurs mains
Caroline, fais de beaux rêves
Caroline, fais de beaux rêves
Tu t'en vas demain

Prends ta robe et ton bijou
Dis bye bye à ta doudou
L'oiseau t'appelle
L'oiseau t'appelle
Réveille pas le malin, la maline
C'est le moment Caroline

Ô l'escalier qui descend
Vole, vole, ô mon enfant
Ouvre tes ailes
Ouvre tes ailes
Tu jouiras comme jouit l'orpheline
Tu es libre Caroline

Ô Caroline, éteins ta fièvre, le temps est venu
D'aller donner tes lèvres aux lèvres inconnues
Tu es grande et la lune brille dans ton ventre

Richard Desjardins,"Adieu mon frère, adieu ma sœur
Demain à l'aube les pieds nus
J'irai dans les vastes noirceurs
D'où personne n'est revenu

Adieu la Terre, tant si bonne
Qui tant d'eau froide m'a fait boire
Adieu Humains, qu'on me pardonne
Si je ne laisse que mon histoire

En l'an quarantième de mon âge
Hors d'enfance et franc de dettes
Pourvu de sens, du moins le crois-je
Nul méfait que ne regrette

Qui meurt a ses lois de tout dire
Éscoutez bien, honnêtes gens
Car on m'a jugé à mourir
Je me tais et je commence

Quand vint la vie dedans mes chairs
Mes mains tendaient vers la chaleur
« Profites-en », disait ma mère
« Pour un plaisir, mille douleurs »

Et vint le temps de travailler
Lever moissons à bout de bras
Dans bonnes soupes s'y noyer
La joie d'aider qui t'aidera

Et vinrent les amoureuses lisses
Fortes fillettes offrant tétins
Et vint la nuit que je me glisse
Dans leurs cavernes de satin

Qui donc refuse de jouir
Des joies du monde quand sincère
Quand transglouti dans le plaisir
Comme en la mer, comme en Lomer

Et vint Lomer. Pur étranger
Clamant nouvelles des équateurs:
« Le temps est venu de changer
Pour mille plaisirs, nulle douleur »

Il m'instruisit que Terre est ronde
Comme on le croit en Portugal
Que puissance et beauté des nombres
Feront se rompre les étoiles

Je suis de caravane humaine
Cueillant le fruit où il se trouve
J'ai traversé le pont qui mène
De l'amitié jusqu'à l'amour

J'ai consenti, oui, j'ai enfreint
Les lois du Deutéronome
Et celles de Saint-Augustin
Je fus allé aimer un homme

Cette matière à tous n'a plu
Trognons de chou et pets de diable
Qui pour le bien torturent et tuent
Ces mêmes qui furent des Croisades

Alors qu'un jour dans le verger
Nous nous aimions sous les olives
Ils sont venus nous asperger
De haines lourdes et de chaux vive

Sans cesse ils ont roué Lomer
Sans force, substance ou liqueur
Il est tombé sous jets de pierre
Son fiel se crevant sur son cœur

Ils m'ont traîné sous les regards
De tous les fols de Carcassonne
Devant des juges en lambeaux noirs
Qui n'ont jamais aimé personne

À l'entendeur voici ma voix:
Je dis que je suis comme l'eau
Que jamais nul n'escrasera
Car toute bête garde sa peau

L'encre se gèle, tombe le froid
Mon sang dans ses veines roidit
Qu'on sonne à branle le beffroi
Que s'ouvre à moi le paradis

Pendant que mes juges faillis
Iront bouillir dans les enfers
Dans les courtines de Marie
Je m'en irai aimer Lomer

Adieu la Terre, tant si bonne
Qui tant d'eau froide m'a fait boire
Adieu Humains, qu'on me pardonne
Si je ne laisse que mon histoire",Lomer,1998

You keep moving along,
Not knowing where you're going,
Or where you've come from.
Your head's in the valley,
Your feet in the sea,
Dear River Thames,
Stay a while, stay a while,
Listen to me.

Dear River Thames, 
Distress blurs my mind,
Through London's gray pastures,
So bleak and unkind.
Clear blue through meadows,
Darker through town,
Dear River Thames,
Stay by me, stay by me,
And don't let me down.

Dear River Thames,
Sail me down to the sea,
Where seagulls sing anthems,
And circle around free.
And there I shall rest,
Where the waters descend,
Dear River Thames,
For the ride, I must confide,
That you are my friend.",Dear River Thames,1975

Richard Dobson,"Elijah came to Texas 
To build his family a home 
With his wife and new baby 
And what little goods that they owned 
Had a good yoke of oxen 
And hand tools for clearing the land 
And he built him a church 
'Cause he was a God fearin' man 
All of his children when there 
Worshiped here through the years 
On down to my granddad 
He's buried 'bout 40 yards from here 
It's where I was baptized 
And where I took me a wife 
And if I have my say so 
That's where I'll rest when it's time 

[Chorus:]
When I'm dead and I'm gone 
Won't you carry me home 
To that little white church 
In my daddy's home town 

'Cause Lord knows I'm some kind of sinner 
But I've done come this far 
And it's too late for changin' 
When this race has been run 
Take me back where I came from 
And let me return what I took from the ground 
When this body won't carry me no further 
Take me back 
And lay me down 
This east Texas red dirt 
Won't grow much of nothin' they say 
'Cept tomatoes and peaches 
They mostly drill for oil nowadays 
And a hired hand named Regan 
First made me understand 
And he told me the red was the blood of my kin in the land

And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay

And settle down quiet some where

Trust in me.

Richard Dodd,"I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing.
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
And the circling is worth it.
Finding beauty in the dissonance.
There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.

Sailed off in a wooden shoe
Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

""Now where are you going
And what do you wish?""
The old moon asked the three
""We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beatiful sea
Nets of silver and gold have we,""
Said Wynken and Blynken and Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in the wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

Well the little stars where the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
""Now cast your nets where ever you wish
Never afraid are we,""
So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

'Twas all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
But some folks thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
Of sailing the beautiful sea
But I shall name you the fishermen three

Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And a Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee-one's trundle bed

Of the beautiful sights that be
You will see the wonderful things
As you rock in the misty sea

Soft as music, light as spray; 
'Twas a girl I learned it from 
Living down Sonora way. 
I don't look much like a lover, 
Yet I say her love words over. 
Mostly when I'm all alone 
""Mi amor, mi corazon"" 

(?)Oh my dawn the party oh
oh senora not in near(?)
me and Juana talkin' low
So the padre couldn't hear
how those hours would go a'flyin'
and too soon I'd hear her sighin'

Never seen her since that night, 
I can't cross the line, you know. 
Tney want me for a gamblin' fight
Like as not it's better so.

Since that last sad night I kissed her; 
Left her heart and lost my own

You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2005

Oh, now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry land
Now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a foul command.

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of the springtime mind
And once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
Oh, why are the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

So, now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.
....................................

the original song of RICHARD FARINA
(copyright Whitmark and Sons) is the following

Now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of the springtime mind
It's once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
So why are the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

And where was the will of my father when
We raised our swords on high?
And where was my mother's wailing when
Our flags were justified?
And where will we take our pleasures when
Our bodies have been denied?

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry land
Now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a foul command.

That I can hear

Please don't hurt me

How do I learn
To give and love and be loved in return
If this is heaven I'm falling
I'd rather run and jump away
Than to see it burn
I feel I could die
Before I sleep I kiss your cheek
And say goodbye

Caught in the middle with the future, got no plan

I wish that we were back here again

If trouble finds me then there's no one I can blame

The way the words just roll off your tongue
The breaking, the promise
The afterglow of a kiss in the sun

You could have warned me
You'd be laughing when I let you see it all
I was hanging by a thread
And you were there to watch me fall
And now I'm left asking why

It?s coming down like chocolate stars in the sun
And everything we had is gone
Don't waste your time, boy
Don't waste it shouting at the moon
'Cause it?s all coming down after you

The moment you stole it and sold it
But the madness still lives in my head
Did I just imagine
The truth in all of the lies that you said?

You didn't bother to explain
I never had a fighting chance
I'm a poet and fighter
Now my head is in my hands
And now I'm left asking why

It?s coming down like chocolate stars in the sun
And everything we had is gone
Don't waste your time, boy
Don't waste it shouting at the moon

Lying in lies, put the clouds in my pocket
'Cause I can't get you out of my mind

Take a walk around my old bedroom
Let the laughter and the memories surround me
I wonder if they love it like I used to

I'm still young but I'm old enough to know that

won't someone tell me?

And now the neon London lights, they all surround me
Busy streets full of faces I don't know
Wanna tear the hands on the clock and turn them backwards
Go to familiar places I call home

I tried to reach you, get back to the start
Why can't we love
Just because I think your funny
Even though nobody does

Did we start a fire just to watch it burn?
Did I push too hard and think you'd never learn?

Is everything going backwards?
Is mercury in retrograde?
I thought I knew what love was
Now tomorrow is yesterday
Is everything going backwards

Freeze the picture, stop the sun
Go underground, forget what we've done
I can't cut the chord, I'm not like you

Hold me close
And I?ll never ever think about letting you go
Hold me close

Never ever wanna be without you, oh

Asking whether she would meet him later on

Doux doux doux fragile
Légère face au vent, plus libre qu'avant

Richard Galliano,"Dans mon jardin secret y a des fleurs immortelles
Des soucis des pensées des racines éternelles
Y a des arbres écorchés par des serments gravés
Et deux trois réverbères qui m´éclairent sur hier

L´allée de mon immeuble qui voulait voir le jour
Le couloir vers ma chambre trop étroit pour danser
L´église au toit pointu qui orientait ma vue
Vers un tout p´tit bout de ciel qui me tendait ses ailes

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Les images danseront resteront à jamais
Au plus profond de moi, un élixir de paix

Encrés dans mon cahier, je les revoie encore
Les bateaux qui partaient, me laissant sur le port
Le vieux tutu froissé, que j´ai envoyé valser
Le lipstick rougissant de mes premiers baisers

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Les images danseront resteront à jamais
Au plus profond de moi, un élixir de paix

Tomorrow I'll walk these tracks
That will lead me across the border
Tomorrow my love and I
Will sleep beneath auburn skies

The pain and sadness we found here
And we'll drink from the Bravo's muddy water
Where the sky grows gray and wide
We'll meet on the other side
There, across the border

For you I'll build a house
High upon a grassy hill
Somewhere across the border
Where pain and memory
Pain and memory have been stilled
There, across the border
And sweet blossoms fill the air
Pastures of gold and green
Roll down into cool clear waters
And in your arms beneath open skies
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes
There, across the border

Tonight we'll sing the songs
I'll dream of you, my corazón
And tomorrow my heart will be strong
And may the saints blessing and grace
Carry me safely into your arms
There, across the border

For what are we
Without hope in our hearts
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters
And eat the fruit from the vine
I know love and fortune will be mine

Y a des souvenirs qui se proposent
Comm' pour mieux m'déchirer encore

Quand on l'ignore il fait faillite
C'est alors qu'on se mord les doigts

Changer c'est pas toujours facile
On s'conduit comme un imbécile
On s'croit très fort et puis, voilà

Is everybody here?
Is everybody ready? Hit it

I don’t care about expensive things
Cashmere coats, diamond rings
Don’t mean a thing

I don’t care for wearin’ silk cravats
Ruby studs, satin spats

All he cares about is love

Give me two eyes of blue
Softly saying, ""I need you""
Let me see her standin’ there
And honest, mister, I’m a millionaire

I don’t care for any fine attire
Vanderbilt might admire
No, no, not me
All I care about is love
All he cares about is love

It may be sound odd
But all I care about is love
That’s what he’s here for
Honest to god
All I care about is love

Show me long, long raven hair
Flowin’ down, about to there
When I see her runnin’ free
Keep your money, that’s enough for me

I don’t care for drivin’ Packard cars
Or smoking long buck cigars
No, no, not me

Twistin’ the wrist that’s turnin’ the screw

And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Richard Glazier,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Was sorrow, sorrow

You're acting funny, try to spend my money
You out there playing your high class games
Of sorrow, sorrow

You never do what you know you ought to
Something tells me you're the devil's daughter

I tried to find her cause I can't resist her
I never knew just how much I missed her

Upon my window pane tonight
And though your love grows even colder

And now you've gone to find another

I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.

It was just a year ago when I first met you;
I learned to love you, and I thought you'd love me too.

I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.

Now that we have really parted, I can't believe we're through.
I don't blame myself; I'm sure I can't blame you.
There was something had to happen, and it happened somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.

After all is said and done, I'll soon forget you,
Although I know that it will be so hard to do.
Let things happen as they will, and I'll get by somehow.

Letting in the sunshine and the rain
And the only friend I've got now is that good old dog of mine
And that little old log cabin in the lane

Oh the paths have all grown up that led around the hill
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way

Richard Greene,"It was midnight on the stormy deep
My solitary watch I'd keep
And think of her I'd left behind
And ask if she'd be true and kind

I never shall forget the day
That I was forced to go away
In silence there my head she'd rest
And pressed me to her loving breast

Oh Willy don't go back to sea
There's other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don't go where the bullets fly

The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other's bride
But still my thoughts will sometime times stray
To thee when thou art far away

I never have proved false to thee
The heart I gave was true as time
But you have proven untrue to me
I can no longer call thee mine

My home upon some icy lake
Where the southern sun refused to shine
Then to trust a love so false as thine",Midnight on the Stormy Deep,1991

You'll be back within my arms to stay

The castles we built of dreams together
Are the sweetest stories ever told
But in my dreams they live again, sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Any time she goes away

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
In this house just ain't my home
Any time she goes away

I know
Yeah, I know 
I know 
I will leave your things alone
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
In this house just ain't my home

Richard Harris,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,2010
Richard Harris,"You see these work boots in my hands, they'll probably fit ye now my son,
Take them, they're a gift from me, why don't you try them on?
It would do your old man good to see you walking in these boots one day,
And take your place among the men who work upon the slipway.

These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled,
When a feller needs a job and a place in the world,
And it's time for a man to put down roots,
And walk to the river in his old man's boots.

He said, ""I'm nearly done and asking this, that ye do one final thing for me!
You're barely but a sapling, and you think that you're a tree.
If ye need a seed to prosper, ye must first put down some roots.
Just one foot then the other in these dead man's boots.""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They could walk there themselves, and they probably will.
There's a place for ye there to sink your roots,
And take a walk down the river in these dead man's boots.

I said, ""Why in the Hell would I do that? And why would I agree?""
When his hand was all that I'd received, as far as I remember.
It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness up to then ye see.
I'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place when I came of age September.

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves, and they probably will.
I'd plenty of choices, and plenty other routes,
And he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots.

What was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him?
When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left, or a broken pot to piss in.
He wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?
He said, ""What the hell are ye gonna do?""
I said, ""Anything but this!""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves and they most likely will.
But they won't walk with me 'cos I'm off the other way,
I've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say.
When all ye've got left is that cross on the wall?
I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all.
Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through,
Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you,
I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more dispute,
And ye'll die before ye see me in your dead man's boots.",Dead Man's Boots,2013
Richard Harris,"It's all there in the gospels
The Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects 
But her mind is awhirl when she finds the tomb empty 
The stone had been rolled
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still

""Tell me where are ye going Lord, and why in such haste?""
""Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
And I have to be there before daybreak
Oh, I cannot be missing, the lads'll expect me
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me?
For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale
May the angels protect me if all else should fail
When the last ship sails""

Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
And the last ship sails

It's a strange kind of beauty, it's cold and austere
And whatever it was that ye've done to be here
It's the sum of yer hopes yer despairs and yer fears
When the last ship sails

Well, the first to arrive saw these signs in the east
Like that strange moving finger at Balthazar's Feast
Where they asked the advice of some wandering priest
And the sad ghosts of men whom they'd thought long deceased
And whatever got said, they'd be counted at least
When the last ship sails

Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea

And whatever the station in life you've become
In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son
And whatever the weave of this life that you've spun
On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun
When the last ship sails",The Last Ship,2013
Richard Harris,"Aye, the footmen are frantic in their indignation,
You see, ""The Queen's took a taxi herself to the station!""
Where the porters, surprised by her lack of Royal baggage,
Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage,
For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility,
And there's none of them famous for their compatibility.
There's a fight over seats, ""I beg pardon Your Grace,
But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in yer place!""

""Aye, but where are they going?"" All the porters debate,
""Why they're going to Newcastle and they daresn't be late,
For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide,
And they've come from all over, from far and from wide.""
There's the old Dalai Lama, aye and the Pontiff of Rome,
Every palace in Europe, and there's nay bugger home.
There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales,
Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails.
""Why, they haven't got tickets,"" ""Come now, it's just a detail,
There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail,
For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail!""
When the last ship sails.

Oh the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers,
The noise at the end of the world in your ears,
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea,
And the last ship sails.

And whatever you'd promised, whatever you've done,
And whatever the station in life you've become.

Richard Harris,"What do the simple folk do
To help them escape when they're blue?
The shepherd who is ailing, the milkmaid who is glum
The cobbler who is wailing from nailing his thumb

When they're beset and besieged
The folk not noblessly obliged
However do they manage to shed their weary lot?
Oh, what do simple folk do, we do not?

I have been informed by those who know them well
They find relief in quite a clever way
When they're sorely pressed, they whistle for a spell
And whistling seems to brighten up their day

And that's what simple folk do, so they say
They just whistle?
So they say

What else do the simple folk do
To pluck up the heart and get through?
The wee folk and the grown folk
Who wander to and fro

Have ways known to their own folk
We throne folk don't know
When all the doldrums begin
What keeps each of them in his skin?

What ancient native custom
Provides the needed glow?
Oh, what do simple folk do?, Do you know?

Once, upon the road, I came upon a lad
Singing in a voice three times his size
When I asked him why, he told me he was sad
And singing always made his spirits rise

So that's what simple folk do, I surmise

Arise my love, arise my love
Apollo's lighting the skies, my love
The meadows shine with columbine
And daffodils blossom away

Hear Venus call to one and all
Come taste delight while you may
The world is bright and all is right
And life is merry and gay

What else do the simple folk do?
They must have a system or two
They obviously outshine us at turning tears to mirth
Have tricks a royal highness is minus from birth

What, then, I wonder, do they
To chase all the goblins away?
They have some tribal sorcery you haven't mentioned yet
Oh, what do simple folk do to forget?

Often, I am told, they dance a fiery dance
And whirl 'till they're completely uncontrolled
Soon the mind is blank and all are in a trance
A violent trance astounding to behold

And that's what simple folk do, so I'm told
Really?
I have it on the best authority

",What Do the Simple Folk Do?,1967
Richard Harris,"Spring was never waiting for us, girl
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot, fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

Richard Harris,"You can't erase the paper chase
She'll make you players in the bright merry morning
She'll run and hide and leave you the paper
Promises behind her as she runs across the square

You can't win the race, she will set the pace
You'll hear her laughing just behind the foolish fences
Throw back the gate and find the piece of paper
Lying on the curbstone but the lady won't be there

And later in the day, you will be searching for a way
To let her know, you're ready for her little game to end
'Cause it's getting dark and then

You'll see her face, a glimpse of lace
And you'll go running through the last sweet dying day dreams
Calling her name but she's been home an hour
Laughing at the mirror and she combs her paper hair

And later in the day, you will be searching for a way
To let her know you're ready for her little game to end
'Cause it's getting dark and then

Calling her name but she's been home an hour

Shining with all his might
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because it was
The middle of the night

The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
The beach was wide
From side to side

In 'alf a year

To talk of other things
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings

And whether pigs have wings

No work today
We're cabbages and kings

The day is warm and bright
A pleasant walk
A pleasant talk
Would be a sheer delight

Yes, should we get hungry on the way
We'll stop and, uh, have a bite

But Mother Oyster winked her eye
And shook her heavy head
She knew too well this was no time
To leave her Oyster bed

The sea is nice
Take my advice
And stay right here

Yes, yes, of course, of course, but, uh, ha, ha

Come, run away
With cabbages and kings

The time has come, my little friends
To talk of food and things
Of peppercorns and mustard seeds
And other seasonings

In a sauce that's fit for kings

We'll eat today

Richard Hatch,"I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night
When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said ""You're on buddy, my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way to Dead Man's Curve""

I'm going where voices fill the air,

The loneliness hangs in the air.
With no-one there real waiting for me,
No smile, no flower nowhere.

There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light

That the man who ran looked a lot like me

If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die

I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She visits my grave where the night winds wail

Nobody knows but me

She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she cries over my bones

Did they make it on board
With fire and the sword?

But the call of the ocean
Is so hard to ignore
It's why I'm leaving your door

When the wind howls and the ghosts wail
Dead men they don't bite
Their faces haunt me at night

Ah honey I've got to go
Can you hear the waves roar?
And no sound of the shore
It shakes you spirit and your soul

I dream of sailing the oceans
In a galleon all golden
Dead trees in the hearth
The way they burn it warms the heart
Ah honey, I've got to go

The years passed
We traveled and sailed west
I'll buy you a new dress

There must be a place for us
For you and I to be as one
Around your shoulders, around your hair

Down into the woods.
Won't you follow me down,

These seismic moments rare and few
Does this seismic kiss from you
Take all that's bitter, all that's cold
Does the shadow in me show?
Wisen up, she can see, eat me whole and lose your hope
For the days, these woods are sold
I would like you to know
I love you
I love you

Won't you follow me down
Down into the woods
Won't you follow me down

We got naked and
Can't remember what happened next
It was weird
I had my fortune told
You said that I would meet somebody with green eyes
Yours are blue!

If you seek it, you won't find
The lovers' eyes so blinded by love
Blinded by love, blinded by love

In your heart lies long term loneliness
It's like an unexploded hand grenade
Time ticks away
Over the hills there is a valley
In the valley there's a little tiny house unoccupied

If you seek it, you won't find

Beware my foolish heart

People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.
 
I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.
 
And if by chance that special place that you've been dreaming of
Lead you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love",Greatest Love of All,1991
Richard Hayman,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

I mean, not to be cut by your dull point of view
Well, feelings will change, we're helpless, they must
But we like it that way, eliminates trust
But that cut on your arm where the blood is still fresh
And the thought of some harm that comes to yourself

Hey sweetheart, cool off, you're not so distraught
You lost what you had but that's what, that's what I've got
Well, I'll close my eyes while you take off my clothes
No, wait a while till this feelings goes
The feeling gets stronger, two times emptiness
We'll embrace that much longer, make more of a mess

The sensation of life was aroused in ourselves
From the plot we digressed, knocked the books off the shelves
Then burned down the house, then met in a bar
With a motel attached and kissed all the scars

Who gotta keep your victims poor and dumb, and dumb, and dumb

Oh man, they laugh when you walk away, away, away

Frustrated eyes flipping pages of air
Gaze after gaze I could see nothing there
I was just a flaw in the scheme
Of everything but nightmarish dreams

No one could stand feeling that way for long
So I chose to regard the whole world as the wrong
And to make my own long assertions in song
I decided I just didn't care
That I'd look and I could see nothing there

(but now)
I lie there staring in her eyes
I lie there staring in her eyes
I watch her be
the sight I wanted so much to see

Oh let me tell you about a pleasure I've found
First you surrender and stop looking around
And then you get the one who you want to lie down
And stare like a corpse in each's eyes
Till you never want to come alive and rise

Their watch of wondering love

Richard Hunt,"There's a monster name of Frazzle
Who's a good friend of mine
He looks ferocious, but he's really fine
Go up and ask him for his autograph
He'd be so happy that he'd start to laugh

He goes Argh! That's how he laughs
He goes Argh! That means he's glad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The greatest time that he ever had

Now you know my buddy Frazzle
He's got fangs on his jaws
His fur is orange, and he's got these claws
He looks so mean that he could scare a crowd
But if you tickle him he laughs out loud

He goes Argh! That's how he laughs
He goes Argh! That means he's glad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The greatest time that he ever had

Mr. Frazzle has emotions like the rest of us do
Sometimes he feels low down and ugly, too
And then the tears begin to fill his eyes
It's so pathetic when a monster cries

He goes Argh! That's how he cries
He goes Argh! That means he's sad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The lowest time that he ever had

Argh! That means he's hungry
Argh! That means he's hot
Argh! That means he's sleepy
Argh! That means he's not
Argh! That means yes
Argh! That means no
Argh! Means thank you for the dinner
But, it's getting very late and I really must go
Argh!",Frazzle,1998
Richard Hunt,"Oh, there's no fire in the fireplace
There's no carpet on the floor
Don't try to order dinner
There's no kitchen anymore
But if the road's been kinda bumpy
And you need to rest a spell
Well, welcome home to Happiness Hotel
If you've got luggage keep it handy
But you're running out of luck
'Cause the bellhops ain't to organized
And the elevator's stuck
Still if you don't mind friendly animals
And can learn to stand the smell
Well, welcome home to Happiness Hotel
Welcome home
Oh, welcome home
No matter where you wander
You will never do as well
Okay the lobby's looking shabby
And it's got the wrong address
And the whole dern thing has been condemned by 'Merican Express
Still the management is cheerful though the whole joint's gone to hell
Well welcome home to Happiness Hotel
Oh there are bugs
There are bugs
And there are lice
There are lice
Sure we have our little problems
But you'll never beat the price
You've got every kind of critter
You've got ev'ry kind of pest
But we treat 'em all as equals

When everyting goes right
And we're making love

And then we have all these days
Where we go separate ways
A heart full of pain
And no one's to blame
It's just another day
Without you
Without you
It's just another day
Without you
Without you
Many times we throw away
What we regret the next day
And we say Good-Bye
Forever Good-Bye!!

Just a game of hit and miss?
I wonder how long
We can go on?

Even show our might

I was a left

We will crucify
Just plain denied
To practice out our rights

Through all the hurt
The meaning of our might

Of the land rushing by, your shades, and your hat.
I prefer a memory to a photograph.

It was merely a muse,
It was in, it was out,
'Til I made the mistake of speaking out loud.
You said, ""I got the camera right here in the back.""

I prefer the memory to the photograph.
Oooh, memory to a photograph.

You know, I sometimes get this little deja vu,
It comes in the dark when I'm lying with you.
And even the salt in the air comes back,
Then I'm open to anything but what you had.
The blur of the land, your shades, and your hat,
Oooh, I prefer a memory to a photograph.

No, the picture we took didn't capture all this.
Just a faraway look, a scene that I missed.
A sign of what was to come perhaps,
Did you know then that when you were showing me that?

It is the night of the dear Savior's birth. 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining. 
'Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth. 
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices, 
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. 
Fall on your knees! 
Oh, hear the angel voices! 
O night divine, the night when Christ was born, 
O night, O holy night, o night divine! 
O night, O holy night, o night divine! 

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming, 
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand. 
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming, 
Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land. 
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger, 
In all our trials born to be our friends. 
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 
Behold your King! 
Before him lowly bend! 

Truly He taught us to love one another, 
His law is love and His gospel is peace. 
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother. 
And in his name all oppression shall cease. 
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, 
With all our hearts we praise His holy name. 
Christ is the Lord! 
Then ever, ever praise we, 
His power and glory ever more proclaim! 
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night (Cantique de Noël),1991

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Maybe you're the hurting kind
Can't take no more of this pain
I've got to get you off my mind

Tried to be what you wanted
I gave you all I had
You left me with nothing
Nothing but a photograph

Richard Marx,"All that I know in my life, I have learned on the street
No magic carpet, no genie, no shoes on my feet

Will I wake up from this nightmare?
A fear that chills me to the bone
Though I may be one of many
I feel so all alone

We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voice is strong, our future's bright
And thanks to what we learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night

Left by my father with only this scar on my face
Told by my mother that, ""no, you were just a mistake""
I have tasted my own hunger
Sold my body to survive
Some have paid to scratch the surface
But they can't touch what's inside

We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voice is strong, our future's bright
And thanks to what we learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night

How I long for something better
Than this life I know too well
Lord, I know I'm bound for heaven
Cause I've done my time in hell

I may only be wasting my time
Don't know what else to do

If you turn me away
Just be careful what you say
Girl, you've got my heart on the line
Don't be mean, don't be cruel
Don't you treat me like a fool
Girl, you've got my heart on the line

It's too late to be wishing I was
In somebody else's shoes this time
I'm tied up, like a slave to a chain
Praying that you'll please be kind

If it's true that love's a disease
Baby, I'm a dangerous case
I beg for mercy, got me down on my knees

Tried to make my spirit give in
But I'm here to make a big, big sound
It's your turn to lose and it's my turn to win

I know you can never go back
Once you turn and walk out that door

Dreamin' 'bout what life had in store for me
When I look back now it really makes me mad

School was alright
Gave me time to fantasize
But one day I woke up
And I realized

I'm livin' in the real world
Everything's written in black and white
Livin' in the real world
Where you don't get nothin' unless you fight

I want to relax but I don't know how
The pressures on me are much stronger now
I remember the days I didn't have a care
Aside from being afraid somebody'd cut my hair

I'm gonna live with a lady on a quiet beach
I'm gonna have three kids, maybe one of each

And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line

Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it baby

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you

On your front lawn
You had a smile on your lips and
Your wallet was gone

Her spell
I know dozens of guys who've been there
As well
They've got scars to show
And they owe 'em all to her.

Did she fool you?

And she's made her reputation
Making strong men cry

But there stories are the same
Lulu's there whey your airplane
Just happens to crash
Still she walks away without even a scratch
Leaving in flames
But she never leaves her name

Has come back to haunt
Like a restless wind
And the best of times
That were left behind
They come blowing in

No one's pushing me through that door
But it might as well be a forty-four in the night

It's too late to say goodbye
I'm all out of lies
It's too late to say goodbye

How can I resist
One more stranger's kiss
Should the thrill be gone
And if I must refrain
Will I wind up the same
As the jealous dogs?

From this day forward could be too long
But crossing that border would be so wrong, and you're right

It's too late to say goodbye
I've run out of lies
It's too late to say goodbye

I know that you're right

And the ways of the world make a heart grow colder
Got nowhere left to hide
The fight in me has died

Live life like the owner of a heart of stone
No one touches, touch no one

Not the first or the last
Trying to figure out the mystery of the half empty glass

Even though the scars remain
And eyes don't stay swollen
Even if it feels that way

But it's not that serious
I'm a big boy now
And I'm not that delirious
So don't show me how
Cause I've gotten beyond the agony
And my perspective is saving me

Never doubted what the cards would reveal
And if the joker showed his ugly face
Not that big of a deal
It's just a moment in the scheme of it all
But it's difficult to visualize when the axe starts to fall

But then a heart won't stay broken
Even on it's darkest day
The right door could open
Pick you up and drift away

[Chorus]

With all the confusion
How does anybody come through
But life is illusion

I feel your spirit
Know that I'm near it

Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right
Three years ago when I came to know Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
And saw the man inside

We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

I think about my life gone by
And how it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time

For what one man put you through
You say that we're all the same
But I'm called by no other name

We all need a place to run
Won't you let me be the one

[Chorus]

Don't keep the dream in you locked outside your door
Just believe in this love
And don't be afraid anymore

I need you to please be strong
I've waited for you too long

Richard Marx,"The warmest day of all my life
You came to me
I held you in my hands
And something changed forever

I want you for a better time
To know the beauty of our Mother Earth
Cherish her forever

Never felt in such a hurry
So little time, so much to do
I lie awake and dream the dreams I'll share with you

[Chorus]
This is your world now
No one can chase all your fears away
This is your world now
Trust in your heart to lead the way

I still recall a day so clear
I saw the future in my mother's eyes
Filled with tears of sorrow

The years roll by, the times do change
The truth around us harder to disguise
As we face tomorrow

So many promises were made me
So little hope remains alive
I only pray the dreams I leave you will survive

[Chorus]

You'll see what I'm saying
When you're on your own
The war that you're facing
Isn't yours alone

I'm a man in search of reasons
Though I am still as much to blame
It's up to me leave you more than just my name

This is your world now
No one can chase all your fears away
Fight for your world now
I know that somehow you'll find your way
Trust your heart to lead the way
This is your world now
I want to chase all your fears away
Fight for your world now
I know that somehow you'll find your way",Your World,1991
Richard Marx,"Just when I believed I couldn't ever want for more
This ever changing world pushes me through another door
I saw you smile
And my mind could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for awhile
Won't you let me shelter you

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you something more
That I could be yours

How do we explain something that took us by surprise
Promises in vain, love that is real but in disguise
What happens now
Do we break another rule
Let our lovers play the fool
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you something more
That I could be yours

Well, I think that I've been true to everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free
Every time I look into your eyes, I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for is right there

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you more
Hold on to the nights",Hold On to the Nights,1992
Richard Marx,"""My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right...
Three years ago when I came to know Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
And saw the man inside...

We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town...

No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking alone
And never came home...
Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me...

I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

I think about my life gone by
And how it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone

I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town...""",Hazard [Live],1994

Why'd they call it human race?
All in a world of our own
I think it's gone far enough, I say we call their bluff

If it's the only life you get

From the battles that rage in my head

Now and forever

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune
That heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever
I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there all the time
All this time

Richard Marx,"Born and raised in the windy city
I moved west to kick start a dream
What I found was a town without pity
That'll chew you up and swallow you clean

I'm amazed at the life I'm livin'
Don't want to seem like I'm rockin' the boat
But it ain't all about taking but giving
I feel something tugging at my coat
No one ever told me it would be like this
That there'd be something called home that's too hard to miss

[Chorus]
I'm saying goodbye to the glamor
Back to the old neighborhood
All that I need is a place that I can breathe
I'm saying goodbye to Hollywood

Done my time in the Hoodoo Jungle
Tired of waking up in another man's dream
I've got the ball and I ain't gonna fumble
Gonna make a winner of this team
All that ever mattered were the goals I chased
Now, I'm ready to run in the human race

[Chorus]

Me and the Mrs. done made up our minds
We're gonna give our boys a little less sunshine
Call it runnin' say what you like

I may be cold but my soul is alive

Richard Marx,"There is no understanding in this hostile age
Sometimes I feel just like a rat locked in a cage
It's hard to live beyond the walls
It ain't no life at all
But don't you tear it down

[Chorus]
Take your chances, I'll take mine
Chasing thunder is only wasted time
Got no reason to walk that line
Heaven's waiting if I can make it home tonight

And with the years I've found a faith that gets me by
It shows me the truth in a hurricane of lies
My baby's left a light for me
That's really all I need
They won't bring me down

[Chorus]

Aimlessly rushing leaves you with nothing
You need some loving to make you feel alive
In less than a moment, life can be stolen
I know where I'm going, gotta get me there tonight

Love won't strike me, love won't sell me out

Richard Marx,"You never know what we could be in store for
The way it goes we're in for more of  the same
One step beyond the flame
The thread of life, the finely woven pattern
Reveals designs in silent laughter and rhyme
One picture at a time

[Chorus]
There ain't nothing left behind us
Not a doubt inside us
If the angel calls tomorrow, there's nothing we haven't said
There ain't nothing left behind us
Nothing but a blind trust
I would beg, steal or borrow to never lose you again

It's down to us to figure out the secret
It's not enough to wait for pieces to fall
The writing isn't on the wall
Take my hand, we'll face the fire together
To distant lands, but we can weather the storm
Keeping each other warm

[Chorus]

There's never been an easy way
Everybody is bound to make mistakes
You just do what you think is right
Then laugh 'til you cry 'til you scream at the night

Richard Marx,"There in my darkest hour, somehow you knew what I felt
And just in the nick of time you saved me from myself
Didn't know I could cut through my defenses
And see through the mask
I figured you must want something from me, but you never asked
I just had to call and you were always there
I think you must have been the answer to my prayer

With you I've got nothing to hide
My heart is starting to pound
Now the walls are tumbling down

I wish I could find the words that linger just out of reach
I see myself in your eyes and lose my power of speech
I am someone now that I don't recognize
It took someone like you to shatter my disguise

Now I've got nothing to hide
My heart's remembering to pound
I can feel the walls coming down
I've got nothing to hide
All that I needed was you around
Now the walls are tumbling down

Head in the sky, feeling just like some kind of lovesick child
I finally pulled through, and I owe it to you, don't want to keep it inside

I am someone now that I don't recognize
Oh I'm healing, I'm believing, you made me realize",Nothing to Hide,1994
Richard Marx,"It's a peaceful thing to know that freedom as a rule belongs to me
There's something very wrong when the color of a man is all you see
After all this time how can a single voice explain
Any reason for the pain we all have seen
It's not a dream

[Chorus]
One man stood tall
And faced the devil with his back to the wall
And took one step closer to heaven above

So he took a stand and walked where no one else would dare to even try
It was the only way
If not for bravery, the soul would surely die
And right before my eyes he gave his life unselfishly
So that all the father's children could be free
Like you and me

[Chorus]

Before his work is done
We've got to put an end to this game of choosing sides
I want us to be one
And I won't let it go 'till it's over
I'm here waiting

Richard Marx,"There was nothing missing, it was just a case of foolishness
Girl, I must've been crazy
Something I would just as soon forget
I can only say I'm sorry and leave it up to you to say the rest

If you want to go, girl, I won't stand in your way
But I'll stand by you if you decide you want to stay
Baby, don't you see
Doesn't have to be forever or goodbye
All I'm asking for is one more try

I'm the one who hurt you, still I know the pain you're going through
And even if you show forgiveness, there may be too much damage to undo
I hear these voices telling me not to give up on you

Trying to find a way
To bring your love back to me

Still I hear these voices telling me not to give up on you

Richard Marx,"Twenty four and he believes for sure he's got it made
Fame is here for good and looks will never fade
He doesn't know
The game is never over 'till the cards have all been played

Eighty three and still he feels his best is yet to come
He believes that youth is wasted on the young
He's alone
The only dream he ever has is being with someone

[Chorus]
Love you when you're standing tall
But nobody knows when you when you're falling
All you have to do is call
But nobody ever hears the silent scream

Christmas came and went again but still nobody came
Staring at her wedding photo in a frame
She's alone
We should hope the loss of memory helps to ease the pain

[Chorus]

Memories, moments you recall
We should be remembered for the greatest of them all
You can't begin to live someone else's life
Or you're own will pass you by

Oh, who's to know
Maybe we can learn a thing or two from everyone

Richard Marx,"I've got the fever, poison in my veins
My mind ain't working right
I know the answer, the way to ease this pain
Only got myself to fight
I can see clearly but choose to be blind
A slave to desire
Holding me, scolding me, changing your mind
You're like playing with fire

[Chorus]
I need you
I want to stay on this soul motin' ride
There is no danger when you're here by my side

Given some distance, just a little time
Right and wrong seems clear
But my sense of reason is nothing but unkind
Every time that you're near
Over and over I say to myself
Ooh, she's only playing
Ten thousand reasons to find someone else
Still I hear myself saying

[Chorus]

I'm out here on the edge
And I know what's in store
It should be over and done, just let go and run
But I've tasted too much
Nothing's the same anymore

[Chorus]",Soul Motion,1994
Richard Marx,"I'll have this feeling 'till the day that I die
When I hear my baby calling
A simple motion, a look in her eyes
And I'm helplessly falling
I'd give all of somebody else
For any piece of her heart that's left
She knows me better than I know myself

[Chorus]
Let me tell you 'bout the way she loves me
Ooh, I want the world to know
I'm crazy 'bout the way she loves me
Ooh, I'm proud to let it show, yeah, yeah, yeah

Came close to letting this train pass me by
Just like a fool second guessing
I could've spent my life wondering why
I didn't cherish the blessing
If I'd have known she'd come my way
The lonely nights would have been okay
I have her promise that she's gonna stay

No one else can love you like I know I can

I got what you want
Takes more than money to turn you on
I got what you need
c'mon baby take a chance on me

Somethin' 'bout your smile seems counterfeit
It ain't in you to be a hypocrite

And I know my heart won't beat the same again
You will always be the shadow of a doubt
Now I go crazy wondering what we might have been

Your charms have made me suffer
Why do I care where you are
I'm afraid my dignity has strayed too far
Can't read what you're writing
Unable to make the call
Do you want me desperately
Or not at all

I turn them my blindest eye

Windy city square
If all that sells is tragedy I haven't got a prayer

Should I try to lose it all, kick it off the track
Just to say I took the fall but ""look who's comin back""

What's the story, where's the dirt
Nobody's happy til somebody gets hurt
I don't want t keep up with all that
The garbage that you swallow gonna someday make you fat

Normal childhood, beautiful wife
Excuse me having a wonderful life
Why should I be hungry for someone else's pain
Heroes should have something but talent for fame
Double barrel in the mouth nails it every time
But that's what legend's all about
Ain't no bigger headline

What's the story, where's the dirt
Nobody's happy til somebody gets hurt
I don't want to keep up with all that
The garbage that you swallow gonna someday make you fat
Maybe I should frequent all the places that I¡¯m avoiding
And maybe you should work on building rather than destroying

If this is making friends, I'd rather be lonely
So where's that leave a guy like me

I may never make page three but ask me if I care

What's a man supposed to do

I don't get no kick from nine to five
And I'm not a man who thinks it's true

How I feel about her in my way

You're bound to be a star
And even if you don't go all the way,
I know that you'll go far
This race is for rats, it can turn you upside down
Ain't no one you can count on in this sleazy little town, Oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
But don't you open your heart

Cause it don't mean nothin'
The words that they say
Don't mean nothin'
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothin'
No victim, no crime
It don't mean nothin'
Till you sign it on the dotted line

The director smiles as you walk in the door
He says, ""I love your work, babe"" but
You're just not what we're looking for
It's never what but who it is you know
So easy to get stuck in all that California snow

Take a good look around and you'll find
People tryin' to mess with your mind

Cause it don't mean nothin'
The words that they say
Don't mean nothin'
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothin'
No victim, no crime
It don't mean nothin'
Till you sign it on the dotted line

Hollywood can be so lonely
Make you the winner of a losing fight
But the party is never over
Cause stars are always shining
Doesn't matter if it's day or night

The producer says, ""let me change a line or two""
And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you
And you want to scream, but you gotta keep it all inside
When you're trying to make a living,
There ain't no such thing as pride, no

Lots of promises in the dark
But don't you open your heart

Cause it don't mean nothin'

All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before

I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh

Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

There's only so much I can say
So please don't run away from what we have together
It's only you and me tonight
So let's stay lost in flight

How many times will love pass me by,

Eldest child of Willy and Louise
His little sister died at the age of four
The family posed, led by Louise
Like right out of some kind of Rockwell scene
But Jake couldn't fake it anymore

Nobody heard the hammer fallin'
Sensed that judgment day was callin'
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door
Everybody loves to point their finger
They might as well have pulled the trigger
Nobody stopped to hear the boy next door

Willy later said, ""He really should've known
The boy spent too much time on his own
And what was on his mind, God only knew""
One by one the neighbors went away
A gruesome little game Jake taught himself to play
His daddy always said, ""Find something to do""

Nobody heard the hammer fallin'
Sensed that judgment day was callin'
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door
Everybody loves to point their finger
They might as well have pulled the trigger
Nobody stopped to hear the boy next door

One less mistake to think about
'Cause no one read the writing on the wall
So much for case 1239
Covered up, curled up in a ball

One little page in the history of crime
Lawyers made a fortune for their time
Seems an explanation was never found
And I hope this tale won't be misunderstood
Things ain't the same in every neighborhood
But before you go to sleep tonight, look around

Nobody heard the hammer fallin'

To know I took the fall

It's like I'm standing on the edge of madness
Save me from crossing that line
Sure that I'll never come back

[Chorus: ]
With the dawn, life goes on
How long can I keep waiting on your love
Hold my breath, give me strength
How long can I keep holding on
How long can I keep waiting on your love

True love is a funny thing
Too much for a diamond ring
To guarantee applause
Too late when you have to guess
Which joke's taken as tenderness
Penny for your thoughts

Just like I'm hanging off the edge of madness
Stop me from falling so far
How can you let me let go

[Chorus: ]

I keep every moment frozen in time
And if they're all I get, I'll be cold the rest of my life

[Chorus: ]",Waiting on Your Love,2000
Richard Marx,"Whenever I'm weary from the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness when my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand
Now and forever I will be your man

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune that heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there all the time
All this time

Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever I will be your man
Now and forever I will be your man",Now and Forever [Live],2003
Richard Marx,"What have I gotta do to make you love me?
What have I gotta do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And I wake to find that you're not there?

What do I do to make you want me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I say when it's all over
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd

It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd

It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

What have I gotta do

When the visions around you, 
Bring tears to your eyes 
And all that surround you, 
Are secrets and lies 
I'll be your strength, 
I'll give you hope 
Keeping your faith when it's gone 
The one you should call, 
Who's standing here all alone

And I will take 
You in my arms 
And hold you right where you belong 
Till the day my life is through 
This I promise you 
This I promise you 

I've loved you forever, 
In lifetimes before 
And I promise you never
Will you hurt anymore 
I give you my word 
I give you my heart (give you my heart) 
This is a battle we've won 
And with this vow, 
Forever has now begun

Just close your eyes (close your eyes) 
Each loving day (each loving day) 
I know this feeling won't go away (no) 
Till the day my life is through 
This I promise you. 
This I promise you. 

Over and over I fall (over and over I fall) 
When I hear you call 
Without you in my life baby 
I just wouldn't be living at all... 

And I will take I will take you in my arms
You in my arms 
And hold you right where you belong (right where you belong) 
Till the day my life is through 
This I promise you baby

Richard Marx,"There's been no sunlight
Since the day you said goodbye
Since the moment that my life
Turned into a masquerade

I can't even pretend to
Paste a smile across my face
All my dreams have been erased
There's nothing left to save me

And you
You're the only one can stop my sky from falling
You're the only one who's name I keep on calling
When everything is closing in
And you
You're the only one can stop this heart from aching
You're the only one who can stop me from shaking
And put me back together
Again

What I'd give just to wake up
And wipe your memory from my eyes
But I can't wish for bluer skies
I've never been quite so hopeless

And you
You're the only one can stop my sky from falling
You're the only one who's name I keep on calling
When everything is closing in
And you
You're the only one can stop this heart from aching
You're the only one who can stop me from shaking
And put me back together
Again

And if you stay away
I fear it will all be too much
And if you stay away
I'll be a man who's lost his touch

Richard Marx,"This is what I should have said
If I'd've been a man about it
You might be in my arms by now
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
As I contemplate the losing
The silence is up way too loud

[Chorus]
I can't sleep anymore
The words I never said keep turning over
I can't dream like before
And all I seem to be getting is colder

Just like the t-shirt that you wore
You were divine and full of madness
Not really like anyone
In words too beautiful for words

I constructed a soliloquy
That never seemed to reach my tongue
Yeah the air never even filled my lungs

All I can think of is
My name on your lips

These things happen everyday
I should be able to smile by now
But I don't remember how

With you went warmth in summer
All of the stars in the sky
With you went perfect sunsets
Sleeping my way through the night
Yeah with you went
Everything good in this world

Desperate for your touch
I haven't been needing much
Why let the music play?
I can't hear it anyway

'Cause with you went
The scent of flowers
Don't they just die anyway?
And with you went

All the rainbows
Now when it rains it's just gray
Yeah, with you went
Everything good in this world

And I thought of doing something rash
In the hopes of making you feel bad
But it seems that it's always me that ends up cryin'

That I think I'm ready to share
It may bring us closer
It may be a burden to bear

It's precious and it's real
And all that I can feel

Is that I'm falling
As deep as any ocean
In ways that can't be spoken
I am falling
For the millionth and the first time
Ever and eternally for you

You are a beacon
Revealing the places I hide
You've given freedom
To so much that I kept inside

And with one look in my eyes
It can't be a surprise

That I am falling
As deep as any ocean
In ways that can't be spoken
I am falling

Ever and eternally for you

Richard Marx,"Elusive happiness
Can be like promises
That rest so gently on our pillow
We stood out on the ledge
And leaned over the edge
And nearly fell right through that window
There were those who had us done by now
Baby, we've only just begun

The world may crash and burn
Or suddenly just cease to turn
But love goes on
It may look out of reach
And time may rob us like a thief
But love goes on
Our love goes on

No one may recognize
What lives behind our eyes
Sometimes the good times are the hardest
And when my strength is gone

It's you that I lean on
A light at the end of all my darkness
And in the end if I know nothing else
The answer is only in your arms

Richard Marx,"Locked up tight but holdin' the key
Clock keeps tickin' like it's laughin' at me
I wonder what spell I'm under
Days go by in a pulseless haze
Who's that person that's wearin' my face
Denyin' what he's hidin'

I can't go on like this
I won't let myself miss the rest of my life

When something's come and gone, what good is holdin' on?
Why waste tomorrow chasin' yesterday?
I part my lips to speak but the words are out of reach
I guess that really means there's nothin' left to say

I guess we could carry on livin' asleep
Who is the fool who could choose to just keep pretendin'
That this ain't endin'?
I wish you all that I wish for myself
To have that ache of emptiness behind us
And not still inside us

It's time to take that dare
There's still a world out there waitin' for me

When something's come and gone what good is holdin' on?
Why waste tomorrow chasin' yesterday?
I part my lips to speak but the words are out of reach
I guess that really means there's nothin' left to say

We did the best we could
Just like we thought we should
But sometimes you've got to just let go

When something's come and gone what good is holdin' on?
Why waste tomorrow chasin' yesterday?

The splendor goes on for miles
I don't know what could be left to wish

I do all right if you know what I mean

And I've closed the door
And locked it tight
And turned off every single light
Another perfect day is all but through
Now me getting over you
Is the one thing left to do

And I can always feel the rain

A way to be strong
Now I see the answer was hiding
In me all along

Over the sun
Like a rocket to heaven
And I'm ready to soar
Right through the sky
Never dreamed I'd find something to lift me so high

But I wasn't ready to fly

Restless, hopeless, and misunderstood
Like so many others I know
