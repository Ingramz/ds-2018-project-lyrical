Rufus Reid,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2005
Rufus Reid,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",The Crying Blues,2010
Rufus Reid Quintet,"Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

I'll be right there, I've got my fair
When I see that rusty haired conductor man
I'll grab him by the collar and I'll holler ""Alabam'! Alabam'!""

Rufus Thibodeaux,"Railroad, steamboat, river and canal
Yonder comes a sucker, and he's got my gal
And she's gone, gone, gone
And she's gone, gone, gone
And I'll bid her my last farewell

I fell in love with a pretty little thing
I thought that wedding bells would ring
She was as sweet as sweet could be
'Till I found out what she did to me

Railroad, steamboat, river and canal
Yonder comes a sucker, and he's got my gal
And she's gone, gone, gone
And she's gone, gone, gone
And I'll bid her my last farewell

I asked her mother to let her go
She whispered, Mother, please tell him no
Though he may think that I am true
There're plenty more who think so too

Railroad, steamboat, river and canal
Yonder comes a sucker, and he's got my gal
And she's gone, gone, gone
And she's gone, gone, gone
And I'll bid her my last farewell

Now I won't cry my life away
Some other sucker will have to pay
And when he finds that she is gone
I guess I'll hear him sing this song

Rufus Thibodeaux,"If I
Had wings
Like an angel
Over these
Prison walls
I would fly
You know I'd fly
To the arms of my darling
And there
I would stay
'Til I die

Take my wife
My child
And your own mother
We would just
Sit and sleep
Each day
It's alone and so lonely
In this prison
But for wrongs
I have done
I must pay

You know I'm lost
Like a ship
On the ocean
That has lost
All its crew
In a gale
I got drunk
And I shot
My best buddy
.
Now I must
Spend my life in jail

Though if I
Had the wings of an angel
Over these
Prison walls
I would fly
You know I'd fly
To the arms of my darling
And there
I would stay
'Til I die",The Prisoners Song,2002

Follow the river
Where do I go
Follow the gulls

Where is the something
Where is the someone
That tells me why I live and die

Where do I go
Follow the children
Where do I go
Follow their smiles

Is there an answer
In their sweet faces
That tells me why I live and die

Follow the wind song
Follow the thunder
Follow the neon in young lovers' eyes

Down to the gutter
Up to the glitter
Into the city 
Where the truth lies

Where do I go
Follow my heartbeat
Where do I go
Follow my hand

Where will they lead me
And will I ever
Discover why I live and die

Why do I live (beads, flowers)
Why do I die (freedom, happiness)
Tell my why (beads, flowers)
Tell me where (freedom, happiness)
Tell my why (beads, flowers)
Tell me why (freedom!)

It was on a Sunday morn'

One little measly hare
On his way returning home

Bear walked around, stood on the ground
He walked straight to the preacher, you see
Preacher got so excited
And then he ran up a Sycamore tree

Bear walked around, stood on the ground
The preacher crawled out on a limb
Cast his eye to the Lord above
And these are words he said to Him

He said, ""Oh Lord, oh, Lord, Lord
You delivered Daniel in the lion's den
Samson strong and the hundred men
Hebrew children in the furnace of fire""

""David went to kill the lion
The good book do declare
But Lord, if they don't help me
Don't You help this big black bear""

I think it was all night
Said, ""Oh Lord, if You don't help me
Treat us both alright""

You should've seen him getting that razor out
Before he struck the ground

He struck the ground cuttin' left and right
He put up a very good fight

And remember when I moved in you?
The holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

Days into night
All I did dream was my baby

Until the day
Darkness entwined
With silver eyes
Was my baby staring at me

And since then I can't see straight
And since then my smile's been fake
Funny I know, the troubles I've seen
But through one eye only that's clear

If you bring along your needles
Then I'll bring my sharpened pencils
And draw one more comic tragedy

So call up the child players
From madam we'll rent the parlor
And dance to death
Till I can't see

Many a twisted features
Made a terrible beauty

And then I knew, I'd been there before

Is that the pockets
Don't hold any more sunken treasures

Rufus Wainwright,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

There's a pale drooping maiden who foils her life away
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er.
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.

You're such a wonder that I think I'll stay in bed

That I think I'll sleep instead

Thousand surfers, whiffs of freon
And big nights back east with Rhoda

A little bit thicker, a little bit harmful for me

Have to eat them all in just one sitting
Everything it seems I like's a little bit sweeter
A little bit fatter, a little bit harmful for me

And then there's those other things
Which for several reasons we won't mention
Everything about 'em is a little bit stranger
A little bit harder, a little bit deadly

Tends to make one part
So brokenhearted

Sitting here remembering me
Always been a shoe made for the city
Go ahead accuse me of just singing about places
With scrappy boys faces, have general run of the town

Playing with prodigal sons
Takes a lot of sentimental valiums
Can't expect the world to be your Raggedy Andy
While running on empty, you little old doll with a frown

You got to keep in the game
Retaining mystique while facing forward
I suggest a reading of a lesson in tightropes
Or surfing your high hopes or adios Kansas

Tends to make one part
So brokenhearted

Is there anyone else who's too
In love with beauty
Playing all of the games
And thinks three's company

Is there anyone else who has slightly mysterious bruises
I don't know what it is
Sick of looking around at friendly faces

All declaring a war on far off places
Is there anyone else who is through
With complaining about what's been done unto us

So I knock on the door
And I am on a train
Going god knows where to
To get me over, to get me over

Get me heaven or hell, Calais or Dover
I was hoping the train was my big number
Taking the Santa Fe and the Atchison Topeka

Looking like a hag
And start giving me something
A love that is longer than a day
Start making my heart sing something that it doesn't want to say

I'm handing it over, I'm saying that you're the only one
Don't run for the border, turn that corner
Already you've run in movies of myself
Darling don't you ever let me go
Wrap your loving arms around me
While the cold winds blow

Tell me what I really want to know
â??Cause I'm looking for a reason, a person, a painting
A Saturday Evening Post Edition by Jesus
An old piece of bacon never eaten by Elvis

So I'll say start giving me something
A love that is longer than a day

In the shadow of love
Under the trees of happiness
You walk alone like a baby unborn
Like a father unknown
Like a pocket penniless

I'm happy that you really care
But do you really know how scary
This is for you and is for me?
Oh do you really know?
Do you really know?

Oh Natasha, all I can do
Is write a song for you
Natasha, oh Natasha for you

I sit alone on the cozy ground floor
On a bench by the garden waiting also
Waiting for love
And thinking of all of
The catty remarks I also swallow

And as I've often asked before
Does anybody know how scary
This is for you and is for me
Does anybody know, anybody know",Natasha,2003

And put away your posies
I don't want to have a drink 
Or play ring around the Rosie with you

Oh, the hours we are separate

Rufus Wainwright,"When the earth was still flat, and the clouds made of fire 
And mountains stretched up to the sky, sometimes higher 
Folks roamed the earth like big rolling kegs 
They had two sets of arms, two sets of legs 
They had two faces peering out of one giant head 
And they could watch all around them 
And they talked while they read 
And they never knew nothing of love 
It was before the origin of love 
Origin of love 
And there were three sexes then 
One that looked like two men glued back to back 
Called the children of the sun 
And similar in shape and girth were the children of the earth 
They looked like two girls rolled up in one 
And the children of the moon were like a fork shoved on a spoon 
They were part sun, part earth, part daughter, part son 
Origin of love 
Now the gods grew quite scared of our strength and defiance 
And Thor said: 
""I'm gonna kill them all with my hammer 
Like I killed the giants."" 
And Zeus said: 
""No, you better let me use my lightning, like scissors 
Like I cut the legs off whales 
And dinosaurs into lizards."" 
Then he grabbed up some bolts 
And he let out a laugh, said: 
""I'll split them right down to the middle 
Gonna rip them right in half."" 
And then storm clouds gathered above 
Into great balls of fire 
And the fire shot down 
From the sky in bolts 
Like shining blades of a knife 
And it ripped right through the flesh 
Of the children of the sun 
And the moon, and the earth 
And some Indian god 
Sewed the wound up into a hole 
Pulled it 'round to our belly 
To remind us of the price we pay 
And Osiris and the gods of the Nile 
Gathered up a big storm 
To blow a hurricane 
To scatter us away 
In a flood of wind and rain 
And a sea of tidal waves 
To wash us all away 
And if we don't behave 
They'll cut us down again 
And well be hopping round on one foot 
Looking through one eye 
Last time I saw you 
We had just split in two 
You were looking at me, and I was looking at you 
You had a way so familiar 
But I could not recognize 
'Cause you had blood on your face 
And I had blood in my eyes 
But I could swear by your expression 
That the pain down in your soul 
Was the same as the pain down in mine 
That's the pain 
Cuts a straight line down through the heart 
We call it love 
So we wrapped our arms around each other 
Trying to shove ourselves back together 
We were making love 
It was a cold dark evening such a long time ago 
When by the mighty hand of Jove 
It was the sad story 
How we became lonely two-legged creatures 
It's the story of 
The origin of love 
That's the origin of love, origin of love, origin of love",The Origin of Love,2003

By the light that switches on

And I wash it down with pop
I eat leftovers with mash potatoes

Never thought my hair'd be turning to gray
It used to be so dark, so dark

No more candlelight, no more romance
No more small talk when the hunger's gone
No more candlelight, no more romance
No more small talk when the hunger's gone

Never thought that I'd end up like this

Never thought I'd be without a kiss

No more small talk when the plate is clean

My dear mother's eyes
A brown horse's mane
And my uncle's name
You walked me down 14th Street
For the doctor to meet after thoughts of the grave
In the home of the brave and of the weak

But why'd you have to break all my heart
Couldn't you have saved a little bit of it?
Why'd you have to break all my heart?
Couldn't you have saved a minor part?

I could have clipped and saved and planted in the garden
Damn you guess I'll have to get a new one

I'd love to sit and watch you drink
With the reins to the world, gripping a smoke
Vaguely missing link
Don't ever change you hungry little bashful hound
I got the sheep, poor little Bo Peep
Has lost and filed for grounds.

But why'd you have to break all my heart
I could have ripped apart and thrown into the river
Wonder if there's hearts that will deliver

Don't ever change, don't ever worry
Because I'm coming back home tomorrow
To 14th Street where I won't hurry
And where I'll learn how to save, not just borrow
And they'll be rainbows and we will finally know",14th Street [Live],2004

Till the dark clouds have all blown away

It's the one thing we needed maybe now even more
Love's the secret we've been looking for

There a cold wind blowing but I know love is strong
There will come a day when the sorrow is gone

Thou knowest not my dim-witted friend, the picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow and thy tousled hair conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere, and slightly dopey gent

You're my funny valentine, sweet, comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable,
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?

So, don't change a hair for me, not if you care for me

Rufus Wainwright,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day

Inspires affection
It's queer that here
He can't cast his spell
In her direction
Somewhere near
One senses fear
Casanova in Hell

The girl is naked
The boy is naked
He hides inside
A secret chamber, there to gape
Through a velvet drape
And dream of rape
Casanova in Hell

Her sharp suggestion
He couldn't get an erection
Came as a shock
He finds himself
A laughing stock
His ageing fate
To contemplate
Casanova in Hell

Back in the library
His revenge is his story
What he will write
Will recall the bite
Of his wit and legendary appetite
The sybarite
Casanova is well

For Casanova has the last laugh
Creates the myth and vindication
Of his sexual vocation
Makes the definitive collection
His lives and lovers and above all
His erection
Will live in history",Casanova in Hell,2006

You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street

Those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say

I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception

And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself and said, ""Well, never mind
We are ugly but we have the music""

And then you got away, yeah, didn't you babe

These are just a couple of my cravings
Everything it seems I like's a little bit stronger
A little bit thicker, a little bit harmful for me

If I should buy jellybeans
Have to eat them all in just one sitting
Everything it seems I like's a little bit sweeter
A little bit fatter, a little bit harmful for me

And then there's those other things
Which for several reasons we won't mention
Everything about 'em is a little bit stranger, a little bit harder
A little bit deadly

So brokenhearted

Always been a shoe made for the city
Go ahead accuse me of just singing about places
With scrappy boys faces have general run of the town

Playing with prodigal sons
Takes a lot of sentimental Valiums
Can't expect the world to be your Raggedy Andy
While running on empty you little old doll with a frown

You got to keep in the game
Retaining mystique while facing forward
I suggest a reading of a lesson in tightropes
Or surfing your high hopes or adios Kansas

But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love, and don't I show it?
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold, I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot

Words to get off his chest

Saw you sittin' there being a sad culprit

Rufus Wainwright,"Who will be at Sanssouci tonight?
The boys that made me lose the blues tonight, and then my eyesight
All together, playing games of cards
Gambling the tiny shards of brass, once my heart

Who will be at Sanssouci tonight?
I'm looking through the window from the garden
Waiting for the call to my hotel room
I'm tired of writing elegies to boredom
I just want to be at Sanssouci tonight

Who will be at Sanssouci tonight?
Surely not the one that loves me truly, only
He's probably down at the stables, there
Gently polishing my cabriolet, only
I don't care, I really want to go

So I'm opening the doorway to the ballroom
Callin' up some dude from my hotel room
I'm tired of writing elegies in general
I just want to be at Sanssouci tonight
Tonight, tonight

The candles seem to all have been blown out
Cupid's wings have cobweb rings and no one's about
Could it be I came to the wrong place?
But I swear I saw them climb the stairs, that sweet mystery
Who will be at Sanssouci tonight?

It's only when you're outside that you notice
Only through the window you can see them
Once the door is open all will vanish
Ain't nobody at Sanssouci tonight
Tonight, tonight",Sanssouci,2007
Rufus Wainwright,"Do I love you because you treat me so indifferently?
Or is it the medication?
Or is it me?

Do I love you because you don't want me to rub your back?
Or is it the medication?
Or is it you?
Or is it true?

[Chorus]
And I better be prominently featured in your next slide show
Because I paid a lot of money to get you over here, you know?
And if I am not prominently featured in your next slide show
I don't know what I'm gonna do

Do I love you, or is this feeling just a little pain?
A treasure chest is broken, easily open
And usually I am such a happy prince
Behind the iron curtain, the city wall's a solid prison

[Chorus]

Do I love you?
Do I love you?

Won't you walk me through it all, darling?
Doesn't matter if it is raining
Won't you walk me through it all?

Even if the sun, it is blazing
Even if the snow, it is raging
All the elements we must conquer
To get to the other side of town

I have suffered shipwreck against your dark brown eyes
I have run aground against your broken down smiles
Believe me when I tell you I have no place to go
But to go where the wild flowers grow and the stone gardens bloom
(And the stone gardens bloom...)

Won't you walk me through the tiergarten?
Won't you walk me through it all, darling?

Rufus Wainwright,"You taste of potato chips in the morning
Your face has the Marlon Brando club calling
And who would have thought that I'd owe it all to Tulsa?
And that fat guy with the green shirt that we both signed together
Once he hears the song, won't live it down forever

Your suit was the whitest thing since you-know-who
I fear that that savior I have mentioned may be you
And who would have thought that I'd owe it all to Tulsa?
And that poor girl who waited in the rain for hours to meet me (not you, baby)
Once she hears that song, won't live it down completely

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do? What to do? What to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost its charm

And through foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhere",A Foggy Day,2007

Crying when I must, and laughing when I choose
Hey ho, if love were all
I would be lonely

I believe the more you love a man
The more you put your trust, the more you're bound to lose
Although, when shadows fall,
I think if only somebody splendid really needed me
Someone affectionate and dear
Cares would be ended if I knew that he wanted to have me near

But I believe that since my life began

The winds grow colder, suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away

No more his eager call, the writings on the wall
The dreams you've dreamed have all gone astray

The man that won you has run off and undone you
That great beginning has seen a final inning
Don't know what happened, it's all a crazy game

No more that all-time thrill, for you've been through the mill
And never a new love will be the same

Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools, and where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher, it's lonelier and tougher
With hope you'll burn up, tomorrow he might turn up

Like a bell that is ringing for me

And from the way that I feel when that bell starts to peel
I could tell I was falling, I would swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love, almost like being in love
It's almost, it's almost...

But, this can't be love, because I feel so well
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs
This can't be love, I get no dizzy spells
My head is not in the sky

My heart does not stand still, hear it beat?
This is too sweet to be love

This can't be love because I feel so well
And yet I love to love, glad I'm alive
Love to live, think I'll survive

There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over that rainbow, skies are blue

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Or the ball where she gives it her all

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do? What to do? What to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost its charm

What a break, for Heaven's sake

Crying when I must, and laughing when I choose

Rufus Wainwright,"The night is bitter, the stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder, suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away

No more his eager call, the writings on the wall
The dreams you've dreamed have all gone astray

The man that won you has run off and undone you
That great beginning has seen a final inning
Don't know what happened, it's all a crazy game

No more that all-time thrill, for you've been through the mill
And never a new love will be the same

Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools, and where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher, it's lonelier and tougher
With hope you'll burn up, tomorrow he might turn up
There's just no letup, the livelong night and day

There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over that rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star,
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me

Or the dance that's a dream of romance

Or the bride with the guy on the side
Or the ball where she gives it her all

By the skirt who is doing him dirt

Rufus Wainwright,"The lady comes to the gate dressed in lavender and leather
Looking north to the sea she finds the weather fine
She hears the steeple bells ringing through the orchard
All the way from town
She watches seagulls fly, silver on the ocean
Stitching through the waves, the edges of the sky

Many people wander up the hills from all around you
Making up your memories and thinking they have found you
They cover you with veils of wonder as if you were a bride
Young men holding violets are curious to know if you have cried
And tell you why and ask you why any way you answer

Lace around the collars of the blouses of the ladies
Flowers from a Spanish friend of the families
The embroid'ry of your life holds you in and keeps you out but you survive
Imprisoned in your bones behind the isinglass windows of your eyes

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone

Even now by the gate with your long hair blowing
And the colors of the day that lie along your arms
You must barter your life to make sure you are living
And the crowd that has come, you give them the colors
And the bells and wind and the dream

Will there never be a prince who rides along the sea and the mountains
Scattering the sand and foam into amethyst fountains
Riding up the hills from the beach in the long summer grass
Holding the sun in his hands and shattering the isinglass?

Day and night and day again the people come and go away forever
While the shining summer sea dances in the glass of your mirror
While you search the waves for love and your visions for a sign
The knot of tears around your throat is crystallizing into your design

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone, come away alone with me",Albatross,2008

I'm in love, but let's not talk about it
There's so much to tell you

I believe in freedom
Freedom's apparently all I need
But who's ever been free in this world?
Who has never had to bleed in this world?

All I need are your eyes
Your nose was always too big for your face
Still, it made you look kinda sexy
More like someone who belongs in the human race

Where you been, Zebulon?
Let's meet up, why not tonight?
In the lane behind the schoolyard
And we'll have some tea and ice cream",Zebulon,2010

My brother will be there at the door (waves upon the tropical shore)

My maiden aunts mind is vicious (gosh your lips are delicious)

You've really been grand (i thrill when you touch my hand)

Sissi was the anarchist empress of Austria
And I was in the same state that she was in
Thinking over it over it how can I get over it
And where the hell’s that fan

After another induction to the hall of famine
I closed the magazine
Thinking over and over it how can I get over it
And be German and mean
Jenny was a pirate and Jane was beheaded and Nina was a sweet nymphomaniac
And with them in my corner I’m sure that it’s a tall order
To find that perfect man

Trying to make all the roses bloom in unison
Say I’m gonna blow you away
Making all of the roses bloom so step away

After another unveiling of the bright red herring
I walked down Rufus Street
Thinking over it over it how can I get over it
And where in the world will I meet
That literary, lean, stripe suited lover
I’ve read about all of my life
Which I fear is a ruse and explains
All the walks through all the parks of Europe
And why I never will tell you “I love you”
And why there is just but
A vision of perfect man

When all your dreams slipped out your hands

We started talkin'
As if nobody else exist
With her bleach blond hair and her cold hard stare
And her lucky 13 on her wrist

And all night long, I play my song
Until she broke down in tears
Oh it's just the same, caught up in the game
Of life so homemade my dear

Love to watch her floating
Hoping that she drifts my way
All those waves drown her sorrow
She'll need me tomorrow
So what's another empty day
But all my friends, they see the end
She's been doing this for years
But I swear I know, that her heart can grow
Beyond that lonely little life that she fears

'Cause all I need is time
All I need is time

I just want the chance to let that little ballerina come dance
I know it's hard to find romance
When all your dreams slipped out your hands
Oh darlin'

You've been trying so hard
For all of your life
Never got it quite right
This I know
Oh you say you need it slow
Or you just lose control
Baby if I find the way
To take off your mind away from the cold
Just tell me that you'll go, oh

I just want the chance to let that little ballerina come dance
I know it's hard to find romance
When all your dreams slipped out your hands

Me one dime, and her two nickels

There were some mothers on the show that decided to screw their daughters' boyfriends
The daughters were mad, and the boyfriends were glad
Because they got an education by burnin' the candle at both ends

Rugburns,"We lived on Holliston Street in the sixties
We didn't need much back then, just a smile
And daddy would sing
And buy us ice cream
And we would listen

Uncle Louie would come over for dinner on Sundays
He taught piano to my sister, Kath
And I'd stand behind
And imitate him
And she would laugh
And he'd get mad

And if I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't rush the growing old
I'd take the flu, the measles, and the blues
And I guess I'd do as I was told

Kathy would walk up ahead, and I'd follow
She seemed so big back then, and me so small
And mommy would give
Me one dime, and her two nickels
And I would cry
'cause she got more

And if I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't rush the growing old
I'd take the flu, the measles, and the blues
And I guess I'd do as I was told

They let us stay up real late to watch Ed Sullivan
We saw The Beatles two times that year
And daddy would laugh
And say, look at that dumb hair!
But I liked John
Man, I loved John

And I'd give up candy for lent in the springtime
And mama was proud
And so were the nuns
I thought it was okay to eat the candy
If the wrapper was on
I was just sucking out the juices
The juices of life

And if I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't rush the growing old
I'd take the flu, the measles, and the blues

In the women's bathroom at the oceanside bus station
A constipated woman barged in on me and said
Eeek! a boy! get out before I call queer nation!

And they said, what's with this guy?

And my heart was beating louder than the drums at the tip of zimbabwe
They never taught me nothin' 'bout this in catholic school
They only said if I was bad, I would incur the wrath of mr. yahweh

Well I watched Oprah the other day
There were some mothers on the show that decided to screw their daughters' boyfriends
The daughters were mad, and the boyfriends were glad
Because they got an education by burnin' the candle at both ends
Oprah's dress was canary yellow
And I think that she fancied that fellow
And the crotch in his corduroys bulged
And the truth it was soon divulged
When they taught us 'bout love

California with his girlfriend, Julie, when he decided one day, 
""Hey, Jule, let's move up north
To northern California where the air is clear 
And the skies are blue and they have more traditional family values
What do say Jule?"" 
So they loaded up their car and they moved up north 
To the Santa Cruz mountains near the Byantine Winery 
Into a one bedroom trailer behind the bowling alley
Two blocks from the supermarket
One more block to the south

John applied for a job at Dick's Automotive and 
Dick came to the door and he said, 
""Tell me Johnny boy. Can you rotate the tires on a '72 Subaru?"" 
He said, ""No."" ""Well then, can you change the oil in a '76 Pinto?"" 
He said, ""No."" ""Well can you rebuild a holly four-barrelled 
Carburetor on a '69 Camaro with a big 'ol hearse shift rod?"" 
And he said, ""Um, no."" 
""Do you have a girlfriend with long, red, curly hair. 
Creamy, milk-white thighs. 
Big full lips. 
Biceps like Henry Rollings? 
And can she just scream like a hyena in the summer?""

John studied real, real hard. 
He learned how to rotate the tires on a '72 Subaru. 
He learned how to change the oil in all the Pinto's. 
And he learned how to rebuild that holly four-barrelled carburetor on a '69 Camaro. 
And much, much more than that. 
He learned how to make love with his girlfriend, 
Julie like a real man oughta. 
And Dick gave him his service stripes and he said, 
""There's a little old lady and her car's broken down up near the Byantine Winery. 
You gotta help her man. 
Go Sheba, Go. Rrraah, Rrraah."" 
So he sent him on his way and about that time Dick glued back in his dentures, 
glued back on his toupee, 
stood in front of the mirror and said, 
""I feel sexy! I wonder what Julie's doin' all alone in that trailer. 
I bet she's having trouble opening up a can of peaches right now. 
I'll bring along my blowtorch just to see if she needs help."" 
So he hiked a block down the road to the one bedroom trailer 
Behind the bowling alley and he knocked on the door. 
And Julie answered the door and she said, ""Oh, hello
Dick, I was just having trouble opening up a can of peaches. 
C'mon in."" 
So he started up the blowtorch (bwooh) 
And all the peach juice ran down his veins. 
And he poured it in the Tupperware that Julie used to sell in Ocean Beach. 
And he said,

We're goin' on a picnic [x8]

So he loaded Julie into his '57 Chevy and he drove her up right near the winery. 
Into the middle of the forest he took her. 
And he tied her up to a tree. And cut half of her top down. 
And he said, ""Stick out your tongue."" 
Then he put on forty-two and a half tabs of brown acid that he still had from his Woodstock days. Sprickled a little paote on her tongue just for good measure. 
She saw all kinds of colors. 
Lemon yellow, orange orange, cherry red, kaleidoscope eyes. 
The world was on fire. 
And about that time there was a mommy deer walking through the forest with a baby deer. 
And Dick cut down Julie's arm and he poured in some granola 
And he mixed it up with stricnine poison and he said, 
""Oh, c'mere little deer. 
I have some food for you. Look at Julie."" 
And the mommy deer said, 
""Oh, I better eat it first because it could be poisonous 
And my heart is much stronger than yours, child."" 
But really the mommy deer was just a glutton and wanted all the food. 
And the mommy deer stuck her little mommy snout into Julie'
s palm and it licked it. 
Mmmm. Mmmm. And it said, ""oh, go ahead, eat some."" 
But the mommy's heart was much stronger 
And when the baby deer stuck her tongue into the palm of Julie's hand and licked, it died. 
Flat shooby doo wop down. 
And the mommy deer died shortly thereafter. 
Zippity doo wah out on the ground. 
And Dick cut Julie down from the tree and he looked at the dead deer at his feet. 
And he grabbed her around the neck and pushed his tongue right down her mouth. 
And he said, ""Wow, nature's so bitchin'!""

'Bout that time John was driving back down the road 
Feeling really good about helping that little old lady out. 
And he saw Dick's '57 Chevy parked on the side of the road he said, 
""Wow, he could be in trouble. 
I'd better bring along a chainsaw, 
A blowtorch and an icepick just to see if he needs help."" 
Then he said, ""Whoa, that looks like the afghan sweater that 
Julie's grandma knitted us last summer in Ocean Beach. 
What's Julie doing here?"" 
And he hiked through the forest. 
And he saw the love of his life on a dirty brown piece of Berber carpet. 
Dick's dentures on the ground chattering. 
His toupee being carried off by the squirrels and cockroaches. 
And he saw red and he started up a blowtorch (bwooh). 
Then he welded their bodies together, 
Took an icepick out of a secret manilla envelope, 
Stabbed them fifty-seven times. 
Started up a chainsaw (br-r-r-r-r), 
cut off Dick's ankle. 
Put his foot right in his mouth and says, 
""Look's like you put your foot in your mouth one last time, Dickie Boy!"" 
Then he looked at the dead deer at their feet and he picked them up. 
And he gave the mommy deer mouth to mouth resuscitation, but to no avail. 
The mommy deer was dead. 
And he gave the baby deer mouth to mouth resuscitation and the baby deer came back to life. 
Charles Bronsan had tears in his eyes, 
I guess 'cause nature had been vindicated. 
David Coresh was selling barbequed ribs on the side. 
The mommy deer still was dead. And he said,

Mommy deer dead, baby deer alive [x4]

When the weather man said he couldn't grant us a reprieve

Well you test me every day you're like a bug up my nose
I swear I'm gonna leave you, but you keep me on my toes

If the sun comes up tomorrow, then I guess I'll take your cuffs off

Qu'il chante ou qu'il gronde, pourvu qu'il existe
Je veux voir des villes, qu'elles soient blanches ou rouges
Et des yeux qui brillent, et des gens qui bougent

Sai da frente por favor, estou entre a espada e a parede.

a new day is dawning sunny and bright.
But after I've been crying all night the sun is cold

Since I lost my baby, since I lost my baby.

Birds are singing and the children are playing,
there's plenty of work and the bosses are paying.
Not a sad word should my young heart be saying,
but fun is a bore and with money I'm poor.
Since I lost my baby, since I lost my baby.

Next time I'll be kinder, won't you please help me find her?
Someone just remind her 'bout this love she left behind her.
'Til I find her I'll be tryin' now, ev'ry day I'm  more inclined to find her,
inclined to find her, inclined to find my baby.

Our little technicolor hideaway

Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los Diecisiete (To Feel Seventeen Again),1994

For them who pause, you got to get out of the midst
Split teeth grit, but your shit don't mean SHIT

Beware of the vocal when I'm shinin' like gold
Get fold, I'ma slip into dangerous mode

the loom and my attitude swells and a phone can't cop
No please don't freeze lyrics are run to siege
I'm known as a mess, when I rhyme silly pleas
Bad boy big mouth, I smack your waist out
With a birds blow, when the weather gets kinda cold
Use an instructive tongue or you get flunked

And like clit detention, I need more affection
Thinking things with appeal of redemption
Soak the attention I gets no detention

Steppin through the city at night, with the ? and two mic
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs

And if dem tie me off, dem can call me Cedro
I put a rap to singalong in all de ? crew
And if da gal a bitch ? ? the rainbow

Tear your face off the planet, leavin' one-third damaged
With you back cracked the earth canvas, leavin' mountains slanted
Rock the earth of the axle, crabs who

Puttin' dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws

Take over your party, slam dance with you hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us

Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms

You rappers doodoo, baby shit, just basic boo boo
I’m Shaka Zulu, Mansa Musa, my money buku
My beats is bangin’, fuck what you rappin’, who produced you?
I slapped the snot, take what ya got and Run The Jewels you

You itsy bitsy furry fright and frickin' sickly
A little prickly, dick on display for Winter swimming
Look at these kitties, Mike, I'mma rat-a-tat 'em for living
I deal in dirty work, do the deed and then dash, ditch 'em
I'd lend a hand but they stuck in a fist and gun position
We run our brand where destruction's the number one commitment
It’s all a joke between mom contractions and coffin fittings
So we disappear in the smoke like we're fuckin' magicians

No hocus pocus, you simple suckers been served a notice
Top of the morning, my fist to your face is fucking Folgers
We might be giants, standing on little dandy shoulders
You punks is pussy proverbial pansy panty holders
I Jake the Snake ‘em, DDT ‘em in mausoleums
Macabre massacres killing cunts in my colosseum
They all actors, giving top in back of a BM
I’d fall back if the casting calls are ending in semen

I'm the foulest, no need for any evaluations
I'm a phallus for Johnson and Jimmy spraying faces
Any cow that is sacred will get deface'd
Like any tyrant murderer gets replaced, face it
The fellows at the top are likely rapists
But you like ""Mellow out man, just relax, it's really not that complicated""
Well pardon me, I guess I'm just as sane as you explain'ed
Or maybe sanctifying the sadistic is derange'd

Psychotics use it then lose it, junkies simply abuse it

I probably smell like a pound when they put me in a coffin

A dirty boy who come down on a side of dissonance
I can't even relax without sirens off in the distances

The only solace I have is the act of conjugal visitin'

My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Go mane and missin' my misses, they keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain, the villain is givin' vision
The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious
Liars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons

This is clearly not life's design
Figure out quickly that nothing gets answered
When you ask the universe why
Life is a journey, to live is to worry
To love is to lose your damn mind
But living's a blessing so I am not stressing
'Cause some of my friends ain't survived
That's the release, but in much bigger pieces, I'm living on limited time
Like how do you look in the eyes of a friend and not cry when you know that they're dying?
How do you feel 'bout yourself when you know that sometimes you had wished they were gone?
Not because you didn't love 'em but just because you felt too weak to be strong
You couldn't bear to see someone who prided themselves on the strength to feel weak
The cruelty of randomness, hold it for ransom, that life will not fade in your dreams
You see that they're fighting and know that they're losing but still you make jokes and you laugh
'Cause you know despite all the sadness that you better get the good times while they last
Now every new word that they speak you are already feeling like it’s in the past
And when they all gone you just try to move on 'cause the memory's hurting too bad
Grown up so much and I wonder who you'd've become if you stuck for a while
Just know that I love you, good friend, ain't forget you, and when I remember I smile

And I guess I'd say I'll see you soon
But the truth is that I see you now
Still talk to you like you're around
And I guess I say you left too soon
But the truth is that you never left
'Cause I never let myself forget

An eye for an eye, and a tooth for the tooth
Will leave us all mumbling and blind
So we stumble blind through depths of the dark
Looking for something divine
Life is a journey, to live is to suffer
And I have been suffering through mine
But living's a blessing so I ain't no stressing
'Cause some of my niggas ain't 'round
And he got no drama but his baby mama is still on my line and she cryin'
I searched for the words to give her some comfort for her soul and spirit and mind
I tell her that it'll be fine
But deep down I know that I'm lying
The family came took rings and his chains
The bank took the house and the rights
The only thing left was his child, and she had a smile in his eyes
So much to the soul, when the grandmama kept her, she'd look at her sometime and cry
The very next day she cried
And day after day she cried
Then called baby mama and told her ""I'm sorry, can't keep her no more, I have tried""
No killer was captured, but I know he listening
So I'd like to tell you in song
The streets was a jungle, I pray that you made it, I hope that you righted your wrongs
I hope that you learn, I hope that you changed so your mama won't know this pain
So my homie's name will mean something more than a nigga got killed for a chain

And I guess I'd say I'll see you soon
But the truth is that I see you now
Still talk to you like you're around
And I guess I say you left too soon

Run-D.M.C.,"Two years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some emcee rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say,
The rhyme was Def and it went this way

Took a test to become an emcee
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac,
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

Dave cut the record down to the bone,
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
And then we're talking autographs, years of laughs,
Champagne, caviar, and bubble baths

You see, that's the life that I lead, and
You sucker MC, this is who I be
So take that and move back, catch a heart attack
Because there's nothing in the world, that Run will ever lack

I cold chill at a party in a be	-boy's stance,
And rock on the mike and make the girls want to dance
Fly like a dove, they come from up above,
I'm rockin on the mike and you can call me Run Love.

I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill'
So if you see me cruisin' girls just move or step aside
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride

It's on a, ah first come, first serve basis
Coolin out girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your people's delight
And for you sucker emcee, you just ain't right

Because you're bitin all your life, you're cheatin on your wife
You're walkin round town like a hoodlum with a knife
You're hangin on the ave, chillin' with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through

Ah with the one two three, three to two one
My man Larry Larr, my name DJ Run
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass
I'm rockin to the rhythm won't you watch it on my face

Go Uptown and come down to the ground
You sucker emcee's, you sad face clown
You're a five-dollar boy and I'm a million dollar man
You're a sucker emcee, and you're my fan

You try to bite rhymes, all lines are mine
You're a sucker emcee in a pair of Calvin Kleins
Comin' from the wackest part of town,
Tryin to rap but you can't get down

You don't even know your English, your verbs or noun
You're just a sucker emcee you sad-faced clown
So DMC if you're ready, the people rockin' steady
You're drivin big cars, get your gas from Getty

I'm DMC in the place to be, I go to St. John's University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge,
And after 12th grade I went straight to college
I'm light skinned, I live in Queens

And I love eatin chicken and collard greens
I dress to kill, I love to style
I'm the emcee you know who's versatile
Say I got good credit in your regards

Got my name not numbers on my credit cards
I go Uptown, I come back home
With who? me myself and my microphone
All my rhymes are street delight

So here's another one for why'all to bite
When I rhyme I never quit,
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it
'Cause it takes a lot to entertain,

And sucker emcee's can be a pain
You can't rock a party with a hip and a hop
You gotta let em know you'll never stop
The rhymes have to make a lot of sense,

You got to know when to start (when the beats commence...",Sucker M.C.'s (Krush-Groove 1),1984

A job, a home and the perfect pay
And the world was free of greed and hate

It was a dream [wake up]

Trumpin' your fate, never peepin' the card
You just goin' through life without a trace

But that's not true for you, your life is on the brink
Of self-destruction, total corruption
You better get out or die from consumption
Sweat for a dollar, to get nothin' back
Cause at the end of the week, you still get taxed
You'd even sell your soul to make your life correct
But with the rate of inflation you should eat your check
So you try to make a hustle, to get ahead
But the only thing you manage is to stay in the red
Coppin' from John, to sell to Rex
And your jones for success has put your life in check

Or even sly
And bein' held low in the public eye

Sheer dynamite
But if you only knew the crew called you freak's delight

Wearin' the tightest jeans, and shortest skirt
You think you're cold chillin', lookin' like a jerk

Run-D.M.C.,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire

Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like cool from cool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devastating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devastating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these
PERIOD!",King of Rock [Live][*],1985
Run-D.M.C.,"I'd seen you jackin' JC cause they got him most hazed
If you know about the ladies and all his babys
You diss on his rhymes a million times
And run around town like Bonny&Clide
You see the move you're makin' the rhymes you're takin'
Will lead the heart breaking and I'm not mistaking
You like his money to be his honey
If it's truth you choose you break big dummy
Dumb girl

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl

I wish I knew why a girl like you 
was to do all the things that you do
I know you want a man but you should understand
JC ain't D just be his fan
You're not this fine you're out of your mind 
And I wrote this rhyme just for your kind
Don't be misled remember what I said
The rhymes of Rappers surely not to take in your head

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl

(Now) you are the finest girl in the whole school
but they don't call you fly because you're a fool
because you don't go to class you will not pass
you'd like to go but you're too slow because you're going to fast
And I can tell you are dump when you walk in the place
Walk around with your dump cold suckin' your face
Always sinning never winning cause you've lost your race
You get high into the line think that measures the ace

Dumb girl
Use me the girl is
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl

Now you're a typical sexteen with no real power
Ha! You funk like this a battle with ya last medium shower
Always guys call you fast but I gonna slow
Always slipping or giving somebody a blow
Giving every guy a try a way good to act
But there's a thing that you're missing
That you can't even buy
When it comes to love you even hit it by keep it
Just silly did it dump did it just played stupid

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl
(use me, stupid as ..)

I want you to listen to the words that I speak
About playing when I'm saying to never be weak
You should use you brain but you don't have one
And when it comes to ??sings?? you don't have none
YO YO you should know when I come with Run
We tell this dumb di di dumb di di di di dumb dumb

Run-D.M.C.,"Born to rock around the clock
You can't say I'm not
And in case you forgot
I'm the kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing, of rock!!

I'm the devastating mic controller d.m.c.
And can't nobody mess around with me
I'm the king of rock, rap, and a rhyme
I deal what I feel and it feels fine
If the girl's ?? chase then I will play
Around with sound put down for the rhymes I say
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together let's rock, hit it run!

You, jump, watch you clock, while I rock your spot
I'm better known to the world as the king of rock
I like to speak my piece when I'm on the mic
I'm the best, or at least, I'm the one you like
And when I serve you deserve to hear what I say
I throw a curve he got the nerve to make a triple play
Now how devastating can an MC be?
My name is Darryl, but you can call me D, hit it run!

It's called, gangsta hard rock, non-stop hip-hop
And it's headed for the top by the rhymes I pop
For every race place color country county or creed
And all of the places that I emceed
Be-boy badness to the highest degree
And it can't be-a-boy unless you be D
You can't bust a cherry or crush a grape
And if you ain't got this tape you're in bad shape
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, let's rock!

Do, you, really believe what's going on
I was conceived and I was born
I once was lost but now I'm found
Tell your bunch I'm boss I run this town
I leave all suckers, in the dust
Those dumb motherfuckers can't mess with us
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, let's rock, hit it run!

I, was, straight from the start performin' art
Climbin' up the chart while others fall apart
The three outlaws in the music trade
We won't rob but our job is to get paid
Cause run has fun if jay will play
As I add one more rhyme to say
Now how devastating can an MC be?
My name is Darryl, but you can call me D, hit it run!

I was born
Son of byford, brother of Al
Bad as my mamma and run's my pal
It's Mcdaniels, not Mcdonald's

Get down to the sound 'cause I come correct
So when I write don't bite and I might check
And if I find your behind I'll break your neck
Mr. World Rhymin' Rapper ready to have fun
You'll reason with the rekkid 'cause it's made by Run
It's def, you was left in a total stun
So bust a move while I prove who's number one
Got quality and skill both beyond belief
Do I steal? Be for real, I'm not a thief
Dictator and hater of those that beef
That's right I can fight and I'm the chief
 

[Verse Two:]

[DMC]

People in the place don't put D down
I'm the microphone master the best around
There's not too many of my type
And all rap titles I will swipe
You'll see me talkin to a girl
A sweet young thing with jheri curls
I never ever wore a braid
Got the peasiest hair and still get paid
 
[Run]

Well I'm dropping MC's with just one punch
'cause it's the baddest of the bunch so call me Capt. Crunch

Run-D.M.C.,"Now Peter Piper picked peppers, but Run rapped rhymes
Humpty Dumpty fell down, that's his hard time
Jack B. Nimble, what, nimble, and he was quick
But Jam Master was faster, Jack saw Jay's dick
Now little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep
And Rip van Winkle fell the hell asleep
And Alice stilled her hunger in Wonderland
Jack Jill busta in his hand
And Jam Master Jay is making out our sound
The turntables might wobble but they don't fall down

I got the juice and Mother Goose both did that thing
Jam Master's gettin' loose and DMC's the king
Cause he's adult entertainer, child educator
Jam Master Jay, king of the crossfader
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest
Perfect timin' when I'm climbin', I'm a rhymin' apparatus
When he cuts, girls move their butts
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts
And on the mix, real quick, and I'd like to say
He's not fat, but he's fast and his name is Jay

It goes a one, two, three and

Jay's like King Midas, as I was told
Everything that he touched, turned to gold
He's the greatest of the great, get it straight he's great
Playing fame cause his name is known in every state
His name is Jay to see him play will make you say
""Goddamn, that DJ made my day!""
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker
He's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
If cuts were his, he would be you
I'm not lying, y'all, he's the best I know
And if I lie, my nose will grow
Like the little wooden boy named Pinocchio
And you all know how the story goes!

Tricks are for kids he plays much gigs
He's the big bad wolf and you're the three pigs
He's the big bad wolf in your neighborhood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good!

There it is

We're Run-DMC, got a beat to settle
D's not Hansel, he's not Gretel
Jay's a winner, not a beginner
His pocket gets fat, other get thinner
Jump on Jay like cows on moons
People take Jay like dish and spoon
Hands like all, first hails aim
You'll see Jay again my friend!
Huh!",Peter Piper,1986
Run-D.M.C.,"You know I'm proud to be black y'all

Listen party people here's a serious song
It's right not wrong, I should say right on
I gotta tell you somethin' that you all should know
It's not a mystery it's history and here's how it go

She was a tiny black woman, when she was raised
She was livin' to be givin' there's a lot that she gave
There's not a slave, in this day and age
I'm proud to be

Don't worry bout what color I am
Because I'll show you how ill, this man can act
It could never be fiction cause it is all fact
And if you get in my way, I will not turn back
I'm proud of my name, my name is Darryl Mack
I'm black and I'm proud, and I'll say it out loud
I'll share my story with the whole crowd, augghh!

You know I'm proud to be black y'all
And that's a fact y'all
And if you try to take what's mine
I take it back y'all, it's like that

DJ Run, and I run these things
You can hear it loud and clear like when the school bell rings
Like Martin Luther King, I will do my thing
I'll say it in a rap cause I do not sing

D.M.C., the man, that's causin' the beef
I got a message for the world so listen up it's brief
Like Malcolm X said I won't turn the right cheek
Got the strength to go the length, if you want to start beef
Start beef!

You know I'm proud to be black y'all
And real brave y'all
And motherfucker I could never be a slave y'all
So take that!!""

We're gonna tell ya somethin' put your mind in a swirl
God bless the next baby that comes in this world
The world's full of hate discrimination and sin
People judgin' other people by the color of skin
I'll attack this matter, in my own way
Man, I ain't no slave, I ain't reelin' no hay
Written a deposition, in any condition
Don't get in my way cause I'm full of ambition
I'm proud to be black (and I ain't takin' no crap)
I'm fresh out the pack (and I'm proud to be black)
So take that!!

There was a man, an inventor, who invented so well
He invented a fortune, for a man named Bell
George Washington Carver, made the peanut great
Showed any man with a mind, could create
You read about Malcolm X, in the history text
Jesse Owens broke records, Ali broke necks

Now you can debate, c-c-c-concentrate
But you can't imitate D.M.C. the Great!

Dissin' all devils, causin' havoc in hell
At a very high level base and treble shall yell
Heard in the heavens are the sounds supreme
So clear to the ear it is sometimes seen
So loud like a cloud with thunder and lightening!
So proud to the crowd it is somewhat frightening!
No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed
There's no stoppin' 'cause the rockin' cannot cease, break!

You see it's harder than hard, not one bit soft
Courageous and contagious so you better break North
Not a cold, on a roll, did you hear me cough?
Just listen while I'm dissin' cause you're pissin' me off
Cold bedding is spreading all across your face
You can't take when I break and if that's the case
I'll go on, and on, and kick the bass
So back up off the cup while I take my taste

It's highly appraised when the hell is raised
So demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed
The unbelieving receiving prophecy so true
I cut the head off the Devil and I throw it at you
My mighty mic control, already brought his soul
The rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll
A black hat is my crown, symbolizin' the sound
Signifyin', we won't play around, bust it!

Rappin' and climbin' beat-makin' every day
No synthesizer sound, so silence when I say
I am great, get it straight, 'cause that's my fate
My name is Run I'm number one, that's how I rate
He's in the place with the bass, and style and grace
His name is J he's here to play, and win this race
He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D
Kind of tall yes y'all, he's down with me

From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea
The word is heard as told by D
I don't sing I bring, much delight
Like a star shinin' bright in the darkest night
If you are cold, I'll bring you heat
Like I brought the whole world my funky beat
Mysterious and serious I ain't no joke
Fire from the depths of hell and you can smell the smoke

Kickin' and tickin' while you're havin a ball
Like chicken finger lickin' I'll be vickin' you all
So do The Bird, have you heard, did they give you a call
Just me and D.M.C., cold shakin' the walls

There's no fearin' when hearin' sound of this kind
Across the land every man is goin' out of his mind
On the face of the earth spreadin' like disease
Contaminating infiltrating like a horde of bees

Lord of lyrics, duke of discussion
Ruler of rock, your king at cold-crushin'
Puller of people, controller of crowds
Lingering lyrics all lasting and loud

Left y'all, ah to the left y'all
Because I rock upon the mike real def y'all

And to the right y'all, ah to the right y'all
Because I rock upon the mike all night y'all

Breakin' all but laws, when I break fool
Cause I'm the man.. that was born to rule
Every girl in the world, and make them drool

It's easy to G, it's easy to me

And now, child, bow, and I mean it
I came, saw, kicked, and you saw it

We invented the song, and you blew it

I did, done, do, I'm this clever
I come again and win, and you'll never
See a man like me, your idol
So joke, smoke, toke, but this title
The rhyme is mine, fine, and so vital
It's time for me to rock, my recital
Gonna tell you about a groove, that's comin'
From the heart in part, and just one in
A million, or you, will be bummin'
So check the time, the rhyme, that comes from it
Inside your brain, remain, so just keep it
Plain, sane, refrain, so just peep it
Look, see it, check, but never stop it

I met her on the road in a fly hotel
High on the heels and never failed

She seemed to scheme for a dream to sell
She spent a night locked in a cell
I knew Mary well cause she 'Raising Hell'

It's not Mary who was quite, contrary
Talkin' 'bout Mary who was always in a, hurry
The things she needed were necessary
She did not need, a busted cherry
True and blue just like a blueberry
Ask if she's crazy and I'll say very

Put on my green bomber it was, freezing cold
Applied long johns with Adidas not matching

I need a little help Jay, I got a little problem
A guy like yourself, maybe you can help me solve em
I only want to know why this happens all the time
(What?)  Everywhere I go, I start to rap and rhyme
I rock them in the day (yeah you rock em every night)
I rock em when I left so def I knew something was wrong (alright)
I rhyme when I am sleeping, I rhyme when I'm awake
When I was nine I said a rhyme by putting candles on my cake
I just came from the bank (you said a rhyme?) A rhyme so funny
A song about the line so long they all gave me their money
That's why I came to you, you're my friend (yes that is true)
Said maybe Jay knows what to say, he'll tell me what to do

Hard rock hard hitting hip hop hard-core
Causing casualties and catastrophes
And tragedies for the suck emcees

Combine the hustle, foxtrot, pop and lock
Put em all together why because

Pause, the people are jammin

Livin' in the city, the crack the mack and all that
Easy does it, is it was it
The black or white that Friday night
In those racist places, let's get it right
Ah to the maximum, and keep askin' 'um
When the city gonna fix where the blacks are from
And every day around the way another one got
Bucked in his head, from a gunshot
No chance in advance for the ambulance
Cause he was just another victim of the circumstance
A brother died, the mother cried, it was a pity
But that's how it goes down when you're livin' in the city

Just a hard rock, call him a hard rock
In the metropolis there's no stoppin' this
Can't agree with society poppin' this
Disagree with the plea when they coppin' it
Some men pretend the end will come soon
They gather what they can and them BOOM
You played yourself, you made your wealth;
The deal was dealt, now your health is in question
Three Card Molly, hoodlums, who are we?
Pollution, prostitution, In God We 
Need a solution, revolution, substitution
For the thing's that we're abusing
Pity the city, for the people livin' out on the streets
Yo we homeless, the homeless need to eat
There's no progress for the rest
God bless for less

What's it all about?

They said no but
""Yo!"" ""Yes why'all!""
The people that spoke were never provoked
And now it's tumblin' down
Freedom of speech for each
Now how that sound?
Try to stop me from sayin' what I want to say

Now here we go as I flow and show and kick
Infor-mation, teach and ? reach inside the nation
And be a, seer cause I'm reason with run
And now that the point is out
Let the jam slam my man and tell me
What's it all about?

I flex my muscle, what I must do
Is bumrush you, fuck you I'll crush you
The Ku Klux Klan is fucked up
And every good man'll understand
Beginnin' and winnin', from the first fuckin' vocal
I spoke to you, I ain't no joke to you
I do what I want to do
If you don't like what me and my crew is doin' then fuck you

Took a test to become an MC 
And Orange Krush became amazed at me 
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac 
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back 
Dave cut the record down to the bone 
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone 
And then we talkin' autograph, and here's the laugh 
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath

And you sucker MC's is who I please 
So take that and move back catch a heart attack

And rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance 
Fly like a Dove, that come from up above 
I'm rockin' on the mic and you can call me Run-Love 

I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville 
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill'

Got my name not numbers on my credit cards 
I go Uptown, I come back home 
With who me myself and my microphone 
All my rhymes are sweet delight 
So here's another one for y'all to bite 
When I rhyme, I never quit 
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it 
Cause it takes a lot, to entertain

And people get their equal, hit the full one, one for growin'
Ya knowin, we're flowin in the ghetto, they get nothing
No toys for little boys, no curls for girls and turkey stuffing
They laugh, they know that half the presents ain't thick
You might just wanna ask, ""Yo, where my presents, Saint Nick?""
So think, a little 'bout the people minus money
And when you get your dough, why don't you show some kindness, honey?
Go 'head, get fed, and spread a little love
Give what you can afford just like The Lord from up above
A quote, a note, and one you won't believe
It's better to give than to receive

Think of all the prisoners that's in prison during Christmas
Not tryin' to bring you down, but tryin' to put you up on
Landed it on the table so you're able to put your cup on
No snow, not a flurry, so hurry don't you miss it
Not dissin' you, but whishin' you a very merry Christmas

I'm from the ghetto, now this mean I get
No toys or presents beneath my tree
I wrote my list, I made my wish
Is this what Christmas means to me?
No snowflakes droppin', can't go shoppin'
Rhymes I'm a-poppin', to keep the hip-hoppin'
Why can't a Santa (Pause) for the cause?
I'm gettin' mine, you gettin' yours
That's how Christmas is supposed to be
A very merry Christmas for everybody
Fight poverty, give to the needy
Don't be like The Grinch cause The Grinch, is greedy
Deck, the malls with bows of holly
'Tis the season to be jolly
No presents for my tree yet
And I don't even know if any gifts I'm gonna get
Happy holidays not like a lotta days
A few here, a few there, a new year
Season greetings are the reasons for the cheer
If Santa Claus, is coming to town
Hope it's my chimney he's coming down
On Christmas, because Christmas is
On Christmas, because Christmas is

Give up the dough! Give up the dough!
Give up the dough on Christmas, yo!
Give up the dough! Give up the dough!
Give up the dough! Here we go, here we go!

Give up the dough! Give up the dough!
Give up the dough on Christmas, yo!
Give up the dough! Give up the dough!
Give up the dough! Here we go, here we go!

Ha-have a, very merry merry, and hurry
And if you'll need a leader, Run'll be there for your flurry
Blurry sight, and write, a rhyme for the night
Christmas is the time for giving not for the type
So open, your pockets, your heart, unlock it
Dollars train from Hollis, I give it like I clock it
Cold as the weather, minus the humidity
Don't mistake, harmonies and kindness for timidity
Christmas, this must, be the time of year
Leggo of your Eggo, rather ego, me go there
And here, my dear, so give a kid a beer
'Cause every time you give, it's coming back, let's get it clear
I'll be scopin', and hopin', brothers lend a ear
So have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

Give up the dough! Give up the dough!
Give up the dough on Christmas, yo!
Give up the dough! Give up the dough!
Give up the dough! Here we go, here we go!

Give up the dough! Give up the dough!
Give up the dough on Christmas, yo!
Give up the dough! Give up the dough!
Give up the dough! Here we go, here we go!

Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

One thing I knoe is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that stretches for success will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the boys on the train, drive to school on the church
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudice
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh! (Repeat 4x)

You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is",It's Like That,1992
Run-D.M.C.,"It was December 24th on Hollis ave in the dark
When I see a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my god, an ill reindeer

But then I was illin because the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man had gone
But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn

I picket the wallet up then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said ""Santa Claus""
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of g's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease

But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right
So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and all the dough was for me

It's Christmas time in Hollis queens
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees

Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink egg nog

The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of darryl's
But each and every year we bust chrsitmas carrols

Rhymes so loud and prod you hear it
It's christmas time and we got the spirit
Jack frost chillin, the ?orchas out?
And that's what christmas is all about

The time is now, the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

My name's d.m.c. with the mic in my hand
And I'm chilling and coolin just like a snowman
So open your eyes, lend us an ear
We want to say merry christmas and happy new year!",Christmas in Hollis,1993

So check it check it out, I'm gonna rock the house
Without a doubta I'ma shout about to turn it out
So take a step back, I gotta wreck track
I got a rep for breakin' necks, I get respect black
(Damn damn!)  Darryl Mack, you're all of that
They pray they can save the crazy rat
They attack to mack to move him off the map
Could never tell I fell, to hell and back
It's beautiful, the mic makes hits
To the dirty, stinkin', son of a (uh)
I'm mad and glad and sad and highly upset
So don't do nothin' that you might regret
Cause I'll stomp that ass, like a little insect (c'mon)
Clean off my kicks (c'mon) clean off my kicks (c'mon)
Clean off my kicks and then step!

Thinkin' Run ain't the one
From eighty-three and they be seein' me and D and they front

Reel it back, come rewind it's about that time
Feelin' wack, ate the swine it's about that swine

And I am, D.M.C.
And for all of y'all
This is the way, we reckless for rhymes

You got to save it for David and wave it if you think that I gave it
I never gave a damn about a critic so save it
I run amuk demanding my opinion you make it
The critic'll get the didick and if you got it then stay with it
You never knew me but you flew me to your town see
By kickin' dollars straight to Hollis I'm off the ground B
I never heard of such where niggaz stand and I fell
I'm doin' years with this career like Patti La-Belle
And if I ever was to fall I fell upon ya
Like ?? I made my mind I come to con ya
I see females I tell them yo my word is bond huh
Like Terri Teresa Tammi Tawana Tarena and Tonya
I'm comin' hard I got your head and yeah the lock's on
I threw you up, why did your daddy ?? cock strong
I rock I wreck I rip a rhyme I ??
My rap is right I write a rip-and-ready rock song

Call on the brother to come and get dumb
Until the def drum come as they come, when they come
I said I rip some, tearin' them up, a big up
A whattup? A nigga, a so what, yeah put your bricks up
I knock down the walls because I got to
The rock sound because I hip-hop new
Not the old, gold, from around the neck
And when I grab ahold you give me nuff respect
In a black BM, with my contact lens
When the track begins, I'm setting new rap trends
Lettin' lyrics I lay down
You play loud I stay proud with Jay down you stay down
Get up on the truck song, the one you put your buck on
You're stuck on, you're luck on, you're sucked on
A lollipop sucka!
I snuck ya, I struck ya, you stupid mother

I gotta come my name is Run and me and D we been appointed
I'm ever so clever you never touch the anointed
I'm Born Again I got a friend the Lord I rearrange
But other than that I'm livin' fat and ain't nuthin' changed
Big Willie still in your grilly, you better block son
I bust you up and then I blast you with my Bop Gun
A million times rhyme risin' to the prime
While another nigga's cuts get bucks, like it's a dope rhyme
Be instead I'd rather leave another brother dead
Cause yet another brother deaded from the slow dread
I'm makin' papers, brothers catchin' vapors
Try to lick shot, you get got, catch you later
This ain't The Cosby Show you know what it's like A Different World
We're livin' inside a world where you get the cash, you hit the girl
So check the hypness, I'm not livin' like this
I'm the type of guy to bust your eye, you lose your whiteness
You comin' butt when you wish upon a star
But I could never be butt, so yo, bust the guitar

Heads up my brother, here comes another
Word to the verb the urge to discover
A lover, you hover, you smother, my brother
You can't do nothin' other than take the record out the cover
You get the song at it's strong and random flow
You sing along cause the words you heard you know
Hostile the style that style is wild
The penile is where I goes and smile
Because I pop a lot, they try to lock me up
Because I rock the block, they try to stop me up
But I'm sly as a fox I can rocks
I got smarts when they starts tradin' shots they get dropped
I pull my card I pull my card I pull my card not
I use the rock to be hard, I'm a hard rock
You get a speedknot, and then you bleed a lot
You better read a lot because you really need a lot of
Information, and some education
Cause I'm replacin' what you hearin' on your station

Cause I'm the man with the hand that rocked the cradle, uhh
A lot of punk for the chunk baby that's a bet
Album number seven and we still ain't finished yet
I didn't get old, I got better at the craft
Sat back and watched you try to kick it but you made us laugh
So get back, you already had your chance to dance
You proved you had no waist to fit in this man's pants
Word to God, I'm back fo' sho'
Hollis Queens gettin' wreck so act like you know

I need a witness to get with this, take notes
Great quotes like boats float flowin' so dope
Never givin' up hope, nope, know what I wrote

You want to ask me, can't be now or later
I'm a rough rugged person, been that way from the start
Darryl Mack got the knack to put the H in heart
(And it ain't no fun, to step to D and Run
But if you want to step up, step up and get that ass - done)
A reporter with recorder was recordin' the slaughter
As I'm peepin' 'cross the border leapin' water keepin' order
Lit it up like a spliff, get a whiff of this hit
Cause I flick em like bits, and I bust 'em like zits
Dippin' down to grip this microphone I rip this
I'm glad not sad I flipped this, now can I get a witness

Don't play like I'm bitter, when you come with your best

Run-D.M.C.,"[Run]
Back, back, back with the boom, so give a nigga room
Came with the fame with my name came a tune
The King of Rock, there is none higher
God ?? with Madonna not melodic like Mariah,
Carey, when Larry put me in his Caddy I made my album
I rock the funky beat like Marky Mark be rockin Calvin,
Klein's, no friend of mine, I told you Pryor,
Richard, switch it all around now you admire
""My Adidas"" was a hit in eighty-six it made me dollars
Stompin straight through Compton niggaz there was screamin, ""HOLLIS!""
Back to the top, you're bout to get dropped
Go for what you know or ride the bo' and get stopped
My man Darryl Mack, dressed in all black
I pass the mic to D (and D.M.C.'ll pass it back)
Rappers won't be dissin after this rap song
Cause they sing like Rodney King, ""Can't we all just get along?""

From a harder core, I'm kickin' the raw
I wreck it on tour, I'm breakin' your jaw
This is what Run-D.M.C.'ll be about y'all
I make the party people want to scream and shout y'all
I'm just a be	-boy, so watch me destroy
You best believe in you're receivin' D.M.C. boy
I used to explode, I never let go
I let the tec go back because I said so
Yeah I'm a hoodlum, but I'm a good one
So punks gunnin' for my run I wish they would come
So back up, Mr. Softy cause you're not hard
You're never comin' off because I got God
Just ?? ?? and get a beat down
Never weak kid, I come up with more street sounds
Rhymes galore and soarin' 'cross the floor an'
Some more is pourin', knockin' down your door an'

[Chorus]

C'mon and jump to the rhythm I give em is what I give 'em
When I get 'em I just hit 'em and split 'em
And when I split 'em lit 'em up like a bulb in the dark
I made you blink you figure out, cause I know you're the mark
I gotta lotta what I gotta, that'll be what I got
So step to me or D.M.C and it'll be in your heart

Bust a rap like a cap, put a hole in your soul
Take the trigger then you figured that I'm losin' control
I go loco with the vocals, yo goes the chokehold
And I broke those pros with the dope flows
I slow rolls, NO I don't smoke those
Leave the blunts for the punks in front rows

You see redline, here comes your bedtime

And Rip van Winkle fell the hell asleep.
And Alice stilled her hunger in Wonderland
Jack, Jill busta in his hand.
And Jam Master Jay is making out our sound,
The turntables might wobble but they don't fall down.

I got the juice and Mother Goose both did that thing.
Jam Master's gettin' loose and DMC's the king.
Cause he's adult entertainer, child educator,
Jam Master Jay, king of the crossfader.
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest.
Perfect timin' when I'm climbin', I'm rhymin' at fast.
When he cuts, girls move their butts.
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts.
And on the mix, real quick, and I'd like to say
He's not fat, but he's fast and his name is Jay!

It goes a one, two, three and,

Jay's like King Midas, as I was told,
Everything that he touched, turned to gold.
He's the greatest of the great, get it straight he's great.
Playing fame cause his name is known in every state.
His name is Jay to see him play will make you say,
""Goddamn, that DJ made my day!""
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker,
He's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker.
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe.
If cuts were his, he would be you.
I'm not lying, why'all, he's the best I know,
And if I lie, my nose will grow
Like the little wooden boy named Pinocchio,
And you all know how the story goes!

Tricks are for kids he plays much gigs.
He's the big bad wolf and you're the three pigs.
He's the big bad wolf in your neighborhood,
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good!

There it is,

We're Run-DMC, got a beat to settle.
D's not Hansel, he's not Gretel.

Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin' iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like cool from cool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devastating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin' but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devastating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin' hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these

Run-D.M.C.,"These are the words that I wrote so I hope that ya don't man
I'll never joke about the coke that you're smok-in
Understand you're fuckin' up, fuckin' up the block
Got shot rocked and that's just where the shit stops

What's the meaning of this?  I must be dreaming
Everybody's ?? when I see men dealing
for a rhyme or rope, or a dime of coke
Sometimes I rhyme when I'm crying broke
Many many many records broke laws, broke jaws
A few months ago I had to ""Pause""
During that time, me and my man
was chilling on the corner with a quart in our hands
A beef broke out, at Soul Kitchen spot
It was crazy Baby Pop, someone got shot
I seen him drop, then came the cops
Sayin', ""Nobody run, everybody stop""
I wanted to run, cause I was carryin' my gun
Darryl Mack packin' mine, strapped with my nine
Everyone on the wall, that's what the cop said
Everyone complied, except Bald Dread, he said,
""Blood claat boi me nah hafa deal wit dat
Yo I'm a superstar for de world dem call 'I'm Darryl Mack""
I turned around and said, ""Word up cop!""
He said, ""D.M.C., take your ass down the block""
If it happened to him, it could happen to you
cause that's what's happenin on The Avenue
when I.. ""uhh, uhh uhh, uhh.. uhh..""
""Na-na-na-na-na!  The Ave.""

Now on The Ave. (what?) people steal and they dealin' away
I got the feelin' the illin' will never ever pay
Cause on the street, you're never in the fast lane
You go to jail or get a bullet in your brain
People laugh and smile at a stick-up
A young man in a rut, shakin' a big cup
People pass his ass and say, ""Tough luck""
To waste time for a dime is cold fucked up
A loud shot in the air, not rare
A brother fell to the ground, nobody cares
You ask why, the baby cry, a man laugh
Nobody give a damn, that's how they livin' on The Ave.
Auugh!

Away from The Ave. they have what's called the backstreets
Another world of girls that crawl the backseats
Systems that are kickin', sinkin' many black beats
(This and that goin on ??? street)
I remember the time there was a jam in ???
??, the music, no ?? til after dark
That's when the shit starts happening
(Brother from The Ave. this and that again)
Body move in the back and a quarter in the jar
Find the rules by the basketball court in the park
And the ? by the bench where the forty dogs spark
The crowd crowds around like they found Noah's Ark
The young, hung, and swung on a swing
Glidin' and slidin' and ride the ding-a-ling
I didn't see a kid by the see, so he saw
(Near the monkey bars, funky cars we adore)
I'm throwin' fate to the gate ?? ??
(And my man from Japan got vicked for sure)
Do me a favor when you roll with your crew
You gotta check out, check out, The Avenue",The Ave.,1997
Run-D.M.C.,"Run.. (run..) d.. (d) m.. (m) c.. (c)
Rock.. (rock.. rock..)
For you! (for you.. for you..)
Fresh (fresh.. fresh..)


For all you sucker mc's perpetratin' a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold lost
You're the kind of guy that girl ignored
I'm drivin' caddy, you fixin 'a ford
My name is joseph simmons but my middle name's lord
And when I'm rockin' on the mic, you should all applaud
Because we're (wheelin', dealin', we got a funny feelin')
We rock from the floor up the ceilin'
We groove it (you move it) it has been proven
We calmed the seven seas because our music is soothin'
We create it (relate it) and often demonstrate it
We'll diss a sucker mc make the other suckers hate it
We're rising (surprising) and often hypnotizing
We always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
No curls (no braids) peasy-head and still get paid
Jam master cut the record up and down and cross-fade

Because the rhymes I say, sharp as a nail
Witty as can be and not for sale
Always funky fresh, could never be stale

Took a test to become an mc and didn't fail
I couldn't wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
I'm a wizard of a word, that's what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
I'm the master of a mic, that's what I say
And if I didn't say that, you'd say it anyway

Bust into the party, come in the place
See the first things come, the music in your face
Tears down the walls, some of the floor
With the dj named jay with the cuts galore

So listen to this because it can't be missed
And you can't leave til you're dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you can't leave until we're through
So relax your body and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme - hey
You might think that you have waited
Long enough til the rhyme was stated
But if it were a test it would be graded
With a grade that's not debated
Nothing too deep and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of sense

So move your butt, to the cut
Run amuk, you're not in a rut
Each and everybody out there, we got the notion

We want to see y'all all in motion

Just shake, wiggle jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound

Side to side, back and forth

We're the two mc's, and we're gonna go off
Stand in place, walk or run
Tap your feet, you'll be on the one

Just snap your fingers and clap your hands

Our dj's better than all these bands
Huh!!

[run]	we got all the lines
[dmc]	and all the rhymes
[run]	we don't drop dimes
[dmc]	and we don't do crimes
[run]	we bake a little cake with Duncan Hines

Run-D.M.C.,"Two years ago a friend of mine 
Asked me to say some MC rhymes 
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say 
The rhyme was Def a then it went this way 
Took a test to become an MC 
And Orange Krush became amazed at me 
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac 
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back 
Dave cut the record down to the bone 
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone 
And then we talkin' autograph, and here's the laugh 
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath 
But see ahh, ah that's the life, ah that I lead 
And you sucker MC's is who I please 
So take that and move back catch a heart attack 
Because there's nothin' in the world, that Run'll ever lack 
I cold chill at a party in a be	-boy stance 
And rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance 
Fly like a Dove, that come from up above 
I'm rockin' on the mic and you can call me Run-Love 

I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville 
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill' 
So if you see me cruisin' girls just a-move or step aside 
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride 
It's on a, ah first come, first serve basis 
Coolin' out girl, take you to the def places 
One of a kind and for your people's delight 
And for you sucker MC, you just ain't right 
Because you're bitin' all your life, you're cheatin' on your wife 
You're walkin' round town like a hoodlum with a knife 
You're hangin' on the ave, chillin' with the crew 
And everybody know what you've been through 

Ah with the one two three, three to two one 
My man Larry Larr, my name DJ Run 
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass 
I'm rockin' to the rhythm won't you watch it on my face 
Go Uptown and come down to the ground 
You sucker MC's, you bad face clown 
You five dollar boy and I'm a million dollar man 
Youse a sucker MC, and you're my fan 
You try to bite lines, but rhymes are mine 
Youse a sucker MC in a pair of Calvin Klein 
Comin' from the wackest, part of town 
Tryin' to rap up but you can't get down 
You don't even know your English, your verb or noun 
You're just a sucker MC you sad face clown 
So D.M.C. and if you're ready 
The people rockin' steady 
You're drivin' big cars get your gas from Getti 

I'm D.M.C. in the place to be 
I go to St. John's University 
And since kindegarten I acquired the knowledge 
And after 12th grade I went straight to college 
I'm light skinned, I live in Queens 
And I love eatin' chicken and collard greens 
I dress to kill, I love the style 
I'm an MC you know who's versatile 
Say I got good credit in your regards 
Got my name not numbers on my credit cards 
I go Uptown, I come back home 
With who me myself and my microphone 
All my rhymes are sweet delight 
So here's another one for y'all to bite 
When I rhyme, I never quit 
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it 
Cause it takes a lot, to entertain 
And sucker MC's can be a pain 
You can't rock a party with the hip in hop 
You gotta let em know you'll never stop 
The rhymes have to make (a lot of sense) 
You got to know where to start (when the beats come in)",Sucker M.C.'s,1997

To the brownstone, and on the streets that he roamed
Before he got locked up, he sewed the whole block up
People would jock, because he cooked the rock
Caught by the cop, he's knocked, and now he's faceless
The spot was hot, he's Scott, that's what his name is
When he was out with clout, people surround him
Now that he's in the pen, niggaz downed him
Wait upstate, for the day, till they free the man
In '98, be straight, and then you'll see him again
Ready to kill, and steal, ill and build

Naked, out to die and not movin'
He needs a fix by six that means you've been
Strung out, your lung out, foamin' with your tongue out
Back to hell and well, that's where you hung out
For the past and last year, your acts for cash here
Crash and smash any ass to get a blast yeah

One two, one two, and I say

Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get out your seats and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we're not just rough, we're more than tough
And when it comes to rhymes, we got enough

It's like that y'all, and we don't stop the body rock

Run-D.M.C. and we're tougher than leather
We're making and breaking and snatching and taking
The deal's for real we could never be faking

I'm chilling, he's cooling, I'm a king that's ruling
Preach and teach and always schooling

See, we're learning, and earning, the tables keep turning
To be like us, you could, you could be yearning
Pulsating, dominating up above
Cold chilling and I'm willing, the name's Run-Love

Creating, devastating in the place to be
Full of soul, mic control because it's easy to ""D""

Beat making, never faking, chilling all of the time
Foreplaying rhyme saying, I get mine

No way to rock me, no way to stop me
It's seems quite shocking to those that mock me
And that's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and plan for my downfall

But I'm not running, I'm just stunning
Smart not stupid 'cause I'm so cunning
MC's regretting, I'm upsetting
My recitals take titles and dollars I'm betting

Like that y'all, so just keep above
See my name is DJ Run, they call me Run-Love
Creative creator, creating the rhyme
Devastating devastator, not doing a crime

Making beats every day, and I get mine
The biggest star going far, so check the shine
Big winner, not a sinner when I do my thing
I might have a sling or a fling 'cause I'm down with the king

Biggest rap no crap, I do not sing
You want a show, let me know, just give me a ring
Like that y'all, we're just keeping it on
D.M.C. my man, to the break of dawn, rock

I'm ill, I chill, with skill I kill
And none of my rhymes are run of the mill
I cause grief, I'm chief, there is no beef
And if there's beef, I knock out teeth
MC's act dumb, they know where I'm from
The King from Queens and I'm down with Run

I take a stand my man, and I won't sit
'Cause I'm the real deal, like Coke is it
Then you won't find my name in the yellow page
'Cause Run only speaks when it's on the stage

I got a rhyme in line that's easy to find
With a sketch so check, so one of a kind
Got two MC's and one DJ
Grab at least 20 G's when we play

So D.M.C. home boy, my mellow, my man
So get on the mic and won't you take the stand

My rock is hard, you can't pull my card
I'm a shining star, shining near and far
Shining like the sun on a day of fun
Always on the move cause I'm down with Run

I'm the cool and calm, I'm the calm and cool
I'm not a fool, I went to school
My name is D.M.C., I tell no lie
And I graduated from Cooley High

I am the only rapper who will not die
I'm a gruesome guy, and you can try
To battle D.M.C. but you must be high",Together Forever,1998
Run-D.M.C.,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Uh-huh, yeah, what? Yo, yo
Aiyyo I seen Run with the chrome spinnin
Watchin the Knicks in the back of the 6
Pulled up on the side like, ""Who's winnin?""
Nigga said, ""Me since eighty-three, get it right""
Politely flashed his Roley, then dipped to the light
Next night seen him on stage with some platinum shells
with baguettes on the side that spelled ""Raising Hell""
I said, ""Run the crowd yell like you paid 'em well""
Then he said to ask Bertha Dell, who the hell?
Oh well - I thought I was done bein impressed
until my man called me up and told me listen to Flex
(""Yo yo yo, turn on Flex""0 I ain't know what to do
It was like Run was sunnin everybody but then again the shit was true
MC's must want him gone, hoppin on chrome
sayin they the kings, please, you kept the seat warm
Ain't nobody better than this twenty year veteran
Even as a Reverand, hotter than you ever been
It don't really matter who the hell you are
The fakest of all cats or the biggest of stars (uh-huh)
Tryin to doubt these three, you breakin the law
They the kings, LEAVIN why'ALL IN AWE, THAT'S REAL PAW

Flow is hot, don't need no gun to cock
I'm sick of Vidal, your brother tried to get me to fall
I'm kickin it raw, even in the thick of it all
Run laps around wack cats, I hate DAT's
Since way back, made great tracks, I lace raps
Yo face that, before you catch aluminum bats
from numerous cats with Run-D.M.C. on they hats
You ain't gettin no show 'til your album out
The label don't want to spend money yo what's THAT about?
No clout, had to settle for a fake amount
While my catalogue bigger than your bank account
No doubt, I'm the greatest all time fo' sho'
Rev. Run comin through and leavin niggaz in awe

[Chorus x 2]

Ready to rock steady with Run and make a lot of dough

That sucker MC's is who I stalk
Create in a rhyme that is in formation

Thinks he the bomb, bet his beeper stay blowed up""
So much frost on my wrist look my fist froze up
A photographer is tryin' to get a little close up
Why cause I'm a star now? Buy out the bar now?
Or I press one button, start up my car now?
I heard that you want to spar now, so baby it's on
I spit flows, rip shows 'til the day that I'm gone
And this day I hit 'em off I'll have America sewn

I'm the epitome of royalty, you versus me is a joke
I'm a rage and major blaze, you cigarette smoke
Your video's number one and that was part of our plan
Went from ""Rock Box"" to a whole countdown jam
Took rock music, switched it and flipped it and made it raw
Anywhere you played, we played it before in eighty-four
Every show, a hundred thousand people or more
Fame'll still give us tours and we be tryin' not to take 'em all

I leave you stressin' confessin' (?) and strivin' for blessing
And whatever your impression it better be, that we the top pedigree
Bringin' why'all energy since eighty-three

I pick up a pair of shells and make why'all wear 'em again
If you thought it I done did it
Heard it I done spit it

Even all the crooks that been livin outta Brooklyn

To the top where I'm 'posed to be
And when the track light up, y'all can back right up
Y'all players too close to me

[J.D.]
You know what I used to like?
The way my man used to come on stage and grab the mic
And just throw the damn stand across the stage man
Then he used to tell his man like, ""Yo D
Come right here in the middle of the stage, grab yo' {shit}
And say what you gotta say"" - and you know what D used to say?
He used to say..
""Party people! Your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get out your seats, and let's get ill
That's right why'all, we're not just rough, we more than tough
And when it comes to {shit} like this, ha, we got enough!""

Yo, yeah, DMC man
In the place to be
Yo, this song is dedicated to (word)
(whether good days, happy or sad)
To all of those that's been down with each other since day one
Aha, let's keep it together

[Run]
Now we've been all around the world
From the corner of the block to the top of the world and back
We're the royalty on the ave, ain't nobody ever have
And the brand new jet black Cadillac
We've been down since day one
And no matter where I go people want to see him next to me
They say ""what's up with d?"" I used to jam all across the land
The coliseum, even message, when raising hell were cassettes
In the shelves, and the plush hotel after every show
We were just kissing the mic, living the life
Of MTV and the radio
And so you jay and me said ""it's 83'""
We're living and sticking together like a family
And no matter what, the rule must be
That it's guaranteed that I'm for you, and you for me
So

[Chorus]
Let's stay together let's stay together
Loving you whether, love is good and bad
And happy or sad

Yo, my love of the mic, can't touch my love for my wife
Baby I ain't going nowhere, specially the way you smile
When you have my child, or when I rock the crowd
Can't wait to be right there
Even my kids that ain't yours is still yours
Cause you love him and treat him like your very own
We be holding hands and I be holding doors
And when my mother in-law spend time alone
Call her about five hundred times a day
When I'm often gone cause I'm on the road
And when I'm on the phone, you know I want to be home
Cause that's the one and only spot where I really belong
You know our love, called you the preachers' wife
But the keys to bed lead living it up
And everybody would know, them seen us in the video
On the dance floor straight cutting it up
I love you baby

[Chorus]

To me, you mean the world
No matter what it is you say or do
I always I will be there for you
So no, no matter what, let's stay together

In the good life, happy or sad
You mean the world, no matter what is it you say or do
I always will be there for you
So no, no matter what, let's stay together
In the good life, happy or sad
Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, love is good or bad, and or happy or sad

Ain't no beats to lead somebody you love
Best thing in life, is to have somebody ya heard
So keep it together

From the days of arm call niggas hung around blocks and corner stores 
Herringbone chains and fantasies rushin the door 
Niggas from Rastel poppin shells, snatchin rings 
Fly from shirt kings, from Queensbridge to 118 
I had my eyes open, steppin out into the world 
So fiendish, Ol' English 'til I url, growing pains 
A young kid, learnin early how to know the game 
USA Roller Skate rink, mobs and crews would take minks 
Clean streets, hustlers, crack cocaine 
Gave back by throwin block parties and basketball games 
A lotta cash made on Hollis Ave., fast and change 
High rollers was livin, until the Task Force came 
A lotta ghost towns and memories, bad blooded enemies 
So many died with the same gangsta pride that entered me 
Peace to them old timers, they who taught us 
How to stand strong and pass it on to the sons and daughters 
We all glow, and I'm proud to be all that I know

Look at LL, A Tribe Called Quest, Mobb and Nas Esco 
Ain't takin credit, we showin pride, look at us now 
Got haters mouths all open wide, wonderin how 
In some cases the only thing that father and son 
Have in common is they love for Run 
Been the illest since day one, I'm too advanced to ever be caught 
Who's more legendary than me...that's what I thought 
And if somebody wanna test mine, yo, watch this

Kicked the shirt kings for an ill airbrush top 
That'll match my cortez Nike's 
Niggas gettin robbed at the back door comin out with bags 
We used to get our gold fronts, from Eddie's gold caps 
What y'all know about that 
I bet the whole Queens do, around '86 with the chrome bass crew 
The young guns and lost boys made the news

If I did this whole rap game be unstable
Went over to Arista wit Mr. Davis, for the change of neighbors
It's only fair that we share those naked papers
You can tell a cat serious about rap and it ain't luck

Love is like no other couldn't get in between her
Always stayed fly man I wished that you seen her
Said they had a scheme but nobody believed her
No real job cause she stay in the streets
Gina did nails but her love made beats
When they want to eat they just walked in the store
They took what they wanted man the illest you saw
Til one day they went up kindin' fiendin' with ice
Butter like(?) the jeans and Gina said ""The rings are nice""
Next thing you know they want to pull off a heist
Shook took a look and shot the jeweler twice
Diamonds all shinin' as they flew in the air
Butter actin' up and grabbin' stuff by the pair
Gina at the door cause she good with the gun
They both grabbed the money and run

Spoonie was a rookie that was new on the scene
Used to be a thug now he's doin' it clean
Ironic he was coppin' and they gave him the spot
Knew Butter back from Hollis used to chill on the block
Seen Butter round the way with a brand new Benz
Gina lookin' pretty in the city with friends
Spoonie's sayin' yo I gotta get these ends
And these are the two I gotta apprehend
A big boy from Hollis promised not to tell
And lead these cops on a long long trail
Spoonie saw Gina and the chick turned pale
Runnin' sayin' somethin' like she don't got bail
Butter said promise me I won't see jail
Spoonie want a watch and a brand new cell
Butter and Gina moved to Pensacola
Spoonie got a Roley and a Motorola

A few ladies in the den, so bring some Jello in
And a mighty fine fellow in like myself

Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me

In New York the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really (hawk) but we just (walk) because we have no time
And in the city it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside

I'm not braggin', people naggin' 'cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Daryll every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' 'cause I'm on TV

2 MC's who are claiming the fame
And all other things won't be the same
Beacause it's about time for a brand new group
Run-D.M.C. to put you up on the scoop
We make the fly girls scream in ecstacy
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party
We put all the fellas in a daze
It's everyone that we amaze
And we got the master of a disco scratch
There's not a break that he can't catch
Jam Master Jay that is his name
And all wild DJ's he will tame
Behind the turntables is where he stands
Then there is the movement of his hands
So when asked who's the best, y'all should say:
""Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay""

Jam Master Jay is the one in charge
It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs
So won't you move your butt

We're not talking ground, we're not talking sky
We're not talking low, we're not talking high
We're not talking big, we're not talking small
We want all of you on and off the wall
We're not talking night, we're not talking day
But we're talking bout Jam Master Jay",Jam Master Jay,2002

Hey!  You over there, I know about your kind
You're like the Independent Network News on Channel 9
Everywhere that you go, no matter where you at
I said you talk about this, and you talk about that
When the cat took your tongue, I say you took it right back
Your mouth is so big, one bite would kill a Big Mac

You talk too much               You never shut up
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never shut up

You talk about people, you don't even know
And you talk about places, you NEVER go
You talk about your girl, from head to toe
I said your mouth's moving fast, and your brain's moving slow

You talk too much               You never shut up!!
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never shut up

You're the instigator, the orator of the town
You're the worst when you converse, just a big mouth clown
You talk when you're awake, I heard you talk when you sleep
Has anyone ever told you, that talk is cheap

You talk too much               You never shut, up!!
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

Talking is the one thing, that you can do best
You told the cavity creeps, to watch out for Crest
You never have the story, right and exact

I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

And you're always fighting someone you know ya can't beat

You talk too much               You never shut up!
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

You're always spreading rumors, whether bad or good
You're the damn Walter Cronkite of the neighborhood
The Barbara Walters, and the Howard Cosell
You always come around, with a story to tell

You talk too much               And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

And talkin to you, is like dropping a dime
You're spreading the word, like it is your job
You should be a stool pigeon, who works for the mob

You talk too much               And you never shut up
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never shut up!

A big blabbermouth, that's what you are
If you were a talk show host, you'd be a star
I said your mouth is big, size extra large
And when you open it, it's like my garage

You talk too much               And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never shut up

You always like to gossip, just like a girl
You talk so damn much, it's outta this world

You won't be a man, you'll be a nagging wife

Thirteen months outta year, is when you speak
I'm tired of listening to the garbage you talk
Why don't you find a short pier, and take a long walk

So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way

Wrecka lecka mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts, wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to fortee better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather

Sucker emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be

The microphone is granted when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society

I rages on the stages with a tune of verse
I get praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

Is keeping perfectly still

And he never gives an answer

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way

Talking perfectly loud

Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

Sees the sun going down

Running Wild,"The question that is on man's mind since the beginning of time is
""Where do we come from, where do we go?""
Well, let me tell you a story which took place a long, long time ago.
450.000 years before our time, when the atmosphere on ""Nibiru""
the 12th planet was getting worse and worse and when ""Alalu"" the
sovereign of the ""Annunaki-race"" was dethroned and dislodged by
his opponent ""Anu"".
""Alalu"" had to flee in his ""Vimana"" to save his life and he came down
to Earth and found something the ""Annunaki"" could use to filter the
solar radiation to save their atmosphere from destruction: ""GOLD""!!
And ""Alalu"" revealed his discovery to ""Anu"" and as a reward for it
he could return to his own planet.

AND THEN IT ALL BEGAN!!

A reef of gold was the right offering
For soothing with a gift of right size
He handed it over to Anu the King
Alalu's return had its price
Enki the scientist the son of Anu
Came down and dug for gold
Building a haven called Eridu
He mastered his task truly bold

No more gold, the volume decreased
The heir to the throne came down
Enlil brought Edin to seize
Ripping the gold of the ground
Annunaki men dug really hard
They worked their hands to the bone
A serious revolt for setting a mark
Cause the rage and discontent had grown

Hellbound, poisoned souls, in pain they'll burn, no return
Mankind will never learn, their blinded pride, the evil side

The firestorm will rage on the day of the falling
Armageddon's near it's the end of the genesis
Dying by the flood, no way back, no recalling
The malice and the pride is the death and fall of man

A daring test in the hour of need
An artificial bio-robot
Annunaki-essence for an exogamy
A fertilized ovum they had
An Annunaki woman was the one who gave birth
Adapa received his science
But Adapa was banned, he wasn't its worth
Cause of malice and evil defiance

Hellbound, poisoned souls, in pain they'll burn, no return
Mankind will never learn, their blinded pride, the evil side

The firestorm will rage on the day of the falling
Armageddon's near it's the end of the genesis
Dying by the flood, no way back, no recalling
The malice and the pride is the death and fall of man

The gods created animals and plants
Adapa's daughters they took their chance
They got married to Annunaki men
Enlil got furious from this wicked sin
He knew a huge tidal wave would come
His command, no warning to none
He wanted to wipe out man from this place
He wanted to stop this conceited and evil race

As the conspirator Enki took part
Noah was charged to build up the arche
The water came deluging the spot
So, death flowed with the swallowing waves of the flood !!

Sodom and Gomorrah they fell from grace
But the gods, they had to see for themselves
Mankind was spreading demanding more space
Claiming the throne and its wealth

The gods had to prove, who was right, who was not
Who followed the laws that they gave
Only one called ""Lot"" at the unholy spot
They saved him and his children from grave

Firewind blew that unleashed the storm
Atomic explosions that raged
No more warning, no arousing alarm
Their power set an end to this age

A few good souls were sent by the gods
They tried to save mankind from fall
But the ""Men In Black"" were hatching a plot
Defiance and malice's their call
Grinding the earth, turning good into bad
They raged like a maniac beast
Exploiting the being, the evil did spread
Souls made for hellfire's feast

Hellbound, poisoned souls, in pain they'll burn, no return
Mankind will never learn, their blinded pride, the evil side

The firestorm will rage on the day of the falling
Armageddon's near it's the end of the genesis
Dying by the flood, no way back, no recalling
The malice and the pride is the death and fall of man
The firestorm will rage on the day of the falling
Armageddon's near it's the end of the genesis
Dying by the flood, no way back, no recalling
The malice and the pride is the death and fall of man

In the 7th month of the year 1999 an ancient god of wrath will return
bringing fire, water, death and destruction.
That is the day when man will be judged for all evil he has done
and he will be commanded into the eternal fire.
Only the good and righteous souls will be saved to live in eternal peace.

The Highest Apple
At present
All you were is with me
My eyes closed, my memory confident
Standing here watching
Each hill and shoreline
With the seed you left
Still growing
The garden is well stocked
With mighty trees
With fruit growing for the whole world
Ripe, sweet
And bitter apples
And the one apple
That is beyond reach
Who amongst us
Can exist a single day
Beyond our own time and our own limits
Countless and
Futile
Are times I've climbed
To reach and taste
The forbidden fruit
The winds will blow
And the sun will shine
From generation to generation
Through the trees of the garden
But the day and the hour
Will surely come
To take the highest apple
From the knowledge tree

The endless storm, the months of rain
But this land holds me ball and chain
A worker for the wind
You need heart, you need dreams
Laughter, joy, you need beliefs
But without love you sow an empty field

Trading with strangers in silhouette
I drink your health, son of the earth
Passing ships in the modern death

Old emotions still burn inside
On solid ground, round the mother tongue
A tower of hope, a joyful sound
You take your time
A hand of aces in a pack of lies

And wash our hands of shame
When the sins of generations fall

Across the green like rain
Here one world window opens wide
And demons they show face

BEYOND THE VALLEY

I looked behind me
Whithout rancour without pity
To where my footprints were scattered
On their journey through the dust
From the beginning to an end of time
And to the bright everlasting days
Beyond the valley
You came down
To a barren wilderness
And you raised the shadow
From the valley

We will proclaim your name in voice
On Gods way
We will praise
The love and the grace
That gave us our existence
So lowly beneath the sun
As it poured out ist light
On alien stars.

Running down the alley
I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh, baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I Love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Oh, yeah

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle
Of a slot machine
Love may still exist
In another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I Love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I Love you""
Rolling off my tongue

All time is here
I'm going down to clachnan
To stem the rush of years
Big sky above me
Powerline overhead
I get lifted up enraptured
I keep falling at your feet
I'm looking over colourfields
Past the white sands
And our human years
And it's all waiting here
Breaking the seed
It's coming againGathering the windReturning to claim a harvest
I'm lifted where I stand
On the never-ending land
I'm coming to sense of home
Wind through the barley
Your early dream
A rising choir of birdsong
Your fields of summer green
It's all passing over
I've no complains
We're just a row of unlit candles
Waiting the gate of saints
I'm living on the borderline
Between the moment
And the shining miles
The far streching stones
All the lines of the sown
It's coming againGathering the windReturning to claim a harvest
I'm lifted where I stand
On the neverending land
I'm coming to sense of home
The light of ancient shine
On your ordinary lives
We joyed went to the lines of harvest
So open up the land
Open up the sand
Returning again in Clachan

Care of my heart. And when I'm

The highway unwinds I'll keep
Coming home. Love on a wire.
