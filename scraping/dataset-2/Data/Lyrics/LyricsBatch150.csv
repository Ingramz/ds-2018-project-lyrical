Diplo,"My face shining, looking like some salmon skin
All twelve Reggie Hammond, holding hammers him
Never speak, he like that short silent type
I’m in the mountains shovin' knives, drinking wine at night
Rose petals get thrown to the feet
Know we grow knee ’cause even in this rap don't work we got stones in the street
Go down in Tallahassee, work and come home in a week
See me stoned in a Jeep with the chrome on the feet
Leather overalls, shirtless like I'm Kells in the street
Posing for flicks, leaning on an English whip
With the float ware straight from the aquarium
My bitch built like secretariat, yeah, bring the chariot
I fuck the pussy, not marry it, world on my shoulders, dougie, I carry it
I’m more than happy with my bitch, she got no saggy tits
I’ll do it old school style and give her baggy dick

[Chorus: x4]
Rock, rock, very
Slow, slow, steady
Base, base, heavy
Drum, drums, ready

They talk in cents, diamonds in our tooths and dinner (ice)
Rap game Burt Reynolds in a candy canteloupe car rental
I’m in the trash compactor, black shades like famous actor
Bank account doin' gymnastics, flip
40 cal. in the Razorback starter jacket (Arkansas)
I switch up like south paw, frozen teeth look like tiger claws
Look like a pain to massage my upper bums and lower jowls (igloos)
My wedding gifts consists of Versace blend, ice out contenders, didn’t mean to offend you
When I pull up the [?], in the candy leather [?]
Flush out the system with niacin, 40 lines of the Vicodin
Still childish and violent, with appetite for violins
Disappearing act like Sister, Sister
Lost the biscuits, city slickers, rap game Billy Crystal

[Chorus: x4]

Pass our nuts, shit, ain’t no courtesy flush
Fuck black bitches till they bruise, white hoes till they flush
Fuck pretty bitches in their face, dick holes in their butts
Bumping mace [?]
[?] sipping more lean with Goldie
Sweaty minks in the summer like it’s snowing
Pummel all opponents turn gold if I concentrate
Scrape the plate rap for my team, bought a cheese greater
Eggplant, Parmesan with [?] seen him do a pushup on the back of his head
Acting like I’m certified, niggas get nervous when I’m walking
Nudge each other and whisper that’s him
Y’all niggas, cooch, pussies
I’mma cool off his noose on the loose sipping hooch
Flow’s out the colon, TYB chosen, bust it wide open with my staff like Moses
Motherfucker

Bounce to the left, shake it to the right
Now pop it up once, we gon' dance tonight",Rock Steady,2013

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

And a fine coal miner for the NCB that was
A fallen angel and Jesus on the cross
A skating ballerina you should have seen her do the skater's waltz
Some people have got to paint and draw
Harry had to work in clay and stone
Like the waves coming to the shore
It was in his blood and in his bones

Ignored by all the trendy boys in London and in Leeds
He might as well have been making toys or strings of beads
He could not be in the gallery
And then you get an artist says he doesn't want to paint at all
He takes an empty canvas and sticks it on the wall
The birds of a feather all the phonies and all of the fakes

While the dealers they get together
And they decide who gets the breaks
And who's going to be in the gallery
No lies he wouldn't compromise
No junk no bits of string

And all the lies we subsidize

I've got to say he passed away in obscurity
And now all the vultures are coming down from the tree

It's getting darker all the time these flagpole days

He's crazy lion howling for a fight

And I feel so good 'cause it feels so right
I was made to go with my girl
Like a saxophone was made to go with the night

And she can raise one eyebrow
Put her hand on my hip
And I close one eye now
Sweat on her tip
And I surrender to the fever
She love me so tender I got to believe her
Love? expresso love's alright

I don't want no sugar in it
Thank you very much
All wired up on it all fired up on it
Expresso touch
Hey maestro expresso
It's just another one just like the other one
Hey maestro expresso
Is this another one just like the other one",Expresso Love,1980
Dire Straits,"The sky is crying the streets are full of tears
Rain come down wash away my fears
And all this writing on the wall
Oh I can read between the lines
Rain come down forgive this dirty town
Rain come down and give this dirty town
A drink of water  a drink of wine

If I've been hard on you I never chose to be
I never wanted no one else
I tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to
Hand in hand like lovers are supposed to

As you'd sleep I'd think my heart would break in two
I'd kiss your cheek I'd stop myself from waking you
But in the dark you'd speek my name
You'd say baby what's wrong
Oh, here I am baby I'm coming back for more
I'm like a wave that's going to roll into the shore
Yes and if my love's in vain how come my love is so strong?

Now you and me go parallel together and apart
And you keep your perfect distance and it's tearing at my heart
Did you never feel the distance?
You never tried to cross no line
Now it's another dirty river and another dirty scar
And I don't know who's kissing you and I don't know where you are
So far from home  don't you think of me sometimes",Hand in Hand,1980
Dire Straits,"I seen a girl on a one way corridor
Stealing down a wrong way street
For all the world like an urban toreador
She had wheels on  on her feet
Well the cars do the usual dances
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl
But the roller girl she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud

Hallelujah here she comes queen roller ball
Enchante what can I say don't care at all
You know she used to have to wait around
She used to be the lonely one
But now that she can skate around town
She's the only one

No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud
She gets rock n roll a rock n roll station
And a rock n roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
But the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song what it was
Roller girl don't worry
D.j. play the movies all night long

She tortures taxi drivers just for fun
She like to read their lips
Says toro toro taxi see ya tomorrow my son
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip
She got her own world in the city
You can't intrude on her
She got her own world in the city
'cause the city's benn so rude to her

No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd

Dire Straits,"Warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control
Somebody threw a spanner and they threw him in the hole
There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls came down
There's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell
There's leaking in the washroom there's a sneak in personnel
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze
'goodness me could this be Industrial Disease?

The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post
They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most
The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas
And everyone's concerned about Industrial Disease
There's panic on the switchboard tongues are ties in knots
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots
Some blame the management some the employees
And everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease

The work force is disgusted downs tools and walks
Innocence is injured experience just talks
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees
That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse
Philosophy is useless theology is worse
History boils over there's an economics freeze

Sociologists invent words that mean 'Industrial Disease'
Doctor Parkinson declared 'I'm not surprised to see you here
You've got smokers cough from smoking, brewer's droop from drinking beer
I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis knees
But worst of all young man you've got Industrial Disease'

He wrote me a prescription he said 'you are depressed
But I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest
Come back and see me later - next patient please
Send in another victim of Industrial Disease'
I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck
They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks
Two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong
There's a protest singer singing a protest song - he says
'they want to have a war to keep us on our knees

They want to have a war to keep their factories
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind
They want to sap your energy incarcerate your mind
They give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three

Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'
Meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons'
The other one's on a hunger strike he's dying by degrees
How come Jesus gets Industrial Disease",Industrial Disease,1982
Dire Straits,"I hear the seven deadly sins
And the terrible twins came to call on you
The bigger they are babe
The harder they fall on you
And you you're always the same you persevere
On the same old pleasure ground

It just comes pouring down

You had no more volunteers
So you got profiteers for to help you out
With friends like that babe
Good friends you had to do without
And now they've taken the chains and the gears
From off your merry-go-round
Oh and it never rains around here
It just comes pouring down

And your new romeo
Was just a gigolo when he let you down
See the faster they are babe
The faster they get out of town
Leaving make up stains and the tears
Of a clown
Yes and it never rains around here
It just comes pouring down

Oh you were just a roller coaster memory
I don't know why I was even passing through
I saw you making a date with destiny
When he came around here asking after you
In the shadow of the wheel of fortune
You're busy trying to clear your name
You say 'i may be guilty yeah that may be true
But I'd be lying if I said I was to blame
See we could have been major contenders
We never got no money no breaks'
You've got a list of all the major offenders
You got a list of all their major mistakes
And he's just standing on the shadows
Yes and you smile that come-on smile
Oh I can still hear you say as clear as the day
'I'd like to make it worth your while'

Ah but it's a sad reminder
When your organ grinder has to come to you for the rent
And all you've got to give him
Is the use of your side-show tent
Yes and that's all that remains of the years
Spent doing to rounds
And it never rains around here
Well it just comes pouring down

Now you know what they say about beggars
You can't complain about the rules
You know what they say about beggars
You know who's the first to blame his tools
You never gave a damn about who you pick up
And leave lying bleeding on the ground
You screw people over on the way up
Because you thought that you were never coming down

Dire Straits,"A long time ago came a man on a track
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best
Made a home in the wilderness

He built a cabin and a winter store
And he ploughed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travellers came walking down the track
And they never went further, no, they never went back

Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their load
And the dirty old track was the Telegraph Road

Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph Road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river

And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow

I used to like to go to work but they shut it down
I've got a right to go to work but there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed

And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the Telegraph Road

Well, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights
Yeah, life was just a bet on a race between the lights
You had your hand on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder like you don't seem to care

But just believe in me baby and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't wanna see it again

From all of these signs saying ""sorry but we're closed""

Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph Road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river

And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow

I used to like to go to work but they shut it down
I've got a right to go to work but there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed

And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the Telegraph Road

Well, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights
Yeah, life was just a bet on a race between the lights
You had your hand on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder like you don't seem to care

But just believe in me baby and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't wanna see it again

From all of these signs saying ""sorry but we're closed""

Dire Straits,"These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me

Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn to be

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me

So many different suns

You remember we used to run and hide
In the shadow of the cargoes I take you one time
And we're counting all the numbers down to the waterline

Near misses on the dog leap stairways
French kisses in the darkened doorways
A foghorn blowing out wild and cold
A policeman shines a light upon my shoulder

Up comes a coaster fast and silent in the nihgt
Over my shoulder all you can see are the pilot lights
No money in our jackets and our jeans are torn
Your hands are cold but your lips are warm

She can see him on the jetty where they used to go
She can feel him in the places where the sailors go
When she's walking by the river and the railway line
She can still hear him whisper

For the usual fee, plus expenses
Confidential information, it's a diary
This is my investigation, it's not a public inquiry

I go checking out the reports, digging up the dirt
You get to meet all sorts in this line of work
Treachery and treason, there's always an excuse for it
And when I find the reason I still can't get used to it

And what have you got at the end of the day?
What have you got to take away?

And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am

In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put my hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
It's just a cakewalk twisting baby step right up and say
Hey mister give me two give me two 'cause any two can play

Another hustle just to make it big
And rock away rock away

And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids

She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stay

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rock away rock away from Cullercoats and Whitley bay out to rock away

It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel all right when you hear that music ring

Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
But the horns, they blowing that sound

Way on down south in London town

You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
But it's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes then an old guitar is all he can afford

He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night

With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll

And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans played Creole, Creole

For the usual fee
Plus expenses

It's not a public inquiry

Digging up the dirt
You get to meet all sorts
In the line of work
Treachery and treason
There's always an excuse for it
And when I find the reason
I still can't get used to it

And what have you got at the end of the day ?
What have you got to take away ?

blinds on the window and a pain behind the eyes

You're dancer on thin ice
You pay no heed to the danger
And less to advice
Your footsteps are forbidden
But with knowledge of your sin
You throw your love to all the strangers
And caution to the wind

And you go dancing through doorways
Just to see what you will find
Leaving nothing to interfere
With the crazy balance of your mind
And when you finally reappear
At the place where you came in
You're thrown your love to all the strangers
And caution to the wind

Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battles raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many differents suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line on your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms",Brothers in Arms [Live],1998

Would join the Royal Society

To draw the line

Now you're a good surveyor, Dixon

You talk of liberty
How can America be free

In the forests of the Iroquois

Now hold your head up, Mason
See America lies there

The capes of Delaware
Come up and feel the sun

From foundering on the rocks

Is just to see you there at the end
Of my wandering back in the dock

But there's a loan to pay off and a few skip jack

Darling, are we in trouble now 

They say we're grown up
But we've been searching all this time
I wouldn't own up
Never would admit to flying blind
But in the Darkness
We found each other anyhow
Darling, are we in trouble now 

When we'd talk it over
Love was a cry from a distant shore
Then we found each other
And all that we'd been searching for 

And I'm done denying
I guess by now you know
I'm through with trying
Can't bring myself to let you go
And of all these feelings
We said we never would allow

And a sleepy little laddie smiles up at his daddy
And he's asking for his G.I. Joe
And daddy tucks him in with a kiss upon the chin
And says my little one I love you so

Daddy is he a goodie or a baddie

Don't you let the bedbugs bite
It's time to go to sleep now not another peep
And I'll see you in the morning light
And then the radio was playing and the weatherman was saying
The hurricane had blown away
And daddy's little boy was jumping up for joy
And he was singing at the break of day

The most dangerous lady on her quarter deck
She found her Golden Heart
You found your Golden Heart

to some Arcadian band

Just to hold time in my hand 

And you shot me with a cannonball of history
And long forgotten art
I'd be turning it over as our words ran free
I'd hold your Golden Heart

Nothing in the world that I love more your heart, your heart

And all the time I sleep
I will have a reminder that my baby wore
A part of you to keep 

And I'll send you all my promises across the sea
And while we are apart
I will carry the wonder that you gave to me

Dirge Within,"I lie asleep
A portrait of what we
Want to believe
This is never ending
You left me with uncertainty
If only I had listened
Everything inside of me
Will never keep you here

When this fight comes to an end
I just wanna be with you again

Here I am, with the memories
Back and forth again
Such a distant voice
And it calls to me, with the memories
That I'm drowning in
With my dying breath

No words to speak
No one to hear me scream
Uncertainty is still taking over
What's left of me, I cannot be
If only I had listened
Dying for an answer
As I stand above your name

When this fight comes to an end
I just wanna be with you again

Here I am, with the memories
Back and forth again
Such a distant voice
And it calls to me, with the memories
That I'm drowning in
With my dying breath
Once again

What's understated
There will be an end
What's overrated
All the words we left unsaid

Memories are all we have

Dirk Balthaus,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,

Dirk Bogarde,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Dirk Bogarde,"They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You don't realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Dirk Bogarde,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1960
Dirk Bogarde,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome

A comb in her long yellow hair
When who did she spy but Sweet William and his bride
As to the church yard they drew near

The day passed away and night coming on
Most of the men were asleep
Lady Margaret appeared all dressed in white
Standing at his bed feet

She said how do you like your bed
How do you like your sheet
How do you like your fair young bride
That's lying in your arms asleep

He said very well do I like my bed
Much better do I like my sheet
But most of all that fair young girl
That's standing at my bed feet

Then once he kissed her lily white hand
Twice he kissed her cheek
Three times he kissed her cold corpsy lips
Then he fell into her arms asleep

Well the night passed away and the day came on
And into the morning light
Sweet William said I'm troubled in my head
By the dreams that I dreamed last night

Such dreams such dreams as these
I know they mean no good
For I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine
And my bride's bed full of blood

He asked is Lady Margaret in her room
Or is she out in the hall
But Lady Margaret lay in a cold black coffin
With her face turned to the wall

Throw back, throw back those snow white robes
Be they ever so fine
And let me kiss those cold corpsy lips
For I know they'll never kiss mine

Then once he kissed her lily white hand
Twice he kissed her cheek
Three times he kissed her cold corpsy lips
Then he fell into her arms asleep

And drink up your blood like wine

[Scarface]
It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day.
It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day.

What it is?, nigga!
You don't wanna get involved with this here, nigga!
Is you a bitch nigga?, you a bitch nigga!
Look at yourself and then analyze me!
This motherfucking G
I can see the flaws in you, you got girl drawers in you
Girl flaws in you, a broad nigga!
I peeped your whole hand when you came in
I'm a man and I hang men
Play the game to win
All men should play on ten
Scarface 'finna do it again
Mash you nigga, smash through niggas
Don't make me upstrap and blast you niggas
Once again, it's only, its a must that I do it
Lock you in my scope and blast your ass through it
I'ma ruin
The image and the style that you used to
'cause you don't keep it real like you used to
A O.G., esa, fool to the hole fa'sho
So niggas slow your motherfucking roll
'Fore I come through with the same M-11
The Feds took from me, and shoot you in yo motherfucking stomach

[Chorus: Scarface]
You a Snitch Nigga, when you rat on yo friends
Bitch Nigga, when you steal cash from your kin
You'z a Snitch Nigga, running when the drama go down
You was bumpin at first what happened to the manly sound
You a Snitch Nigga, specializin' at bumpin' ya gums
Bitch Nigga, countin' all your bricks but all I see is crumbs
Snitch Nigga, ain't you tired of running your mouth
Can't even go home, cause a jacker might run in your house

[Verse: Z-Ro]
Now snitch fellas get up under my skin
That's why I don't mess with friends
Unless it's my Mac-10
I'm the king of the ghetto, Z-Ro the crooked in the flesh
Looking for head shots, 'cause snitch fellas get the bullet-proof vests
What you scared for?
What happened to all the tough ass talk
The way you was bumpin', I thought you had a taste for asphalt
Look at momma's baby out here starvin' for an ass-
Whippin', beefin', with a magician then drippin' now his ass missin
I'll be damned if I pull a rabbit out a hat
Well pull my 40 out of holster, and put a snitch fella on his back
WHOA!, look how I handled this .44
My conscience be screaming Z-Ro Murder Mo!, Murder Mo!
And these snitch fellas on ""How I'm Living"" try snitchin' on ""BET""
But got a restraining order against ""Murder I-N-see""
This how we ride, and ain't never gon' make a switch dude
Z-Ro the Crooked, I'll be damned if I be a snitch fool

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
It's Bun be I go back-a like ""Atlanta Black Crackers""
I back-slap a, back-packer, from here to Cakalacka{Carolina's}
Wack rapper, short stopper or dope kicker-inner
Bitch I ain't ya chicken hitter, bring the heater get you wetter(get you
Wetter)
With the 50 caliber magnum handgun
Step a bear off in his tracks, you better hope I don't land one
If I cock that bitch back..aim it at your chest
It'll be weeks before they even find the pieces to your vest
We releasers of ya stress..ease ya pain
Put this pistol in your mouth, you'll never need them trees again
The one ya momma warned ya about
Bun-why he's insane
Kill a kid over a quarter, (???)
(???), boy you fuckin with the triller
Z-Ro the young guerilla
And Face the born killa

Feel around in the dark for dough

Like my baby dick needs a tug like right now

Can't keep it up cuz her boob job sucks
What do she do when I whip it out
Close her eyes and open her mouth

I could try my luck with a penis pump
Or go get me some intravenous love
Birds and bees and worms and slugs
Turn to me or turn to drugs
Word on the street is I stink like a bum
But its hard to take a shower when you can't wake up
So what do I do when there aint none left
Make a call to the pony express

Cost a bit more but only bring the best
Ever seen a bitch in a brand new dress with a fat old man
Tryin to look all fresh
Well I've been with the worst and the best
And I couldn't even tell the difference

Dirt Poor Robins,"Do you give orders to the dawn?
Can you bring forth the way of light?
(or go to where the dark resides)
Can you replace a single star?
(Or from its skies can you divide)
Did you create the eyes that give you sight?

And though you feel like you are slain by fires you've come through
Your hope should stay upon
The One whose blood has bought and paid for you

Do you give birth to freeze and frost?
When all is white with fallen snow
(and the waters turn to stone)
Can you command the heaven's rain to overflowing?
And then with one hand be made still the thunder's undertoning?

Rise up on wings like eagles
All those who call upon His name
Will run and not grow weary
We will walk and never grow faint
Rise up there's strength to follow
Rise up He's calling us to go

The sea's a teardrop in His hand
The earth is dust within His grasp
(That passes through the hourglass)
Though you may feel you are alone,
Left disregarded
You're in the flock of He who shepherds lost and broken hearted

Rise up on wings like eagles
All those who call upon His name
Will run and not grow weary
We will walk and never grow faint
Rise up there's strength to follow
Rise up He's calling us to go

And though we struggle with the fear of doom impending
We know our future holds
A happy ever after ending

I shouldn't have another, but I thank I would

The rotation of my records every second made me good

But I've heard those words before
And I won't play these games
You say that your reason
Is life has got to offer more
And every day's the same
And I do feel offended
Why don't you just say
What you really mean
Or...

[Chorus:]
Shut up, you don't love me, baby
'Cause if you did, if you did
I would know
Shut up, you don't love me, baby
'Cause if you did, if you did
Then it would show
Shut up, you don't love me, baby
'Cause if you did, if you did
You wouldn't go

The days go by slowly
Each more painful than the last
I try to understand 
I got my defenses
Up so high it's sad, but I
Have always had a man
And I guess that it's over
So...

[Chorus:]

I saved you, boy
You know I did
I took your crooked life
And I straightened it for you
I held you up so very high
And you can't take back what you said
It's real this time

[Chorus: Repeat 3X]",Shut Up,2006
Dirtie Blonde,"Strength, I never had much strength
When it came to loving him
Change, I don't do well with change
Can't decipher what is real
I failed to show you how I truly feel
And now you're going, and I can't deal

So stay, for me
What do I know?
I'm a make believer
I'm a tyrant
But I'd treat you right this time

You, you always take the punches
You accept it as it comes
And I am good when I am good
But when I'm bad, I'm overbearing and I know
You do the best you can
Hardly feeling like a man

[Chorus:]
Throw me down, hit my face, break my back
'Cause I can take the physical pain
Belittle me in front of a crowd
Tell 'em I'm only really half of myself
when they're around
Tell 'em I'm even scared of the dark,
I stay up all night
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
Tell 'em I hold the pain of a girl that never was real
A girl that you, you never even knew

Oh, I guess I've really done it 
You won't look me in the eye
No, don't tell me that it's over
I won't cry, but I will wither up inside
And never be the same
And I'm the only one to blame

[Chorus]",Stay,2006
Dirtie Blonde,"I can't go to sleep
I lie in bed awake and wired, trying desperately
But I'm not counting sheep
I'm listening to the music in my head so constantly
'Cause I rely on it
To take me far, oh, so financially
And I'm depriving him
Of all my time and all my energy
And all this time, I slave away
It will happen someday
And all you got to do is say 
What you want

[Chorus:]
So what you want?
What you want for me to say?
All I ever do is try for you
Oh baby I'm ready
What you want?
Try to take it day by day
But I need some kind of sign from you
I'm giving you plenty
If you need, I could throw it in your face
Write a song that's undeniable
So steady, I'm ready 
What you want? 
I could be the one you want
I could be the one you want

Don't lose faith in me
I'm about to execute with true simplicity
I'll make you tap your feet
Make you hum the words as you are walking down the street
'Cause I rely on you
To get it now or never, see'est la vie
And it's a time to start anew
Show that this is what I want to be
And all the times I slaved away
They will pay off someday
And all you got to do is say
What you want

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]",What You Want,2006
Dirtie Blonde,"Are you for real?
Are you yessing me to Death?
You get my humor
And baby, I'm amazed
Yeah, this must be my day
You're too good lookin'
There must be something wrong
I'm sure you're taken
I'm doing it again
But I don't want to screw myself

[Chorus]
'Cause you're a little bit too nice
I look a little bit like hell
'Cause I'm a little overtired
And I'm a little overwhelmed
And you're a little bit too late
And it's a little bit too soon
And I'm a little bit too strange
For somebody like you
Walk Over Me

So far, So good
You proved me wrong again
But I'm not certain
So can we fill the space
With this awkward silence?

[Chorus]

Walk Over Me

[Chorus]

Oh, it feels a little bit too right
So I know it must be wrong
I wanna take you home tonight
But I'm trying to be strong
Oh, you know a little bit too much
And it's a little bit too fast
I don't have the best of luck
With making these things last

Oh, I'm just a little like my mom
I barely get a wink of sleep
And I will never lie to you
And your secrets I will keep
Oh, and you're a little bit like me
Think you're a little bit too smart
I'm a little bit weary
So please don't break my heart

[The Pimp]
I'm comin' hard with this killa game
And I'ma make 'em all realize that they about to be broke
Young shawty it's a pimp in the air
And if you really didn't care, what you callin' me for
It's all about the game that I kick
To get inside her head and make her want to lick on it quick
The silly trick suck it up like a tick
The average playa don't understand what the Pimp be gamin' her with
Don't give a damn who you claimin' you with
Because I know you in love every time I see yo pretty brown eye contacts
I got you grippin' yo seat
Cause I know you plan to sweat girl every time I see ya smile back
I ain't pretty or nothin' 
But still I got enough game to back it all up when I leave
I got another trick up my sleave
I'm killin' 'em softly every time I get 'em down on they knees
I know you want these N-you-T's
Cause I do a lot of shows and you think I got plenty cash
Saw a bunch of girls in the past
So I'm only chillin' with pretty chickens that ? keep a pretty stash
So you know I ain't finna pass
A pretty opportunity to get them girls sprung with the tongue
So tell the freaky trick I'm finna come
So watch me ??
I cut 'em up and let 'em up then I'm gone

[Chorus]
I want to be

[Da Gangsta]
Now it ain't nothin' but the freak in me 
To spit this game and make yo broad want to sleep with me
See I know you want to creep with me
I got a fifth of that Hennessy and some killa that'll weaken yo knees
Dirty skeez won't you freeze at ease
And drop to the beat
Or better yet won't you lay on yo back
But you need to stop teasin' me
By squeezin' me and just let my finger get to workin' with that
You know the game that I'm kickin' is fat
I met you last night and I already got the game in check
When you heard my words
I struck a bloody nerve
I see the way I got you jumpin' when I'm kissin' yo neck
Don't be afraid of them playa effects
Silly whoa don't you know that my game got you goin' for broke
So when you choke off that contact smoke
I got that game to break you down and plus a lil' some for yo throat
And when I'm done I'm ready to go
I'm walkin' out yo do'
I leave ya down butt-naked on the flo'
Understand that you messin' with a pro
When this night is over ain't no need for you to call me no mo'
Cause I'm headed to the next show
To get the next whoa to scheme her outta all her dough
y'all know what I came here fo'
A playa from the South spittin' true thang run 'em low
I want to be yo Candy-nigga

I want to be your Candyman

Make you say

I know you want to bring yo cheese to me
Is it to keep it steady pleasin' me
That what it seems to be
Now let me tell ya what it means to me
I'll show you what you really need to see
If you come sleep with me

[The Pimp]
Now look here shawty called me up when he leave
I'll come on over beat you down all night to this song
You know the situation so wrong
Me creepin' and sneakin' up in yo house when yo man leave home
But this gator head on bone
You makin' it worse because you babblin' about yo thong
Boostin' me up on the phone
To come on in and creep what I can
And then I dash on
I got yo mind - oooh it's so blown
You know that it's gone
I bend you over headfirst to the floor
Girl I got the keys to yo door
You know you do understand when I lay you down I gotta go
You know what I came here for
So don't be trippin' when I come try to claim you don't know
We finna make a flick trick
So get on yo knees
We gon' call it ""Strip Deep Throat 4""
And to all the whoas that don't know
You need to stop teasin' and let a playa just splash in them hips
You need to lick around on the tip
I'm the Candyman so you know I got some sweet for them lips
I want to be

Hmmph! A dedication to all them homeboys a
Nd all them homegirls out there that done passed away
Dirty boys dedicate this rhyme to you 
That let you know how much love we got for you.
So from here on out let your soul have a peceful journey
One love!

(Pimp)
Now I got love for my homies who done shed blood for my homies
In the night sometimes I wish I coulda took slugs for my homies
But they gone now and you better believe I cried my tears 
Maybe the way y'all died it'll make me change the life I live
Like my homie Juwan Tobin raised in the village of guilt 
It's like the whole world stopped spinning my boy when you got killed
And Rico Maye...maaan why you had to depart
I remember riding our bikes around Cedar Park until it got dark
And found lil' shot up Jordan they found your body parked in the car 
I know you watching over your son from up above in the stars
An ole shocking Scott I know you where the angels stay 
Cause with fluid on your lungs you died in the strangest way
You was my second cousin so I miss you every day
The beautifullest thing in this world to see your smiiling face
And Fred and Isaac damn I hate y'all died like that
Taking slugs in your back cause your truck got jacked
But lil' Isaac boy I wish you woulda had on a vest
And until this day I know your soul holdin' down the crest
And Peanut and Beesy both of y'all died for some girls
Yo' mama brought you here but haters took you out of this world
And Damon Frank from here on out we gonna hold your name down
The love you had for Hundred Station, Smiling Coat and Gumptown
And lil' Poony your soldier name was Eddie Hell
And all my thugs in Riverside gave you the truest fairwell
And that's for real!

[Chorus(both)]
Now some people come and some people go
But how you leave this world young playa don't nobody know
I see your chest up out the casket not on the floor
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to go
Now everytime I hit that wood I blow smoke in the sky
I know you closer to cloud 9 my boy so go on and get high
I see your mama shaking her head and wiping her tears from her eyes
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to die

(Gangsta)
It's been a struggle everyday just trying to fight to survive
It's like the Gump ain't been the same since my homies done died
Now Torio that was my boy since elementary days
I blow smoke for you in the air every time I get blazed
When Meatball took that fall I just couldn't even cope
The last time I seen my boy was down in juvenile court
I tell my players hold your head and keep your glock by your side
Don't be scared to up and bust when they testin' your pride
Juwan Turner got killed man I can't take it no more
I might be wrong but I don't think it was my homie time to go
When lil' Junior died the Westside got out of control
We miss that brother soul how much he'll never know
Oh and reminiscing on my boy lil' Khatto 
I know you in that paradise cause that's where all the g's go
Pour out some liquor for my homies no I'm spitting these rhymes
Cause pouring out some alcohol can't tell you how I feel inside

The days that we spent without your presence around
For all them players who didn't make it we gonna hold this thing down
Until we meet again homies cause it ain't gonna be here
I guess I'll see y'all in the heavens where all the real g's live
And that's for real

(Chorus)
Now some people come and some people go
But how you leave this world young playa don't nobody know
I see your chest up out the casket not on the floor
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to go
Now every time I hit that wood I blow smoke in the sky
I know you closer to cloud 9 my boy so go on and get high
I see your mama shaking her head and wiping her tears from her eyes
I'm asking the Lord the same ole questions why you had to die

(Pimp)
Now as I walk through the valley with the shadows of death
My homies gone so I'm walkin this valley all by myself
We miss our boy lil' Willie so much he was like a brother to us
I know you watching the world telling God how tight we was
You might be gone but you ain't dead I feel your soul by my side
Asking me to check on your grandma to make sure she's alright 
I know it ain't nothing I can say right now that can bring your life back
I don't even hate the boy who killed you I'm gonna let God handle that
Cause who am I.....
To judge a man for his sin and his faith
The only thing I can do for Willie right now is change my ways
It's gonna be hard cause I'm a young playa that loves to get paid
Until that day I'm gonna pimp whores until I go to my grave

(Gangsta)
Now as I sit and reminisce upon my boy and all the things we been through 
Who knew this early in our lifetime that the Lord would choose you
How can I make this pain I can't take itit's breaking me down inside 
I'm asking the Lord to bless your soul as I wipe the tears from my eyes
I find it hard continuing life without you walking this earth
I guess we all gonna have to face death as an answer for birth
But where you're resting now you're free from all these criminal minds
I can't lie I'm kinda glad you're free from these struggling times
But yet and still I don't understand why you had to go so soon
My deepest sympathy goes to your family for your loss was a harsh wound
So Rest In Peace lil Willie Dickerson another homie to mourn
But I can't wait until Judgement Day when all our souls can rejoin

(Chorus)
Now some people come and some people go
But how you leave this world young playa don't nobody know
I see your chest up out the casket not on the floor
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to go
Now every time I hit that wood I blow smoke in the sky 
I know you closer to cloud 9 my boy so go on and get high
I see your mama shaking her head and wiping her tears from her eyes
I'm asking the Lord the same ole questions why you had to die

Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Sho nuff
Let's ride, let's ride

I'm Mr. Everyday Chiefer
Full of herb
And this killer ass reefer got a nigga feeling swozy
I'm slowly, creepin' up through the hood
And I see my niggas, and the smoking real good
So show a nigga love, what up kinfolk
And while you at my nigga, won't you past the dope
You know a nigga has to choke
Of killer both for me, I got the smoke flowing down my throat
So playa won't you ride with me
We can get quizzer in the front of my drop top Caddy
With my heat just ready to skeet
So playa please don't drop no fire on my feet
But it's all good, cause it's much love
And I got my mind twisted off kind bud
I'm screaming out Dirty thug
Sipping on the Cognac with the hardest buzz
So tell me what it was
What it be like
Mr. G living up to this gangster life
And it's got me on a flight higher than a kite
And my eyes real low so I have no sight
I'm feeling really right as I keep flow, through the sky
Way past cloud number nine
Chiefing all the time, blazing on an ounce
Cause I just can't make it with a nickel or a dime
Everything looking fine in the Gump city
Girls walk around short skirts on looking pretty
You can tell the thugs from the sedity
All the high-class girls always acting nitty
But showing no pity, in the land
Of blunt passing
Niggas be everlasting
Where Mr. G gone blaze the weed 
Until I'm dead and gone off in my casket

[Chorus]
Now take a trip in my 'Lac with me
We can patch in 
You can go half on a sack with me
We can find a freaky slut to beat
And if it come down to it
We can bust our heat in the street
See, it don't really matter
Long as I'm down for you
And you down for me
We can ride together, forever
Rolling through the streets of the G-you-M-P

It ain't nothing like riding the track, rocking the show
Making the crowd get hype, letting them know
Is you ready to wild out, I'm bout to flow
Got you peeping the style out, as I go
Now should I drop the game on them hoes
Now do you really understand 
How the pimp game goes
It's all about money and hoes
Keep us in it, with your mind froze
And slamming Cadillac doors

Now I'm a ride on the track
Giving you something that you can feel
Better buckle up before you go, haters hit the door
Cause we be hitting you with the skills
Don't give up before you flow, I'm a let you know
That my adrenaline assembling
That's enough to have a emcee trembling
Just give me the mic and them Frank Benjamin's
And call the paramedic, I'm about to injure men
Finish him, ain't many left to cope
Hearts stopped beating, listen to this stethoscope
So many emcees getting' left for broke
And try to make a comeback, shoulda kept the joke
Khao be the name, try dissin' me
Your history, your absence a mystery
Dried your game up like an antihistamine
Put that on Big Pimp and Mr. G
This'll be, something that people can ride to
Laid back, track cool like Rallo
Hit after hit we follow
Wanted to nibble and bit off way more than you can swallow
Why'all must be drunk off the bottle
Hating on us, don't talk, bring yourself to me
I don't need nobody helping me
I'm about to lyrically burn a brother to the twelfth degree
What why'all want to do now, huh
Humiliated, didn't know, Krumbsnatchaz affiliated
With Dirty, came up and really made it
All these cats want to be down with us
I really hate it, but illustrated, the picture
It takes skills to grab the mic
And keep it tight, some want, simplified:
Some had it, some got it
Some wish they did, and some don't

It ain't nothing like riding the track, rocking the show
Making the crowd get hype, letting them know
Is you ready to wild out, I'm bout to flow
Got you peeping the style out, as I go

Now should I drop the game on them hoes
Now do you really understand 
How the pimp game goes
It's all about money and hoes
Keep us in it, with your mind froze
And slamming Cadillac doors

Now let me take you to the land where the riders see
Pardon me shorty
Let me introduce you to my pimp psychology
Let a young nigga hold if you down with a holla at me
Now follow me, to my '98 'Lac outside
Now is she ready to ride
Slip cover your eyes, it's a surprise
I'll be obliged if you slide where them Dirty boys hide
And I was hypnotized when a young playa saw (um,um)
Your pretty brown eyes
And I apologize if I came to hard
Trying to get between your, sugar brown thighs
You know the pimp hide
And it's twelve o'clock tonight
I got late night lust
We need to, bring a pen and pad
And keep count (keep count) 
Of the nuts I bust (I bust)
I'm swerving, looking through my rear view nervous
While your head steady working
And your neck steady jerking
Up on your knees in my seat
And your lips steady slurping
I don't just kill a knob
And I know your mouth finna' throb
And baby if you could
Shine and rob with your tongue
Like old Inga Shywood (Shywood), situation all good
I love the way you got straight to it 
And plus I love the way you do it
I wouldn't take nothing from you
Girl you's a true headhunter
Booger-lips turner
You must have got it from you mother
Now look up in the sky, it's a pimp in the air
So freaky bitches better beware
I got your mind, mega blown
With the game that I spit
And keep them freaky bitches horny as hell

Now should I drop the game on them hoes
Now do you really understand 
How the pimp game goes
It's all about money and hoes
Keep us in it, with your mind froze
And slamming Cadillac doors

It ain't nothing like riding the track, rocking the show
Making the crowd get hype, letting them know
Is you ready to wild out, I'm bout to flow
Got you peeping the style out, as I go

While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise

Young shawty I'm the pimp, so you know my game cold
Brush all my teeth cause my whole grill gold
Step out my house, pink gators on my toes
Tryna hit tha club before they all close
Hop in the Lac, Fleetwood eight four
Twenty inch G's with tha triple gold spokes
Creep in the door with my pockets on swole
Limp across tha flo like both of my legs broke
Slide to tha bar to get me somn cold
Got a glass of Thunderbird cause I can't stay in mode
Put down my glass and hit tha dance flo
Don't get mad at me boy what you cuffin' my hands for
If I want it I'ma get it ya know how my game go
? I'm pullin ya main woe
I'm chargin' for this game, I'm givin' you lames yos
Gotta line these girls up in a soul train row
I hit tha V.I.P. just to get my mind blown
Do I see Mista G he got that fire dro
All tha hataz in tha club what ya rollin' ya eyes fo
Cause ya mad I'm pushin' good and pimped out tha side door

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Now when I hop off in tha Lac, I swerve tha interstate
Just because I'm cheifin' dro and I'm smugglin' heavy weigh
Keep tha hood bout my G's and break um off a K
And sip on Hennessy till I start to hallucinate
Pull my way down tha block cause its mo money to make
And plus I got some mo cookie dough I need to bake
But you can buy a bag of mine and I betcha you gon' be straight
Cause tha soft ain't got no cut and tha wood ain't got no shape
Cause tha fiends run to me whenever they want to taste
Cause they say that mine taste like baked potato and steak
Well excuse me if I done took all yo pay
Cause I just set up shop and been workin' for one day
You say you want to rob me, well hell that's a mistake
Cause I got atomic bombs that cause tha Earth to quake

It not God man its me, cause I destroyed tha place
All because of this devious busta who tried to hate
When all he had to do was ask, instead he tried to take

It's about 2:45 and we at tha red light
Looked in my mirror, and saw some head lights

But tha group done checked around when ya on tha westside
Put my foot to tha flo, doin' bout eighty five
Hit Fairview, headed to Riverside
They behind us kinda close, so hell I bust a ride
Ran on tha curb and scrubbed my damn tire
Man can't you mash tha gas and dash up outta sight
What ya talkin' 'bout, I'm doin' a bill five
I could pick up mo speed on a ten speed bike
Oh you tryna joke, better hope we don't die
Since we ain't packin gats it seems we gotta fight
When I throw a left, you best to throw a right
Pull up in tha cut so they can pass us by
Get down in yo seat and get off tha brake light
They pulled up in tha back and blocked us from behind

He said listen heyah Dirty, why you tryna hide
I was just tryna tell ya Cadillac is tight

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang

Or I could hit it from the back

Gotti we gone slide down swang wide
(Aight)
We gone ride gray or peanut butter buck eyed
Then we gone tip toe, so slow
We gone wreck the slab for the dirty third coast
Hell we gone post up, on the lot

Fifth drop screens lit, trunk pop
Stash spot, cash box, on vogue socks
Old shoes chrome laces giving haters blues
Banging what Screw, tell me what it do
Shocking and rocking club and the thug and staying true

I'ma do my thug thang, bang bang, chitty, chitty chop
With the stash unlocked, trunks staying hot
HA, green sticky la, deep in the shop
Cardiac kicking times

It's a party baby bounce, bounce sugar hit the flo'
I'm on the cool up in the fo', in the newest Gucci clothes
'Bout to drop it to the door, baguettes touching my navel
Body rocking kinda slutty, served out like label

We got, a stable full of pop
That dish the satellite and throw cable at the spot
Up on the table if it's able to get wet like a mop
And after we wreck the spot we can just ride

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang

I'ma do it like this, I'ma do it like that
I can hit it from the front
(Or I could hit it from the back)
I'ma put it in your crack, see how you act

If you like it on your knees, you could have it for a snack
I'm a fat mack, in a handy bag with a snub with 'em
Broads like the way the fat mack do his thug thizzel
When I hit 'em with my love then I got 'em

I'ma hit it from the top, I'ma put it in a bottle
I'ma hit it from the back, the big black Casanova
I'ma put it in your head and I'ma set it on your shoulders
Syrup in the soda, talking bout the Barre

Foreigner car, feeling like a fallen star
'Bout the menage 'tois ain't that what that Pokey said
Never been scared, South side will leave you dead
And call me Big Meaty, call me Big Meaty

Don't come into my room if you ain't gone get freaky
Working on his boys, run through em like a tractor
Out the South side, Moe-Yo make the god damn adapter
I ain't even quit, I'm doing mighty fast

Sitting on glass, Moe-Yo showing my naked ass
It's the Moe-Yo freestyle I'm so throed
South side playa putting it down, cho-cho
Playas get chosen, like M O E

Put it in your middle yes the big body
Riding big tractor, I'm a money stacker
Out the South side Moe-Yo I'm kinda actor

Any of why yall prankstas, why yall ain't gangstas
Why yall just throwbacks

Sissy ass bitch then take yo ass to Chuck Wilder
Women's prison and you still probably won't last for a hour
You a nigga scared to death you gon' get raped in the shower
By 6 dikes slapping yo ass with towels
You'll probably move yo bowels
You'll probably piss on yourself and crumble like a ball of powder

What to my surprise..

(Verse 1)
Young shawty I'm the pimp, so you know my game cold
Brush all my teeth cause my whole grill gold
Step out my house, pink gators on my toes
Tryna hit tha club before they all close
Hop in the Lac, Fleetwood eight four
Twenty inch G's with tha triple gold spokes
Creep in the door with my pockets on swole
Limp across tha flo like both of my legs broke
Slide to tha bar to get me somn cold
Got a glass of Thunderbird cause I can't stay in mode
Put down my glass and hit tha dance flo
Don't get mad at me boy what you cuffin my hands for
If I want it I'ma get it ya know how my game go
? I'm pullin ya main woe
I'm chargin for this game, I'm givin you lames yos
Gotta line these girls up in a soul train row
I hit tha V.I.P. just to get my mind blown
Do I see Mista G he got that fire dro
All tha hataz in tha club what ya rollin ya eyes fo
Cause ya mad i'm pushin good and pimped out tha side door

(Chorus 2X)
While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..

(Verse 2)
Now when I hop off in tha Lac, I swerve tha interstate
Just because I'm cheifin dro and i'm smugglin heavy weigh
Keep tha hood bout my G's and break um off a K
And sip on Hennessy till I start to hallucinate
Pull my way down tha block cause its mo money to make
And plus I got some mo cookie dough I need to bake
But you can buy a bag of mine and I betcha you gon' be straight
Cause tha soft ain't got no cut and tha wood ain't got no shape
Cause tha fiends run to me whenever they want to taste
Cause they say that mine taste like baked potato and steak
Well excuse me if I done took all yo pay
Cause I just set up shop and been workin for one day
You say you want to rob me, well hell that's a mistake
Cause I got atomic bombs that cause tha Earth to quake
It'll open all tha gates and cause heaven to shake
It not God man its me, cause I destroyed tha place
All because of this devious busta who tried to hate
When all he had to do was ask, instead he tried to take

I put 24 inches on the Brougham
Call my baddest bitch and tell her daddy comin' home
Pull up at the light and them thangs keep spinnin'
I'm bustin' down a Philly, finna fill it with a 20
That liquor got me swervin', E&J is what we sippin'
Just pulled it out the shop, so that paint still drippin'
Got that thang flip-flop, so the flop keep flippin'
Keep that 45 cock when I'm woodgrain grippin'

[Verse 1:  Big Pimp]
I woke up Friday morning, right before I washed my ass
My nigga Keke called me, told me ""Boy, come get your Lac""
I'm happy as hell cause I been waitin' for the call
He told me that he sprayed it last night with stone wall
""You got 31 Flavors, and boy you need to see'em
But you need you some rims, so meet me down at Emmet Neil's
And Pimp while you thinkin', I'mma tell you how to kill her
Take off them Gary Payton's and sit that bitch on Andre Miller's""
I call up LaKiera, that's my main thoroughbred
Cause right 'fore I hit her, I get some flame-thorough-head
Now when she suck it, she don't play when she catch it
Could it be I run with J and Scarface down in Texas?
But I'm down in Alabama where the ballers love flexin'
Keep my 45 cocked just in case I feel threatened
I pulled up at the light and them hoes almost fainted
I hearin' screamin' out, hollerin' ""Keke must'a painted it""
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:  G-stacka]
I'm choppin' down your block in a big body Brougham
Candy flip-flop, 24 inch chrome
Spinnin' like four windmills, enough to give off wind chills
And all this dro smoke is startin' to fog up my windshield
I'm sittin' more high than four deers, stacked on top of four hills
And if I sip 'bout four beers, I'll need four blunts to straight kill
I'll show you how that bass feel, four 15's off in the rear
Beatin' so hard off in your ear, when you get out you can hardly hear
Mix E&J with Belvedere, so my mind ain't never clear
My 4-5 been with me so goddamn long feel like my souvenir
You want to know what's truly real? How many times my candy flip
The sun make my paint look like a fruity bag of M&M's
Hoes love the way it drip, so they holla ""Let me ride""
So it's me and Pimp with 'bout twenty-four hoes inside, every night
Takin' flight, in my Fleetwood full of hood freaks
And if that thang is candy paint, it must got sprayed my Keke

[Chorus]


[Verse 3:  Both]
(In singing-rap style)

[Big Pimp] We push Caddies with gold spokes, vogues with mo-mo
[G-stacka] They sit high, they sit low, 20's and 24's
[Big Pimp] We got hoes that dike hoes, suck dick, and snort blow
[G-stacka] We got niggas that smoke dro, push bricks, and elbows
[Big Pimp] Thirty-one clear coats drip wet like Mop 'n Glow
[G-stacka] Spinners that chop fast, spinners that chop slow
[Big Pimp] Gators of all soles, furs, and perm fros

I'm on my knees screamin' ""Baby I apologize""
'Cause I don' hurt you so much, I know you tire of cryin'
You was there every Sunday when I was doin' time
And sent a letter every Monday just to ease my mind
To let a nigga know that pussy cat was still mine
And bought you two fat dildos just to kill time
The fact that I'm... on the other side of this glass
I realize... just exactly what a nigga had
You stayed wit' me... even though I used to spank that ass
Didn't hesitated wit' me... any time I needed cash
A many days I was stressed out and feelin' bad
You laid me down on my chest and massaged my back
And plenty days you don' cooked, and I never came home
Collard greens, macaroni & cheese, and neckbone
Po'kchop, sweet potato pie up out the stove so hot
I know I'm pimpin' right now, but baby one day this pimp gon' stop
I know I was crazy baby I had you out there slangin' rocks
But I'm out now so face it baby I gotta hit the block
What you talkin' 'bout? Hell yeah I love you and it ain't gon' stop
I always said I wan'nt gon' do it again but I never stop
But I did you so wrong - that's the purpose for this song
I didn't mean to break your heart but now our love is on the run
Run-run-run-run, fuss-n-fightin'
What's done is what's done, let bygones be bygones
And you was there - to console when I lost my homey
And you was there - to give me head anytime I was ho'ny/horny
And you was there - when my eyes was on the verge of cryin'
And you was there - when I was on the verge of dyin'
So how the fuck I fixed my mouth to call you a bitch
If you was bitchin', it's probably 'cause I got you pissed

A gangsta wife(yeah), down to ride(oooooh yeah)

Shawty, I know it's been hard on ya the past couple of years
You shed so many tears, wonderin' if my love is real
To show you how I feel, hell I mostly pay the bills
Hustle up on drug deals, so we can get a hot meal
I'm from the streets, so the streets don' made me how I is
I know I'm in them day and night, but that's just how I live
So ain't no need to fuss and fight, wit' you all in my grill
'Cause if I ain't want you, best believe that I wouldn't be here
Got some issues, best believe that we gon' get clear
'Cause you been down wit' me too long to up and disappear
Just give me time, enough time for me to stack a mil'
Then we can hit the hill and build us a tight crib
Some tight cars, candy paint wit' the big wheels
Bulletproof windshields, strapped with the blue steele
I know your love is trill, 'cause you don' stuck wit' me
So if I up and leave this city here, you goin' wit' me
If I come stuntin' in the hood, shit you stuntin' wit' me
And if I'm chiefin' me some wood, shit you chiefin' wit' me
I'll never get through thuggin', but'll be a good husband
The only one you lovin' plus the only one you fuckin'
The situation get ugly, then your head I'm bustin'
That's if you cheat, or you leave a nigga stuck with nothin'
Eventually you'll see, and understand me
So when I'm through off in these streets, one day you'll be

Now if I die tonight, you tell my babies that they daddy was gangsta
(Errry gang' - errry gangsta)
Now if I die tonight, you tell my babies that they daddy was gangsta

[Verse 1: Big Pimp]
Now off the top, I was (errry) pimp roller, hoe stroller
Hard time ""Coco-Cola"" solder, a 4-5 cocked-glock-toter
That come BACK and hit the same SPOT for the rocks I sold ya
I thought I told ya bitch - I'm gangsta mixed with a lot of soldier
A black-plastic-bag-body-folder
'Cause for the cash, I'll have you lookin' bad if I ain't know ya
And to my kids, for the last four years all I did was love ya
'Cause everythang I did since then, shit I did it for ya
I know you see me a lot of times fussin' with y'all mother
I hear you in the front, hollerin' and cryin' thinkin' I'm hurtin' your mother
That's when I realize, to stop your cries I need to hug ya
That's when I dry your eyes and explain why I'm leavin' your mother
Da-da gon' always be here, not because I made a promise
Shit, I helped created you, even though you came up out her stomach
And everything I got, you can have it ,if you want it
But if I don't have it, and a nigga do, I'mma take it from him
I promise, I'm y'all personal ridah
Somebody fuck wit'cha, come tell your pop, and watch your pop, POP som'n inside'em
And to my lil girl, them niggas tryin' to holla, I'mma burn'em
Tell them fuck niggas you got a father and you don't need non' from'em
And to my five boys, y'all niggas already causin' drama
I have y'all spittin' on people, gettin' mad, and tryin' to bite y'all mama
And I'mma tell y'all one more thing, even if you disregard the other
Dev, Deshawd, Davarius, Tamier, Danya, and Dane - look out for each other

[Chorus]

[Mr. G-stacka]
Now let's just say that if tonight, was the night, that a nigga had to go
Just tell my family that I love'em, 4-1-0 to my Kin Folk
But for my baby daughter, I just feel I ought'ta, let her know
How her daddy was a gangsta, hustled hard to get that doe
A young thug livin', came up off drug dealin', and pistol grippin'
Catch a nigga slippin', and lickin',  most of my competition
Thinkin' with precision, enough to keep me up outta prison
Slangin' with intentions, to get rid of all my chickens
Stayin' strapped with ammunition, that hit niggas from a distance
Once they run they mouth, you'll find them bitches missin' - now pay attention
Now, ain't no need to question why, daddy's a soldier
Full-clip-loader, big-gun-toter, all-day-'dro-blower
I don' sacked the finest green and cracked the finest soda, grindin' to support ya
All the dimes I don' broke up, all the crimes that provoke us
All the grime I don' soaked up, it's my mind that I can't trust
And it gets tuff, thinkin' one day I'll slip up
And leave you all alone, now that's enough to drive me crazy on my own
But baby stay strong... No, I never meant wrong
My only objective, was to provide so you can live long
And everything I speak on, take it to the heart
'Cause if I die tonight, it's on your mom to play her part and my part
And that's hard, that's why I pray to God
And ask him, when He take me out this world
Watch over my baby girl
That's for real

[Chorus](4x)
[**Singing interlaced with last two cycles of original chorus**]
If I die tonight, if I die tonight - Oooh-ooooh-oooooh

[Pimp]  Oh shiit, since I said som' first, gon' get it man
Yeah, take it back man
Fuck it, leave it like that, leave it like that..
Shiit, keep it real, fuck it... Gone, go head man

[G]  Shiit, you know... and that's what we mean, why'knaw'msayin'
I don't know

[Pimp]  I love my babies
Daddy ain't really got nothin' to say y'all we don' said it all

[G]  We don' said it, but you know
You know how we feel, y'all know we love y'all

Ya'll better be good too, and y'all better take care of us too

Dirty,"[Intro]
First off, I want to say I thank all the radio stations
that EVER showed them Dirty Boyz some love
We 'preciate that... but we doin' this for all our
down-south rappers that ain't gettin' no love on
these video stations and on these radio stations...
All my down-south soldiers, they gon' keep doin'
this to us if ya'll don't stand up, right now and ride with us
STAND UP RIGHT NOW, AND NIGGA LET'S RIDE

[Verse 1:  Big Pimp]
I don't know if I'm goin', or leavin', or comin'
But I know Universal got us starvin' and hungry
I'm sick to my stomach, I vomit every time
I see a video on TV that ain't mine
You know I ain't lying, half of 'em can't rhyme
Black Entertainment... why ya'll won't play mine?
We gave two videos to be	-E-T
For both, we paid 200 G's a piece
Ya'll must don't like us, all ya'll must hate us
We don't get no love and support from our label
Two whole years, and ya'll just dropped the album
With no fuckin' commercials or promotions to tell them
That we was comin', so people could go runnin'
To the nearest music store, so we could have us some money
So I could feed all my kids, pay all my bills
Rent thirty days late, so where the FUCK we gon' live?
Nelly and Baby selling records way to Timbuktu
If ya'll put all the money behind them, what the FUCK we gon' use?
But Nelly and Baby, we ain't hatin', we just lettin' it be known
To show the whole world how Universal, doin' us wrong

[Chorus]
Either you gon' love uuus (Either you gon' love uuus)
Or you gonna hate uuus---There's no in-between
I sit and wonder where we went wrong
You motherfuckers better love us or just leave us alone

Either you with uuus (Either you with uuus)
Or you against uuus---There's no in-between
I sit and wonder where we went wrong,
You motherfuckers better love us or just leave us alone

[Verse 2:  Mr. G-stacka]
It's like either you gon' love us, or hate us, bitch niggas, just face us
Two of the coldest thangs ever to touch pencil and paper
How the fuck they gon' replace us, knock'em off it they think such
Been in this game too long, I'll let loose chrome before I get touched
'Cause this shit done got me too hot, and I want to know who shot Tupac
'Cause them might be the same lames that try to make sure we don't reach top
But I think not, 'cause I keep glocks... Ya'll niggas ain't feelin' me
It's time for Pimp and G to get rid of all wack niggas in this industry
It's history, what they should be, all kinda unsolved mysteries
These hollow-T's in this 2-2-3, will end your life so damn tragically
I'm talkin' to all the big men, with authority over our shit playin'
These niggas that's over these video shows is hoes, and that's what G sayin'
Rewind that back and replay it, if didn't quite get through your head
I don't bite my tongue for none, so why in the fuck am I supposed to be scared
Ya'll bitches done brought the south shame, bitin' up all the south game
Then blowin' up off the south name, don't never want to give the south fame
But ya'll better tell'em, that Gangsta straight rebellin'
I'll go off, and put twenty holes in your cerebellum, you smell'em?
They try to stop us, but these niggas fellin'
And every time you see me this is what the fuck I'm yellin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:  Mr. G-stacka]
Now off the top I'm tellin' these lame ole, plain ole, sadiddy, and bourgie
want to-be white niggas, 'round here judging gangsta music
See this here is not for you trick, get on up outta office
Let the hood niggas judge me, 'cause the hood is the ones who bought this
In Vibe they tried to talk shit, them sissy there can suck dick
'Cause Pimp and G the rawest, everythang we spit is flawless
Why the hell they want to start us, spittin' false information
They staff get infiltrated, and bullets gon' penetrate 'em

[Big Pimp]
And that's how every rapper, comin' from down south feelin'
We can't speak our minds 'cause east coast run hip-hop television
And it's so puzzling, to the fact and I really don't get it
They still won't play our video even though we put Tigger in it
'Cause we don't dance around on all our videos like P. Diddy
Is ya'll tellin' me that all my videos ain't ""jiggy""?
Oh, you hear me?  And it's a shame, and it's a goddamn pity

If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it

Tell him to just get out,

Nothing left to talk about

Pack his raincoat show him out

Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no

Don't pretend that is right when it's over

But I'mma let 'em know throughout all the hatin'
And all the sticks and stones being throwed at the Pimp and da Gangsta
We stayed on our toes, all ten of 'em
No matter what, representin' Montgomery, Alabama
We still here, all debts paid
'Cause we don' paid our dues, we don' paid 'em

Ohhh, ooohhh
I don' paid my dues - my dues - my dues (wow, oohhh)
Ooohh, ooohhh
I don' paid my dues - my dues - my dues (wow, oohhh)

Ok, uh
I dedicated ten years of my life, ten years on the mic
Ten years sittin' at home writin' rhymes gettin' tight
And every nigga dream is to blow up over night
But every nigga dream don't seem to turn out right
I had to sacrifice, so school just wan't the thang for me
I rather get a bag of weed and freestyle over every beat I hear
And enter every talent show to let them see our skills
This rappin' shit is school, but it ain't payin' mama bills
And they ask me why I feel, the way I feel for real
'Cause to get to where I am I paid my dues in my career
Like jackin' niggaz beats, hustlin' to get our own
Now we record in studios, we used to spit our raps on the phone
And dealin' with niggaz who claimed they'll manage us
They intentions was good, but their actions almost damaged us
They amateurs, and we was like, way before our time
It was money on our mind, so we stayed on our grind
One day we gon' shine, one day we gon' sign
One day we gon' get paid for writin' these cold ass rhymes
And since that day has came, it's been nothin' but trouble
Some niggaz who rolled with us, is no longer ridin' for us
Some bitches bad-mouthin' our names as if they know us
At first they had our back, now these bitches want to destro' us
But hold up, 'cause we got plenty fans that stayed true
That know what we been through to get here, we paid dues

[Chorus]

Y'all know me  I'm the be-I-G P-I-M-P
Daddy Hall that fat nigga that rap with Mr. G
Ooh Lawd now what would I be without he?
Let me take y'all - back when it started in grade three
Every morning listenin' to this nigga named Boosky
This dude had lyrical flow, killin' niggaz back and forth
Who that there?  Man, how you do that there?
Goddamn I want to do that there
So I went home and wrote my first rhyme, for the first time
Didn't know nothin' 'bout no bar, so I called it my first rap line
In due time, I was rappin' to the beats of Run-D.M.C.(Run-errie-Run)
Learnin' from the super staaars
We they rap I start rappin', when they stopped - I stopped
That's how I learned to count sixteen bars
Every chance I got, I showed my talent
'Cause every month this lady Coon throwed a talent show in Cedar Park
We did it for love, we didn't know nothin' bout know spinnin' rims or candy cars
The tips we got, we bought M&M's and candy bars
Plus at that time, I was still rappin' by myself
I hit eighth grade, then realized that I needed some help
My first time tryin' to find a partner, man I went through a dozen
I went home one day and somethin' said, ""Mayne, listen to your cousin""
His first rap this nigga snapped, first two bars, fightin' and shootin'
And every day black bandana retro J's Nike suits, and
Big gold chains, and bad bitches that like to give brain
Hey, that's my kinda rap, shiet we one in the same
Simple and plain, the rest is history
A quick summary on how I met Mr. G
But since that time, our life don' got better
'Stead of rappin' for dips of chocolate, we rappin' for whips and cheddar
Fo' real, we don' paid our dues me and my lil' cousin, we don' paid our dues

Pimp life, don't screw up, don't choose any foes(never choosin' foes)
Pimp life, that's the life I chose(that's the life I chose)

What is it 'bout Gangsta, that got you sprung from him
Catchin' nuts on your tongue from him, pullin' out your guns for him
Then turn right around and spend all your funds on him
Just spoilin' him, and spoilin' him, it's only two days you been knowin' him
I guess this goes to show the wimps, this boy's here born to pimp - forever
I hit the streets stuffed in the Coupe Deville with plushed out leather
With four of my baddest hoes, who knows to bring Da Gangsta chetter
No matter morning, noon, or night or any type of weather
They claim they love me, wouldn't treat no other nigga better
But I don't sweat 'em, I just tell 'em, better yet just let 'em
Do what they do, sooner or later they'll find out I ain't true
But still official, hell they call me Mr. Jizzle
Got two of the baddest strippers lickin' on each other's nipples
It's so simple - they just need motivation, now it's masturbation
And dick suck-you-lick-tacious, I'm facing on every occasion
Don't need persuasion, just kick some conversation
And strip 'em naked, and make them bitches take it
'Cause I'm straight pimpin'

[Chorus]

I leave the club about three-thirty, damn near yawnin'
Been here since twelve, and hell, still ain't found no bitch worth bonin'
""I finna roll"", So I work my way to the front do' I spot Michelle
She used to fuck with this lil' dike bitch named Cocoa
But all I know though, she probably still lick that hoe low
A lot of these hoes tryin' to go pro, if you don't ask, you won't know
You still don't know her do you? 
She used to sell tapes for Jo Pro
You ain't talkin' bout lil' short red Cocoa
Used fuck with your homeboy BoBo
Yep, that's her fo' sho
I was obliged to have both of them hoes off in my ride
But more obliged to see Michelle head 'tween Cocoa thighs
And if you didn't know I was a P-I, M-P
It's in me, genetically, and it better be
From all the pimp game my uncles tellin' me
Upcomin' pimps respectin' me, game ass bitch selectin' me
Can't be the lame trick you expectin' to be
I'm a pimp lil' bitch who you expect to see
With a fifth of Hennessey and some Ecstasy
With two thick freaks sittin' next to me
In a candy pink 'Lac with the matchin' seats
Q-P stash with a dash of be	
Girl, you look to sweet tryin' to dazzle me
Legs cocked up in the passenger seat

She want to ride--she gotta get some dirt on her knees
It hurt'em to see, they baby mama swervin' with me
Left out your house with some pants but had a skirt underneath
She in the heavy see-H-E-V 350 rockin' with the shift kit hurtin' the street
She on the block like she workin' the street
But if I get her in my car, I'mma have the bitch slurpin' for free
Oh you say you want to twirk for a fee? Well I ain't no trick, BIOTCH
I'll have your ass workin' for me
They call me Peter Wee, because I flirt with the freaks
But you ain't never seen me do it, you just heard it was me
And I'm is...

[Chorus:  Big Pimp] (2x)
We still pimpin' hoes, we still gangstafied
We still ridin' vogues, we gettin' high
We still in the club, we still sackin' wood
We still on them tweety dubs, we still in the hood

[Verse 2:  G-Stacka]
Now you know Gangsta stayin' blacked down, with a black 4-pound
And'll bust off rounds, in your chest until your back blow out
Cause everyday I hit the corner with a cracked up ounce
Them fiends see me, boy they start to do the Crackhead Bounce
And I got grams, grams, and grams of blow
Of pure white snow, I call myself the good-dope-store
You'll catch me deep off in the hood sittin' on all gold spokes
Or probably smokin' on that wood, sippin' that Hypnot-o
And my motto is:  If you ain't gangsta, you ain't livin' right
And if you ain't pimpin' we got prescriptions that'll get you tight
I come from the street, so packin' heat is just a part of life
And game on your wife, freak her one night now she a super dike
And it's the same damn thang everyday, flood the block with ya'
They don't smoke if they don't pay
I got a tech-9 in my waistline that'll leave your smoke gray
And in the hood is where you'll find me on a daily paper chase

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:  G-Stacka]
Now when they see me, hell they holla ""Gangsta what you got for bout two bills""
I'll give your ass a ten pack of triple stack X-pills
And that's real, cause a nigga out here tryin' to live
I hit the block with a bunch of rocks until I stack me a mil'

[Verse 4:  Big Pimp]
I shack/Shaq like O'neal, thirty-two O's in the grill
I point guard with G, but I coach them hoes like I'm Phil
Niggas ask what I'll be doin' if I ain't have this deal
And I tell them ""The same thang for the last eighteen years""
And that is...

Uncle Pimp and G
[G] What's up
Could you read us a hoodtime story please?
[G]Y'all all in the trap
Yep
[G]Ok, ok...Here we go

[Verse 1: Big Pimp]
Once upon a time not long ago, lived two cousins that was broke
With no money in their pocket, they result to sellin' dope
Movin' everythang from regular weed, crack-cocaine, and 'dro
Didn't want the MPD's to catch 'em so they kept it on the low
Bought another and another, broke bread with each other
Sell that butter in the hood and give the rest to their mother
Other brothers wanna flex, then that simp is gettin' fucked up
Call him Gangsta, oh and you may call me Silky Pimp Cutta
Hustle like a mother... gul hand filled with clusters
Alabama on my back, best believe I got the muscle
Crank the 'Lac we gotta roll, they stole the rims up off the Nova
Comin' back from Texas, undercovers tryin' to pull us over
Ridin' up the block doin' eighty-three (eighty-three)
I bet it was some motherfucker hatin' on me (hatin' on me)
Dave the Dope King, supplyin' all the flow
Went to court last week and snitched on all his folk

[Chorus x2: chops and splices with variations throughout the chorus]
Choppin' down the block bitch
Choppin' down the block bitch
Choppin' down the block bitch
Choppin' down the block bitch

[Verse 2: Mr. G-stacka]
Let me take you back to when the Pimp & Gangasta +Hit Da Flo+
You knew the South was finna blow when Pimp & Gangsta hit the do'
Nothin' but the southern slang, you hear it every time we spoke
Now niggaz hollerin' ""Here we is"", throughout the east and west coast
Represent the Gump, let 'em know that Bama got flow
Put it on the map, make 'em adapt to all my country folk
Every city that we go, pack the club and rock the show
Get respect from Gangstas, Vice Lords, Bloods, and the Locs
In the hood they crown us both, kings over all the fakers
Niggaz know they can't fade us, that's way them niggaz hate us
Meanwhile we switched labels, now we with the Mob bitch
J Prince made it able, cause we spit that hard shit
Blackklown a hard clique, as bout as hard a clique can get
Now that we on top, don't no niggaz wanna start shit
The problems that I deal wit' ain't deep enough to have me stoppin'
Hop off in the Chevy, flip-floppin' down the block choppin'

[Chorus x2]

Ma, baby take a charge for me
And my girl, is a real hot thang
And she catch hoes for me

That's my girl, with a red coat on
Sliding down the block, and her shoes made of chrome

My baby ain't ashamed, she'll jump off the top
And I like, when she make her last spot
When I put my school head, up on fifteen knots
You, better not touch my baby girl
We just balling all night, in our own little world

North star brain, and keep her down in my bed
Baby ain't scared, to strut her stuff in your lane
When I touches her brain, she get wet like rain
Jet down mayn, on a beautiful day
Waving my blue trunk, like we in a parade
If you lay in an escapade, when we in to winning
Don't drop the matches, on my baby's buck skin
Twenty two's tucked in, crawling for a playa
She love when Moe-Yo sing to her, getting paper
Hot we wreck the spot, and don't mind
When the fellas try to holla, 'cause I know baby fly

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

See my boo, don't mind being couped up
'Cause when the weekend roll around, she gets ooh stuff
When she juiced up, attitude screwed up
Leave a chip on her her shoulder, boys swear she souped up
I chunk my deuce up, 'cause my lady too tough
Four scoops of purple stuff, mixed in my cup ha
No matter who what, when where or how
In the middle of a crowd, baby gotta stand out
Let the top down, she don't believe in broads
Quick to snatch my boy, 'cause she attract the law
Ask her bout them boys, like his like your's

Dirty $,"Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

Gotti we gone slide down swang wide
(Aight)
We gone ride gray or peanut butter buck eyed
Then we gone tip toe, so slow
We gone wreck the slab for the dirty third coast
Hell we gone post up, on the lot

Fifth drop screens lit, trunk pop
Stash spot, cash box, on vogue socks
Old shoes chrome laces giving haters blues
Banging what Screw, tell me what it do
Shocking and rocking club and the thug and staying true

I'ma do my thug thang, bang bang, chitty, chitty chop
With the stash unlocked, trunks staying hot
HA, green sticky la, deep in the shop
Cardiac kicking times

It's a party baby bounce, bounce sugar hit the flo'
I'm on the cool up in the fo', in the newest Gucci clothes
'Bout to drop it to the door, baguettes touching my navel
Body rocking kinda slutty, served out like label

We got, a stable full of pop
That dish the satellite and throw cable at the spot
Up on the table if it's able to get wet like a mop
And after we wreck the spot we can just ride

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made

Or I could hit it from the back

I'ma do it like this, I'ma do it like that
I can hit it from the front
(Or I could hit it from the back)
I'ma put it in your crack, see how you act

If you like it on your knees, you could have it for a snack
I'm a fat mack, in a handy bag with a snub with 'em
Broads like the way the fat mack do his thug thizzel
When I hit 'em with my love then I got 'em

I'ma hit it from the top, I'ma put it in a bottle
I'ma hit it from the back, the big black Casanova
I'ma put it in your head and I'ma set it on your shoulders
Syrup in the soda, talking bout the Barre

Foreigner car, feeling like a fallen star
'Bout the menage 'tois ain't that what that Pokey said
Never been scared, South side will leave you dead
And call me Big Meaty, call me Big Meaty

Don't come into my room if you ain't gone get freaky
Working on his boys, run through em like a tractor
Out the South side, Moe-Yo make the god damn adapter
I ain't even quit, I'm doing mighty fast

Sitting on glass, Moe-Yo showing my naked ass
It's the Moe-Yo freestyle I'm so throed
South side playa putting it down, cho-cho
Playas get chosen, like M O E

Put it in your middle yes the big body
Riding big tractor, I'm a money stacker
Out the South side Moe-Yo I'm kinda actor
Act a damn fool, on this damn tape
Like Po-Yo said got them hoes screaming rape

I'm at the point, of no return
Caught up in this game, everybody know my name
I got, money to burn

[Ronnie Spencer]
I've been struggling, started off with nothing
Everybody know me, as the one to do thangs for free
Right now, I'm on the grind
See you got yours, I gotta get mine
See the most high, gave me a sign
He said son, it's your time

[Hook: x 2]

[Dirty]
I'm at the crossroad in my life, and baby it's do or die
Fall or floss, small or cry could mean slow suicide
On these streets scratching for my keep, grinding for my people
When you're not treated equal, it's so hard to live legal

Will my seed deceive em, to this never ending saga
Fascinated by cash cars, and clothes just like our papa
Taking mo' gambles than Pac did, in pursuit of the dolla
On the verge of crapping out, from money and power

Having big body dreams, and wood grain wishes
Trying to taste the good life, cause it looks so delicious
Man the pressure's tremendous, so I smoke on spinach
Trying to find some piece of mind, than get caught from behind

Mashing for the finish line, in this cruel millennium
Make mo' shine than lime, I'm spending more than time
Rocking pie with dimes, keep the top reclined
Use to be caught up in grind, now addicted to rhyme

Never turn my back, on what's real to me
That's my love, for my Wreckshop family
I had my share of likes, up's and down's
And thank goodness, I'm still around

Never could, make it on my own
When I'm looking in the sky, and I'm feeling so fly
But though one day, you're here
Then the next day, you're gone

[Tyte Eyez]
I'm at the point of no return, and ain't no looking back
'Cause there's ends I got to meet, big faces I got to stack
They say man'll make the money, but money'll make us move
Positions to get richer, a seven figga made dude

Calm on the cool, collecting cash flow
Keep my bidness on the low, prepared to drop my solo
The new millennium, Mr. Tyte E-Z
And if I turn my back now, then my kids won't eat

My wolf pack won't sleep, until we slay all prey
Get vicious without perdition in this Y2K
This feddy is in my vision, in this hectic paper chase
Wrecking my lyrical weapon, pimp the pen at a steady pace

Appreciate God pressing, no cases and no bars
Frauds and changed faces, but my game's up to par
A ghetto shooting star, and I ain't trying to go back
To the guns and the slums, and the jacks or the crack

Ain't it clear when I'm near you

Oh so don't pay no mind

It's just this heart on my sleeve that's a bleeding

Was just selfish and sad

Is just making me mad

There was a little dirty boy that was up to no good, 
He had a chip in his tooth and a mic in his hand, 
He had a dirty ass head from the beach and the sand, 
He said I just got out of the water and i'm late for school 
I asked dirty to skip and he said that's cool
So we went to the liquor store got ourselves 
Some magnum rollin' down the street 
Ya you know we brown bagged them, 
With the 50s on top and the 20s on bottom 
Said we rollin' through my hood ya you know we got 'em 
Sucker M-C's wanna battle me but that's okay I tell 'em 
Don't fuck around because we don't play I sang rock out with my cock out 
I got balls of steel hear me clanking down the street like a bag of beer, 
Said the dance off session gonna start right here, 
Dirty b grab the wheel cause I cant steer, 
You got 20 inch rims and they spinnin' when you stop, 
Said I don't give a fuck, kill it when the beat drops, 
Cause that's what I respect to all you knuckle heads and derelicts 
Just jammin' down the sound with the syllables and intellect, 
Maybe not the intellect but syllables are clean 
And I leave you in the desert with an empty canteen

I wanna learn to play guitar and sing just like Bradley
And the b lines that Eric dropped reminded me of hip hop
And I'm singin' lovin' is what I got I got I got
Cause when the lovin' was gone

I learned to play the blues through Stevie Ray Vaughn
I needed music for all the ways it helped me feel

But Duddy don't you worry you'll be sleeping in a moment, 
Then moments turn minutes and minutes turn to hours 
Then hours turn to long ass nights and cold showers. 

It's four in the morning still wide awake 
Let's see how many bong tokes Duddy B can take. 
I already drank all the alcohol left in my house so now 
I sit here wide awake with a dry fucking mouth 
And I just think of all the things on my mind 
And then I let um roll around about a million times 
Until it's got me you it grabs a hold of me baby, 
It's insomnia kids you know its drivin' me crazy.

I'd cry my self to sleep but I'm too scared that I might drown. 
I'm calling for the sandman but I don't think he's in town, 
And all these sleepless nights have running thoughts have got me down. 
I wish I had a sudden case of narcolepsy 
Maybe call up Duddy B so we can smoke the best weed 
And give me something nice so it can calm my chest peace 
And talk about these things that we really don't need. 
Now as I lay in bed in my head I'm running circles 
Stuck in the land of low light and infomercials. 
It's insomnia kids you know its drivin' me crazy 
Only thing that can save me is an overdose maybe.

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in.
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king? 

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

On the run, from the one That they called Sheriff Spark
Six guns by their side and bullets around their waist
Two shots to the sky
Signal sound for the chase
The safe was nearly empty and They were nearly free
But were seen by the Good eye of the mean Billy Green
And he screamed at the top of his lungs They're on the run
It's the two outsiders Grab your horses and your guns

I said I wish that
We could stay here,
But I fear our time has come
We could ride out in the darkness
Chasing the rising sun
We gotta pack our bags this instant,
We're heading south-bound to the next town
And if we all arrive there so safely,
Baby you can

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

They got nothing left to lose
'Cept their guns and their wounds
Now they're crossing borders
Sheriffs posse on their tail
They'd rather die together
Than be stuck up in a cell
They drank up all the whiskey and They partied every night
Like it could be the last The bounty said shoot on sight
So they chased the endless summer Though it came with the pride
They wouldn't stop running till They found a paradise
But the sheriff finally found them with his eyes seeing red
So the lovers had to shoot him down and fill him full of lead
They were finally free To find a place to lay their head
And when they finally did he looked at her and then he said

I said I think that we can stay here,
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean,
And sit with the rising sun
So unpack your bags this instant,
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely,
Baby you can

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Well you're my green-eyed girl And I've been running around with you
It's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do
So wipe the dirt off, or Take your shirt off,
And we should go hit the cantina, We got work off
I said it's hot outside Let me go swimming in your eyes
We've been running for a while
Why don't you lay down and make smile
I could never ask for nothing better than this
It's just tequila and the beach, that's why its salty when we kiss

I said I think that we can stay here,

If your ship breaks down, you can always find me,
And Dirty J chillin' underneath the shady tree,
Our fans are always welcome with our friends and family.

And if you wish you can stay, as long as you please
Just lend a helping hand up at our cabin by the sea
Where everyday is beautiful, the sun, the sand, the breeze
And everybody lives together here in harmony

And we'll sing
Just as loud as we please,
And we will be,
Forever so free,
So come follow me, cabin by the sea.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
You paint the fence, I'll hang the tire from the tree.
Our friends are all around, and the storm was a no show
Said we look better in the black and white photo.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
Sit up on a porch and we can burn a couple trees.
Our friends are all around and the storm was a no show,
Said we looked better in the black and white photo.

What the photograph don't show, is where we're headed tomorrow
And when we have to go, we'll always be together in the black and white photo.

Gather up some rocks and make a circle in the sand.
We'll fill it up with wood and build a fire with our hands,
The smoke starts to rise, the moon starts to shine,
You bring the weed, we'll bring the whiskey and the wine

And we can pass it all around, until it's all gone,
Put a message in the bottle, put the cork back on.
We'll throw it in the sea, the message it will read,
If you find this don't send help, send another bottle please!

And we'll sing but just as loud as we please.
But and we will be, forever so free,
So come follow me, cabin by the sea.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
You paint the fence, I'll hang the tire from the tree.

You better dance all night

Don't look now I just took flight
Apocalypse now, we own the night
Got two choices surf or fly
Skate or die, sink or swim
Crash or fly, look within
I do not let this bullshit phase me I see lights and I go crazy
Cool is the wind, dark is the sky
Blackbird sings in the dead of the night
Take these broken joints and get high
Take your worries kiss 'em goodbye
Tonight has been so amazing
I see you and I go crazy
You put me into this trance
I hear music lets dance

We ain't gonna stop now, no

Like an eagle flying across the sky, and they wonder why

As we swim upon the ocean, swim on the sea
Won't you please come with me, running up into the hills
And the trees we can fall down through the tumbleweeds

I will promise to sing them

All the way through the everglades
I’ve broken through to the other side
Just to find myself building castles in the sky

Floating on a dream to the house of the holy
Hands clinch tight praying death come slowly
'Cause life's too short to give up what you're holding

Then I hear the sound of this musical amphetamine, 
Diggin' at my soul like the tracks full of ketamine 
Never slowing down fast forward's all I've ever seen, pockets never dry 
Man you can call me evergreen, two bottles of wine, three teas, and some Vicodin 
Every single night same thing until I'm one eying, 
Always keep my shit locked tight no oxygen
If you don't believe me, go kick rocks with some moccasins
Couldn't find a hipster to fix gears on my rockin' man
Everywhere I go I got the whole room talkin' man.

Every song we sing creates a memory
I wouldn't change for anything, music is eternity and lives in me eternally
Endlessly, we will come together like a symphony
And everything you do feels like it's meant to be 
It's endlessly, music is eternity and lives in me eternally.

Said you wanna play this game with me but you got way too much lag 
Wish you had my gamer tag, wish I could be cut in half, half to write your songs for you
The other half to spit your raps, put this on my epitaph I don't give a rat's ass
I don't even rhyme I just whine really fast, and I ain't got the time, 
I'm just sand in the glass,
This time you shall not pass 'cause I'm the dragon smog, 
I'm a small axe move big trees you still play with Lincoln logs
Why don't you go take a jog better yet go kick some rocks
Let me guess you got a blog, follow trends like it's your job
I prefer to be myself you wanna be like everybody else
Like a ticket, need some help gonna get scalped Indian pelt.

All of the love you give to me and we'll carry through
So endlessly, we will carry on through your energy

Exactly where I'm supposed to be, my feet walk steady to my own heart beat
And I will carry on through the sounds of my soul,

All that we are is under our control

Deepest roots, redwood tree
Count my rings infinity

Earth's my home for now it seems
But Mars is in my destiny
I'm just floating high on steam
I'll come down eventually
Just to get some Listerine
'Cause verbally I'm disgusting
Future bright, diamond ring
Shoes and hat always clean
So far from reality I live my life like it's a dream
Watch me fly endlessly
Faster than a laser beam
If you do not clap for me
Probably 'cause you amputee

These people are strange
I'm a stranger storm riding
She loves the shade
Below these leaves her body lays
Beneath this tree I placed a grave
Replaced her moon with roots and rain
And now she's mine
Forever more
She sleeps beneath my garden
And when flowers grow from bloody soil
It makes them ultraviolet, my love

Forever

Jeffery shit when I touch these walls
Crawl in a cave when the day-time calls
Hibernate, animals
Next night out when I'm feeling great
Met this chick in an altered state
Heels as big empire state
She's a model, fuck that's great
Gave me a touch
Said what's up
I said fucking, nothing much
Ask me what I'm wearing
I said shhh, designer drugs
Lucy and the diamonds
Turn out, the lights are blinding
I'll spit this last line
And you can call me Scott Weiland
Burn slow

I can see you through the flames of your lighter
I can see you with the lights down low
I can feel it when I'm standing beside you
Got the feeling that you want to burn slow

I can see that you're always on the move
And I can see that your always on go
I can feel that your minds always running
Got the feeling that you wanna burn
Wanna burn slow

Hold it in, ghost toke
When our lips touch we both smoke
If the feeling is right we both know
If the hit's too big we both choke
Man I love this feeling
Got my head above the ceiling
Burn it slow 'cause we just chilling
Got nowhere to go but here
And I just love the way that you vibe
I'm on your level and I
I care not what they say and I'mma do whatever feels right
So I lose it, no control
Light me up and just watch me go
Don't confuse it, I get stupid
I get stoned, yeah I go ruthless

I can feel that your minds always running
Got the feeling that you wanna burn
Wanna burn slow

I take my time cause I know that you wanna burn slow
I take my time cause I know that you wanna burn slow

Sit at home when I'm killing the pages
I do it cause I love it, got incredible wages
I wanna kick it like a horny devil in Vegas
I call up a couple ladies with the medical haze
Very super sick and ready to roll
Got the grinder out and shredded the dough
Now it's time to get kinetic, we headed
For vertical travel you like never before
Me and the woman we pumping in the garage
What I'm thinking, I'm thinking a Ménage
Loving the feeling, I got to end a massage
I gotta sit I'm thinking I'm having dinner with God
Super silver haze, taking me up
Super killer babes, shaking they butts
All the beauty steady making me puff
And the central making me lust
That's what I yearn for
Something so beautiful when we cipher, I'm not thinking about no germ so
My turn you all
What about some love and I'm concerned though
We learn though
Really make you make my worm grow
Adjourned
Then after we burn slow

I can see you through the flames of your lighter
I can see you with the lights down low
I can feel it when I'm standing beside you
Got the feeling that you want to burn slow

I can see that you're always on the move
And I can see that your always on go

And before I even argue
He is looking Out the window
At somebody Coming in
""It is always Nice to see you""

Who had died While he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of

And so I raise my head

Looking inside Does she see me?
No she does not Really see me

Dirty J.,"Damn

You gone ride or die?

Woo
Woo

All my niggas gone bust they guns
Real mother fuckers never trust niggas, but we trust our guns
Get money is the code of the streets
Live by it, and they say the hotter the bullets, the colder the streets
Like the older the hammer, the older the beef
You holding the can and you busting or you die with your heat
Me and my niggas gone survive in the street
For one reason, we ain't living to kill niggas, just dieing to sleep
I'm in the hood and I ain't wear a vest
Push a stock GTO, with a pump in the seat and a desert eagle in the head rest
Live and I took 5, get respect cause I wont die
So its a bet that I'm gone ride

[Chorus: x2]
I'm riding dog, you riding with me? (ride with me)
If I'm frying dog, you frying with me? (fry with me)
If I'm dieing dog, you dieing with me? (die with me)
Just know when the beef come, we all busting our guns (what?)

We can beef, I don't give a fuck, any street, stoop or block
Compton, New York City of Rocks
You ain't never been out the hood? don't go to far
12 gauge shotty, with a pump like Joe Dumar's
Shells the size of Sprewell lugs, go through cars
Rip apart your new Bentley nigga, like Dre sent me
The haze in me make me wanna kick back
Your man work out at bally's, put the 38 to a 6 pack
And beef keep the E.R full til the shit packed
No more rooms? let em die in the streets
Im from the CPT, where niggas dieing to eat
Them niggas with scars under they left eye and they cheek
Park a 745 on your street
Like mother fucker if you don't ride with me, you can die with the enemy
Or die like the Kennedy's nigga
I empty desert clips out like a bottle of Hennessy nigga

[Chorus: x2]

I got niggas that'll beef for the game
Run up on your man, splat his brain then bring you his chain
So if you owe my hood, you better pay up
I roll with killas, that'll put you in a hole like a lay up
Ain't no sleep on the block, my niggas stay up
Cause they ain't trying to miss sales
They trying to tip over fish scales
Be in the XXL, and its only 6 street rappers if you wanna be real
That go for the whole industry you bitch ass niggas
Say my name in a verse if you ready to die
I call up my Harlem niggas on the i95
10 minutes later you dead on the I95
Aftermath mother fucker, we ain't playing this shit
50, work ride, Joe, Cube, the Game and Em
Its our house and we in the front yard
So fuck with the Dr. and get picked apart like junk yards

I settle down to prime time limbo

And though the roaches are thick on the ground
Somebody goes to close my window
Keep the noise of the city down
Get a dose of integrity

Every week, in every home
She got wholesome news for the family
I believe, I believe, in what she says
Yes I do
I believe, I believe, at the end of the day

Ita's tongue never touches her lips
She could always be my godmother
And though the desk-top hides her hips
My imagination's strong
She's the sweetest thing I've ever seen
I'd like to take her out to dinner
But when I think about the places I've been
I'd probably hold my fork all wrong

Every day and every night

When I stood by you proudly
I would have gave my last breath
Now you can't breath without me

But what am I to do when her parents do not try

Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Addiction to pain is what it got me,

Is basically the reason I became somethin' different
Its just that I remember me before

Dirty Money,"[Chorus]
Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus
Should've been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, gave my trust, gave everything
You think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different
Make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep
Making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head vivid as a picture
I Wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

Uh
Give my all you take it from me (from me girl)
And don't even replace it for me (noo)
I wish you just fake it for me (fake it)
I wish I can make you love me more
You can't tell I fucks with you I needed you (need you)
I thought that you understood that based on how I treated you (treated you)
I don't pay attention to the rumors that you feed into
Know you're missing something I wish I was what completed you

[Chorus]

I feel like a killer hit me (hit me)
The weapon was concealed initially (ohh)
But I felt so much pain from it (pain)
You deserved to feel it with me more (more)
I feel like I beg with you I plead with you (plead with you)
I don't comprehend how you can't love when it's so easy to (easy to oh)
I thought you could do it I believed in the naive in you (ohh)
I just need to breathe baby now I got the freedom to (ohh no)

She's like a drug
And I don't think I can get rid of her
Cause she got me in this curse
And it dawned on me I can't do nothing with her
This woman's worth
I Can't find my way out
And it hurts
I tried but she won't let me go
Oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh she won't let me go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
She won't let me go
She won't let me go",Yesterday,2010

Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but its harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom (why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night the inevitable prolongs
Another day another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Taneisha I'll be back in the morn'

""A House is Not A Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone (no)
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your own
Pick up your phone, come on

""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
'Til we back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks
Is what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you big)
And here I stand, a better man! (a better man)
Thank you Lord (Thank you Lord)

Tempest swells our worlds collide

We all sought shelter from the breaking news

And oh though you know I don't know you

Over corpses down below 
And all the while we could have smiled

Is the thing that makes you blind

With flowers borrowed from a dead friends grave

I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in your eyes

The first time ever I saw your face, laid my eyes on you
Was the Bowery Ballroom stage, you were shredding Marshall tubes
And I knew that I had to get to know
You, why don't you pack your clothes?
Move to Brooklyn on your own
And join the band, come on the road

We talked for like two minutes
But I had a feeling
Something awkward but new between us
Something strong and appealing

And we both had girl- and boyfriends blowing us up SMS
But we both knew a mood like this so strong would be wrong to suppress
Felt like it bore the impress of destiny
In a minivan in New England, our eyes met
We said yes and we said yes

Love will burn out
Love will just fade away

First time I ever kissed your mouth, we both felt time stop
My heart, it leapt up, wow, jumped from a mountaintop
Then I knew: maybe I could be with you
Do the things that lovers do
Slightly domesticate the truth
And write you ""Stillness Is the Move""

The ceilings that we ignored
The slept-on floors never ending
Our feeling obscured but pure
And our love ascending

This is how we saw the world, side by side from the road and the stage
So our lives were twined and curled and mixed up like the code we obeyed
And that was basically my dream and I dreamed it with you 'til we betrayed it

And love will burn out
And love will just fade away
And love's gonna rot
And love will just dissipate

Now we're going our separate ways
But we're still connected
You'll go forward and I'll stay the same
And that's how it breaks
Wash it away, wash it away
All of the pain, all of the pain and anger
It slips away, love slips away
But it will remain, it will remain unanswered

Now I'm listening to Kanye on the Taconic Parkway, riding fast
And you're out in Echo Park, blasting 2Pac, drinking a fifth for my ass
I'm just up in Hudson bored and destructive knowing that nothing lasts

'Cause love will burn out
And love will just fade away
Yeah love's gonna rot
And love will just dissipate
'Cause love will burn out
And love will just fade away
And love's gonna rot
And love will just dissipate",Up in Hudson,2017
Dirty Projectors,"Morning
About the break of day
Here we lay, arm in arm
And cradled by the dawn
How did you sleep?
What did you dream of?
Can you still remember our world in the key of love?
The amount of light that we both know
All the shadow descending from above

We had our own little bubble
For a while
We had our own little bubble

I want to be dead

I've lived a life that's full

Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few

I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels

Say girl, I'm just here to let you know whatever you need
I got you, youknowI'msaying
And that ain't because I'm a trick
That's just because through all the hard times you stayed down for a player
YouknowI'msaying, so I got to respect you for the queen you are
YouknowI'msaying, and I'ma treat you like a shining star
That's for real, coming from Lil' O

[Lil' O]
I'm thinking about the hard times I had boo
Like when I had to borrow change I had to ask you
See when a player had nothing I still had you
And you stayed down and it wasn't cause you had to
That's why I'm glad to, buy you things like diamond rings
Take you to the market to design your jeans
Expose your whole world to the finer things
Or put you in a drop benz sticky lime green
And that's all because you ain't do no popping
Girls hate you like bad food I got this bar rocking
But fuck them broads tell them we goin shopping
And when they see you 'sachi'd down, don't start jocking
See when I was down, where was my pals
They didn't come around it was me and my gal
That's why I don't hang it cats, niggas play it foul
But for you, I'll do anything just ask, that's my style

So if you ever need some change (I'll do it)
Since you was there throuh the pain (I'll do it)
Since you stood through the rain (I'll do it)
And baby money ain't a thang (I'll do it)
So if you need your rent paid (I'll do it)
Need your wardrobe laid (I'll do it)
You want to chill all day (I'll do it)
All you got to do is say it and (I'll do it)

When the going got tough, you got tough with me
Through the thick and thin you stuck with me
And even though we're not living in luxury
Stay bubbled a player to come up with me
And I remember all my days in jail
Running my business from outside my cell
Look in my kitchen and try to use my scale
You even caught a case trying to make my bail
I don't want another woman cause you're all I need
When I post up my script you break down in greed
And I always appreciate your love
You even let me run the streets with my thugs
Even went to hit the streets with my drugs
Penitentiary chances, anything you need
Baby I can provide, all of these circumstances

(Chorus)
Since you was there throuh the pain (I'll do it)
Since you stood through the rain (I'll do it)
And baby money ain't a thang (I'll do it)
So if you need your rent paid (I'll do it)
Need your wardrobe laid (I'll do it)
You want to chill all day (I'll do it)
All you got to do is say it and (I'll do it)

[Dirty $]
From the start you were my one trusted, much repect
It's amazing how we connect, I'd be a fool to neglect you
I'd do whatever it takes to protect you
If you ever need me call and I'll be there in a sec., boo
When I was flat on my ass you gave me your last
When your people talk trash, you take it in stride
And just reply with a laugh, this hater on enhanced
Still thinking that a player spitting game trying to stab
Trying to slam couldn't create demonstrate between you and me
Now my glass half full no longer half empty
Boys envy, chicks just might tempt me
But I see, his and her plates on bentleys and jewels
In our future, tell me baby boo does this prada suit you
Then pack your shoe, till the virign not last
Anything you want, I'll do it cause of the past

So if you ever need some change (I'll do it)

Anything could happen at any time

I'm Mr. Everyday Chiefer
Full of herb
And this killer ass reefer got a nigga feeling swozy
I'm slowly, creepin' up through the hood
And I see my niggas, and the smoking real good
So show a nigga love, what up kinfolk
And while you at my nigga, won't you past the dope
You know a nigga has to choke
Of killer both for me, I got the smoke flowing down my throat
So playa won't you ride with me
We can get quizzer in the front of my drop top Caddy
With my heat just ready to skeet
So playa please don't drop no fire on my feet
But it's all good, cause it's much love
And I got my mind twisted off kind bud
I'm screaming out Dirty thug
Sipping on the Cognac with the hardest buzz
So tell me what it was
What it be like
Mr. G living up to this gangster life
And it's got me on a flight higher than a kite
And my eyes real low so I have no sight
I'm feeling really right as I keep flow, through the sky
Way past cloud number nine
Chiefing all the time, blazing on an ounce
Cause I just can't make it with a nickel or a dime
Everything looking fine in the Gump city
Girls walk around short skirts on looking pretty
You can tell the thugs from the sedity
All the high-class girls always acting nitty
But showing no pity, in the land
Of blunt passing
Niggas be everlasting
Where Mr. G gone blaze the weed 
Until I'm dead and gone off in my casket

Now take a trip in my 'Lac with me
We can patch in 
You can go half on a sack with me
We can find a freaky slut to beat
And if it come down to it
We can bust our heat in the street
See, it don't really matter
Long as I'm down for you
And you down for me
We can ride together, forever
Rolling through the streets of the G-you-M-P

It ain't nothing like riding the track, rocking the show
Making the crowd get hype, letting them know
Is you ready to wild out, I'm bout to flow
Got you peeping the style out, as I go

Now should I drop the game on them hoes
Now do you really understand 
How the pimp game goes
It's all about money and hoes
Keep us in it, with your mind froze
And slamming Cadillac doors

Now I'm a ride on the track
Giving you something that you can feel
Better buckle up before you go, haters hit the door
Cause we be hitting you with the skills
Don't give up before you flow, I'm a let you know
That my adrenaline assembling
That's enough to have a emcee trembling
Just give me the mic and them Frank Benjamin's
And call the paramedic, I'm about to injure men
Finish him, ain't many left to cope
Hearts stopped beating, listen to this stethoscope
So many emcees getting' left for broke
And try to make a comeback, shoulda kept the joke
Khao be the name, try dissin' me
Your history, your absence a mystery
Dried your game up like an antihistamine
Put that on Big Pimp and Mr. G
This'll be, something that people can ride to
Laid back, track cool like Rallo
Hit after hit we follow
Wanted to nibble and bit off way more than you can swallow
why'all must be drunk off the bottle
Hating on us, don't talk, bring yourself to me
I don't need nobody helping me
I'm about to lyrically burn a brother to the 12th degree
What why'all want to do now, huh
Humiliated, didn't know, Krumbsnatchaz affiliated
With Dirty, came up and really made it
All these cats want to be down with us
I really hate it, but illustrated, the picture
It takes skills to grab the mic
And keep it tight, some want, simplified:
Some had it, some got it
Some wish they did, and some don't

Now let me take you to the land where the riders see
Pardon me shorty
Let me introduce you to my pimp psychology
Let a young nigga hold if you down with a holla at me
Now follow me, to my '98 'Lac outside
Now is she ready to ride
Slip cover your eyes, it's a surprise
I'll be obliged if you slide where them Dirty boys hide
And I was hypnotized when a young playa saw (um,um)
Your pretty brown eyes
And I apologize if I came to hard
Trying to get between your, sugar brown thighs
You know the pimp hide
And it's 12 o'clock tonight
I got late night lust
We need to, bring a pen and pad
And keep count (keep count) 
Of the nuts I bust (I bust)
I'm swerving, looking through my rearview nervous
While your head steady working
And your neck steady jerking
Up on your knees in my seat
And your lips steady slurping
I don't just kill a knob
And I know your mouth finna' throb
And baby if you could
Shine and rob with your tongue
Like old Inga Shywood (Shywood), situation all good
I love the way you got straight to it 
And plus I love the way you do it
I wouldn't take nothing from you
Girl you's a true headhunter
Booger-lips turner
You must have got it from you mother
Now look up in the sky, it's a pimp in the air
So freaky bitches better beware
I got your mind, mega blown
With the game that I spit
And keep them freaky bitches horny as hell",Ride,1999

You just the baby mama and I don't see the drama
So why this hoe thinking she's the holy one Shana

Shadows start to fall
Temptation is calling
Coming for us all

Flames are getting higher
People come and go
Just for a second
I was in a world of my own

It's a habit of mine
Sometimes it makes me wonder
Is it passion or crime
It's like a wave that pulls me under

7 o'clock in the morning
Somewhere I shouldn't be
My heart beats out a warning
Don't bite the hand that feeds

It's a habit of mine
Sometimes it makes me wonder
Is it passion or crime
It's like a wave that pulls me under

Dirty Vegas,"Through these eyes I see
There's a place for me
And life is full of questions
That keep me alive

Through these veins I feel
A certain kind of thrill
And I'm flying in all directions
And that keeps me alive

Would you sell the story
Drown in all the glory
That surrounds you
Surrounds you!

Won't you shelter me
Keep me company
As I'm searching for protection
To keep me alive

With these hands I feel
A certain kind of thrill
And I have in my possesion
What keeps me alive

Secrets I have found
It turns my head around
And that keeps me alive

It's what keeps me alive
It's what keeps me alive
And I'm flying in all directions
It's what keeps me alive",Alive,2002

Winds up locked in the circuity

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down
Automatic, automatic

What is this madness that makes my motor run
My legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command

My hands perspire and shake like a leaf
Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure, they tell me

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down
Automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic

Look what you're doin' to me
I'm utterly at your whim all of my defenses down
Your camera looks through me with it's X-ray visions
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in the circuity

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down
No way to control it, it's totally automatic

Und gewinnt g'rade Distanz zu den Dingen, die ihn zerstören
Hing 'n paar Jahre in der Luft
Wenn er sagte: ""Jetzt is' Schluss."", ging's gerade erst bergab
Resultat daraus war Frust
Ja, er hat alles wirklich wichtige vernachlässigt
Oft schien theoretisch alles gut, aber nie tatsächlich
War der derbste Ochse, ist zusammengefallen
Wirkte im allgemeien wie 'n Schatten seiner Vergangenheit
In mancher Zeit fiel ihm die Decke auf den Kopf

Neue Ideen, wild entschlossen Erfolge zu seh'n
Die Hälfte von allem, was ich weiß, weiß ich von ihm
Ging's um Weiterkommen im Kopf war'n wir beide ein Team
Einer meiner besten Freunde, das wird immer so sein
Weil wir mehr als unsere Meinung und Erinnerung teilen
Vor ein paar Jahren zog er eine Weile weg zum Studieren
Es wurd' klar, dass man langsam die Connection verliert
Er ist Idealist mit 'nem Drang zu mehr
Heißt, egal was du machst, mach's mit ganzem Herz
Zu viele geben Versprechen, du bist einer, der sie hält
Wegen der Entscheidung, die du fällst
Ich weiß seit lang nich', wo du bist, was du machst, wie du gerade lebst

Für das Wesentliche, alles hatte keinerlei Sinn
Es fehlte 'n Ziel, damals war das Leben 'n Spiel

Wenn Vergangenheit ruft, nicht nach unten seh'n
Und die Balance halten, Contenance bewahren
Manchmal musst du Atlas sein und auf deinen Schultern Tonnen tragen
Schweren Herzens baden geh'n (ja)

Manchmal kann man Resulte erst nach ein paar Jahren seh'n
Nur immer gerade steh'n und dich nicht verbiegen für 'ne Welt

God's the only one who knows how we are not dead

Out the window, but don't waste it
'Cause falling on the floor is overrated
Over the rainbow, I'm bleeding
What I wanted isn't always what I needed

But you're whispering so loud with words that never die
I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke, they burn
Burn within my heart, burn within my soul

I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke they burn
Burn within my heart, burn within my soul
And I will carry them with me forever

A night of looking down a musket
Somehow I always end up on this magic carpet
Hit the tango wherever the wind blows
It always takes me further than I wanted to go

After the sideshow, an invitation
Outside the city limits leaving condemnation
Ears are ringing with little whispers
After everything, that's all I can remember

But you're whispering so loud with words that never die
I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke they burn
Burn within my heart, burn within my soul

I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke they burn
Burn within my heart, burn within my soul
And I will carry them with me forever

I hear what you whisper, I'll always remember they never die
I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke they burn
Burn within my heart, burn within my soul

I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke they burn
Burn within my heart, burn within my soul
And I will carry them with me forever

",Whisper So Loud,2008
Disciple,"If everything comes down to love
Then just what am I afraid of
When I call out your name
Something inside awakes in my soul
How quickly I forget I'm yours

I'm not my own
I've been carried by you
All my life

Everything rides on hope now
Everything rides on faith somehow
When the world has broken me down
This love sets me free

When my life is like a storm
Rising waters all I want is the shore
You say I'll be ok
And make it through the rain
You are my shelter from the storm

Everything rides on hope now
Everything rides on faith somehow
When the world has broken me down
This love sets me free

I'm not my own
I've been carried by you
All my life

Everything rides on hope now
Everything rides on faith somehow
When the world has broken me down
Your love sets me free

Everything rides on hope now
Everything rides on faith somehow
When the world has broken me down
Your love sets me free

You have become my heart's desire
I will sing your praises higher
'Cause your love sets me free
Your love sets me free
Your love sets me free",After The World,2010
Disciple,"The air is leaving here
It's getting hard to breathe, I'm choking 

The fracture was innocent
A miniature compromise that exploded

Inside my atmosphere
And now the paradigm is shifting

A good man was living here
Virtuous evidence has all but disappeared

Right was wrong when wrong went right 
I'm fading
Black has turned to gray inside
And I know that I need saving, can You save me?
Take me away to where You are 
Cause I won't leave without it

Involuntary fast
The bread that never lasts, I'm starving 

Sanity shackled here
The key is in my hand, but I'm frozen

Revelation sings
Justice delivery is blinding

My death is imminent
I'd rather die with You than utterly alone

Welcome back my innocence 
How I have so longed to see your face again
Overwhelmed I say goodbye
As the pages turn I say goodbye
Passing by the end of my life

Pages turn, memories burning away
Ashes celebrate 
You're washing me, consuming me 
As I'm falling on Your sword
You're washing me, branding me with grace
Innocence reborn",The Ballad of St. Augustine,2010
