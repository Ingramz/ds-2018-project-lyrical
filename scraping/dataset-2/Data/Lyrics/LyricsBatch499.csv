Jon Blondell,"Nobody cares about me
I ain't even got a friend
Baby's gone and left me
When will my troubles end?

Black night is falling
Oh, how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
But now another day is gone

Got no one to talk with
To tell my troubles to
Don't even know I'm living since I lost you

My mother has her troubles
My father has his, too
My brother's in Korea
And I don't know what to do",Black Night,2000
Jon Blondell,"I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely 
I'm crazy crazy for feeling so blue
I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then some day you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry, why do I let myself worry 
Wondering what in the world did I do
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying 
And I'm crazy for loving you
I'm crazy for thinking",Crazy,2000
Jon Blondell,"You took me up to heaven - when you took me in your arms
I was dazzled by your kisses - blinded by your charms
I was lost in a fool's paradise
Good and lost in a fool's paradise

When you told me that you loved me - I gave my heart to you
And I wondered if there could be any truth in love so new
I was lost - in a fool's paradise
Good and lost - in a fool's paradise

The whole world was my kingdom
And you the gem in my crown
Then I saw you glance at a new romance
And my love came tumbling down

Though you treat me kind of coolish - and may never let me know
That you think I'm being foolish because I love you so
I'll still got lost in a fool's paradise
Lost with you in a fool's paradise",Fool's Paradise,2000
Jon Blondell,"Hello there my it's been a long time
How am I doin'? Well, I guess that I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now but it seems now it was only yesterday
It ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
What if I remember that's the same thing that you told me it was lonely yes
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

I gotta go now 
I guess I'll see you somewhere around
You don't know, you'll never know, we don't know, you can't know when 
I'll be back in town
Maybe tomorrow, please remember
What I told you, told you, that entire time you're gonna pay
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time slips away

Oh, what I want you to do is just remember, just remember, what I told you
And time, time, you're gonna pay
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

One day I want you to do
Just remember, remember, what I told you
And time, time
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slipped away

It's the same thing, same thing, that you told me 
It seems like just the other day
It ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

It's a funny thing about the time
It's funny baby, how time slips away",Funny (How Time Slips Away),2000
Jon Blondell,"I'm looking for that Lonely Street
I've got a sad sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street

Perhaps upon that Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street",Lonely Street,2000
Jon Blondell,"Well, I woke up this morning
Looked out my door
I could tell my milk cow 
Could tell by the way she lows
So if you see my milk cow
Won't you drive her on home?
'Cause I ain't had no milk and butter
Since my cow's been gone

Now you better treat me right, baby, day by day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down on your knees and pray
'Cause you're gonna need my help someday
Yeah, and you're gonna be sorry that you treated me this way

Well, I said sail, sail on
I said sail on, pretty gal, sail on
You're gonna keep right on sailing 'til you lose your happy home
Let me hear you, Mickey

I've tried everything, good woman, to get along with you
Now I'm gonna tell what I'm gonna do
Quit my crying
Leave you alone
If you don't think I'm leaving, you can just count the days I'm gone
'Cause you ain't gonna see me
You ain't gonna see my sweet face no more
And you're going to be wondering where in this world I'm gone
You can count on me",Milk Cow Blues,2000
Jon Blondell,"When the evenin' sun goes down
You will find me hangin' 'round
The night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life

Many people just like me
Dreamin' of old used-to-be's
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
Ah, but it's my life

Listen to the blues that they're playin'
Listen what the blues are sayin'

Life is just another scene
In this old world of broken dreams
Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life

Oh, the night life ain't no good life
Oh, but it's my life

Listen to what the blues are saying

Life is just another scene
From the world of broken dreams
And the night life ain't no good life
but its my life

but, it's my life",Night Life,2000
Jon Blondell,"Well it's cloudy in the morning gonna be raining in the afternoon
Cloudy in the morning and it's gonna be raining in the afternoon
If you don't like this rainy weather you better pack your bags and move
But if you're running from it brother the only road that I can see
If you're running from it brother the only road that I can see
Is the road that leads to nowhere and nowhere is a fool like me
Rain keep a falling falling round my window pane
Rain keep a falling falling round my window pane
Ain't never seen so much rainy weather guess I'll never see the sun again

Save those dimes and nickels save 'em for a rainy day
Save your dimes and nickels save 'em for a rainy day
It ain't gonna keep the rain from coming but at least you know you've paid your way
Rain rain rain keep a falling...",Rainy Day Blues,2000
Jon Blondell,"It was in the summer, not in the fall
I spent all my money on alcohol
And now you're gone, and I don't worry
Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

No need of crying or holding out your hand
Cause I can get a woman quick as you can get a man
But you're gone, and I don't worry
Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

If you see me stealing, don't you tell on me
I'm stealing back to old used-to-best
Cause now you're gone, and I don't worry
Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world",Sittin' on Top of the World,2000
Jon Blondell,"Well there's floodin' down in Texas...All of the telephone lines are down
Well there's floodin' down in Texas...All of the telephone lines are down
And I've been tryin' to call my baby...Lord and I can't get a single sound

Well dark clouds are rollin' in...Man I'm standin' out in the rain
Well dark clouds are rollin' in...Man I'm standin' out in the rain

The thrill is gone away 
The thrill is gone baby 
The thrill is gone away 
You know you done me wrong baby 
And you'll be sorry someday 

The thrill is gone 
It's gone away from me 
The thrill is gone baby 
The thrill is gone away from me 
Although I'll still live on 
But so lonely I'll be 

The thrill is gone, is gone away for good 
Oh the thrill is gone, baby it's gone away for good 
Someday I know I'll be over it all baby
Just like I know a man should 

You know I'm free, free now baby

Jon Blondell,"Gettin' tired now gotta get some sleep now 
Guess I've been worried much too long
And don't wake me till it's over 
When the need for you is gone
I was so happy before I loved you 
I'm gonna be like I was before
And don't wake me till it's over 
When I don't want you anymore

My mind is gettin' weak now gotta get some sleep now 
I gotta rest my achin' head

Jon Boden,"How long will I love you
As long as there are stars above you
And longer if I can

How long will I need you
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan

How long will I be with you
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash upon the sand

How long will I want you
As long as you want me to
And longer by far

How long will I hold you
As long as your father told you
As long as you are

How long will I give to you
As long as I live through you
However long you say

How long will I love you
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I may",How Long Will I Love You,2013
Jon Bon Jovi,"I guess this time you're really leaving
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well as my broken heart lies bleeding
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance girl

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hiding place
Well I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And baby you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I wasn't there when you were happy
And I wasn't there when you were down
Didn't mean to miss your birthday baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you

Jon Bon Jovi,"I just seen trouble 
He's calling out your name tonight 
Billy get your guns 

You could walk away 
But I know you were born to fight 
So Billy get your guns 

The bandileros are strung out 
In the promenade 
Billy get your guns 

And the wind whispers softly that the devil's to blame

Billy get your guns 
That's the price on your head for the 
Price of fame 
And it'll never change

Sittin' on the bar

And some organ grinder singing 
About some sucker moving on

Waiting to get paid 
Billy get your guns 
From some Johnny on the spot 
Who said hey keep the change baby 
Billy get your guns

There's trouble blowing like a hurricane 
Billy get your guns 
That's the price on your head for the 
Price of fame 
And it'll never change 

They christened you with whiskey 
And there's fire running through your veins 
Well you're an outlaw just the same 
And every night a bullet wears your name

There's trouble blowing like a hurricane 
Billy get your guns 
That's the price on your head for the 
Price of fame

Beneath the pale moonlight

Thinks it's his lucky night

Jon Bon Jovi,"I wake up in the morning
And I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow
And the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm going
Only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run
A six gun lover
A candle in the wind

When you're brought into this world
They say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me something
I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well they tell me that I'm wanted
Yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable
I'm what Cain was to Abel
Mister catch me if you can

I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
Call me young gun

You ask about my conscience
And I offer you my soul
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man
Well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come
And I've seen it shot down
I've seen it die in vain

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son
Call me young gun

Each night I go to bed
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't looking for forgiveness
But before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I got to ask a favor
And hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest
Let this boy die like a man
Staring down a bullet
Let me make my final stand

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son
Call me young gun
I'm a young gun
Young gun, yeah yeah yeah
Young gun",Blaze of Glory,1990
Jon Bon Jovi,"Hey Patty Garrett that's what I used to call you
They tell me you want me but I hear they've got you
They made you a lawman with a badge made of silver
They paid you some money to sell them my blood

But you say, this ain't about me and this ain't about you
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed
You do what you've gotta cause you can't walk away

Wonder what would of have happened if you were the killer and I was the hero
Would things be the same ?
Or would I have traded your life for my own life ?
Would I have paid your debts in your place ?
I don't know

But this ain't about me and this ain't about you
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed
You do what you've gotta cause you can't walk away

Blood money, that's what I call it
'Cause money for blood ain't no fair exchange
Blood money
Bought and then sold you
But your conscience is all you can take to your grave",Blood Money,1990
Jon Bon Jovi,"A whiskey bottle comforts me
And tells me not to cry
While a full moon says a prayer for me
I try to close my eyes
But the night's there to remind me
Of the guns and the early graves
The ghosts appear as I fall asleep
To sing an outlaw's serenade

[Chorus:]
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'
When you're livin' on the run
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness
For the things that I have done
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
The desert's been a friend to me
It covers me by night
And a snakebite's not my enemy
But it taught me how to fight
All this fame don't bring you freedom
Though it wears a this disguise
When an outlaw is just a man to me
And a man has to die

[Chorus:]

[Solo]
And I hope someone will pray for me
When it's my turn to die... pray for me

Jon Bon Jovi,"Hey mister, can you help me?
I'm a loner on the run
I'm just looking for tomorrow
And I ain't gonna hurt no one

I jumped headfirst into a bottle
I was lookin' for a friend
Came up just short of nothin'
I didn't find the truth, I only found an end

So tell me who's gonna save me
Or my father or my son?
When the only justice a man can see
Is the barrel of a loaded gun, oh yeah

I been broke and I've been hungry
I think they're both my middle name
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough
Still I guess, I can't complain

'Cause what you get in life you take it
You've gotta hold on and make it last
They say good things come to those who wait
But it's life that goes so fast

And when there's just one rule you live by
Each day you kiss the risin' sun
When you live and die by the life we breathe
In the barrel of a loaded gun

Guns talk to me in my sleep at night
And a gun somewhere is burnin'
With my name

Winners are losers
And losers will have to face
All those yesterdays
And all of the dreams they blew away

So Mister can you help me
Or are you my gun?
Have the ghosts of justice
Brought you here to me to taste
The barrel of a loaded gun

There's justice in the barrel of a loaded gun
Justice in the barrel of a loaded gun
Justice in the barrel of a loaded gun
Justice in the barrel of a loaded gun",Justice in the Barrel,1990
Jon Bon Jovi,"A penny for your thoughts now baby
Looks like the weight of the world's on your shoulders now
I know you think you're going crazy
Just when it seems everything's gonna work itself out
They drive you right back down

And you said it ain't fair
That a man walks
When a bird can fly
We have to kick the ground
The stars kiss the sky
They say that spirits live
A man has to die
They promised us truth
Now they're giving us lies

Gonna take a miracle top save us this time (ooh...)
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle 'cause it's all on the line
And I won't let you down
(No I won't let you down, ooh...)
The river of your hope is flooding
And I know the dam is busted
If you need me I'll come running
I won't let you down... no, no

You're looking for salvation
You thought that it'd be shining like an angel's light, yeah
Well, the angels left this nation
And salvation caught the last train out tonight
He lost a hell of a fight

He said: ""I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be
I never can be everything you wanted from me
I've got big plans so big that any blind man could see
I'm standing in the river
Now I'm drowning in the sea""

Gonna take a miracle top save us this time (ooh...)
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle 'cause your heart's on the line
And your heartbeat is slowing down (heartbeat's blowing, ooh...)
Your feet are grounded still you're reaching for the sky
You can let 'em clip your wings 'cause I believe that you can fly

Well my eyes have seen the horror of the coming of the flood
I've driven deep the thorny crown into the soul of someone's son
Still I'll look you in the eye 'cause I've believed in things I've thought
And I'll die without regret for the wars I have fought

Gonna take a miracle top save you this time (ooh...)
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle 'cause your heart's doing time
And your conscience is calling you out (conscience's calling, ooh...)
It ain't all for nothing
Life ain't written in the sand
I know the tide is coming
But it's time we made a stand with a miracle

Gonna take a miracle, I need a miracle
I need a miracle, I need a miracle
Na, miracle (miracle) oh...",Miracle,1990
Jon Bon Jovi,"As we stood there older than men
And younger than the boys (that's right)
We were as still as the wind
That blows on a hot august night

And you were lonesome
As a jukebox
But deadly just the same
I could be as gentle as a newborn
Then spit into the eye of a hurricane

And we knew how to laugh
And we knew how to cry
Yeah, we sure knew how to live
But we don't ever

Never say die
Never say die

I guess you'd say we had a pact
These words we knew so well (that's right)
Still they remained unspoken
And we'd take them to the fiery
Gates of hell

Once i was afraid of love
But when it's your brother
Those things change
'cause love is just another word
For trust
So hear me when i say

Never say die
Never say no
You got to look them in the eye
And don't let go
When it's your own blood you'll bleed
And your own tears you'll cry
When you're brought up to believe
That it's the strong who survive
Never say die

Solo
Yeah, and we could run like lightning
Through the pouring rain
And we'll be standing like a soldier
Who comes marching home again

They ask what it is that i want written
On the gravestone where I'll lie
Tell them it's just my bones
That died there
So save the tears they'll cry

My spirit is still riding somewhere
Somewhere in this night
When it's these three words that come to me
As i kiss this world goodbye

Never say die
Never say no
You got to look them in the eye
And don't let go
When it's your own blood you'll bleed
And your own tears you'll cry
When you're brought up to believe
That it's the strong who survive
Never say die",Never Say Die,1990
Jon Bon Jovi,"They say that no man is an island
And good things come to those who wait
But the things I hear are there
Just to remind me 
Every dog will have his day
The spirits they intoxicate me
I watched them infiltrate my soul
They try to say it's too late for me
Tell my guns I'm coming home

[Chorus:]
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Tell my maker he can wait
I'm riding somewhere south of heaven
Heading back to Santa Fe
It's judgment day in Santa Fe
Once I was promised absolution
There's only one solution for my sins
You gotta face your ghosts and know
With no illusions
That only one of you is going home again
And I blame this world for making 
A good man evil
It's this world that can drive a 
Good man mad
And it's this world that turns a killer 
Into a hero
Well I blame this world for making
A good man bad

[Chorus:]

Now I ain't getting into heaven
If the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Heading back to Santa Fe
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
It's judgment day in Santa Fe

[Solo]
So I save a prayer
For when I need it most
To the Father, Son
And the Holy Ghost
And sign it from a sinner
With no name
When I meet my maker
When I close the book
On the hearts I broke
And the lives I took
Will he walk away
'Cause my soul's
Too late to save

[Chorus:]

Now I ain't getting into heaven
If the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Heading back to Santa Fe
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
It's judgment day in Santa Fe",Santa Fe,1990
Jon Bon Jovi,"You're dancing with your shadow
You been talking in your sleep
Well you can walk on water
But don't want to wet your feet

You really got me 
You really got me now
You know I don't know how you do it
But you really put me through it
You got me
You say you talk to everyone
Who is anyone in town
But they don't recognize you
With your foot out of your mouth

[Chorus:]

Who am I to judge a man
Who says he's his own biggest fan
It's true
You brought a knife out to a gunfight
And you're shouting that I'm dead
My old friends Smith and Wesson
Think you're in over your head

Jon Bon Jovi,"Levon wears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus 'cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town.

Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot they say
Spend his days counting
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper
To a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times
Said God is dead and war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon.

Levon's sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day 
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing,
While Levon, Levon slowly dies.

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon",Levon,1991
Jon Bon Jovi,"I see you looking over your shoulder
Tell me who do you think's out there
You're reaching for your four leaf clover
But baby there ain't no luck down there
I swear that there's no heart in this city
It's here the slogan reads
""Do your time"" everybody's doing
their sentence
It's just there ain't nobody here
Who knows just what's the crime
I watched my father live a lie here
I'd rather die than fade away
I read the rules
And yeah I know them
Still you ain't ever gonna
Make me play the game of
Fear
Fear
Fear
Fear

Running with the rats
Through the city
Makes you feel like you're
A partner in crime
Girl once you won't stop to watch
That little girl did

Hey baby won't you stop and hear me
Just being here we're
breathing heart attacks
We can run and chase
The setting sun we can run
And we won't ever look back

Take my hand I know we'll make it
I'll let nothing slow us down
I know you want to curse
This place but there's only
One thing that's stopping us now

Fear fear fear
Of a new thing
Fear fear fear
Of the brass ring

You ain't one for taking chances
You work and live and breathe that 9 to 5
Still that's what you call living
That's surviving to me

And surviving is living to die in
Fear",Fear,1992
Jon Bon Jovi,"The last time I saw her
Was the night she said goodbye
She said that loves a stranger
And it's sure to pass you by, yes she did
As she packed up her belongings
Baby wouldn't look me in the eye
But I could see a tear roll
Off her face
As we both tried so hard
Not to cry she said

I never wanted the stars
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
Because I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you

I tried so hard to remember
Where when how why love went away
I tried to drown myself in pity
But your memory kept calling your name, yes it did

I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings, baby
All the things that money brings
And the servants to paint the sky blue
And I worked so hard seven days a week
And built a fortress for your heart to keep
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you

I never wanted the stars
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
Because I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you

I want you, I want you, baby I want you

But never thought you were alone
I filled the party up with company
But never made our house a home

All I've got is my guitar these chords and the truth
All I've got is my guitar, but all, baby all I want

I never wanted the stars
Never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away

Jon Bon Jovi,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

When snow will be falling, friends will be calling
You know it's time when, there'll be carolers singing SilentNight
I love when they sing, the feeling it brings
It's warm as a fire is bright
Soon there'll be toys for good girls and boys
And reindeer are heading our way
Yes, and Santa will come down the chimney above
There's one thing I wanted to say

[CHORUS 1]
I wish every day could be like Christmas
And if I could have one wish come true
I wish every day could be, full of peace and harmony
I wish every day could be like Christmas, I do

I saw a child sit with old Mr. Clause,
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earthwas
Now the old man grew cautious, on how he would say
That it's the greatest gift what you could give, every day

All the world seems at ease tonight
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass
Is why can't every day be so bright

A perfect Texas afternoon 
A mother and two children play 
The way they always do 
As they raced home from the mailbox 
A mother and her son 
Against a little girl of 6 years old 
The independent one 

The deputies went door to door 
Through all the neighborhood 
They said I got some news to tell you folks 
I'm afraid it ain't so good 
Somehow something happened 
Someone got away 
Someone got the answers for what happened here today 
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no 

Tell me it was just a dream, August 7 4:15 
God closed His eyes and the world got mean 
August 7 4:15 

Now the people from the papers and the local T.V. news 
Tried to find the reason 
Cop dogs sniffed around for clues 
Someone shouted ""Hit and Run"" 
The coroner cried ""Foul"" 
Her blue dress was what she wore 
The day they laid her body down 
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no, no, no, no 

Tell me it was just a dream, August 7 4:15 
God closed His eyes and the world got mean 
August 7 4:15 

I know tonight that there's an angel 
Up on Heaven's highest hill 
And no one there can hurt you baby 
No one ever will 
Somewhere someone's conscience is like a burning bed 
The flames are all around you 
How you gonna sleep again 

Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no

Jon Bon Jovi,"I've been staring at the page for what seems like days 
I guess I put this one off for a while 
Did I see a tear fall from your eyes? 
Or did you laugh so hard that you cried? 
When I served my secrets on a silver tray to you (hey now) 
Hey now, I guess the night's just bringing me down 

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 

You've been the blood in my veins 
The only one who knows my middle name 
And the smiles, they came easy 'cause of you (hey now) 
You know that I love you, but I hate you 
'Cause I know I can never escape you 
So let the choir sing for tonight I'm an easy mark (hey now) 
Hey now, am I acting just a little too proud? 

There's no love, there's no hate 
I left them there for you to take 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 
Have I said too much 
Maybe I haven't said enough 
But know that every word was a piece of my heart (hey now) 

Hush me darling, maybe I've lost my touch 
Maybe I've lost my guts 
There, is that truth enough? 
Hey now, hey now...

You know these love letters mix with whisky 
Just don't light a match when you kiss me 
Though I'll blow away, you know I'll be back soon (hey now)

There's no love, there's no hate

Jon Bon Jovi,"You know your favorite old pair of shoes
The ones with the hole in the toe you won't lose
Your favorite record that's all scratched and used
But still you love to play when your feeling blue

That faded rose that's all dried out
Those Bukowski poems we couldn't live without
Your high school picture when you had wild hair
That stormy day on the beach that got us here

Oh, you better believe there's just one thing you need
Oh can't you see?

It's just me baby
It's just me baby
If there's just one thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams, it's just me baby

Just like a shadow 10 feet tall
Standin' right behind you should you fall
I'll be the one to hold you up to walk
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl

And if your waves should ever break at sea
I'll be there waitin, I'm that sandy beach
I'm that same old dog, scratchin' those same fleas
I'll be by your side, you can count on me

It's just me baby

If there's just one thing that you should keep
In your book of dreams

Lookin' shiny new, feelin' really strong

I didn't come this far to throw the towel in 
I didn't fight this hard to walk away

It's just because the words got in the way

Seems her chauffeur took a dive
And sold her secrets to the sun

To be a saint, not a queen

Two lustful lovers catch a spark
And chase their shadows in the dark

It disappears in a trail of light

Sucked the head off her lagger 
Threw me a wink 
And she said to me ""buddy, what's your sign?"" 

I was off I was runnin' 
Knocked me clean off my feet 
Her tongue kept on selling 
What any blind man could see 
I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs 

She said ""what you hiding underneath that shirt?"" 
Right behing the buttons there's a heart that hurts

Naked, face it, you can't fake it when you're naked 
Naked, face it

Put the k back in kink 
Threw a coin in her jukebox

When I put my hands in her cookie jar
She was more than a girl, she was a cabaret star
I was a deer in the lights of a speeding car

Jon Bon Jovi,"I went to see the preacher, to teach me how to pray
He looked at me and smiled, then that preacher turned away
Said, ""If you want to tell him something, you ain't gotta fold your hands.
Say it with your heart, your soul, and believe it, and I'll say, Amen.""

Bang a drum for the sinners, bang a drum for your sins
Bang a drum for the losers and those who win
Bang a drum, bang it loudly, or as soft as you need
Bang a drum for yourself son, and a drum for me

Well I called upon my brother, just the other day
He said, ""Jon, I'm gonna die if I don't start to live again.
I work each day and night like clockwork, just tryin' to make ends meet.
Well I could kick this bad world's ass if I could just get on my feet.""

Bang a drum for the innocence, lost in our youth
Bang a drum, bang it loudly, or as soft as you need
Bang a drum for your brother, and a drum for me

I don't know where all the rivers run
I don't know how far, I don't know how come
But I'm gonna die believin, with each step that I take
Ain't worth the ground that I walk if we don't walk it our own way

I don't claim to be a wise man, a poet, or a Saint
Just another man who's searchin' for a better way
But my heart beats loud as thunder, for the things that I believe
Sometimes I want to run for cover, sometimes I want to scream

Bang a drum for the tomorrow, bang a drum for the past
Bang a drum for heroes, who won't come back
Bang a drum for the promise, bang a drum for the lies
Bang a drum for the lovers, and the tears they cry
Bang a drum bang it loudly, or as soft as you need

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And so I face the final curtain
My friend I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way.

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception
I planned each chartered course
Each careful step alone the by way
And more much more than this
I did it my way.

Yes there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I face it all and I stood tall
And did it my way.

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of loosing
And the now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that and my I say
Not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way.

For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has not
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

And did it my way

It would be so easy
To live your life
With one foot out the door
Just hold me baby
Til we ain't strangers anymore

Its hard to find forgiveness
When we just run out of lies
Its hard to say you're sorry
When you cant tell wrong from right

It would be so easy
To spend your whole damn life
Just keeping score
So lets get down to it baby
There ain't no need to lie

Tell me who you think you see
When you look into my eyes
Lets put our two hearts back together
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor
Make love with me baby
Til we ain't strangers anymore

Jon Bon Jovi,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal.

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
But you'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

Here, slip this C-note up your sleeve 
Just stay inside until I leave

I've been running, always running
Never have both feet on the floor
I've been running, always running
Now I'm not running any more

No waves will wash up on this shore
I won the fight but lost the war

I've been running, always running
Never had both feet on the floor
And I've been running, always running
Now I ain't running anymore

There were roses I have loved
Who've given or have given up
I pushed your patience and my luck
It wasn't love I didn't trust
It wasn't you, or me, or us
You've shouldered ifs, and ends, and buts

You never know what they will amount to
And your life is just going on without you
It's the end of the things you know
Here we go

You've gotta know that there's more to this world
Than what you have seen
Because we all have a limited view of what we can be

With our blinders on
Each one of us feels a little stranded
And you can't explain or understand it
Each one of us on a different planet
And admist all the to and fro
Someone can say ""Hello, 
Here we go""

It appears that you might be
A little dead to the world
Or at least a bit to all of those
Who have shown a true affection
You make a mess of those
Who will care without exception
As you pile drive through anything that stands
In your way or blocks your view

Are you dead to the world?

I've gotta wonder if you are
A little dead to the world
With a reflex that is uncontrolled
It's the only explanation
Unless you're just as cold
As they say and just as calculating
Using and debilitating those
Who can see the good in you

Jon Brion,"Her ghost is six or so feet tall
And the lights in the house are dim
His voice still echoes through the hall
She can't get away from him

I clear the couch off and I sit
She hangs up the phone and then
She says she can't believe he quit
But I know he'll be back again

Every hour on the hour
He will reappear and make it clear that he's around
It's not your average social call
He does it all without a sound

Her ghost is propped up in the hall
He speaks no evil there
He doesn't notice me at all
I find it a bit unfair

I'm bathed in shadow from that wall
I know he'll be in the air

Every hour on the hour
She'll watch her apparition stare her down, but pass her by
And I've no ammunition 
I'm the one who's being exorcised

Every hour on the hour
Every moment all my power
And every where I turn 
I tend to learn that she's got 
Memories that never burn

And this is of concern and I prepare to go 
'Cause this I know 
That though he's out of sight 
He's in her mind and in my hair
I'm tiring of this fight
Besides it's getting me nowhere

Her ghost makes all of this occur
He does it breathlessly
So long as he's the life in her
He'll be the death of me",Her Ghost,2001

I'll admit that hasn't happened yet

I believe she's lying

I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine
Given time

As sure as she is sitting here
She's sure that she's awake
And as soon as we're committing
We're admitting our mistake

So of course it's only fitting
That the course we're going to take
Is drawn and whereupon I'm slamming on the brakes

I believe she's lying

I trust her to undermine my faith in her, in time
I have every confidence that she'll dismantle mine

The element of chance
And the subject now in question

I came to meet you, my car died in your yard
Why turn the key?
There's so much here to see
These are my memories

Of precious places, precious things
That were meaningless before
We'd seen them together

Old hinges squeaking in the rain
That hotel by the highway where we stayed
There's something every hour
Who needs the Eiffel Tower
When we've got memories

Of precious places, precious things
That were meaningless before
We'd seen them together

The pen, the car
The paint, the pier
The moon and star
The message clear
Liberty raised her hand to us
As if to say, ''It's OK, live today, live today''

I said, ''Don't leave me, don't break the tie''

That just melts in his hand

Ah but the thrill is all gone

Been a long uphill climb

I'm like I leave your fuckin' champ, now watch me rope a dope
Just watch him choke, cause everythin' I drop is dope
Now watch 'em all go up in smoke

I came here to raise hell, I can't lie
One shot, one kill, it's real, I ain't hidin'
You on't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die
And never get it fucked up, I got shooters for hire
Cause you don't want it, I have you like aye aye
Better back the fuck up, over guns so I try
Now that weak shit will never slide, I despise
You are now not in the presence of nice guys

Look, what the fuck, I was just chillin' in the cut
And no beginners, only winners run amok, you runners up
You funny fuck like twenty bucks, I know your slut will let me fuck
I told my city ""Hold me down"", now look how high they hold me up
I'm Kobe clutch, I hold my nuts till I was old enough to cuss
Was kissin' bitches after lunch, now that's a muthafuckin' rush
Still in highschool, I was fuckin' niggas bitches on the hush
So no questions, it's no panties in a muthafuckin' must
It's the peoples rapper, I ain't no rapper
I'm the rapture on the mornin' after
You lackin' passion, you ain't bad, you just a wack distraction
I can't relax cause I feel the magic smashin', Tony Braxton
Where your sisters at? Let's get it crackin'
Look, I was young, I was broke
Had no hope, so I wrote, that's how I cope
I went hard with no results
New approach, same truth
Just get ready, aim, shoot then get bing, bang, woof
So they better bring troops because

How the fuck you boxing with god bitch when your arms are missing
No religion but my mom's a christian
I had her tripping when she found my porn subscription
I'm on some different shit
And expensive whips with a different bitch
I rip your fucking lungs out with a plumber's wrench
I don't know a nigga living in his right mind that could probably stop me
Nigga shook like a young bitch in a room, fucking Bill Cosby
Mach five, nigga high speed, in his face watch his eyes bleed
Full the plug from the life support and the IV's, nigga try me
Came from the dirt, thank god all the pain it was worth
Thinking my name was cursed, I couldn't get on, I felt so ashamed and hurt
I eat up everything until the fucking reaper gets me

My vision was getting on stage
Dreaming about it, they told me that this was a phase
You getting to big for your britches, remember your age
Huh? What the fuck that mean?
Tell 'em doubt me they be reading 'bout me
All this passion you would have to beat it out me
And they said I would never leave my county
Kill that noise, I couldn't let them breath around me
All I could ever see is drowning
All I could ever see is drowning
All I could ever see is drowning
Now that ain't no problem but nothing but sharks
I rob 'em, I never needed no help

Get some was a proud day for every chick I got head from

Lose it, now fuse it
It's useless like using a toothpick as a pool stick

I hope my career does not die in limbo
I wake up just praying my fuse is lit
Cause I don't get hyped like I used to get
Back when I would hop in the booth and spit
I'm too immune to this
Stuck in my thoughts, am I a lunatic? (fuck)
Fuck this music shit, what is Hopsin? I don't know who it is
I do give bitches spontaneous hunger
And when I do there's a cloud of raining and thunder
That you'd hate to get under
And when that happens ain't no place to get comfort
I'm late for the monster, you may be a goner
I put listeners in the craziest slumber
A note to peasants, my vocal presence
Is so perfect that fans get so obsessive

Jon Dee Graham,"Well, maybe I’ll drive up north for a while
Go and see some family
Livin’ by myself here alone on the hill
Starts to wear on me

Between the ghost in the yard and the angel in the tree
The roses in their beds get more sleep than me

Half the time, I think I’m crazy
And the other half the time, I wish I was
All the waiting I’ve done, for some sense of things to come
But it never does

When I’m driving at night, I see pictures on the windshield
The lights, the road and my picture show
I see the boys when they were babies, see Roy in the Air Force
I see things that never happened, well, they might have, I don’t know

Between the time that I leave and I arrive
The past is in the back seat with the dead of quiet

Jon English,"She Was Real
It was cold and it was dark,
When I stopped my Harley,
And I looked down at my road map,
I thought I had gone too far,
It was one of those Autumn nights,
Pitch black, with a mist in the air,
When you can't see anything close up,
But you know there's someone there …
So I pulled out my flashlight,
And shone it in the night,
I heard a voice calling softly,
And I caught her in the light,
She was all dressed in jeans and leathers,
She looked lost and afraid,
And she whispered, “can you help me,
I must have lost my way?”
She was real, my heart did a somersault,
She was real, she came near,
I said, “Hey, you gave me quite a turn,
Just what the hell are you doing out here?”
She was real, she said, “I don't remember”
She was real, she looked at me,
So I said, “Where do you want to go?”
She said, “I live by the sea”,
She was real, I swear she was real …
Well I ain't no Greek statue,
But she was something to be seen,
She had this long dark hair, eyes like a cat,
She was no more than nineteen,
And you see I didn't think it right to ask,
Just why she was all alone, I just took it to be
Boyfriend trouble, so I said, “I'll take you home”.
She was real, she gave me her address,
Or else I wouldn't be here,
She was re she climbed up on the back of my bike,
And she showed no fear,
She was real, soft she put her arms around me,
She was real, she held on tight,
And she was real as we shouted our conversation,
As we thundered through the night, faster,
She was real, I swear she was real …
It was raining, and the mist was coming in,
She looked at me, she said, “Hey, I want to get home fast”, 
I told her I'd do my best,
And when I asked her out next Saturday,
God help me, she said yes,
And the wind was snatching our voices away,
But I felt good inside,
There was me and Suzy riding out there,
Just busting with pride, feeling good,
And she was real when I took the roundabout,
Just as real as the wind in my hair,
She was real when I turned to look at her,
My God, she wasn't there,
She was real, she told me her name,
I went shouting out the same,
I went stumbling through the undergrowth,
Screaming like a man in pain,
My God she must have fallen off,
But I swear I didn't feel her fall,
I went looking, searching, looking,
And then I gave the cops a call,
The cops came, found nothing,
It was sunrise when they got there,
Nine am when the searching broke,
I guess it must have been the look on my face,
That told them it weren't no joke,
So I gave them Suzy's address,
And they took me round there in the car,
I just wanted to go with them,
I couldn't face my Harley,
And Suzy's mother answered,
She had Suzy's hair and Suzy's eyes,
And when I told her what had happened,
She just broke down and she cried,
And she told me I was cruel and heartless,
To tease an old lady so, and she told me,
Suzy died on that roundabout twelve years ago …
She was real, there's a photo on the fireplace,
Dated 1965, but she was real, 
she was on the back of my bike,
she was soft, she was alive,
I swear she was real, I ain't going crazy,
I touched her and she touched me,
So I guess I'll get on back to that roundabout,
She's waiting there for me, she's waiting,
She's real, I swear she's real, she was real (2x),
I ain't crazy, she was real (2x), I ain't crazy!

Well-a, ooh-ee love goes on
Keep it to yourself like a dog with a bone
Your lover ain't never your friend
So pick yourself up, dust yourself off
And get kicked in the head again

Well, Jimmy Stud was the milkman's friend
He helped on the rounds now and again
He was fit, he was pretty, he sure got about
He pleased a lot of women 'til his wife found out
Then she got the house, the car and the kids
But Jimmy hit the bottle and slid into the skids
Fat alimony cheque to mail
Which he didn't so he went to gaol, that's right

Ooh-ee love goes on
Keep it to yourself like a dog with a bone
Your lover ain't never your friend
So pick yourself up, dust yourself off
And get kicked in the head again

Well, Baxter Funt was a pal of mine
He liked the women and he liked the wine
Gave all his money to a gal named Jean
Who kicked him around and treats him mean
And she dresses slick, she spends it quick
She got a mother who looks like Moby Dick
Baxter dreams of a sunny day
When he'll just fff fade away, do it

Yeah, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Do waddy, do what you want to
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-dah

Listen to those rails a-thrumming
All aboard, get on the ""A"" train
Soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem","Take the ""A"" Train",1975
Jon Faddis,"You use me to get you anything you wanted.
Oh, but I'm a changed man now, baby,
And your other friend can get you what you want now.
If I go through those same things again,
I'll be worse off than I started.

[Chorus:]
Girl, you're such a bad influence
And you've got ways to make me do what you want.
Girl, you're such a bad influence,
I've got to stay away.

I've been hurt in all of the worst kind of ways,
And it's you pretty baby,
I've just got to stay away from.
I won't go through those same things again,
I'm so glad that we parted.

[Chorus]

Somebody please, you've got to help me break away.
You know I don't like this lonely feeling.
It wasn't meant to be this way.
I won't go through those same things again,
I'm so glad we parted.

I've got to stay away from you, baby.

Jon Faddis,"I was ready to take a chance,
I found myself a new romance.
Then you call that same old night,
Always change my mind.

Oh no, not again.
Oh no, not again.

[Chorus:]
Just when I thought it was over, you come back
And I'm hung up on your love again.
Just when I thought I was free, you come back.
Now I'm hung up on your love again.

Just as I was doing good,
You come back, just to prove you could.
Things will always be the same,
With me the victim of the game.

Oh no, not again.
Oh no, not again.


[Chorus: x4]",Hung Up on Your Love,1986
Jon Faddis,"Don't change your mind,
I ain't got the time to sit and wonder.
I'm doing fine.
If you decide to leave, I won't go under.

You know I've come this far without you
It won't be too hard to be alone.
I've got choices all around me,
So I won't be spending too much time at home.

[Chorus:]
Girl, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, baby.
I can't forgive you,
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby.

No, don't say a word.
I already heard that you don't love me.
In your state of mind,
I don't need to hear your side of the story.

Your friends all said we had a future
And I don't think I really want to know.
My friends keep telling me to lose you
And how glad they'll be when you decide to go.

[Chorus]

I broke my back to make you happy.
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to care.
If you think you're better off without me,
Just remember, it's a dirty world out there.

[Chorus]

I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on,
Gonna miss the air you breathe.
I'm just not quite happy, baby,
'bout your crazy plans to leave.",Miss You,1986
Jon Faddis,"[Chorus:]
If I don't take a chance,
If I don't make a move,
If I don't go looking for new romance,
How will I ever find my groove?

If I don't play around,
How am I gonna have my fun?
If I tried to settle down,
Would I be fooling anyone?

I'm out on a limb above a sea of bliss;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.

And I feel so free today.
You know I feel so free today.
That's right, I feel so free, no matter where I go,
But I feel so free today.

If I don't make mistakes,
If I don't play the fool,
If I have to worry 'bout the heart I break,
How am I ever gonna learn the rules?

I'm looking for danger inside the sweetest smile;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.

They chunked at me at me 
Called me names 
They'd have whipped me sure but the sheriff came 
I slipped off through the dry goods store 
I ran down Division Street 
Some of them boys followed me 
Down to the railroad track 
Four of them and I cain't fight 
But I had my old Randall knife 
I cut that boy and I never did look back

Could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky

That you'd return when the storm was done

In the dream of you
With all my heart and all my soul

I will raise you from the ground
And without a sound you'll appear

Numa forma de mulher

from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

She filled up his window with soft milky light
'Til he crawled up the chimney and into the night

Chorus:
But the moon she rises and the moon she falls
And her slow white eye sees nothing at all

Down on the sidewalks a crowd gathered 'round
Flinging up bricks and bottles to knock the boy down
He stood up above them with his hands in the air
Calling up to the moonbeams, ""Come let down your hair!""

He wanted to feel like a bucket of milk
Or sweet summer wind on rolling green hills

Sailing up from the night wind to the arms of the moon

Jon Langford,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo

Jon Langford,"I met a little girl in Knoxville
A town we all know well
And every sunday evening
In her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And I knocked that fair girl down
She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry
""Oh Willy, dear, don't kill me yet
I'm unprepared to die""
She never spoke another word
I only beat her more
Until the ground around me
With her blood did flow
I took her by her golden curls
And I dragged her 'round and 'round
Throwing her into the river
That flows from Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
With your dark and roving eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
You can never be my bride
I started back to Knoxville
Got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried
She woke up in a fright
Saying, ""Dear son, what have you done
To bloody up your clothes?""
I told my anxious mother
That I was bleading in my nose
I called for me a candle
And I called for me a bed
And I called for me a handkerchief
To bind my aching head
I rolled and thrashed the whole night through
All horrors I did see
The devil stood at the foot of my bed
Pointing his finger at me
They carried me down to Knoxville
And put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out
But none could grow my bail
I'm here to waste my life away
Down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl
The girl I loved so well

Who had the heart, and who had the brain
To shoot my little darling on that cold lonesome plain?

They found us a-loafin' all around town

But I know I'll die as an innocent man

I've been in this prison for seven long years
Each night I see ellen through my bitter tears
I got a letter yesterday, I read it today

Pulling kids out the ground

Either through basketball or the mall or various odd
Jobs he does around town for free or at most a dollar
And I'm guessing 99% of you have either laughed in Whitey's
Face or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or voice or sister
Or shortness when he wasn't looking
But the next time you'd see him he'd still go out of his way to 
Smile and wave at you and ask you about your mother's
Operation or something like that because he, unlike us,
Actually cares about someone other than himself

The reason I bring this up to you is because I was the worst
Offender of all

Then a tiny little man rushed to my side
He should've gotten a big thank you

But he never quit on me
'Til I told him he was useless
And his sister was freaky

And spent the game atop our T.V.

And when the lightning struck him
He let out a wicked, loud yell

Is wasted on the color blind
It fades away, lost in the gray

And all of us who sit alone
Pretending that there's no one home
Behind the door, what're we hiding for

And then I open my eyes
And I know you're beating my heart
Beating my heart
Look at the sky
I know you're beating my heart
Beating my heart

That you are the one thing that I've got
Look at the sky
I know you're beating my heart

But doesn't everyone
Its like who am I
And why am I here

Without you standing by my side

You're making everything inside

Jamie says that she wants to stay in but she just don't

I worked all week at the restaurant and I just need to cut loose
So if you feel like me get your brand new shoes meet me at 1st avenue
No excuses let the music rock your body right

No more sorrow
We might not be here tomorrow
So just live for the moment and dance your life away

Jon McLaughlin,"They tore my high school to the ground and
Put a new wing in the east lot
On my old parking spot
It stands reminding me of how
I wish that I could travel back in time
Change my state of mind

So if you're still in your teens listen to me

It's hard to see beyond these walls
Of who (who) and who not to be
Socially
Maybe you're in you're out
But in the end when all your hats are in the air
Nobody's gonna care

So fair the weight
Freshmen hold on
It's only four years long
Then it's gone
And the queen of the nerds and the king of the prom get a job
Look at them now
She's living her dreams while he sleeps with his crown
So be cool, be hot, be weird
It's just four years

Next time you're walking through your school
Take at who's surrounding you
Or hounding you
Cause it's all just castles in the sand
When your tassel's on the left side of your head
You're never going back

So hope
It's only four years long
Then it's gone
And the king of the nerds and the queen of the prom get a job
What did you know?
He's a CEO and she answers his phone
So be cool, be hot, be weird
It's just four years

And as for your grades I know they're important
Everyone wants to be a wiz
Cause all of it goes on permanent transcripts
I just don't know where mine is

So fair the weight
Freshmen hold on cause every homecoming court moves on
It's only four years long
Then it's gone
And the queen of the nerds and the king of the prom get a job
Look at them now
She's living her dreams while he sleeps with his crown

Jon McLaughlin,"I've been around for a little over 20 years. 
And to anyone who needs advice on getting here. 
Don't ask me, the path I took was not exactly by the book, by the book. 
I was too young to know and to dumb to figure out. 
That you can lose yourself in all this traveling around. 
When you reach a point of no return losing touch with lesson learned, lessons learned. 
Let me tell you now where I went wrong. 
Hollywood is just another place I don't belong.

[Chorus]
Let's go to the middle where time stands still. 
Let's get lost in those hills. 
Live a little closer to what is true. 
I'll be me and you be you.

I'm finding out the ways of this world can we overcome with one boy's love for just one girl. 
And the only way to love yourself. 
Is to give your love to someone else, someone else. 
Don't believe in everything you hear. 
Growing up is more than just living through the years.

[Chorus]

I'm disappointed in myself. 
I left you on a shelf that I could never reach. 
I practiced what you'd always preached against. 
But now I'm back in my defense. 
That black and white world we tried to paint is really gray. 
So it took a little while to get this right. 
The guilty and the innocent are always side by side.

[Chorus]",The Middle,2008

So if we're gonna play this game look me in the eye and

[Chorus]
Tell me you're in love I'm the only one
Go on and lie to me with all the things that you say
It's alright
Just give me tonight
Go on and lie to me and I'll believe the things that you say
Show me what you want
Anything I got you can take it, fake it, make it
Whatever you're needing to believe
If we both agree we can't say we didn't see what was coming tonight
So if we're gonna play these parts
Look me in the eye and

I'll be here

In an unfriendly world who cares who you are?

You can't lean on someone

While we are on the Earth
Should not be alone

Jon McLaughlin,"Entering a room on an autumn night
I ran across a beautiful sight
From that point on when I was not looking at her I said, nothing else looked quite right
Now I was not about just to let this go
I wasn't gonna leave and not know the way her voice sounded
Against my ears
So I went over to say hello
And I whispered in her ear real slow I said

[Chorus]
The stars moved when you walked in the room
That's why I'm talking to you
My heart won't beat in the groove unless I'm talking to you I know I'm not the only fool with eyes
And you'll get attention from all the other guys
I'm gonna stand here til you realize why I am talking to you

Now I had to take a minute to take her in
I did not know where to begin
Cause I was just moved by the way she dressed and the way her dress hit her skin
Any girl who's met any guy will know that some guys are just for show
So I looked into her eyes and I said this is as true as the truth goes
I'm gonna make sure I let everybody know that

[Chorus]

Let me take a minute to explain myself
Let me say some words that may help
The reason why I've got to be close to you is just that I don't want nobody else
I'm gonna make sure I keep you all to myself

That we used to think were ours
Until they fell apart
Right now they seem so far

But all that shows is the way we fall apart

It's hard to be me and you when all that everyone does is stare

In the white hot sand
And I still feel your ring on my hand

And baby let's go, take a dirt road

Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Gettin' down to some up all night

Now don't forget your flip-flops
We can stop by the quick stop
Get some jerky and a twelve pack
No tellin' when we'll be back
I got a cooler in the truck bed
I couple towels when we get wet
Cause you know we're gonna jump in
And take a little midnight swim

You keep on fallin' 'cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't no end at least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid
She was only 27 and she had five kids
Could-a been the whiskey, could-a been the pills
Could-a been the dream she was tryin' to kill

But there won't be a mention in the new little world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Named Lillian

Who never got any farther
Across the line than Meridian

Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down without a sound
In the red dirt ground",Mountain of Regret,1999
Jon Randall,"I meant to ask you how to fix that car
I always meant to ask you about the war
And what you saw across a bridge too far
Did it leave a scar

Or how you navigated wings of fire and steel        
Up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal
And still you found the ground beneath your wheels
How did it feel

Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy
Above and below me world without end

I meant to ask you how when everything seemed lost
And your fate was in a game of dice they tossed
There was still that line that you would never cross
At any cost

I meant to ask you how you lived what you believed
With nothing but your heart up your sleeve
And if you ever really were deceived
By the likes of me

Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy
Above and below me world without end

Gone now is the day and gone the sun
There is peace tonight all over Arlington
But the songs of my life will still be sung
By the light of the moon you hung

I meant to ask you how to plow that field
I meant to bring you water from the well
And be the one beside you when you fell
Could you tell

One we made sometime ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me

I don't tell them, how many nights I cry without you

Jon Randall,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago

Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be

Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me

For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now

Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another

Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!

La luz inmensa que me das
Se termina toda tempestad
Para comenzar

Sentir, sentir
Que cada cosa es importante como venga de ti
Ser libre es lo que cuenta
Y que la vida en mi ser mi fe
Sentir, sentir

Que cada cosa es importante como venga de ti
Sentir es lo que cuenta
Que la vida y mi ser
Mi fe, mi fe",Sentir,1994
Jon Secada,"Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearin' my fear apart
And that laugh, wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? 
'Cause I love you
A-just the way you look tonight

And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart

Lovely, don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? 
'Cause I love you
A-just the way you look tonight

Mm, mm, mm, mm,
Just the way you look tonight",The Best Is Yet to Come,1994
Jon Secada,"I gotta stop and think how we met
I wanna stop and feel your mouth, kiss your lips
'cause this feels so good still

There's just too much of you I couldn't live without
There's so much of you that I need
So when you tell me that you're nervous
Please don't worry 'bout a thing, don't be silly

For the rest of my life it's you
(It's you)
You don't have to worry 'bout a thing
No, don't be silly

I will never stop
(Don't be silly )
I will never stop
(No, no, no, don't be silly)
I will never stop
Never stop, never stop, never stop

I wake up every morning
(See you there)
Come home every evening
(See you there)
Morning, day and evening baby, see you there

Willy nilly lovers moonbeams way above
I will never find another that I could fall in love with, no way
Don't you worry, don't be nervous baby, now don't be silly

Girl, you're all that I need, it's true
I could never find another, no
So, don't be silly

I will never stop
(I tell you, don't be silly )
I will never stop, I will never stop
(Meet you every minute )
Never stop, never stop, never stop
(Never, never stop loving you )

I'll never stop loving you
(Don't be nervous, don't you worry 'bout a thing, please)
(Don't be silly)
I will never stop
(No, don't be silly )
I will never stop

I will never stop
(Each an' every minute, baby )
Never stop, never stop, never stop
(Give it to me )
(Give it to me)
Never stop, never stop, never stop
(Don't be silly, don't be silly, please)
",Don't Be Silly,1994
