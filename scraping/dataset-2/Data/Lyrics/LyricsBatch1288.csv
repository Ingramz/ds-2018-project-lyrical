Yelawolf,"With a full of trash straight to the ocean
All black Benz is slowly rolling
Head light's off don't be the chosen
Thinks it's a game then drop the token
Up shits creek without a paddle
That's just life I'm in the saddle
No rest no bitch we don't tattle
Snake's don't always shake the rattle

Yeah, yeah, yeah

All these cops they want the qouta
Too much hypo coca cola
Lucy smoke oh yeah you know her
Shes that bitch who rest in nova
Took that bite to bit the apple
You know me I'm hard to tackle
Break me down homie you wish
You couldn't catch that fish with golden tackle

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Give me give me till it's empty
Too much money isn't plenty
It's not enough it's not any
Come come on just choose the jimmy
They all want to bust a nut in
Drop the bomb push the button
Be the king, be the sultan
Some of this shit is so insulting
Break the broken make the chosen
Choose the loose then roll the tie get down and soak with
Gas the gap and light the match and leave you smoking
Choking on the fuse the latest news, life's a wicked
Life's a mystery and please don't be the witness
To the sickness they'll just end it with it
Something death and warm from the step of country fresh

Yeah
Yeah
Country fresh
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Country fresh",Whistle Dixie,2012
Yelawolf,"This here was all in a dream, everything's getting complicated
As it would have seemed, niggas was stressed out
The whips do a couple of check bounce
I was looking for something to test out
Criminal, I don't usually want the style but now
Circumstances have got me on prowl [?]
Up in the late night, you can check the shit out
And when I see the bait bite, voices were saying to me

Let's go rob the dollar, general
Get the benjamins, and the penny rolls
Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal
Guess I'm a criminal
Let's go rob the dollar, general
Get the benjamins, and the penny rolls
Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal
Guess I'm a criminal

Here's the plan
Learned about this daisy, go for my man
Tonight is the night, strategizing and apprehend
We'll never get the chance to do this again
Know what I'm saying?
You get up in the alley round 3 o'clock
Of tops, cut the surveillance then we in the spot
Scan the cops so can stand out
Know the room but not exactly where's whereabouts
Hope you're ready
Lay back and watch for the signal
Brought the proper tools so I can go through the window
[?] first, I see a way through the ceiling
It could be a west wing of the building
Boom, we in and we're fucking the shit here up
Looking through [?] and covers [?] up

I got it, let's go, hope that this dream is a hope
They got me mafiatized, I think I've gotten too close
I'm living on their [?]

Let's go rob the dollar, general
Get the benjamins, and the penny rolls
Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal
Guess I'm a criminal
Let's go rob the dollar, general
Get the benjamins, and the penny rolls
Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal
Guess I'm a criminal, now

This was a tight fit,
[?] out, in this comfort, for the biggest heist shit
Hear the beat, the last hit, before retiring
In and out, the loot sirens
Go to time the street 43, the plan had go [?] leaves
And we, we was sitting quietly,
Silently, [?] leave it, do it probably
She gone, we [?] all way, over to the stairs
Straight up the control room with the cameras everywhere
Grab a [?] making them all disappear
The room with the safe [?] sitting right there, yeah
This time I'm [?] up the wall
This safe is a beast, but I brought my biggest saw
A couple hours, the [?] deep, got home a [?] and seven G

Yelawolf,"Faces change
But this place'll stay the same
And I'll know
When I'll go

Yeah
And I'm pickin' up another bag
And I pack another knapsack
The airport's like a stop light to me
Sittin' on red, green light go
Can't see my family
My family grew into a global trance
Or fans, some may call 'em
And it's on the stage I stand
To jam Roxy, no wakin' up to stop the dream
I lived the life, signed a picture
'Cause no dam could stop the stream
Or flood gates, I'm in the fuck trades
And a pocket fulla culture condoms
They put you on the podium for first place
But on the block, they judge you on 'em
So
Who got the South in a six pack, and a shotgun just for show?
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth
Put the hood in mossy oak
I'm the
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's write
With a broken pen, there they go again
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' jam
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in
I'm goin' home, I'm home again
Bring it back up in the UK
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack
Catfish Billy, hell, you say
I'm just bein' blunt, homie
Keep the grass

You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly

Yeah, take one look
Better yet, take two
But if I take that break, there's a move you made
This dude you shape will come take you back
Back to the roots I've been
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in
Or a spot to sleep in
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season
'Cause I am not the reason
That the image you're used to seein'
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless
Meaning yes, I'm different
Differently made
And me screamin' the A
Is not the difference in grades
It's the place I stayed
'Cause the schools were underpaid
The teachers taught, but to me they fought
A star that was underway
It was under Wayne, it was in my name
Michael
M.W.A
Atha
And in trouble I stayed
Breakin' out of this bubble they made
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand
Committed to the words I say
A blood line's not a family tree
It's a needle in my skin for all to see
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk
But I drink and take the ink

You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly",Faces,2012
Yelawolf,"There wasn't much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last check
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette
Feeling half dead, whiskey on my mind
Then came the dead
Sheriff in the yard, here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye
Baby in her arms
She took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave
Nonchalant about it
Maybe she'll come back
This time I doubt it
Act like I care, but I really don't
Wanted to change
But somehow I knew I really won't
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand
God's not going to land another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock and be late again
One gun and a Harley in the driveway
One way out, dirt road, pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk, half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention
In fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away
And he started singing

London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

I didn't see it coming
I didn't see the wall
And I went from running, to a slow crawl
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie
I speak no evil, but hear no angels
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door
Knock knock
I'm on the salt road non stop
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot
And the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap
I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven, Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge
But I can't forget the sound

London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down

And we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down",London Bridge,2012
Yelawolf,"Yeah, Slumdon Bridge
Mr. Red, Catfish
Back me up
Let's go

I’m out to bark again, ball cracked on the target, demolish it
Don’t jump, I just see, nah, took a swattin', then
Think while I jump back on the beat, like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech, needs to retrieve blood
Should I creep into these ambient sounds with the speech? Obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's several pauses
You might need a coffin with holes on the top of these tubes to receive oxygen
You buried alive like a freak, six feet
Clawing and snatching and clawin' like a cat
And a dog and a rat
And a hog in a pen
With a frog and all there is to eat
Is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth and jaws and then
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of them
See that you back to bars again, he's all asleep in coffin, man
I’m all, they all that’s been, ever was at the start of it
You mention the squad and then
You mention the god of pens
Not of it, but I'm harder then
Flesh I’m harder than titanium brass plates that are polished in
Sticking emcees off like a fly trap, or a bobby pin
When I rap I’m astonishing
I attack tracks like a train track strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave’s that's what I made, got this bastard popping then
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shih tzus
Pisses on igloos
Throw it up to the whole fucking world, it's sick too
Vomitin' stomach fluid like you just ate shit stew
Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?
Neither does ? or they ?
Swimming in this ocean no, he just moves
What I’m trying to say is, it’s my motherfucking ocean
And I crossed it
Built a bridge, the Slumdon Bridge, holla!",Outro,2012
Yelawolf,"For fuck's sake

Living the life of a student
Yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind
And they say that I’ve been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight, never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines
Sit on the side, with a rhyme pad
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five, eh

It’s kinda like I took a train
To the left side of my brain, oh, mayne
Toddle some mud, under my door
You know I’m stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology, psychologically insane
Part of me wanna get down, down, down
Making you go low, inside

You don’t know, if you don’t know by now
You better tell him ’bout it
What you gonna tell him bout it?
Yeah, yeah

Ten toes to the dirt
Pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink-drink ya pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels I’m a ridah
Steering your Prada
Only closed in my Ada-di-das
I’m a fetus in my boom sake nana
Daddy’s home, on the mic, hey papa

Back with my bang yo, straight loop on my pedal no band though
But every single one of my fans know that
Every damn show, I’m taking their ears on a journey
Like I’m flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin’ so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics cause they think I’ve been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes rocking a Kangol
I’m riding round with Yelawolf in your daddy’s Lambo

Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You’re probably sipping sweet tee’s, you still huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
Fact, what you used to steal from
You been playing fools, like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game, when you know the meal’s done
Yelawolf is kicking back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still son
Whoa, this old rock, it heals been rolled
Still shocking when I see ‘em go
Bananas and they hammer the ?

Living the life of a student
Yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind
And they say that I’ve been winning for time

Sit on the side, with a rhyme pad
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five, eh

I’m not the average half wit
After this hour gets out of this
60 seconds I’m going in any directions
And chasing this jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
It’s probably the better idea you move the direction in
Fact its a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blowing his fucking mics like the winds 
I caught this cardigan
Hooligans, hooligans, hooligans
But really who’s a friend?
Jump in this little fire jump right back in the pool again
Know I be new again
A student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers, I’m tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4, minus war
You don’t want it
Shady records I’m already better, fuck it, doggonnit

Dog don’t gotta lead
Dog’s already home
Jack, dog I’m a beast, I’m a wolf
Bring your dogs back
A melody man in a melancholic mellow yellow can
Sh', tell him how we gonna sell ‘em man

Been working hard all week
(So if you wonder if we earned it, well its not a probably)
So won’t you bring that back to me
(And holla when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween)
I got blisters on my feet
(To walk in night with you is not the shoes to be borrowing)
So won’t you bring that back to me
('Cause all the sole of my pin is what all the sorrow brings)

If you don’t know, if you don’t know, no, no, no

Yelawolf,"Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my in-laws, they outlaws with no laws

We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, ""DOO DOO!"" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, ""Mmm mmm,""
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist",1 Train,2013

Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes and cherish your wins
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, ‘86er, nigga, that’s my born year
Get the fuck from ‘round here, that’s just my country ways

Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel
Entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then wake up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just want a free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside

She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
The worst part of all is he just don't care
She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a (shit)

The priesthood, but at least should
Make an attempt to show some remorse
And to be some sort of a repenter

Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher
Into the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked so I might say something back that might offend you

They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep

Hello stranger
Can I call you a friend? My friend, I'm going down
With empty bottles on the table
Black roses on the ground

Ground bottle six with the permanent bliss
Razor sharp glass lips, give me a kiss
Eyes fixated with the familiar shape
Black label, white letters, they integrate
Cubans in the bar room with harpoons
I bloom in the night fog like mushrooms
See every bullet hole in the window of my past
Now that's what I call a shot glass (two, three, four)

Count the cracks on the sidewalk
Pack the cigarette box in my left palm
Flame on the tip of a smoke
I don't know where the light came from
Legs like a ghost, I still walk
Whole world mushed concrete, feels soft
Blinded by the cameras pop flash
I'm a big fan, shot glass? (Two, three, four)

What about my life in there? What about the would and when's?
If's, maybe's, could-have-been's? You didn't know shit about me, man
You didn't go to school in the clothes that I had to wear back then
Look at you, fucking faggot, what you looking at, punk?
What, bitch? Give me another shot, hey, what you want?
Make it a double, fuck it, a triple, fuck it, give me the bottle
And then it's bottoms-up, what a positive role model

Hey Wolf, Wolf!
Come on man, it's time to go

Wake up in the morning feeling like I'm not awake at all
Take a Tylenol, shake it off
Wanna take another shot of Jack but Jack D shot me with a sawed-off

I'd like to say good day
And I hope you say ""good buy""
When they ask was it worth for you to pay
For my music, for pressin' play
For all the stress that went into my songs
My love and hate
The most honest I could be with you to date
Is to say thank thank you Shady
For lettin' me be me with no holds barred
Thank you for the chance to enhance this old car
This old jar of moonshine is but
Two fine lines on a blank sheet but so far
These two lines point directed to my home on the mothership sonar

The dirty south needs a soap bar
In the mouth of these MCs but
But who am I to judge on what they love?
I guess they enjoy being broke and co-stars
And I'm soakin' so hard
From the sweat that I could take my clothes off
I done fucked and raped the whole yard
Should sit back and shake the gold off
But I'm already gone
I got a vision like Teller, sons
In an envelope like letters
Lettuce, green, money, long
Wolfpacks in a calzone
I'll keep makin' these albums
Yeah you might have heard a dial tone
But I was on the other line when I hung up the phone
I'll send a postcard when I leave
I think about you when I dream
And when I'm up under the high beams
I reflect that shining
So you can feel the heat of light

Baby done grown up, workin' that bid like a grown up
Fuckin' toned up, let the Glock talk, I'ma gon' hush
Just like daddy taught me
Wait I didn't have one
Fuck it, I'm happy for him
'Cause he got a bad one

But I can build Noah's Ark without a power drill
Look at this crowd like it's a battlefield
Tell 'em my travels, my triumphs, my failures, my family loud and clear
Let 'em off, judge, I don't care how they feel

How I made a pot of gold from a bucket of beans
How I made it back to dry land, stuck in the sea
From crippled ships to triple dip Z's 71's
Yeah it's already begun
And I ain't even had a hit but I'm fuckin' ready for one
I got my weight up

From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

There's a dark moon in the clouds
Misty fog in the swamp
Crickets chirpin' outside my window
The water it thumps in the bathroom sink down the hall
The lights flicker sometimes
The wind is howling, the dogs are growling way deep in the pines
A passin' car on the distant road, the only thing running
Nightmares in my sleep, the Sandman is coming
I see the ghost in the red cloak, the shadows are taking shape
The sound of a faint voice, lost and full of hate
Dry leaves crumble under the feet of the reaper
The limbs tap on my window, like the nails of a creature
Tales of goblins and fairies, a sacrifice on the prairie
A murderer that escaped, I'm disillusioned and weary
Lightning strikes on the hill, illuminating the cabin
The old man on the porch, evil and quietly laughing
Surrounded by demons
I'm an angel and they all want me
And to this day

Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

Cigarette buds, and oil stains on the dying grass
The smell of the liquor, rising up from the broken glass
The crowds of black leather, the heat from the engines
Motorcycles and goons, bearded men and loud women
The cracklin' paint, the old shack with the swingin' light
The heroin needles passin', open in plain sight
Ozzy and Black Sabbath, the vinyl is skippin'
From the fight in the kitchen
Blood screamin' and kickin'
Smoke fills up the sky, gasoline on the trash heap
The mattress is burnin', I hear it poppin' and snapping
The rain soaked teddy bear, so heavy I can't lift it
The flask full of moonshine, I watch as they all sip it
The Halloween pumpkin candle, lit with a Pentagram
The Grandfather clock, with a broken minute hand
Surrounded by thieves, killers, thugs and some junkies
And to this day

Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

I throw on my leather jacket, a collection of biker patches
One of them says Savage, the other one Black Sabbath
Heavily tatted, barely any skin left,
Whiskey bent after twelve, I'm always playing with death
Bullet shells in my yard, loaded gun on the shelf
Run the roads like a wolf, through the whole Bible Belt
Rattlesnake skin boots, toes up on the chopper
Fifty Harleys behind me, they all ready to slaughter
Drunk in front of my sons, drunk in front of my daughter
Spit, cuss, and I yell, it's like a one-sided quarter
'Cause I'm only heads up, no matter which way you flip it
No brake lights in my life, I'm either rich or evicted
Committed to my convictions, committed crimes with the quitters
Connected to my religion, the religion of sinners,
Send a prayer to God, exhaling smoke off the meth pipe
Like puddles reflecting the ripples echo to next life
So here I am standing just like the ashes that fell from the fire
A seed that fell off that poisonous and forgotten flower
Became my own nightmare, but now I think it's charming
Especially when

Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

Both of us raising hell
Chasing liquor with liquor
Racing and chasing tail
You got caught with a nickel bag and then went to jail
You sat [?] for a week because your mama didn't have bail
I rode my bike to your house as soon as you got out
Remember laughing at the cops and then I took you straight to the spot
I moved away for some years to Atlanta, Georgia but stayed the same
My troublesome attitude got me locked in an ugly chain
We kept in touch every week and I noticed the change
You wanted to clean up and go to school some day do the family thing
And I was too wild to get it, admittedly so
But I supported your move no matter which way that you rolled
I guess you made a good choice, graduated with honors
Got a good job at the factory making that legal dollar
And as for me I got worse
I found myself in a curse
Dropped out of school for a dream
A dream I didn't rehearse
You hit me up 'cause you knew when you saw me I was bad off
But I was too proud to ask for the help 'cause I knew the cost
But you offered a place to stay
Until I could find my way
You helped me go find a gig
Clean up and get it straight
Never once did you tell me to stop rapping and give it up

Six months a year on the road, I never get to visit that much

Now you may see me in publications or radio placements
A new truck, a new Harley, and think I forgot how I made it
But ain't a day that goes by that I don't recall the struggle
Scared to death to go back to it, I constantly hustle
I thank you for my ambition
For the strength to condition
Anyone who helped me along the way and believed in my vision
It takes a village to raise a child
For me it took small towns
Everything that I learned from it
The ups and the downs

Back in '02, when I could barely afford a plate
And he couldn't afford it either, but he did it anyhow

I must have had a nightmare
But I really cannot remember
My heart was beating out of my chest
And I was cold, I must of let the window crack
Funny september and the winter's coming back
The house is unusually quiet and I'm wondering where Sabrinas at
By this time of the clock she would of been pulling on my blanket
Saying daddy ""I want my cereal"" wondering where her mommy's at
My door is wide open I can hear the breeze hit the curtains
Wind chime hanging on the front porch singing
Sabrina must be asleep
I pull back the sheet
Get up and walk to her room in the hall
Not a peep not a sound not at all
The anxiety of a father is settin' in
As I turn the corner to her room
Her Mickey Mouse blanket is on the floor
She isn't in the bed
I take a deep breath and put my hand on my head
Relax
It's a game of hide and seek
Shes in the closet I know it
I open the door
Gotcha!
She isn't there
The faint sound of the television from downstairs
Playing some cartoons she on the couch of course
How did I oversleep
Baby girl why didn't you come wake up daddy?
And neither responds
Fear turned to frustration
Sabrina answered me
'Brina this isn't funny
I ran into the couch and she's not there
I'm starting to panic and I'm looking up everywhere
Guest rooms, bath rooms, cabinets
On to the tables, the attic
Wait a minute oh god no
I know she wouldn't go outside
We live so far back in the woods
She wouldn't dare
Its to scary for a little girl just to go bye bye
I'm trying to escape my minds eye
But my imagination is running wild
At this point I'm talking to god
""Please lord, please I'm scared help me find my child""
I run to the basement
Sweat beats on my head
Pacing thinking pacing thinking
Turn my face in
The screen door to the backyard's yard
I run to the swingset
Swingset? No
Sandbox? No
Goddammit Sabrina where'd you go?
Theres a trail to a pond that I take her to everyday
Maybe she's down there
I run down the trail its about 100 yards
We usually hang out on the pier
And as I get close in
Everything moves slow motion
Her little white shirt on the surface of the water
She was there, lifeless floating
(Oh my god)
The pain I can't explain I couldn't see anything
I ran to the water
God is this really my daughter?
I picked her up she was really heavy
And hella tight in my arms
I took her out of the barn
I laid her on the grass
I couldn't breath I gas
Gave her CPR she wasn't responding to it
My phone in my pocket
My hands are shaking
My visions blurry
9-1-1'll send a ambulance in a hurry
But it was too late
No telling how long she wasn't breathing
Her skin was the color purple
Her lips were ice cold
She must have fell of the pier with her poor teddy bear
She tried to get out she got wood under her nails
God what did you do to us?

Small town Alabama, from city life we departed
Not a single light in the street, morning was scary and dark
To a little boy catching the bus to school 5:30 sharp
I used to make up songs to keep my mind from wandering
What was in the woods waiting for me, my stomach still rumbling
From the cereal diet
Even though mama was trying to do the best that she could
Alcohol made her violent
Her boyfriend was a prick, probably twenty six
Barley looked my direction and really didn't do shit
My animosity grew along with my anger
And impatience disastrous school
My teachers knew I was trouble waiting
And I did too, admittedly but I like it
Maybe I had to accept I'd always be uninvited to church events
Football and family oriented stuff
But I never thought I had it rough
I embraced it honestly cause I knew how different I was
It made me a rebel and rebels made me feel welcomed and loved

Mamma peeled the paint off the wall screamed

They rushed her to the hospital in that old Chevy truck
Running 90 miles an hour down them back roads
Blowing past the sheriff, in the woods smoke bellowing off the engine
Running hot, must of been a sign
They rushed her to the emergency room
Barely made it to the bed
A few minutes later I was screaming for my first breath
A little devil the doctor said
He's got that look in his eye y'know

The rifle's in the corner, money on the table
Cellophane sacks, baby's in the cradle
Chevy's in the drive, cranked and ready for him
Lights a cigarette, ashes on the floor
And takes another toke, smoke fills the room
Sun sets behind the clouds, heavy gloom
Cops on the run, sirens in the distance
Wild small town, violent and resistant
In the street, they rage and fight
Any given night, it's just another reason for a killin'
Brave the cold and lock the door 'cause it's war
Storm filled with crime, only safe in buildings
Made of brick and mortar, brick of thick morals
Ain't got brick and mortar? Steel will support 'em
Steel with the trigger finger, take your life

Bombs take it light, wrong take it real
Take a quarter pound of dope and make a deal
Take the front, son, run for the hills

Yelawolf,"I'm down on my knees again
A call for my repentance
The war has taken over me
I beg for the forgiveness
The bullets ricochet uh
I hear 'em when I sleep now
The blood is on my hands Lord
From man, woman, and child
I'm a soldier from my country
But a slave unto my gun
The screams to echo louder
God, what have I become?
I pledge my allegiance
I left my family, a new born baby
To slay the enemy, the struggle for power
The lust, the fantasy
I trusted America, she took my sanity

Winds of change rolling in
Take your love back again
I your fool, Amen
Just a bowl for your violin
You played me
You made me, your violin

She looks at her reflection
Eyes black and blue
She told them she would leave him
She said she was through
He took her from a small town
Showed her the big city life
He promised her the world
Then he made her his wife
But he runs around town
He's a cheater and a beater
She's sleeping with the enemy
But no one believes her
A diamond green, a glass of whiskey
The bottle of pain pills open and empty
She left a letter ""to hell I send thee""
He brought home flowers, ashamed and guilty
Too late

Winds of change rolling in
Take your love back again
I your fool, Amen
Just a bowl for your violin
You played me
You made me, your violin

Uh, you was like a rag
I've been washed up and dragged through the mud like a thief
From all the beefs and my love, take it up, take a down
Took a left, took a right, there's no one to be found
To explain to me why
Why it was me that was brought to the edge of the cliff
'Cause this is not fair but why should you care?
The choices I've made of mine but I swear that all can not be the fault of just me
I've tried to maintain my wants and my needs
To work and not see the changes I've strived for
A better life for my family I would die for
Taking away everything from me
And that's why more
Tell me to make a decision in front of five doors
As I'm praying, I'm saying 'Why lord?'
Send me to a war without a sword
I'll fight and I'll fight more
I'll travel along road
'Cause I'm just a violin
My life is another cord
You played me
'Cause I'm just a violin
My life is another cord

And chase that American Pie
Now we got no Hank and Johnny
No Waylon playin', Dwight Yoakam on radio

My only chance 

I'm shy, shy, oh so shy

The girls don't like the way I move 
I think at times I've lost it 
Do I look like I can't move 
Or do I move exhausted

If I just knew she loves me 
I know I wouldn't care 
But she talks to the barman 
And I think that's unfair

[Chorus]

I'm sad, sad, oh so sad

And now that girl moves close to me 
I join into her move 
Pretending I enjoy it 
And now I lost the groove

One guy stands tho', between us 
Shows up with all his power 
I now feel like an idiot 
Who stands in a cold shower

[Chorus]

The barman stares at me 
So? So drink 
Then turns around 
And pours a wink

I move away 
But play it cool 
I think she's right 
I'm just a fool

Yello,"The age of science has failed 
To explain our universe in rational terms. 

Consequently the power of magic 
Has gradually emerged from our conscious minds 
To fathom the unfathomable.

Our most distinguished scientists 
Reluctantly admit that mankind is nothing 
But some billion creatures, 
Sitting on a piece of solar driftwood floating in space.

Magic is the art of influencing the course 
Of events by the intervention 
Of spiritual forces or some other occult device.

According to Arthur C. Clarke 
Any sufficiently advanced technology 
Is indistinguishable from magic.

Early civilization often mistook 
The unexplainable world around them to be magic. 

Rupert Sheldrake in his book 
Seven experiments that could change the world
Has stated that scientists' attitude 
Toward their experiments affect 
The results of their experiments.

There is no such thing as a definite 
Fact in science and therefore the irrationality of magic 
Plays an important part in our rational world. 

Werner Heisenberg, the leading 20th century 
Physicist has stated that mass 
Is a physical interpretation of energy. 

Religious organizations have understood the power of magic
And therefore monopolized the interpretation 
Of the supernatural to control the human mind. 

The universe as a whole is beyond explanation. 

Only at the end of the 20th. century 
The Roman-Catholic Church admitted, 
That the great visionary Galileo Galilei was in fact correct.

The second millennium has come to an end. 
Scientists have to admit that the universe is magic.",Beyond Mirrors,1997

Tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts
Just to pass the time
And the eyes get red in the back of your head

Put it all behind me and
I'll be just fine

Sometimes I wish that it would rain here
And wash the west coast dreaming from my eyes

Yellowcard,"You sat me down beside myself
To show me all the reasons I was wrong for you
Was this for real, it's hard to tell
'Cause it was such a beautiful mess we had got into

I'm gonna overcome this
Paper hearts can't win this time
And all along I should have know this
It wasn't your dream, it was mine
I know you wanted me to give up this life to be
Everything I was back when you had the hands my heart was in
I was never good at goodbye

Can I swallow this bottle whole
So this brain in my head can forget your face

When we were starting out
You believed in me without a doubt
You were the finest thing that happened to a boy like me
It's so much harder now
I want to try and tell you how
There is so much love in me
Even though it's hard to see
And I was never good at goodbye

Can I swallow this bottle whole
So this brain in my head can forget your face
Can I swallow this bottle whole
'Cause I'd rather be dead than make more mistakes

Today I couldn't stay awake
Feels like I'm drowning in this firewater lake
I won't be sleeping much tonight
It's not the same without you lying by my side
Right beside me

Can I swallow this bottle whole
So this brain in my head can forget your face
Can I swallow this bottle whole
'Cause I'd rather be dead than make more mistakes

I know you wanted me
To give up my heart to be everything I am
And you're the only thing that I can see
I'm sorry, but you're not the only one for me

You left me here beside myself
Left me with all the reasons I was wrong for you",Firewater,2003

And the city lights shine for her
And above them, I cry for her

Where would I go
Would she know

She is the one
All that I wanted
She is the one
And I will be haunted
She is the one

You still got your life,

Running around all the time

One day this shit will work out fine.

Still so much that must be done

And one day they'll see just what they've done
One day they'll see the obvious

Yellowcard,"""Dear Bobbie,
Do you remember when you were young and very pretty? I do.
I remember pleated skirts, black and white saddle shoes.
Do you remember dancing that night? I do.
I still think of you when we dance,
Although we can't jitterbug as we did then.""

How long has it been?
Nineteen forty-five
You opened my blue eyes
To see a whole new life
Do you remember when
I told you this that night
That if you're by my side
When everyday begins
I'll fall for you again
I made a promise when
I told you this that night

I'll be fine
'Cause when I die, then I die loving you

Then we finally was married in 1949.
We drove the yellow convertible all night long.

This house that we have made
Holds twenty-thousand days
And memories we've saved
Since life has lead us here

And I'll be fine
'Cause when I die, then I die loving you
It's all right, and I'll be fine
'Cause when I die, then I die loving you
Loving you, loving you

I'm coming home to you
Slipping off my shoes
Resting in my chair
I see you standing there
The silver in your hair

I'm coming home to you
When I lay tonight, when I close my eyes
I know the sun will rise
Here or the next life
As long as you're still mine, then it's all right

I'll be fine
'Cause when I die, then I die loving you
It's all right, I'll be fine
'Cause when I die, then I die loving you

Never scared to jump across

And you do

[Chorus]
I don't want your freedom,
I don't want to play around,
I don't want nobody baby,
Part time love just brings me down.
I don't want your freedom,
Girl, all I want right now is you.

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you
But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once twice forever
'cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

Yellowjackets,"God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
The blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

Fear not said the angel
Let nothing you affright
This day is born a savior
Of the pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's power and might
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear savior lay
They found Him in the manger
Where oxen feed on hay
Him mother Mary kneeled down
And to the Lord did pray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

Remember Christ our savior

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune 
That is choppy you'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Play for me

And we're all gonna feel the rain
And we all take what we're given
Even the pain

Cold, tired and hungry, now she's movin' with the wind
And all I do is worry about the pain she must be in
If only I could see you, tell me why you didn't write?
Now there's no one there to defend you and I can't sleep at night

And we're all gonna ride this river
And we're all gonna feel the rain
And we all take what we're given
Even the pain

And we see the light before us
Through the darkness and the shame
But it all breaks down, it all breaks down
Even the pain

So roll on mighty river
Take us down to the sea
Wash away the muddy waters
Set us free

And we're all gonna ride this river
And we're all gonna feel the rain
And we all take what we're given
Even the pain

And we see the light before us
Through the darkness and the shame
But it all breaks down, it all breaks down

Yellowman,"A-yo Ice, man. I'm working on this term paper for college. 
What's the First Amendment?
   
Freedom of Speech, that's some motherfuckin' bullshit
You say the wrong thing, they'll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says ""Profanity - No Airplay""?
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?
You're bitchin' about rock'n'roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get
   
[You have the right to remain silent]
Fuck that right! I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin'
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers deprivin' the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfuckin' apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek
   
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said ""Fuck""
So I thought for a minute and said ""No,
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show""
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's comin', cos I'm mad and I'm gunnin'
Homeboys, and there's no runnin'
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothin' but a piece of fuckin' shit on the damned map
   
Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away
   
What they're trying to do with radio, with this, uh, McCarron-Walter
Act and a lot of other ways, is start by saying that they're
protecting the public from wicked rock bands, or girlie magazines, or
whatever. But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down,
what they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information
itself.
   
If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it.

Yen Town Band,"In The Sunday Park
Light in the aftenoon
I listen to the sound
of my dream Coming through
All the mountains or
Blueberries and greens
fairy tale lullaby
I was down last night
Too much to handle here
I didn't know how to carry on
Still lucky
All the mess in my head,
is fading now
Among the crowd on the street
I wish you'd come to my place
You would be smiling
so close to me
I wish the day dream never ends

I'm the kind of girl,
who lives only for today
but I think it's o.k
to be myself
Especially
when you're not around
I need someone to hold
I know how to have fun

I wish you were here by my side
we would be talking
something silly
I wish the day dream never ends

When I feel a single beat
of my lonely heart
I can sing,I can cry,
without knowing why
Yes I tried and I tried
to the way to you
somehow life always leads
through a maze
everyday eveiynight
you live in my mind
everyday everynight
still pleasure and pain
melodies of memories
will never stop
you are with me
until the end of time
just a day dream

I promise to have her and keep her and teach her

Whispered in my ear how long would it take me 
To get her whole family here safely 
She said they were deported back in the 80's 
She has some black magic in hades, to save me 
The way she moves her hips its amazing
Oh yeah (something) so nice to meet yea

Kept her cuticles laced

Reminiscing when I met her at the copacobana 
Had me unstable crazy going loco bananas
Long legs brown hair 
Its where she came with a halo
I said she probably looking even better then j-lo
Puerto rican mami had me going berzerk
Went all the way to want animal search in a skirt 
Brotherhood too she works out she's so gorgeous
Brother its true no doubt shes flawless
Her loves a drug she was getting me yo
Kinda bug me when she started telling me no
I got a 50 cause of course I was lacking the money

And you don't even know my name

You really turn me on when you picking daisies right outside the barn
Like the bomb when the night comes

The doctors can?t even tell me what I got
But where does it hurt and when did it start?

It started with Carmen we're from the same hood, Carmen Santina Angelica Woods
Her papa's a baker her mom is a teacher 
We met skipping school met in a double feature 
Eating popcorn at the back of the theater 
And shared our first kiss in my little two seater
We talked about life about love, about war if it ain't about love what are we living for

Searched high and low for her all the through the hood
Talked to her family her mom and her pop 
She ain't no good for your heart, ugh ugh, rip it apart
My hommies tell me be tough but I could not get enough
We made a connection you see, not sexually but deeper than oceans and seas
See you can't be afraid to because she makes me feel like I am free
If she could be right beside me I'm good, she is my medicine she is my cure 
See you can't be afraid to be, 'cause she makes me feel like I am free 
Wish we could take it right back to the hood

Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.
The fact is, their name would be mud,
Like a chump playing stud,
If they lost that old ace down in the hole!",Ace in the Hole,2000

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

Yes,"Harold Land with a wave of his hand said goodbye to all that.
He paid his bills and stopped the milk, then put on his hat.
He tried to say his last farewells as quickly as he could,
Promising that he would return, but doubted that he would,
Doubted that he would, doubted.

Now he's marching soldiers in the rain as on to war they rode.
A long thin line of human mind, damnation as their load.
In the mud in coldness dark, he'd shiver out his fear,
What disappointing sights he'd seen instead of ones so dear,
Instead of ones so dear, so dear.

Going home, He's going home to the land he loved so well.
Going home, He fought for two years, never fell.
Going home, He's going home,
Going home. He's going home.

Clutching red ribbons from a badge, but he didn't look his age.
Only two years had passed between his leaving home and back;
He had lost his love and youth while leading the attack, leading the attack.

Well after war your heart is dead.
Well it's not hard to understand,

Yes,"Sister bluebird flying high above
Shine your wings forward to the sun

Catch my soul, catch the very night
Hide the moment from my eager eyes
Though you've seen them, please don't tell a soul
What you can't see, can't be very whole

Speak to me of summer
Long winters longer than time can remember
Setting up of other roads
To travel on in old accustomed ways
I still remember the talks by the water
The proud sons and daughters 
That in the knowledge of the land 
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways

Catch my knowledge higher than the day
Lose as much as only you can show
Though you've seen them, please don't say a word
What I don't know, I have never shared

Loneliness is a power that we possess to give or take away forever
All I know can be shown by your acceptance of the fact there shown before you
Take what I say in a different way and it's easy to say that this is all confusion
As I see a new day in me, I can also show if you and you may follow

Yes,"Once a peaceful man laid his old head down by a river,
Thought about his childhood life, his father and forgiver,
Couldn't hide away, hide away

He controlled the horses with a hand clap or a whisper,
Drink he couldn't combat but he knew he was no sinner,
Couldn't hide away, hide away

He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure,
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink
Not to hide away, hide away

Better men have realized alone is not a venture,
A decent man would realize alone is not a venture,
Just to hide away, hide away

Then he told another one who drove himself to drink

Between the pictures of time behind the face of need
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid

Yes,"I get up, I get down
Now that it's all over and done
Now that you find, now that you hold

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
There's you, the time, the logic or the reasons we don't understand

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see
As armored movers took approached to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be

Down at the edge, close by a river
Close to the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by the corner
Down at the edge, round by the river

Sudden caution shouldn't take away the startled memory
All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention

Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from the side to side
We hear the total mass retain

Feel partly no more than grains of sand

Destroy oppression

Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many
Won't to follow,
Only tunes of a different age.
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life
Everlasting.

Talk to the sunlight caller
Soft summer mover distance mine

Called out a tune but I never saw the face
Heard but not replaced
I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place
Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
Lost in lights array
I ventured to see, as the sound began to play

What happened to this song we once knew so well?
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
I must have waited all my life for this
Moment moment

The future poised with the splendour just begun
The light we were as one
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun

And for a moment when our world had filled the skies
Magic turned our eyes
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device

What happened to wonders we once knew so well?
Did we forget what happened? surely we can tell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment moment

Starlight, movement, reasons
Release forward
Tallest rainbow
Sun shower seasons
Life flower reasons

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe that I can feel it
There's someone to tell you,
Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
Thoughts would send our fusion
Clearly to be home

Getting over wars we do not mean
Or so it seems so clearly
Sheltered with our passion
Clearly to be home

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe they really mean to

There's someone, to tell you,
And I just can't believe our song will leave you

Skyline teacher
Warland seeker
Send out poison
Cast iron leader

And through the rhythm of moving slowly
Sent through the rhythm work out the story
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.

Young christians see if from the beginning
Old people feel it, that's what they're saying.
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe they really mean to.

There's someone, to tell you
A course towards a universal season.

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
They might stand and leave them
Clearly to be home

Getting over wars we do not mean
We charm the movement suffers
Call out all our memories
Clearly to be home

We've moved fast
We need love
A part we offer is our only freedom

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment

Past present movers moments we'll process the future, but only
Through him we know
Send flowered rainbows
Apiece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights of songs to
Follow and show all we feel for and know of

Breath and hope and chase and love
For you and you and you.",Dance of the Dawn [Studio Run-Through][#][*],1974

So be still he now cries
I have time, oh let clay transform thee so

Was this voice of time just saying
There's got to be a linking of everyone
Got to be a center

Vessels of a different impression, none that we could ever hope to have known

On that perennial light
Impress a bolder empire of energy

With the force as it has been known to be see
You say I'm a fool, a believer

Yes,"The day the Circus of Heaven came to town
Local folks lined the streets in a Midwestern town
Waiting anxiously for the parade to begin all around
On the very last day

A unicorn headed the mystical way
Surrounded by what seemed a thousand golden angels at play
Behind were Centaurs, elves, bright fairies all in colors of jade
On the very final day

For what seemed only just a moment in time
Seven solemn flying silvered regal horses rode by
Seven golden chariots in tow, a wonder to behold
The Seven Lords of the Mountains of Time
There then arose where nothing really stood there before
A giant tent rising one thousand feet high from the floor
Towns people flocked inside with their eyes all amazed
To greet the Seventh Lord of the seventh age
A fanfare rang out in an incredible sound
Bringing out the strangest visions perfect harmony round
Any dreams he asked would they like to have seen
From historical or mythical scenes

Then there above their heads just as vivid as life
Each vision transported multitudes inventing light
Grecian galleons, the sack of Troy, to the Gardens of Babylon
A play of millions roared along
The gigantic dreams of Alexander the Great
Civil wars where brothers fought and killed their friendship with hate
All seen by Zeus performing scenes in the magical way
The day the circus came to town

Outside great animals as tame as the trees
Angels high in starlight dancing streets
Turning their colors with indigo and gold
Dropping violet, red and emerald snow
As the circus finally changed its invisible course
A new world to be found

On the dreamy ground we walked upon
I turned to my son and said
""Was that something beautiful, amazing, wonderful, extraordinary
  beautiful?""

Yes,"You found folks treat you right
As long as you let them know
You've been ready to defend their right
Through doors that they oppose

But if it chokes you let it go
If it doesn't sound true to you
It's no business of yours

You can count friends on your fingers
Count 'em on your toes
If you leave you are a friend of all

Will crumble like a rose

Where valor overcame
The almighty tyrants of the past
Forgotten all but name
As the sons of righteous leaders
Bent on crushing nations
Thus believe the sprirt just

And it's all there
Frienships can never be forgotten
In the end years

Feel 'em in the wind
You can reach the blessings of the
Innocence on which we meet
You can guide love in the atomosphere

Another citizen of choice

It said the future would reveal a way

And the parting of the older ways

The sounds proclaiming the new age

In the tallest tower I think I always will

Tall death that haunted me so

Shall we burn ourselves for the answer

Or lands they were in his mind
Of fusion captured high
Where reason captured his time
In no time at all he took me to the gate
In haste I quickly checked the time

Yes,"Iâ??m moving through some changes
Iâ??ll never be the same
Something you did touched me
Thereâ??s no one else to blame

The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
Weâ??ve given up pretending
As if you didnâ??t care

Change changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

I look into the mirror
I see no happiness
All the warmth I gave you
Has turned to emptiness
The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
Youâ??ve left me here believing
In love that wasnâ??t there

Change changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Word to the wise - well you get whatâ??s coming
One word can bring you round

When I look into your eyes and try to find out how
Thereâ??s no way to save it now
And everything I feel
Changes
Keep looking for
Changes
Changes

For some reason youâ??re questioning why
I always believe it gets better
One difference between you and i
Your heart is inside your head

One word from you
One word from me
A clear design on your liberty
Who could believe when love has gone
How we move on like everyone

Only such fools
Only such jealous hearts

Only through love changes come

Change changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

One road to loneliness

Close To The Edge

I. The Solid Time Of Change
Anderson/Howe

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour.
And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one.
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,
And take away the plain in which we move,
And choose the course you're running.

Down at the edge, round by the corner,
Not right away, not right away.
Close to the edge, down by a river,
Not right away, not right away.

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,
Reaching to call the color of the sky.
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see.
Getting over all the time I had to worry,
Leaving all the changes far from far behind.
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name.

Down at the end, round by the corner.
Close to the edge, just by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.
Now that it's all over and done,
Now that you find, now that you're whole.

II. Total Mass Retain
Anderson/Squire

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand.

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,
As armoured movers took approach to overlook the sea.
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be.

Down at the edge, close by a river.
Close to the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by the corner.
Down at the edge, round by the river.

Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory.
All in all, the journey takes you all the way.
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.

Down at the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.

III. I Get Up, I Get Down
Anderson/Howe

In her white lace
You can clearly see the lady sadly looking.
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain.

I get up, I get down,
I get up, I get down.
Two million people barely satisfy.
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late.
The eyes of honesty can achieve.
How many millions do we deceive each day?

[Thru the duty she would coil their said
Amusement of her story asking only interest
Could be laid upon the children of her domain]

I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

In charge of who is there in charge of me.
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page.
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

IV. Seasons Of Man
Anderson/Howe

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems.
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above.
Ah, ah.

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,
Called to witness cycles only of the past.
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark.

Close to the edge, down by the river.
Down at the end, round by the corner.
Seasons will pass you by,
Now that it's all over and done,
Called to the seed, right to the sun.
Now that you find, now that you're whole.
Seasons will pass you by,
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.


And You And I

I. Cord Of Life
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream.
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,
A movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.
Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Coins and crosses

Turn round tailor, assaulting

Never know their fruitless worth;

all the mornings of the interest shown,

presenting one another to the cord,

Cords are broken,

All left dying, rediscovered

Of the door that turned round,

Locked inside the mother earth.

To close the cover, all the

interest shown,

They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you,

To turn one another, to the sign at the time float your climb.

Watching the world, watching all of the world,

Watching us go by.

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,
And you and I reached out for reasons to call.

II. Eclipse
Anderson/Bruford/Squire

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
As a movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the side of seeds of life with you.

III. The Preacher the Teacher
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time;
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme.
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify;
Political ends, as sad remains, will die.
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you.
Ooh, ooh.

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me.
The preacher trained in all to lose his name;
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same.
In the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
As a moment regained and regarded both the same,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you.

IV. Apocalypse
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning.
And you and I reach over the sun for the river.
And you and I climb, clearer, towards the movement.
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas.


Siberian Khatru
Anderson/Howe/Wakeman

Sing, bird of prey;
Beauty begins at the foot of you. Do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right on over my head.

How does she sing?
Who holds the ring? And ring and you will find me coming.
Cold reigning king,
Hold all the secrets from you
As they produce the movement.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right over the outboard, river,
Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time.
Dude'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah.

Hold down the window;
Hold out the morning that comes into view.
Warm side, the tower;
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru.

Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit.
Cold reigning king,
Shelter the women that sing
As they produce the movement.
River running right on over my head

Outboard, river.

Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time,
Suntower, asking,
Cover, lover,
June cast, moon fast,
As one changes,
Heart gold, leaver,
Soul mark, mover,
Christian, changer,
Called out, saviour,
Moon gate, climber,
Turn round, glider.

Yes,"The Revealing Science of God can 
Be seen as an ever-opening flower in which 
Simple truths emerge examining the complexities 
And magic of the past and how we should not forget 
The song that has been left to us to hear. The
Knowledge of God is a search, constant and clear.

Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources,
Chased amid fusions of wonder, in moments hardly seen forgotten
Colored in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of challenge,
Amused but real in thought, we fled from the sea whole.
Dawn of thought transferred through 
Moments of days under searching earth
Revealing corridors of time provoking memories, 
Disjointed but with purpose,
Craving penetrations offer links with the self instructor's sharp
And tender love as we took to the air, a picture of distance.
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused
Expression, as only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing
Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean.
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many
Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age, as the links span
Our endless caresses for the freedom of life everlasting.

Talk to the sunlight caller
Soft summer mover distance mine

Called out a tune but I never saw the face
Heard but not replaced
I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place

Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
Lost in lights array
I ventured to see, as the sound began to play

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
I must have waited all my life for this
Moment moment

All awakening, all restoring you

Workings of man, crying out from the fires set aflame
By his blindness to see that the warmth of his being
Is promised for his seeing, his reaching so clearly

Workings of man driven far from the path
Re-released in inhibitions, so that all is left for you
All is left for you, all is left for you
All this left for you, now

Hark through dark ties that tunnel us out of sane existence
In challenge as direct as eyes see young stars assemble

Yes,"I. Togetherness

II. Crossfire

Julie's sick and tired of her job 'n all the reasons lately
She took it out on God and laid her soul to hell and let the baby die
Julie's child was born without a need or a reason for being
She took it as a message from a real and distant life

Shirley gets to help her with the child though she's strung out on crack time
Shirley never knew what it was to be held in real love
Together getting high to get to mess up their night
Anything to get up so they're losing their mind
Just to get high, breaking out from this life, gotta get them a drug to get higher

Julie gets to walking out and drags the child, says ""Come on""
How we'll walk in the dark of the morning
Cars screaming round the corner, drugged to heaven, guns are loaded, locked in vengeance

Who shoots the child

Watching in the ghetto is the spine and the cruel of the gang life
Sign language of the get go you get in the gang life
Fear the only law, fear is all we hear about
Feed us in the raw, fear is all we hear about

Listen, get up, quickly get up, get up
It's the answer to punishment given you

Don't give us reasons
Caught in the crossfire dying
God give us reasons
Don't give a reason, God give a reason
Why lay dead a child's life

III. The Giving Things

That talk is just a worry and a worry in a man
That life is just a worrying and getting in a mess
That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him
The pleasure of the giving things within
This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne
And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal

IV. That Is

That talk is just a worry and a worry in a man
That life is just a worrying and getting in a mess
That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him
The pleasure of the giving things within

That word is in it, that talk is in it
This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne
And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal

That beat is of the wanting of the where you're going
That street talk is the basis of the push and shove
They never told you that you have the right
The spirit of the angel, angels sing
Shaava, shava, shava, shava

They be waiting for you, they be asking for you
We depending on you, we depending on your healing of the structure center
Until you reach and touch your own redemption

They never give you a reason, they never give you a reason
They never give you a, give you a, give you a, give you a reason

V. All In All

All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Watching for the signals that some easily
Take it as a point of love, a reference place to where you are
Every step a step to set you free

All for the sake and the calling of light
Ask as you give, as you measure in time

All in all this will to give, this sacrament, this need to live
Take it a step to bring love easily
All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Waiting for the waiting to be free

Talk is the easy send, everyone heard
Ask as you seek the clear, ask and you can

This play is of a myriad of conscience sitting
This day is of a special way of love relating
This sight is in it, this way is in it, the dream is of the positive to make you wonder
How did heaven begin
This time is in it, this thought is in it, this light is in it
When you see, you get it

All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Take it as it comes so easily

We'll be there beside the sign, this wherewithal, this will to be
Bringing all the love that's meant to be
All in all we shall be young, we shall be free, we shall be there
All in all this time is meant to be

VI. How Did Heaven Begin

These days are just a worry to the children of the world
These days are just a worry to the children of the world
How did heaven begin
How did heaven begin

VII. Agree To Agree

Don't imagine any way, so any fool can take away the drugs and the pressure
Asking for the level where a world divides its answers
To the gang lords of evil life, they can't show you how 
Look upon this life as just a picture you are painting
There is a reason for this being
Look upon this place as just a part of all that is
It is a spiritual part of being

Live within the power, you can be the strength it is
Walk among the living, you can be the strength it is
To give, to live, this hope, comes through
It takes the trust to agree this agreement
Live for the breaking free
Live for the breaking freedom
Just let it come through come through","That, That Is",1996

And watch the hills roll out of sight

Inside out, outside in, every way

And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me

And one peculiar point I see,
As one of many ones of me
As truth is gathered, I rearrange,
Inside out, outside in, inside out, outside in,
Perpetual change

And there you are,
Saying we have the moon, so now the stars,
When all you see
Is near disaster gazing down on you and me,

Close To The Edge

I. The Solid Time Of Change
Anderson/Howe

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour.
And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one.
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,
And take away the plain in which we move,
And choose the course you're running.

Down at the edge, round by the corner,
Not right away, not right away.
Close to the edge, down by a river,
Not right away, not right away.

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,
Reaching to call the color of the sky.
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see.
Getting over all the time I had to worry,
Leaving all the changes far from far behind.
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name.

Down at the end, round by the corner.
Close to the edge, just by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.
Now that it's all over and done,
Now that you find, now that you're whole.

II. Total Mass Retain
Anderson/Squire

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand.

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,
As armoured movers took approach to overlook the sea.
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be.

Down at the edge, close by a river.
Close to the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by the corner.
Down at the edge, round by the river.

Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory.
All in all, the journey takes you all the way.
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.

Down at the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.

III. I Get Up, I Get Down
Anderson/Howe

In her white lace
You can clearly see the lady sadly looking.
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain.

I get up, I get down,
I get up, I get down.
Two million people barely satisfy.
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late.
The eyes of honesty can achieve.
How many millions do we deceive each day?

[Thru the duty she would coil their said
Amusement of her story asking only interest
Could be laid upon the children of her domain]

I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

In charge of who is there in charge of me.
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page.
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

IV. Seasons Of Man
Anderson/Howe

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems.
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above.
Ah, ah.

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,
Called to witness cycles only of the past.
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark.

Close to the edge, down by the river.
Down at the end, round by the corner.
Seasons will pass you by,
Now that it's all over and done,
Called to the seed, right to the sun.
Now that you find, now that you're whole.
Seasons will pass you by,
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.


And You And I

I. Cord Of Life
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream.
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,
A movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.
Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Coins and crosses

Turn round tailor, assaulting

Never know their fruitless worth;

all the mornings of the interest shown,

presenting one another to the cord,

Cords are broken,

All left dying, rediscovered

Of the door that turned round,

Locked inside the mother earth.

To close the cover, all the

interest shown,

They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you,

To turn one another, to the sign at the time float your climb.

Watching the world, watching all of the world,

Watching us go by.

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,
And you and I reached out for reasons to call.

II. Eclipse
Anderson/Bruford/Squire

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
As a movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the side of seeds of life with you.

III. The Preacher the Teacher
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time;
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme.
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify;
Political ends, as sad remains, will die.
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you.
Ooh, ooh.

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me.
The preacher trained in all to lose his name;
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same.
In the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
As a moment regained and regarded both the same,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you.

IV. Apocalypse
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning.
And you and I reach over the sun for the river.
And you and I climb, clearer, towards the movement.
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas.


Siberian Khatru
Anderson/Howe/Wakeman

Sing, bird of prey;
Beauty begins at the foot of you. Do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right on over my head.

How does she sing?
Who holds the ring? And ring and you will find me coming.
Cold reigning king,
Hold all the secrets from you
As they produce the movement.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right over the outboard, river,
Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time.
Dude'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah.

Hold down the window;
Hold out the morning that comes into view.
Warm side, the tower;
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru.

Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit.
Cold reigning king,
Shelter the women that sing
As they produce the movement.
River running right on over my head

Outboard, river.

Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time,
Suntower, asking,
Cover, lover,
June cast, moon fast,
As one changes,
Heart gold, leaver,
Soul mark, mover,
Christian, changer,
Called out, saviour,
Moon gate, climber,
Turn round, glider.

Yes,"A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour
And assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,
And take away the plain in which we move,
And choose the course you're running

Down at the edge, round by the corner,
Not right away, not right away
Close to the edge, down by a river,
Not right away, not right away

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,
Reaching out to call the color of the sky
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see
Getting over all the time I had to worry,
Leaving all the changes far from far behind
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name

Down at the end, round by the corner
Close to the edge, just by a river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down
Now that it's all over and done,
Now that you find, now that you're whole

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,
As armored movers took approached to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be

Down at the edge, close by a river
Close to the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by the corner
Down at the edge, round by the river

Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory
All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain

Down at the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by a river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down

In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain           

I get up,
I get down,
I get up,
I get down

Two million people barely satisfy
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late
The eyes of honesty can achieve
How many millions do we deceive each day?
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

In charge of who is there in charge of me
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, it seems
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love
As song and chance develop time, lost social temperance rules above
Ah, ah

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,
Called to witness cycles only of the past
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark

Close to the edge, down by the river
Down at the end, round by the corner
Seasons will pass you by,
Now that it's all over and done,
Called to the seed, right to the sun
Now that you find, now that you're whole

And assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one

And take away the plain in which we move
And choose the course you're running

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be

All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain

Down at the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by a river

III I Get Up, I Get Down

In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

Two million people barely satisfy
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late
The eyes of honesty can achieve
How many millions do we deceive each day?

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

In charge of who is there in charge of me
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page
How old will I be before I come of age for you?

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

IV Seasons Of Man

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, it seems
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above
Ah, ah

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley
Called to witness cycles only of the past
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark

Close to the edge, down by the river
Down at the end, round by the corner
Seasons will pass you by
Now that it's all over and done
Called to the seed, right to the sun
Now that you find, now that you're whole
Seasons will pass you by

In glory we rise to offer,
Create our freedom, a word, we utter a word.

Will silence be promised as violence display

Yes,"By horse, by rail, by land, by sea, our journey starts
Two men incensed by one man's journey from the past
In Iceland, where the mountain stood with pride
They set off with their guide
To reach the mountain side

Roped as one for safety through the long descent
Into the crater of volcanic rock they went
Look up from our telescopic laair,
One star for us to share,
We continue on our prayer.

Crystals of opaque quartz, studded limpid tears,
Forming magic chandeliers, lighting blistered galleries.

Memories of a life on earth go flashing past,
Of home, of Grauben, friends of whom he's seen his last
Contemplating what his life's been worth,
While trapped beneath the earth,
An embryo at birth

Pain and fear destroy the beauty I have seen,
Of caverns, where no other man has been
Silurian epoch hosts me as my grave,
My final blow I wave,
A life too late to save

Crystals of opaque quartz, studded limpid tears,
Forming magic chandeliers, lighting blistered galleries.


Five days out on an infinite sea, they prayed for calm on an ocean free,
But the surface of the water ws indicating some disturbance.

The raft was hurled by an unseen source, two hundred feet, with
  frightening force
And a dark mass rising showed to be a giant porpoise

Rising out of the angry sea, towered the creatures' enemy,
And so the two sea monsters closed for battle

Crocodile teeth, lizard's head, bloodshot eye, stained ocean red
Moving close to their raft's side, the two men prayed as one and cried
""Save me, save me, save me, save me""

The serpents' fight went on for hours, two monsters soaring up like towers
And driving downn to the depths in a single motion

Suddenly, the serpent's head, shot out of the water bathed in red
And the serpentine form lay lifeless on the ocean

Crocodile teeth, lizard's head, bloodshot eye stained ocean read
Battle won, a victor's pride, the three men thanked the Lord and cried
""Praise God, praise God, praise God, praise God.""

Journey on through ages gone, to the centre of the earth
Past rocks of quartz and granite, which gave mother nature birth

Burial ground of ancient man, his life no more is seen,
A journey through his time unknown, I wonder where he's been

Wonder where he's been, wonder where he's been, wonder where he's been

The shore now gone behind the hills, a forest in our sight,
Rocks and distant mountains, bathed in waves of blinding light

Forests from far gone time, no living man has seen,
A private prehistoric world, for you and I a dream

Brownish hue dicates my eye, no colour hides their fear,
Flowers faded, dull and cold, now bleached by atmosphere

Creatures twisting under trees, huge monsters soaked with rage
Hidden deep below our earth, a frightening, bygone age

Their shepherd came, now long extinct, a huge primeval man
The three men filled with disbelief, just turned as one and ran.

Reminded of an inner pact between us
That's seen as we go and ride there in motion
To fields secrets of honor, defending

Stand the marchers soaring talons
Peaceful lives will not deliver freedom
Fighting we know, destroy oppression
The point to reaction as leaders look to you, attacking

Choose and renounce, throwing chains to the floor
Kill or be killing, faster sins correct the flow
Casting giant shadows off fast penetrating force
To alter via the war that seen as friction spans
The spirit's wrath ascending to redeem

Wars that shout in screams of anguish
Power spent passion despoils our soul receiver
Surely we know, in glory we rise to offer
Create our freedom, a word we utter, a word

Words cause our banner, victorious our day
Will silence be promised as violence displays?
The curse increased, we fight the power and live by it by day
Our Gods awake in thunderous roars and guide
The leader's hand in paths of glory to the cause

Listen, should we fight forever
Knowing, as we do know fear destroys?
Listen, should we leave our children?
Listen, our lives stare in silence, help us now

Listen, your friends have been broken
They tell us of your poison, now we know
Kill them, give them as they give us
Slay them, burn their children's laughter on to hell

The fist will run, grasp metal to gun
Spirit sings in crashing tones, we gain the battle drum
Our cries will shrill, the air will moan and crash into the dawn
The pen won't stay the demon's wings
The hour approaches, pounding out the Devil's sermon

Soon oh soon the light
Pass within and soothe this endless night
Oh wait here for you, our reason to be here

Soon oh soon the time
All we move to gain will reach and calm
Our heart is open, our reason to be here
Long ago, set into rhyme

As the power proves you right
Right enough to let you begin

So many displaced among the future dreamers
Realized their doubles
Took a new step
A question of origin

Only in the recent past
Seekers fought to realize
Skyward shone like beacons
A question of origin

Ten thousand millions flee
To the westward light
The dreamers represent
This arc of peace

As the poets entranced
The anchor redeemed
Secrets of science
The history of the future
Was surely made

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Home is our world

Nothing can take us far enough emotion
Far enough together
As the light shines so bright
Bright enough to let us in

Nothing can bridge our souls devotion
Fast enough together
As the power proves you right
Right enough to let you begin

Speak so fast to the prophets of the living
Looking for the signs
Spanning out the centuries
Search for truth

Ancient ones, they watch and listen
Carry our wishes
Took upon themselves to guide us
Through the endless skies

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Our hope is our world, our life

I have seen the passion
That's in the hope that everyone
Will find their way into the secret
Of the home of your heart

Living within the vision
Within the power, beyond belief
We see that hate destroys the soul
Of anyone who tries to teach it

I have seen the dream
That's in your heart
That's in your eyes
To bring you closer to the one

It's what keeps us so alive
It's what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Home is our world, our life

All is pure and clear to resolve
Nothing can change us now

Nothing can ever change us now

Truth is a simple place
Here for us all to see
Reach as it comes to you
As it comes to me
As I will always need you inside my heart

There's the sound that makes you smile
There's a sound in every corner
Of the world that we survive

Your temple is the harmony, you feel the sacred ground
Just wishing for the secret to appear within the sound
Watching for the morning star, the rhythm of the sun
I hear it in my waking dreams, the singing has begun

The passion that we walk upon
The passion that we bring
Is written for the mountains
They love to hear us sing

The last train to nowhere?
Playing out scenes
Of dark desert days?

Call out those bleak shadows from your mind
And never again

Yesterday,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Spanish eyes and soft brown curls
My love, my love

Poke these hoes by my goddamn self, for rrreal (By my goddamn self)
For rrreal (By my goddamn self)

[Verse 1]
Nigga dwell on it, can't he
So tell on me, got my bitch all at the crib
Try to smell on a nigga, want to stay around him
But when I'm sitting on the couch
She keep me saying ""ouch"", 'cause she grabbin on my crouch
And I already know, thinking to myself
What the fuck, somebody told
Had to have been one little nigga that I showed
Some shit that they never should have seen, anyhow
All hell nigguh...hatin' on me now, smokin' on my weed
Steady drinkin' on my beer, hell naw niggah
Get the fuck up out of here, can't hold one
So you can't hold your tongue, nigga lips smackin
Like she chew bubble gum, tell her where I been
What I did, who I'm with
Said see me with two bitches, that's when I said it
I gotta stay the fuck away from head, I'ma

[Verse 2]
Smokin' weed by myself, drinkin' Henn by myself
Buckin' hoes by myself, I fuss with nobody else
Now red light, child started a fight
Just talking all about us, and whilin', its alright
I hate when my brothers, fuckin' up undercovas
Shorty, did I stutter? Go get another rubba
Child is shaking like blubba, child that want me to cut her
Too many niggas in the house, time to get out!
I get freaky in the back, while you play at your work
I'm hitting the fat monkey, and damn your girl chunky
Haven't seen what I've been, I'm drinking all alone
On the phone with my b...l, you, n, t 'course every day
I white out, acamo, philly, or marsailles
Give a fuck about a bitch, what that muthafucka say?
Who gives a shit? Grab a bitch in the club
Show her love with a dub, and them niggas hatin' 'cause I...

[Verse 3]
Smoke by myself, drink byself
Poke by myself, cause I was born by my God damn self
Fuck, run and train, that shit lame
I'd rather be one-on-one with a bitch gettin' brain
Too many heads on a blunt, nigga don't get high
I don't give a fuck, if ya got fire
Every now and then you chip, and you want to get Henn
But you never got a twinny-twin-twin, don't roll trees
Hey man, shit, take it from me
You better off to get drunk on a Pepsi
Up, that's a beep, might be a freak (Hey lemme roll with your phone?)
I ain't taking nobody with me, I'ma ride by myself
Get high by myself, get drunk by myself
Fuck this ho by my goddamn self (myself)
Don't nobody hold your own, like your own
that's why we on our own...

See now when you do what you do, how you do what you do
When you do what you do, nobody can tell on you
If you all by yourself, ah ah ah, say it
I don't need no friends, I don't need no foes
I'ma drink my Henn, and choke all out the door

[Chorus: Kaine - 2X]
If you don't give a fuck
Put yo middle fingaz up

Gimme that Grey Goose (that grey goose)

[Verse 1: Kaine]
This here for my alcoholics
What's that drink grey goose they call it
A big ol glass wit a bird on the bottle
A nigga want to get more drunker so he swallow
Back up, buy two coronas, you'll tell an ugly bitch in tha club you want her
Gonna drink mo liquor than a drunk, get crunk
Til a nigga breath smell like skunk (Hanh!!)

[D-Roc]
Drankin everyday like gasoline in the car, you can find me at the bar
Or the liquor stoe, to get some mo grey goose so I can wet my throat
Walk up in the store, grey goose right there
How much that is, let me get that there
Put yo middle finga up if you don't give a fuck
Tilt yo head back, now finish the cup

[Chorus]

[D-Roc]
285 sip 75, 75, south on 75 to the turnpike (x2)

[Kaine]
Take that trip to the bottom, bottom (x2)
Just take that trip to the bottom, bottom
Take that trip to the bottom, bottom

[Verse 2: Kaine]
Alcohol seepin outta your pores
Smellin like a liquor bearer steady talkin to whores
Say that nigga so drunk, he'll fuck the floor (fuck the floor) fuck the floor
When the day start a liquor in tank
That nigga can't get a bitch, its like he ready to fight
But the goose got him loose so he don't give a fuck
He just whip it to the bar to get another cup

[D-Roc]
I drink grey goose, call me the ugly duckling
You ain't put in on this, you ain't drankin nothin
I drink by my goddamn self
Ima get drunk by my goddamn self
Turn up the bottle, drink it cowboy style
Sweatin like a motherfucker buck ass wild
Put your middle finger up, if you don't give a fuck
Tilt ya head back, now finish the cup

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3: Kaine]
G, gotta grab a bottle of that sheeit

But buddy on tha floor torn up
