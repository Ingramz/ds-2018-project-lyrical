Lucie Bílá,"El cielo es un velo 
De terciopelo de irreal suavidad
Estrellas de hielo 
Que están de duelo con su luz fantasmal

Ah, ah, ah
Yo no sé cuál es la que brilla para mí
Ah, ah, ah
Dime tú cuál es la que tengo que seguir

Estrellas de fuego
Con ellas juego a volar más allá

Ah, ah, ah
Yo no sé cuál es la que brilla para mí
Ah, ah, ah
Dime tú cuál es la que tengo que seguir

Cuentan la verdad en esta inmensidad
Volveré a imaginar que son mías nada más
Y que nadie las puede jamás alcanzar

Ah, ah, ah
Yo no sé cuál es la que brilla para mí
Ah, ah, ah
Díme tú cuál es la que tengo que seguir

Flotan en la oscuridad
En esta inmensidad
Volveré a imaginar",Pruhledna Noc [Estrellas de Fuego],2004
Lucie Idlout,"I will rise for you
I will stand for you
I'll not fall again
I'll not fall again
When I see a hungry baby
When I know a hardened mother
When I hear the night time crying from
What only night can hide.

I will rise for you.

When I see your eyes are dying
When your skins becoming chaffed
When I hear the palpitations of your heart
From living too hard.

When I see you live in question
When I know you're still too young
When you're in your longest hour
With strength in empty things

I will rise for you.

She wants to explode, she wants to unload this angst that wrecks her.
She wants to explode, she wants to unload this angst that wrecks her.
She wants to explode, she wants to unload this angst that wrecks me.

I will rise for you.",I (Will Rise for You),2004
Lucie Jones,"Tell me your secrets, I'll keep them safe
No sign of weakness, it's a sign of faith
We'll stand tall so you don't fall

You're not defeated, you're in repair
Don't have to call me, I'll always be there
We'll stand tall, so you don't fall

If you could see how far you've walked
You would see that all's not lost

I will never give up on you
I don't care what I've got to lose
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dance through this storm
I will never give up on you
You're the one that I'm running to
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dance through this storm

Under the surface, I see you glow
I'm right beside you, you're never alone
Don't let go, when you're so close

If you could see how far you've walked
You would see that all's not lost

I will never give up on you
I don't care what I've got to lose
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dance through this storm
I will never give up on you
You're the one that I'm running to
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dancing through

This madness, we're running through
This magic, it's inside of you
It's madness, it's madness

Now you can see how far you've walked
The mountains climbed, the oceans crossed

I don't care what I've got to lose
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dance through this storm
I will never give up on you
You're the one that I'm running to
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we'll dance through this storm",Never Give Up on You,
Lucie Jones,"Well, that was some performance you gave at the Albert's Dam
Oh Sri Lanka, hilarious 
And by the way you missed nothing after leaving

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
Spend my life in the shade of the morning sun

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much",True Faith,2016

Lucie Silvas,"One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy

But all I do is cry
(Cry, cry, no more laughter)
I should be happy
(Oh, why did he go)

I only know that since he left
My life's so empty
Though I try to forget
It just can't be done

Each time the doorbell rings
I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him

'Cause I still love him so
I spend each day the way I start out
Crying my heart out

Lucie Silvas,"I can feel you slip away from me
You're flying high, when I'm still on my feet
And its never my intention to keep you from your dream
When you say you still need me,
That's not the way it seems

And I know how
Our lives might change with everything we do
But I know now
I can't take this chance away from you
When you love I cry
See the truth I hide
When I'm slowing down
You can keep running for miles
This isn't like me, this isn't like me

Your light's so bright for everyone to see
Keeping you to myself is an impossibility
And with every step you're moving further away from me
But I can't seem to let go
And love you selflessly

And I know how
Our lives might change with everything we do
But I know now
That I can't take this chance away from you
When you love I cry
See the truth I hide
When I'm slowing down
You can keep running for miles
This isn't like me

There's no reason for this pain
I bring it on myself
Coz nobody else shows the light you do
And its not like me to try to hold you back
You keep on running

And I know how
Our lives might change with everything we do
But I know now
I can't take this chance away from you
When you love I cry
See the truth I hide
When I'm slowing down
You can keep running for miles
This isn't like me, this isn't like me

Lucie Silvas,"I feel like I'm dragging you down a one way street 
I don't know which ways up 
All I ask of you is to stay on your feet 
That should be enough 
If we stand around it could pass us by 
We could give up now, and never even try 

[Chorus] 
To breathe in life and breathe out 
Like tomorrow is today 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
It's not so long to wait 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
Wipe the dust from your sweet smile 
An breathe in life 

I just want something real I can hold onto 
I believe its near 
Life's too short to know the truth 
Maybe it's already hear 
We could throw ourselves into the fire 
We could give up now and never even try

We're chasing something we've dreamed of 
(is not always out of reach) 
It's never far away from us

[Chorus: x2]",Breathe In,2005
Lucie Silvas,"My intuition tells me, that this relationship's not working
But we, pretend we're better off not knowing
Only, to realize we can't go on.

Tried to tell you, but you didn't want to listen to me,
Say things we don't want to admit to,
But it's no good, cause it's time to walk away.

I can't explain my reasons anymore,
The talking is over and now I'm out the door...

[Chorus]
And if I don't look back
Then I won't know how much I hurt you... I really hurt you,
And if I don't look back
It doesn't mean I didn't love you... I didn't love you.

Please don't ask me,
'Cause I can't take the way you're looking at me
Everytime we touch it makes me feel so guilty,
And I can't do this anymore.

I can't explain, I've said it all before
And I won't be persuaded, I'm half way out the door...

[Chorus]

It doesn't mean I didn't love you...

I can't explain, my reasons anymore
It's over, your heart's out of my hands...

Lucie Silvas,"Forget me not, I ask of you
Wherever your life takes you to
And if we never meet again
Think of me every now and then

We had just one day to recall
Now all I want is something more
Than just a fading memory
Left wondering what could have been.

Isn't it a shame, that when timing's all wrong
You're doing what you never meant to,
There's always something that prevents you.
Well I believe in fate, it had to happen this way
But it always leaves me wondering whether
In another life we'd be together.
We should feel lucky we can say, we've always got yesterday

And as I leave it all behind
You're still emblazoned in my mind
And for that very special day
Nobody loved me in that way

Forget me not, I ask of you
Wherever your life takes you to
And if we never meet again
Think of me every now and then",Forget Me Not,2005
Lucie Silvas,"Am I talking too fast?
I got a lot to learn
I'll keep my eyes wide open
And I will wait my turn
I would jump right in
But now I'm not so sure
If I put two and two together
Would I still get four?

And I know where I belong
But I'm still breaking through
Sometimes I get it wrong
But I'm keeping it true

If everything is how it should be, then everything will come
When it gets here I'll be ready
If it's just determination, 
Everything will come
And the game's already won

They say you have one chance
But that I don't believe
Although my expectations 
Can get the better of me
I shouldn't be afraid 
Of what I can't control
'Cause whatever's round the corner
I will take it all

And I know where I belong
But I'm still breaking through
Sometimes I get it wrong
But I'm keeping it true

If everything is how it should be, then everything will come
When it gets here I'll be ready
If it's just determination, 
Everything will come
And the game's already won

Believing in myself can't be wrong
I'm waiting for my time in the sun

Lucie Silvas,"When I feel every thing in my life's a mess
And I can't lift my head up above the rest
When all I touch I can't hold on to
Then I cover my eyes and try to picture you

'Cause your belief in me's so strong
I won't give in I will carry on
Cause I know you're the one

When the storm has broken you'll be waiting
When the big wave crashes you'll be swimming
When the war is over you'll be waving the flag
I know you'll be the last man standing with me

Yeah yeah

When I know in my heart I have my good and bad days
And I wish I could hide that side of me away
But you're so blind - I can do no wrong
And I try to explain where the pains come from

And I see you as my shining star
To live up to and be where you are
If I can reach that far

When the storm has broken you'll be waiting
When the big wave crashes you'll be swimming
When the war is over you'll be waving the flag

Never thought I'd find some one to be here with me
I have so much trust in you you're all that I see
Do you know the difference you made to who I am
I couldn't find a better man
You showed me how to understand

When the storm has broken you'll be waiting
When the big wave crashes you'll be swimming

Lucie Silvas,"Like You Love Me""

Woah... mm mmm

Its not every day you wake up
And admit who you really are
Most days its easier to shut yourself up
And never look that far

This is me, I'm covered
What I hid behind the door
And everything she says angers
I'm apologizing for

[Chorus:]
Do you see her when you see me?
Understand her insecurities?
And accept the part she plays in me?
Could you love her....like you love me?

Like you love me
Ohh, like you love me
Woahhh....

Id rather be who you think I am
See myself through your eyes
'cause the mirror you use can't be too harsh
And I want it to tell me lies

So today I'll be brave and I'll face myself
Show you who I really am
'cause wherever I go she follows me
can you reach out for her hand?

Do you see her when you see me?
Understand her insecurities?
Ohh, And accept the part she plays in me?
Could you love her....like you love me?

I'm not perfect but I try to be
Oh, could you really have the hold in me
Sometimes what you get isn't what you see
Could you believe in her, like you believe in me?

Ohhh.....hey hey, yeh yeh...ohh woah..

Mmm...do you love her, woah...

Do you see her when you see me?

Lucie Silvas,"I have been down this road before 
And each time I run when I should walk 
Diving too deep when I can't swim 
Always asking what could have been 

I held my heart out in my hands 
And you pull me down each time I stand 
And I've tried to fly away from you 
I'd rather be alone than love you like I do 

And so they say that time's a healer 
Maybe it's about time that I start 
But I've found time don't make it any easier 
The longer we're apart 

Why is every body always more afraid to live than die 
They seem to have the strength to fail but not the will to try 
I've never been like this and I'm not about to start 
The part of me I miss I'll find now that we're apart 

I'm going down this road once more 
And each time I run when I should walk 
When you reach the end just start again 
Never look back at what could have been 

And now I know that time's a healer 
Maybe it's about time that I start 
But I've found time it don't make it any easier

Lucie Silvas,"Armed with an arrow you're pointing it straight at my heart, 
Watching me break as I try find my way out the dark, 
They say each moment comes to an end, 
So my pain is its consequence, 
It's a battle, and I have no defense. 

Sure as you said that you loved me you turned me away, 
Suddenly everything changed right in front of my face, 
They say sometimes love's just unfair 
But why's it at my expense? 
I've no answers and I've no defense. 

I guess I'll never understand 
How love can come and go, 
Looking through the broken glass, now I know. 
But even though my bitter doubt lets my loneliness show. 
I'll get over, over you in the end. 

I wish that I had the courage to leave you behind,

It wasn't easy to obtain
How do you keep your patience when I do it over and over again?
And God it seems so hard
Cause nothing in life makes sense when you tear it apart

When I try moving on
It doesn't mean my faith is gone
It's nothing more than distance
Maybe that will keep us strong
No I won't let you down
Cause nothing in life makes sense when you're not around

And if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I loose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

And nothing comes for free
And now everything I see
Is how bad I try to take your place and all the love you give to me
Baby if I win I'll loose
Cause nothing I have even matters if I don't have you
If I don't have you

And if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I loose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

And I know
I'm not giving you what you want
I'm not giving you what you need
With the faith of a little bird
Fly away to opportunity
And I roll the dice and I don't know which side up
Always gonna fall
And even though each day I get a little bit closer I might end up with nothing at all

And if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I loose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

Oh if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I loose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

Why throw it all away
It wasn't easy to obtain
How do you keep your patience when I do it over and over again?

Lucie Silvas,"Seasons change and there they go 
It's not over, give me hope 
It don't seem like it was before 
It's time I told you that I need more 

Today the wine is not sweet enough 
And there's no flavor to your vintage love 

[Chorus]
You don't give me the words I want to hear 
If you want me to stay baby make it clear 
You're not showing me love like you did last year 
Like you did last year 

Chase the moon across my sky 
Save the picture of you and I 
Lovers race, was won too soon 
Looks like you've given up and running out 
And I won't wait for you 

The stars ain't shining bright enough 
And Venus doesn't seem to favor us 

[Chorus]

Just come here and we'll talk all about it 
Well it's much too precious to lose so easily 
Just go back to where we used to be 

Give me the words I want to hear 
If you want me to stay baby make it clear 
You're not showing me love like you did last year

Lucie Silvas,"Just like I predicted, we're at the point of no return
We can go backwards, and no corners have been turned
I can't control it, if I sink or if I swim
'Cause I chose the water that I'm in

Ne jamais devoir choisir
Avoir raison ou tort
Au-delà de mes faiblesses
J'ai la force d'y croire encore
Même si l'amour s'enfuit
J'en inventerai les couleurs
S'il est trop tard, pour revenir,
Je remonterai les couleurs

There's no way,
You're changing,
'Cause some things will just never be mine,
You're in not love this time, but it's alright.

J'aurai voulu t'offrir le meilleur de tout mon être
Au lieu de partir, entre nous tout faire renaître
Plutôt que de mentir,
Aborder nos différences
T'aimer autrement qu'à contre sens

And it makes no difference who is right or wrong
I deserve much more than this
'Cause there's only one thing I want
If it's not what you're made of
You're not what I'm looking for
You were willing but unable to give me anymore

Et ce dont je suis fait
Tout entier je saurai te le rendre
Même s'il faut tout apprendre, tout apprendre
What's your definition of the one?

Comment définir l'amour sans toi?
Mais prêt à tous les sacrifices je refuse celui là
J'aurai voulu t'offrir le meilleur de tout mon être
'Cause these are the waters that I'm in

Même si l'amour s'enfuit
J'en inventerai les couleurs
S'il est trop tard pour revenir
Je remonterai les heures

Je saurai te le rendre

Lucie Silvas,"Reamonn - The Only Ones


Sweet the hands that
Laid me to the ground
Sweet the voice that
Makes the sweetest sound

And I won't go down
I won't go down
On my knees
There's just you and me
We are the only ones


I've heard of love that
Inside she makes you strong
In your arms is where I
I Feel I belong

And it's only
If you want it
I'll be gone
There's just you and me
We are the only ones

It's a brand new day
We'll take it as it comes
There's nothing left to say
Cause it's all been said and done

And if the lights go out
We'll be the burning sun
There's just you and me
We are the only ones

There's just you and me
If we hold on tight
We'll make it through the night
Just you and me
We are the only ones

And if the lights go out
We'll be the burning sun
And In the Darkest of nights
We'll be the only ones
And If we hold on tight
We'll make it through the night
There's just you and me
We are the only ones
And there's just you and me
We are the only ones



",The Only Ones [Album Version],2006
Lucie Silvas,"I got a wake up call, I got to make this work
Cause if we don't we're left with nothing and that's what hurts
We're so close to giving up but something keeps us here

I can't see what's yet to come
But I have imagined life without you and it feels wrong
I want to know where love begins, not where it ends

Cause we don't know what we're doing
We're just built this way
We're careless but we're trying
Cause we both make mistakes
And I don't want to keep on running
If we're only gonna fall behind
We've almost got it right
But almost wasn't what I had in mind

We want it all and deserve no less
But all we seem to give each other is second best
We're still reaching out for something that we can't touch

Cause we don't know what we're doing
We're just built this way
We're careless but we're trying
Cause we both make mistakes
And I don't want to keep on running
If we're only gonna fall behind
We've almost got it right
But almost wasn't what I had in mind

You know there's nothing like this love
So we don't want to let it go

Cause we don't know what we're doing
We're just built this way
We're careless but we're trying
Cause we both make mistakes
And I don't want to keep on running

Lucie Silvas,"Don't feel useless, but don't ask 
If I'm hiding or I'm holding something back 
I have nothing that isn't yours 
But there's a place I need to go behind closed doors 

I don't be afraid 
I don't be ashamed 
If you let me go you know I will be back again 

And I know from the outside looking in 
You can't find me here 
You don't know where to begin 
I can't say anything you need to know 
You're the ocean, I'm an island 
We're together but I'm still alone 

Keep on sailing for the shore 
When you get here you won't find what you were looking for 
You're still reaching so I've become 
So distant that I can't be touched by anyone 

Just give me space 
Some time away 
It's a place only for me but I'll be back again 

I don't need you to save me 

I know from the outside looking in

Lucie Silvas,"I've had a plan, I'm starting today
I won't let these obstacles get in my way
When I am down and I'm feeling alone
I know what I've got to do

When I see blocks in the road up ahead
I won't get frustrated or turn back instead
I'll wait just a moment and take a deep breath
There's an easy thing to do

Counting 1,2,3 and 4
I won't let all these silly things bug me no more
Counting 5,6,7,8,9 and 10
I will calm myself down and be happy again

I don't want to see pain or darnkess no more
If I had the power I'd make it the law
To bottle the raindrops and banish the clouds
Let the sun shine through, that is what I got to go

Counting 1,2,3 and 4
I won't let all these silly things bug me no more
Counting 5,6,7,8,9 and 10
I will count myself lucky and be happy again

Counting 1,2,3 and 4
I won't let all these silly things bug me no more
Counting 5,6,7,8,9 and 10
If I'm not feeling right I'll start over again

Counting 1,2,3,4 and 5
I've got everything here that I need to survive
Counting 6,7, right up to 10
I'll add up all the good, leave no room for the bad to get in

Lucie Silvas,"You might pretend that hurt don't apply to you
But I do know how you feel
You like to make me believe that you're fooling me
And don't give a damn about this now

But I hope no matter what you do
No matter what you choose
That you don't lose
That hunger in your life

Oh passionate you
Oh passionate you
I can see it now

I saw the briefest slip
A flash of anger with a single teardrop to explain
How your pain don't hide so easily

Hide anything from me
Now I can see that hunger in your life

Oh passionate you
Oh passionate you
I can see it now

And every time I look at you I see myself
And it tells me I don't ever want nobody else
You don't have to wear it on the outside every time
But I see every joy and every pain in your life

Oh passionate you
Oh passionate you
I can see it now

If I just can't see it now
My love will show you how you're so
So passionately you

Acting like a fool

I'm starting to wise up

Parlez-moi d'amour,
Redites-moi des choses tendres,
Votre beau discours,
Mon coeur n'est pas las de l'entendre.
Pourvu que toujours
Vous répétiez ces mots suprêmes :
Je vous aime.

Vous savez bien
Que dans le fond, je n'en crois rien,
Mais cependant je veux encore,
Ecouter ce mot que j'adore,
Votre voix aux sons caressants,
Qui le murmure en frémissant,
Me berce de sa belle histoire,
Et malgré moi je veux y croire.

Il est si doux
Mon cher trésor, d'être un peu fou,
La vie est parfois trop amère,
Si l'on ne croit pas aux chimères,

Et le console d'un baiser,
Du coeur on guérit la blessure,
Par un serment qui le rassure.

Et ça fait des économies...

Et vraiment bien plus agréable
Si c'était plus frais en été...

Il faut s'assoir à l'intérieur
Mais on peut y compter fleurette
Et ça suffit à mon bonheur...

Il ne faut surtout pas qu'on hésite
L'escalier n'est pas dangereux
Le tapis est beau
Jusqu'au deuxième
Si on monte plus haut
Plus de tapis
Mais allez tout droit
Montez au sixième
C'est gentil chez moi
Montez-y... 

Il faut que je ramène
Un jour bientôt l'amour chez moi
Car j'ai là-haut bien trop de peine
A vivre toute seule sous mon toît

De ma fenêtre elle est bien mieux""
Quand il aura bien vue la rue,

Quand mille feux se reflètent, blafards
Dans un décor de brouillard.

S'en vont chercher les coins sombres, 
Ou se chauffer au jouyeux brasero
Du marchand de marrons chauds....

Lorsque descend la nuit,
Tout's sort's de gueux se faufilent en cachette

Wondering what was going on

From that funny little shop in Spain

When we ducked in from that sudden summer rain

But the great speckled bird in the Bible 
Is one with the great church of God

They envy her glory and fame 
They hate her because she is chosen 
And has not denied Jesus' name 

Desiring to lower her standard 
They watch every move that she makes 
They long to find fault with her teachings 
But really they find no mistake 

She is spreading her wings for a journey 
She's going to leave by and by 
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning 
She'll rise and go up in the sky 

In the presence of all her despiser's 
With a song never uttered before 
She will rise and be gone in a moment 
Till the great tribulation is over 

I am glad I have learned of her meekness 
I am proud that my name is on her book 
For I want to be one never fearing 
The face of my Savior to look

On the cloud that He writes in His Word 
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him

Have you heard someone say
If I had his money
I'd do things my way
How little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in a hundred
With a satisfied mind

Once I was living
In fortune and fame
And everything I could dream of
To get a start in life's game
And suddenly it happened
I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far
With a satisfied mind

No money can buy back
Your youth when your old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a heart that's grown cold
And the world's richest man
Is a pauper at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind

When my life is over
And my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain

But in your heart you know you were born to roam
And you're gonna leave as soon as you get the money
After you sell everything you own

Or does it steal you blind and leave you split apart
Maria, can you give me an answer
Are the songs we sing worth the broken heart

The highway has always been your lover
And someday you may know his name
Wherever you stay it wouldn't really matter
'Cause all those cities start to look the same

His daddy used to drive those eighteen wheelers
Now he drives the bottle deep into the night
He was always saying son, you're just no good
You'll never do anything right

He never got enough love in all his life
He wasn't brought up right he never got enough love
The screams and the bruises and the broken bottles
These were things he understood
From busted chairs to a broken heart
He got away as soon as he could

When he was just eighteen he got his very own gun
Shot a kid near a liquor store one night
He was all mixed up he never understood why
He was only lookin' to prove his daddy right
He never got enough love in all his life
He wasn't brought up right he never got enough love
He never got enough love in all his life

Lucinda Williams,"Back in Memphis she was a pearl
She was everyone's favorite girl
Now her eyes have a vacant stare
What she wouldn't give to be livin' back there
She married a man when she left home
She wanted someone she could call her own
He was good to her when he wasn't drunk
He'd hold her and tell her how pretty she looked
Back in Memphis where she grew up
The life she knew was just not enough
Back in Memphis when she was a girl
She thought one day she'd own the world
She'd look at the TV and magazines
And she'd believe all the pictures she'd seen
She'd be wearin' silk and perfume so sweet
But those things don't mean much out here on the street

Back in Memphis she had fun
Goin' around, tellin' everyone
She was gonna buy dresses that zip up the side
And wear red lipstick, have a nice car to drive
She bounces her baby on her knee
Sayin' maybe today we'll get lucky, you'll see
I promise it won't always be like this
Come here, sugar, give Mamma a kiss

I couldn't believe what he just said
Sonny shot himself with a 44
And they found him lyin' on his bed

I could not speak a single word
No tears streamed down my face
I just sat there on the living room couch
Starin' off into space

Mama and Daddy went over to the house
To see what had to be done
They took the sheets off of the bed
And they went to call someone

Some of us gathered at a friend's house
To help each other ease the pain
I just sat alone in a corner chair
I couldn't say much of anything

We drove on out to the country
His friends all stood around
Subiaco Cemetery
Is where we lay him down

I saw his mama, she was standin' there
His sister, she was there too
I saw them look at us standin' around the grave
And not a soul they knew

Born and raised in Pineola
His mama believed in the Pentecost
She got the preacher to say some words
So his soul wouldn't be lost

Some of us, we stood in silence
Some bowed their heads and prayed
I think I must've picked up a handful of dust
And let it fall over his grave

And all around you crumbling buildings and graffiti
As you bend down to tie your shoelace

But now the sun beats down it makes the sidewalks glisten

So you drop some money in her hand

Buttercups in the mornin' dew

Horses waiting to be groomed need a little sugar too
Train game, moss monster, playin' down in the woods of bamboo

But just when I catch up to them, they slip away from me

And I found out that without fail, they lead me to your door

And the world keep turning round and round
It leaves me hanging in the air
My heart keeps turning upside down
You're still standin' there

Now lately I see all the signs, I feel it in the wind
And the same thing happens every time that you come back again
Now I'll admit that there are nights when I sit up and cry
But sometimes I turn out the lights and pray you'll pass me by

And the world keep turning round and round
It leaves me hanging in the air
My heart keeps turning upside down
And you're still standin' there

Now since you've gone my empty arms have nothing left to hold
And your memory cannot keep me warm but it never leaves me cold

And the world keep turning round and round
It keeps me hanging in the air
My heart keeps turning upside down

It leaves me hanging in the air
My heart keeps turning upside down

I'm tired of these small town boys, they don't move fast enough
I'm gonna find me one who wears a leather jacket and likes his living rough""

So she saved her tips and overtime and bought an old rusty car
She sold most everything she had to make a brand new start

You got a lot of nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend

You say I let you down, you know it's not like that
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose and you know it

I know the reason that you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd you're in with
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street, you always act surprised
You say, 'how are you, good luck,' but you don't mean it
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once and scream it

No I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
Now I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place
Can't you understand that's not my problem

Well I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
You know what a drag it is to see you

I thought he was mine
Thought I'd always be his valentine

I told him no way baby that's your own death you see

Starin' off into space

To see what had to be done
They took the sheets off of the bed 
And they went to call someone

To help each other ease the pain
I just sat alone in a corner chair 
I couldn't say much of anything
We drove on out to the country

Subiaco Cemetery 
Is where we lay him down
I saw his mama, she was standin' there 
His sister, she was there too
I saw them look at us standin' around the grave 
And not a soul they knew
Born and raised in Pineola 
His mama believed in the Pentecost
She got the preacher to say some words 
So his soul wouldn't be lost

That howls through the winter

That moves through your hair
And cracks your lips
That chills you to the bone

I envy the rain
That falls on your face
That wets your eyelashes
and dampens your skin
And touches your tongue
And soaks through your shirt
And drips down your back
I envy the rain

I envy the sun
That brightens your summer
That warms your body
And holds you in her heat

And makes you hot
And makes you sweat

Lucinda Williams,"Once in awhile we might pass on the street
We nod and we smile and we shuffle our feet
Making small talk standing face to face
Hands in our pockets 'cause we feel so out of place

Our paths may cross again in some crowded bar
We feel a little lost 'cause we've drifted away so far
Hoping to find the right words to say
We joke a little and then go on our way

We are so out of touch, yeah
We are so out of touch, yeah
La, la, la

We speak in the past tense to talk about the weather
Half broken sentences we try to piece together
I ask about an old friend that we both used to know
You said you heard he took his life about five years ago

We honk and cross over the other lane

Hundreds of cars, hundreds of private lives

How could we go wrong

Right here where we stand

We could have died
Dancing in each other's arms
Or drivin' home close and warm
Out through the little farms
Or in the bed
Holdin' on
And shakin'
But we did not
And where you been
Lately?

I can see your eyes
So dark and knowin'
And I wonder where
That distant train is goin'

Would you smile?
Would you take me?

Got a friend with a needle stuck in his arm
He got hooked on heroin in Vietnam
It used to help kill the pain some of the time
Now I can't sleep at all since I got back home

I worked in the strip mines off and on
Now I can't seem to get rid of this cough
Ain't been many jobs these last few months
And the last one I had I got laid off

I ain't got no hot water and they shut off the heat
Can you loan me some money for something to eat
Been out here on this corner for about a week
Tryin' hard to stand on my own two feet

They want to try and tell me where I can live
They kicked me off my land and told me they'd give me
A nice little tract house with running water
But how am I gonna explain that to my Navajo mother

Since you left Minneapolis

The buildings and the brittle crooked trees

Thin skinned and splintered
Never gotten used to this bitter winter

I've been wasted, angry and sad
Since you left Minneapolis

Like the heavens and the spring's virgin buds
But they strangle me with their sin
Fill me up with poison
Black clouds have covered up the sun again

I can always trace it back
To that night in Minneapolis
Here on the seventh floor in a room I can't call mine
Deadbolt on the door, do not disturb sign
Shaking and trembling
On the clean white linen
Slivers of starlight across the ceiling

A dozen yellow roses

He was born in Nacogdoches
That's in East Texas
Not far from the border
But he liked to tell everybody
He was from Lake Charles
Did an angel whisper in your ear
And hold you close and take away your fear
In those long last moments
We used to drive
Through Lafayette and Baton Rouge
In a yellow Camino
Listening to Howling Wolf
He liked to stop in Lake Charles
'Cause that's the place that he loved
Did you run about as far as you could go
Down the Louisiana highway
Across Lake Ponchatrain
Now your soul is in Lake Charles
No matter what they say
Did an angel whisper in your ear
And hold you close and take away your fear
In those long last moments

He had a reason to get back to Lake Charles
He used to talk about it
He'd just go on and on
He always said Louisiana
Was where he felt at home
Did an angel whisper in your ear
And hold you close and take away your fear
In those long last moments
Did an angel whisper in your ear
And hold you close and take away your fear

Lucinda Williams,"Some think a fancy funeral will be worth every cent
But every dime or nickel is money better spent
Better spent on groceries or covering the bills
Instead of little luxuries and unnecessary frills

Lovely yellow daffodils and lacy pillow fringe
Pretty little angels for everyone to see
Lily of the valley and long black limousines
It's three or four months' salaries just to pay for all those things

So don't but a fancy funeral, it's not worth it in the end
Goodbyes can still be beautiful without the money that you spend
There's no amount of riches that will bring back what you've lost
To satisfy your wishes, no way to justify the cost",Fancy Funeral,2007

Through these ancient eyes

Over the lines in my face
And the pain in my soul

And pain hits a wall
And doesn't know which way to go
And ocean says I'm crying now
And tells pain to follow

And pain courses through
Every vein, every limb
Trying to find a way out
Between the secrets in my skin

And secrets hold on
Until they finally give in
And they meet up with ocean
And tears again

And tears hand me a shovel
Saying break beneath the crust
That binds earthly skin
And buries all the trust

Between the cracks on my lips
And the scars in my heart
And this burden on my hips

I'm counting out the days til I see you again

Fly in from the North

Echoes the beating of my heart

Under the stars above

What it would mean
If the President wore pink
If a prostitute was Queen

What would happen then
How would the world change
If thick became thin
And the world was rearranged

If the rains brought down the moon
And daylight was feared
And the sun rose too soon,
And then just disappeared

If dogs became Kings
And the Pope should cum
If hobos had wings
And God was a bum

If houses became trees
And flowers turned to stone
And there were no families
And people lived alone

If buildings started laughing
And windows cried
And feet started clapping
And out came inside

If mountains fell in slivers
And the sky began to bleed
And blood filled up the rivers
And prisoners were freed

If the stars fell apart
And the ocean dried up
And the world was one big heart
And decided to start

And children grew up happier
And they could run with the wolves
And they never felt trapped
Or hungry or unloved

And birds had bank accounts

Deathly defiant from drowning out
Filthy sounds stumbling, ugly and cruel
Between the lips of your beautiful mouth

Deep down within me words move in phases
Frozen and still until they decide
To melt and drip over the pages
Until that moment they live inside

My words enjoy the feel of the paper
Better than me, lay with your consonants
Once they get going they never waver
And they slip in between your if, ands, and buts

When my words are hiding between the lines
Then I'm afraid they won't hear me call
What if they fail me without a sign?
What if they hardly surface at all?

Screaming and throwing your weight around
My words choose knowledge over politics
You can't kill my words...they know no bounds
My words are strong and they don't make me sick

They still remain my only companion
Boiling truth to the very end
They'll never ever completely abandon
Ever give up the paper and the pen",Words,2007

Hey little rock star, what don't you see
This is not all that it's cracked up to be
And I can't say I blame you
For throwing the towel in or buying more fame
by cashing your chips in
But with all of your talent, and so much to gain
To toss it away like that would be such a shame

Juvenile delinquent, misunderstood
Peter Pan and Robin Hood
Will you ever do the things you're afraid to do

Will you ever know happiness, little rock star
Or is your death wish stronger than you are
Will you go up in flames like the torches
That are carried for you

[Chorus]

To toss it away like that would be such a shame",Little Rock Star,2008
Lucinda Williams,"When leaders can't be trusted
When hero's let us down
And innocence lies rusted
Frozen beneath the ground

And the destitute isolated we've all been forgotten
And the the fruit trees we planted are withered and rotten
The abuse and magnificent suffer from infection
And the promises were given but never with intention
War becomes common place, secrets overheard
And violence, big business and love is just a word

Why do we marry? 
Why do we fall in love? 
Keep on believing in love
Because love, love is a my soar
Love is a weapon
Love is a lesson
And we, we are the conquerors
We are the soldiers
We are the lovers
That's why we fall in love why we believe in love that's why we marry",Plan to Marry,2008

Your eyes say wisdom
Your skin says frailty
Your mouth says listen

Your voice a cello
Your words speak volumes
In and out, around flow
Like Leonard Cohen's

Since you were invented
Since you came along
No one's even attempted
To come close to the beauty of your song

No hits on the radio
No one knows who you are
No big deal with a video
So you're never gonna be a star

You won't be attending
Meetings with presidents
Of companies pretending
To protect their investments

While they suck the gristle
Off the bones of your art
Unfaithful and fickle
Seductive and smart

They'll say you're a rarity
And sleep in your bed
And strangle your purity
And leave you for dead

They'll call you little honey
And write you a check
Seduce you with money
And fuck your respect

For offering a small glimpse
Through your secret door
Of your intellect and brilliance
You deserve so much more

'Cause you, you're a rarity
Your eyes say wisdom
Your skin says frailty
Your mouth says listen",Rarity,2008

Erano già finiti.

E rivedevo I suoi vestiti,
Il più bello era nero
Coi fiori non ancora appassiti.

I ragazzi vendevano I libri,
Io restavo a guardarli 
Cercando il coraggio per imitarli
Poi sconfitto tornavo a giocar
Con la mente e I suoi tarli,
E la sera al telefono 
Tu mi chiedevi
""Perché non parli"".

Si vestono di nuovi colori
E le giovani donne in quel mese
Vivono nuovi amori.

Son certa che io
Ne verrò fuori"".

Che fai finta e che non capisci, non vuoi guai, ah

Se ti guardo diventa rossa

E sotto quale stella, tra mille anni
Se ci sarà una stella, ci si potrà abbracciare?

Mi dà il coraggio di parlare
E di dirti tranquillamente

Lucio Dalla,"Ti hanno visto bere a una fontana 
Che non ero io
Ti hanno visto spogliata la mattina 
Biricchina biriccò

Mentre con me non ti spogliavi 
Neanche la notte
Ed eran botte, Dio, che botte

Ti hanno visto alzare la sottana
La sottana fino al pelo, che nero
Poi m'hai detto ""Poveretto
Il tuo sesso dallo al gabinetto""
Te ne sei andata via con la tua amica
Quella alta, grande fica

Tutte e due a far qualcosa di importante
Di unico e di grande
Io sto sempre in casa, esco poco
Penso solo e sto in mutande

Penso a delusioni, a grandi imprese 
A una thailandese
Ma l'impresa eccezionale, dammi retta
È essere normale
Quindi, normalmente 
Sono uscito dopo una settimana
Non era tanto freddo, e normalmente 
Ho incontrato una puttana

A parte i capelli, il vestito 
La pelliccia e lo stivale
Aveva dei problemi anche seri 
E non ragionava male

Non so se hai presente 
Una puttana ottimista e di sinistra
Non abbiamo fatto niente
Ma son rimasto solo
Solo come un deficiente

Girando ancora un poco ho incontrato 
Uno che si era perduto
Gli ho detto che nel centro di Bologna 
Non si perde neanche un bambino
Mi guarda con la faccia un po' stravolta 
E mi dice ""Sono di Berlino""

Berlino, ci son stato con Bonetti
Era un po' triste e molto grande
Però mi sono rotto
Torno a casa e mi rimetterò in mutande

Prima di salir le scale mi son fermato 
A guardare una stella
Sono molto preoccupato 
Il silenzio m'ingrossava la cappella
Ho fatto le mie scale tre alla volta 
Mi son steso sul divano
Ho chiuso un poco gli occhi
E con dolcezza è partita la mia mano",Disperato Erotico Stomp,1990

Nuvolari è al di sotto del normale
Nuvolari ha cinquanta chili d'ossa
Nuvolari ha un corpo eccezionale

Nuvolari ha un talismano contro I mali

Il suo sguardo è di un falco per I figli 
I suoi muscoli sono muscoli eccezionali!
Gli uccelli nell'aria perdono l'ali quando passa Nuvolari
Quando corre Nuvolari mette paura
Perché il motore è feroce mentre taglia ruggendo la pianura
Gli alberi della strada 
Strisciano sulla piana 
Sui muri cocci di bottiglia
Si sciolgono come poltiglia
Tutta la polvere è spazzata via

Quando corre Nuvolari
Quando passa Nuvolari
La gente arriva in mucchio e si stende sui prati
Quando corre Nuvolari
Quando passa Nuvolari
La gente aspetta il suo arrivo per ore e ore
E finalmente quando sente il rumore 
Salta in piedi e lo saluta con la mano
Gli grida parole d'amore 
E lo guarda scomparire
Come guarda un soldato a cavallo
A cavallo nel cielo di Aprile!

Nuvolari è bruno di colore
Nuvolari ha la maschera tagliente
Nuvolari ha la bocca sempre chiusa
Di morire non gli importa niente
Corre se piove corre dentro al sole
Tre più tre per lui fa sempre sette
Con ""l'Alfa"" rossa fa quello che vuole 
Dentro al fuoco di cento saette!
C'è sempre un numero in più nel destino quando corre Nuvolari?

Quando passa Nuvolari ognuno sente il suo cuore è vicino 
In gara Verona è davanti a Corvino 
Con un tempo d'inferno
Acqua grandine e vento
Pericolo di uscire di strada 
Ad ogni giro un inferno
Ma sbanda striscia è schiacciato
Lo raccolgono quasi spacciato!
Ma Nuvolari rinasce come rinasce il ramarro

Se ti ho cercato per una vita senza trovarti
Senza nemmeno avere la soddisfazione di averti
Per vederti andare via

Senza sapere se strisciare se volare
Insomma, non so più dove cercarti

Quale allegria
Senza far finta di dormire
Con la tua guancia sulla mia
Saper invece che domani ciao come stai
Una pacca sulla spalla e via
Quale allegria

Quale allegria
Cambiar faccia cento volte per far finta di essere un bambino
Con un sorriso ospitale ridere cantare far casino
Insomma far finta che sia sempre un carnevale
Sempre un carnevale

Uscire presto la mattina
La testa piena di pensieri
Scansare macchine, giornali
Tornare in fretta a casa
Tanto oggi è come ieri

Anche sui treni e gli aeroplani
O sopra un palco illuminato
Fare un inchino a quelli che ti son davanti
E son in tanti e ti battono le mani

Senza allegria
A letto insieme senza pace
Senza più niente da inventare
Esser costretti a farsi anche del male
Per potersi con dolcezza perdonare
E continuare

Con allegria
Far finta che in fondo in tutto il mondo
C'è gente con gli stessi tuoi problemi
Per poi fondare un circolo serale
Per pazzi sprasolati e un poco scemi

Facendo finta che la gara sia
Arrivare in salute al gran finale
Mentre è già pronto Andrea
Con un bastone e cento denti
Che ti chiede di pagare

Non sa cosa farà
Poi c'è qualcuno che trova una moto, si può andare in cità

Anna bello sguardo non perde un ballo
Marco che a ballare sembra un cavallo
In un locale che è uno schifo
Poca gente che li guarda
C'è una checca che fa il tifo
Ma dimmi tu dove sarà
Dov'è la strada per le stelle
Mentre ballano si guardano e si scambiano la pelle
E cominciano a volare

Con tre salti sono fuori dal locale
Con un'aria da commedia americana
Sta finendo anche questa settimana
Ma l'America è lontana
Dall'altra parte della luna
Che li guarda e anche se ride
A vederla mette quasi paura

E la luna in silenzio ora si avvicina

Non fermarti balla su una tavola fra due montagne
E se balli sulle onde del mare io ti vengo a cercare
Prendi il cielo con le mani vola in alto più degli aeroplani
Non fermarti sono pochi gli anni forse sono solo giorni
E stan finendo tutti in fretta e in fila
Non ce n'è uno che ritorni
Balla non aver paura se la notte è fredda e scura
Non pensare alla pistola che hai puntato contro
Balla alla luce di mille sigarette e di una luna
Che ti illumina a giorno balla il mistero
Di questo mondo che brucia in fretta quello che ieri era vero
Dammi retta non sarà vero domani
Ferma con quelle tue mani il treno Palermo-Francoforte
Per la mia commozione c'è una ragazza al finestrino
Gli occhi verdi che sembrano di vetro
Corri e ferma quel treno fallo tornare indietro
Balla anche per tutti i violenti veloci di mano e coi coltelli
Accidenti se capissero vedendoti ballare di essere
Morti da sempre anche se possono respirare
Vola e balla sul cuore malato illuso sconfitto poi abbandonato
Senza amore dell'uomo che confonde la luna con il sole
Senza avere coltelli in mano ma nel suo povero cuore
Allora vieni angelo benedetto prova a mettere i piedi sul suo petto
E stancarti a ballare al ritmo del motore ed alle grandi parole
Di una canzone canzone d'amore ecco il mistero

Ama davvero senza nessuna certezza

E chissà come sarà lui domani
Su quali strade camminerà
Cosa avrà nelle sue mani, le sue mani
Si muoverà e potrà volare
Nuoterà su una stella
Come sei bella
E se è una femmina si chiamerà Futura

Il suo nome detto questa notte
Mette già paura
Sarà diversa bella come una stella
Sarai tu in miniatura

Chiudi i tuoi occhi non voltarti indietro
Qui tutto il mondo sembra fatto di vetro
E sta cadendo a pezzi come un vecchio presepio

Di più, muoviti più fretta di più, benedetta
Più su, nel silenzio tra le nuvole, più su
Che si arriva alla luna, sì la luna
Ma non è bella come te questa luna
È una sottana americana
Allora su mettendoci di fianco, più su
Guida tu che sono stanco, più su

Voglio ancora guardarti
Non girare la testa
Dove sono le tue mani
Aspettiamo che ritorni la luce
Di sentire una voce
Aspettiamo senza avere paura, domani",Futura,1994
Lucio Dalla,"È la sera dei miracoli fai attenzione
Qualcuno nei vicoli di Roma
Con la bocca fa a pezzi una canzone
È la sera dei cani che parlano tra di loro
Della luna che sta per cadere
E la gente corre nelle piazze per andare a vedere

Questa sera così dolce che si potrebbe bere
Da passare in centomila in uno stadio
Una sera così strana e profonda che lo dice anche la radio
Anzi la manda in onda
Tanto nera da sporcare le lenzuola
È l'ora dei miracoli che mi confonde
Mi sembra di sentire il rumore di una nave sulle onde

Si muove la città
Con le piazze e i giardini e la gente nei bar
Galleggia e se ne va
Anche senza corrente camminerà
Ma questa sera vola
Le sue vele sulle case sono mille lenzuola

Ci sono anche i delinquenti
Non bisogna avere paura ma stare un poco attenti
A due a due gli innamorati
Sciolgono le vele come i pirati

E in mezzo a questo mare
Cercherò di scoprire quale stella sei
Perché mi perderei
Se dovessi capire che stanotte non ci sei

È la notte dei miracoli fai attenzione
Qualcuno nei vicoli di Roma
Ha scritto una canzone
Lontano una luce diventa sempre più grande
Nella notte che sta per finire
E la nave che fa ritorno
Per portarci a dormire",La Sera Dei Miracoli,1994
Lucio Dalla,"La settima luna
Era quella del luna-park
Lo scimmione si aggirava
Dalla giostra al bar
Mentre l'angelo di Dio bestemmiava
Facendo sforzi di petto
Grandi muscoli e poca carne
Povero angelo benedetto

La sesta luna
Era il cuore di un disgraziato
Che, maledetto il giorno che era nato
Ma rideva sempre
Da anni non vedeva le lenzuola
Con le mani sporche di carbone
Toccava il culo a una signora
E rideva e toccava
Sembrava lui il padrone

La quinta luna
Fece paura a tutti
Era la testa di un signore
Che con la morte vicino giocava a biliardino
Era grande ed elegante
Né giovane né vecchio
Forse malato
Sicuramente era malato
Perché perdeva sangue da un orecchio

La quarta luna
Era una fila di prigionieri
Che camminando
Seguivano le rotaie del treno
Avevano i piedi insanguinati
E le mani senza guanti
Ma non preoccupatevi
Il cielo è sereno
Oggi non ce ne sono più tanti

La terza luna
Uscirono tutti per guardarla
Era così grande
Che più di uno pensò al Padre Eterno
Sospesero i giochi e si spensero le luci
Cominciò l'inferno
La gente corse a casa perché per quella notte
Ritornò l'inverno

La seconda luna
Portò la disperazione tra gli zingari
Qualcuno addirittura si amputò un dito
Andarono in banca a fare qualche operazione
Ma che confusione
La maggior parte prese cani e figli
E corse alla stazione

L'ultima luna
La vide solo un bimbo appena nato
Aveva occhi tondi e neri e fondi
E non piangeva
Con grandi ali prese la luna tra le mani
E volò via e volò via
Era l'uomo di domani l'uomo di domani",L' Ultima Luna,
Lucio Dalla,"Sto andando a Washington, ma cosa vado a fare non lo so
Sono molto in alto, non vedo niente
Non si vede un accidente da qui
Lei ha gli occhi a mandorla e una faccina piccola così
È con i suoi fratelli, piccolina come quelli
Vuoi vedere la foto che ho con me
Ma cos'è che sta volando, sembra una bandiera
Che cosa sta ancora volando, lentamente si avvicina

Ogni piccolo movimento spara, prima che l'altro faccia lo stesso con te
Ogni piccolo sentimento spara, è meglio non chiedersi niente
Ma stavolta voglio vedere chi è

Son partito da London City dove c'erano i Beatles e il Rock & Roll
Ero una macchina negra, ma adesso mi chiamano Zebra
Da quando mi han messo le braccia di un bianco di nome John
Vuoi andare a Washington: ma cosa vai a fare laggiù?
Qui c'è solo un sasso non si vede un casso
Non è rimasto niente nemmeno là
Chissà se mi sta ascoltando, è una bella mattina
Chissà se anche lui sta pensando
Eccolo lì che si avvicina

Ogni piccolo movimento spara, prima che l'altro faccia lo stesso con te
Ma qui non si muove niente, non è rimasto nessuno
Siamo solo io e te",Washington,
Lucio Dalla,"Dice che era un bell'uomo e veniva
Veniva dal mare
Parlava un'altra lingua
Però sapeva amare
E quel giorno lui prese a mia madre
Sopra un bel prato
L'ora più dolce prima di essere ammazzato

Così lei restò sola nella stanza
La stanza sul porto
Con l'unico vestito ogni giorno più corto
E benché non sapesse il nome
E neppure il paese
Mi aspettò come un dono d'amore fin dal primo mese

Compiva sedici anni quel giorno la mia mamma
Le strofe di taverna
Le cantò a ninna nanna
E stringendomi al petto che sapeva
Sapeva di mare
Giocava a fare la donna con il bimbo da fasciare

E forse fu per gioco o forse per amore
Che mi volle chiamare come nostro Signore
Della sua breve vita è il ricordo più grosso
È tutto in questo nome
Che io mi porto addosso

E ancora adesso che gioco a carte
E bevo vino
Per la gente del porto
Mi chiamo Gesù bambino
E ancora adesso che gioco a carte
E bevo vino
Per la gente del porto
Mi chiamo Gesù bambino
E ancora adesso che gioco a carte
E bevo vino
Per la gente del porto
Mi chiamo Gesù Bambino",4/3/1943,1994
Lucio Dalla,"Vita in te ci credo
Le nebbie si diradano 
E ormai ti vedo
Non è stato facile 
Uscire da un passato 
Che mi ha lavato l'anima 
Fino a quasi renderla un po' sdrucita

Vita io ti credo 
Tu così purissima
Da non sapere il modo
L'arte di difendermi
E così ho vissuto quasi rotolandomi
Per non dover ammetter d'aver perduto

Anche gli angeli capita a volte sai si sporcano
Ma la sofferenza tocca il limite
E cosi cancella tutto e rinasce un fiore sopra un fatto brutto
Siamo angeli con le rughe un po' feroci sugli zigomi
Forse un po' più stanchi ma più liberi
Urgenti di un amore, che raggiunge chi lo vuole respirare
Vita io ti credo

Dopo che ho guardato a lungo, adesso io mi siedonon ci son rivincite 
Nè dubbi nè incertezze
Ora il fondo è limpido, ora ascolto immobile le tue carezze
Anche gli angeli capita a volte sai si sporcano
Ma la sofferenza tocca il limite
E cosi cancella tutto e rinasce un fiore sopra un fatto brutto
 
Siamo angeli con le rughe un po' feroci sugli zigomi
Forse un po' più stanchi ma più liberi
Urgenti di un amore, che raggiunge chi lo vuole respirare

Siamo angeli",Vita,1994
Lucio Dalla,"Caro amico ti scrivo 
Così mi distraggo un po' 
E siccome sei molto lontano 
Più forte ti scriverò 

Da quando sei partito 
C'è una grossa novità
L'anno vecchio è finito ormai 
Ma qualcosa ancora qui non va

Si esce poco la sera 
Compreso quando è festa 
E c'è chi ha messo dei sacchi di sabbia vicino alla finestra
E si sta senza parlare per intere settimane 
E a quelli che hanno niente da dire del tempo ne rimane

Ma la televisione ha detto che il nuovo anno 
Porterà una trasformazione 
E tutti quanti stiamo già aspettando
Sarà tre volte Natale e festa tutto il giorno 
Ogni Cristo scenderà dalla croce 
E anche gli uccelli faranno ritorno

Ci sarà da mangiare e luce tutto l'anno 
Anche i muti potranno parlare 
Mentre i sordi già lo fanno

E si farà l'amore ognuno come gli va 
Anche i preti potranno sposarsi 
Ma soltanto a un a certa età
E senza grandi disturbi qualcuno sparirà
Saranno forse i troppi furbi 
E i cretini di ogni età

Vedi caro amico cosa ti scrivo e ti dico 
E come sono contento di essere qui in questo momento
Vedi, vedi, vedi, vedi
Vedi caro amico cosa si deve inventare 
Per poter riderci sopra 
Per continuare a sperare

E se quest'anno poi passasse in un istante 
Vedi amico mio come diventa importante 
Che in questo istante ci sia anch'io

L'anno che sta arrivando tra un anno passerà
Io mi sto preparando 
È questa la novità",L' Anno Che Verrà,1994
Lucio Dalla,"Cosa ho davanti, non riesco più a parlare 
Dimmi cosa ti piace, non riesco a capire, dove vorresti andare 
Vuoi andare a dormire 
Quanti capelli che hai, non si riesce a contare 
Sposta la bottiglia e lasciami guardare 
Se di tanti capelli, ci si può fidare 

Conosco un posto nel mio cuore 
Dove tira sempre il vento 
Per i tuoi pochi anni e per i miei che sono cento 
Non c'è niente da capire, basta sedersi ed ascoltare 
Perché ho scritto una canzone per ogni pentimento 
E debbo stare attento a non cadere nel vino 
O finir dentro ai tuoi occhi, se mi vieni più vicino 

La notte ha il suo profumo e puoi cascarci dentro 
Che non ti vede nessuno 
Ma per uno come me, poveretto, che voleva prenderti per mano 
E cascare dentro un letto 
Che pena che nostalgia 
Non guardarti negli occhi e dirti un'altra bugia 
Almeno non ti avessi incontrato 
Io che qui sto morendo e tu che mangi il gelato 

Tu corri dietro al vento e sembri una farfalla 
E con quanto sentimento ti blocchi e guardi la mia spalla 
Se hai paura a andar lontano, puoi volarmi nella mano 
Ma so già cosa pensi, tu vorresti partire 
Come se andare lontano fosse uguale a morire 
E non c'è niente di strano ma non posso venire 

Così come una farfalla ti sei alzata per scappare 
Ma ricorda che a quel muro ti avrei potuta inchiodare 
Se non fossi uscito fuori per provare anch'io a volare 
E la notte cominciava a gelare la mia pelle 
Una notte madre che cercava di contare le sue stelle 
Io li sotto ero uno sputo e ho detto ""Olé"" sono perduto 

La notte sta morendo 
Ed è cretino cercare di fermare le lacrime ridendo 
Ma per uno come me l'ho già detto 
Che voleva prenderti per mano e volare sopra un tetto 

Lontano si ferma un treno 
Ma che bella mattina, il cielo è sereno 
Buonanotte, anima mia 
Adesso spengo la luce e così sia",Cara,1995
Lucio Dalla,"Qui dove il mare luccica
E tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al Golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
Nella bianca scia di un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica
Si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quelli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole 
Confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Come la scia di un'elica
Ma sì, è la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice
E ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai",Caruso,1995

Non sarei più un

E francamente
Questo non mi và
Ma poi l'inferno
Cos'è?

A parte il
Caldo che fà
Non è poi
Diverso da qui
Perché io sento che
Son sicuro che

Io so che
Gli angeli
Sono milioni di
Milioni
E non li vedi
Nei cieli
Ma tra gli uomini

Sono i più poveri
E i più soli
Quelli presi
Tra le reti

Nascesse ancora Dio
Gli ubbiderei
Amandolo a modo mio
A modo mio
A modo mio
A modo mio",Se Io Fossi un Angelo,

Haciendo juegos malabares 
Para no amarte en exclusiva
Toda la vida poniendo trampas al orgullo 
Tantas historias como estrellas 
Para no ser esclavo tuyo 
Para obtener mi propia música
Toda la vida descubriendo puertas a escondidas 
Para escapar de tus heridas 
Para buscar la aventuras que me liberen de tus besos 
Solo por eso, solo por eso
Toda la vida para olvídate 
Para perderte y recupérate 
Y no dormirme en tus sentidos 
Como un idiota enamorado desmadejado 
Aburrido que se conforma

Mandando cartas a escondidas 
Haciendo citas indiscretas

Y yo buscando mi otra música, mi propia música

Così sta a me che debbo parlare fidarmi di te

Domani domani domani chi lo sa domani sarà
Oh oh chi non lo so quale Dio ci sarà io parlo e parlo solo per me
Va bene io credo nell'amore l'amore che si muove dal cuore
Che ti esce dalle mani che cammina sotto i tuoi piedi

L'amore misterioso anche dei cani e degli altri fratelli
Animali delle piante che sembra che ti sorridono anche quando ti chini per portarle via
L'amore silenzioso dei pesci che ci aspettano nel mare
L'amore di chi ci ama e non ci vuol lasciare

Troppo sangue qua e là sotto i cieli di lucide stelle

Ma chissà se cambierà oh non so se in questo futuro nero buio

Forse c'è qualcosa che ci cambierà
Io credo che il dolore è il dolore che ci cambierà
Oh ma oh il dolore che ci cambierà

È vicino o se è andato tontano
Se ingiro per l'Europa, occhi neri

Dov'è se d'amore è proprio vero che non si muore, non si muore
Cosa faccio nudo per strada mentre piove
E c'è di più
Non dormo da una settimana
Per quel cuore di puttana
Sono andato al cinema e mi han mandato via
Perché piangevo forte e mangiavo la sua fotografia
E tu, e tu
Datemi un coltello, un coltello per favore
Dov'è quel cuore marziano

E una valigia in mano
Con la bici da corsa
E gli occhiali da sole
Fermo in qualsiasi posto del mondo
Chi sa dove
Tra miliardi miliardi di persone
A bocca aperta senza parole
Nel vedere una mongolfiera
Che si alza piano piano
E cancella dalla memoria
Tutto quanto il passato
Anche linee della mano

Come un suono prolungato
Di un pensiero che è appena nato
Si avvicina e scende giù

Ah io sarei uno stronzo

Beh qualche volta lo sono stato
Importante è avere in mano la situazione
Non ti preoccupare
Di tempo per cambiare ce n'è

Vestito da torero
Una torta in mano
L'orecchio puntato verso il cielo
Verso quel suono lontano lontano
Ma ecco che si avvicina

Con un salto siamo nel duemila
Alle porte dell'universo
Importante è non arrivarci in fila

Ognuno con i suoi mezzi
Magari arrivando a pezzi

Poi riscrivilo sulla pelle

Perché ci vuole solo un cretino come me

Solo perché mi piace perdonarti
Perché tu sei, tu sei dentro di me
E poi tu sei molto più forte di me

Ma come si fa
Dove saremo io e te

Vedrai, son più forte di te

Perchè poi penso che te ne andrai

Vorrei essere l'acqua della doccia che fai 
Le lenzuola del letto dove dormirai 
L'hamburger di sabato sera che mangerai, che mangerai
Vorrei essere il motore della tua macchina 
Così di colpo mi accenderai 

Tu, tu non mi basti mai 
Davvero non mi basti mai 
Tu, tu dolce terra mia 
Dove non sono stato mai

Debbo parlarti come non faccio mai 
Voglio sognarti come non ti sogno mai 
Essere l'anello che porterai 
La spiaggia dove camminerai 
Lo specchio che ti guarda se lo guarderai, lo gurderai

Vorrei essere l'uccello che accarezzerai 
E dalle tue mani non volerei mai
Vorrei esser la tomba quando morirai 
E dove abiterai 

Il cielo sotto il quale dormirai

In leggera discesa

Così che il corridore stanco si riposa
Dura da masticare a pezzi fra i denti
Notte da sputare così noiosa
Che si addormenta sul divano e mi viene addosso

Notte fredda con la mano della morte
Che prende il cuore mio e poi lo butta in un fosso
Secca come la testa di una noce, notte senza più voce
Misteriosa da capo indiano che col suo cavallo

Veloce mi parla da un monte lontano
Notte di Praga con forti odori di guerra
Da passare volando a pochi centimetri dal grano
Della mia terra terra, terra, terra

Terra non più mia da quando quella notte sei andata via
Notte povera e provocante
Che dà da fare in due tenendosi per mano
Notte che stai finendo lontano

Porta via dal rumore di chissà quale aereoplano

Sulle panchine in Piazza Grande
Ma quando ho fame di mercanti come me qui non ce n'è

Dormo sull'erba e ho molti amici intorno a me
Gli innamorati in Piazza Grande
Dei loro guai dei loro amori tutto so, sbagliati e no

A modo mio avrei bisogno di carezze anch'io
A modo mio avrei bisogno di sognare anch'io

Una famiglia vera e propria non ce l'ho
E la mia casa è Piazza Grande
A chi mi crede prendo amore e amore do, quanto ne ho

Con me di donne generose non ce n'è
Rubo l'amore in Piazza Grande
E meno male che briganti come me qui non ce n'è

A modo mio avrei bisogno di carezze anch'io
Avrei bisogno di pregare Dio
Ma la mia vita non la cambierò mai mai
A modo mio quel che sono l'ho voluto io

Lenzuola bianche per coprirci non ne ho
Sotto le stelle in Piazza Grande
E se la vita non ha sogni io li ho e te li do

E se non ci sarà più gente come me
Voglio morire in Piazza Grande
Tra i gatti che non han padrone come me attorno a me

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Veniva dal mare
Parlava un'altra lingua
Però sapeva amare
E quel giorno lui prese a mia madre
Sopra un bel prato
L'ora più dolce prima d'essere ammazzato

Così lei restò sola nella stanza
La stanza sul porto
Con l'unico vestito ogni giorno più corto
E benché non sapesse il nome
E neppure il paese
M'aspettò come un dono d'amore fino dal primo mese

Compiva sedici anni quel giorno la mia mamma
Le strofe di taverna
Le cantò a ninna nanna
E stringendomi al petto che sapeva
Sapeva di mare
Giocava a far la donna con il bimbo da fasciare

E forse fu per gioco o forse per amore
Che mi volle chiamare come nostro Signore
Della sua breve vita è il ricord, il ricordo più grosso
È tutto in questo nome
Che io mi porto addosso

E ancora adesso che gioco a carte
E bevo vino
Per la gente del porto mi chiamo Gesù bambino
E ancora adesso che gioco a carte

Così mi distraggo un po' 
E siccome sei molto lontano 
Più forte ti scriverò 

Da quando sei partito 
C'è una grossa novità
L'anno vecchio è finito ormai 
Ma qualcosa ancora qui non va

Si esce poco la sera 
Compreso quando è festa 
E c'è chi ha messo dei sacchi di sabbia vicino alla finestra
E si sta senza parlare per intere settimane 
E a quelli che hanno niente da dire del tempo ne rimane

Ma la televisione ha detto che il nuovo anno 
Porterà una trasformazione 
E tutti quanti stiamo già aspettando
Sarà tre volte Natale e festa tutto il giorno 
Ogni Cristo scenderà dalla croce 
E anche gli uccelli faranno ritorno

Ci sarà da mangiare e luce tutto l'anno 
Anche i muti potranno parlare 
Mentre i sordi già lo fanno

E si farà l'amore ognuno come gli va 
Anche i preti potranno sposarsi 
Ma soltanto a un a certa età
E senza grandi disturbi qualcuno sparirà
Saranno forse i troppi furbi 
E i cretini di ogni età

Vedi caro amico cosa ti scrivo e ti dico 
E come sono contento di essere qui in questo momento
Vedi, vedi, vedi, vedi
Vedi caro amico cosa si deve inventare 
Per poter riderci sopra 
Per continuare a sperare

E se quest'anno poi passasse in un istante 
Vedi amico mio come diventa importante 
Che in questo istante ci sia anch'io

Io alle dieci avevo lezione di tango
Quanta brillantina e coraggio mi mettevo
Guarda oggi come piango

Hai più preso il treno
Quella donna che tangava con furore
Nei locali della croce rossa
Fuori era la guerra nel suo cuore
Nel suo cuore tanto tango
Da unire il cielo con la terra

Hai più preso il treno
Mi son guardato intorno
Ho viaggiato cento notti
Per arrivare di giorno
Ho letto libri antichi e preoccupanti
Poi arrivati a Torino
Ci siamo commossi in tanti
Per quel tango
Ballato dal bambino

Coltello fra i denti
Fiori in mano
Ballava con aria di questura
E l’occhio lontano
Stava per accadere il miracolo
Il cielo da nero a rosso
Ma il treno si è fermato lì
E non si è piu’ mosso

Hai più preso il treno
Ci siamo spinti senza avere fretta
Ci siamo urlati nell’orecchio
Senza darci retta
Mentre il tango si perdeva
In un mare lontano
Dov’è la tua testa da accarezzare
Dov’è la tua mano

Ora ci mostrano i denti e i coltelli
Ci bucano gli occhi
Non ci sono tanghi da ballare
Bisogna fare in fretta per ricominciare
Tutte le stelle del mondo
Per un pezzo di pane
Per la tua donna
Da portare in campagna a ballare
Per un treno con tanta gente
Che parte davvero
Per un tango da ballare tutti insieme
Ad occhi aperti senza mistero

Morena è lontana e aspetta
Suona il suo violino ed è felice
Nel sole è ancora più bella e non ha fretta
E sabato è domani, e sabato è domani",Tango,

Con quali occhi ti devo vedere

Figlio senza domani
Con questo sguardo di animale in fuga 
E queste lacrime sul bagnasciuga che non ne vogliono sapere
Figlio con un piede ancora in terra 
E l'altro già nel mare 
Con una giacchetta per coprirti e un berretto per salutare 
E i soldi chiusi dentro la cintura 
Che nessuno te li può strappare
La gente oggi non ha più paura, nemmeno di rubare
Ma mamma a me mi rubano la vita 
Quando mi mettono a faticare
Per pochi dollari nelle caldaie
Sotto al livello del mare

Che non può affondare
In questa nera nera nave che mi dicono che non può affondare

E quale pena dentro al cuore

E sta tornando il rimorchiatore

Senza camicia, così come sei nato

E avrai dei figli da una donna strana

Anche la solitudine.",Santa Lucia,2010
Lucio Dalla,"La Storia siamo noi
Nessuno si senta offeso
Siamo noi questo prato di aghi sotto il cielo
La Storia siamo noi 
Attenzione
Nessuno si senta escluso
 
La Storia siamo noi
Siamo noi queste onde nel mare
Questo rumore che rompe il silenzio
Questo silenzio così dura da raccontare
 
E poi ti dicono tutti sono uguali
Tutti rubano alla stessa maniera
Ma è solo un modo per convincerti
A restare in casa quando viene la sera
Però la Storia non si ferma davvero
Davanti a un portone
La Storia entra dentro le nostre stanze
E le brucia
La Storia dà torto o dà ragione
 
La Storia siamo noi
Siamo noi che scriviamo le lettere
Siamo noi che abbiamo tutto da vincere
O tutto da perdere
 
Poi la gente
Perché è la gente che fa la Storia
Quando è il momento di scegliere
E di andare te la ritrovi
Tutta con gli occhi aperti
Che sanno benissimo cosa fare
Quelli che hanno letto un milione di libri
E quelli che non sanno nemmeno parlare
È per questo che la Storia dà I brividi
E nessuno la può cambiare
 
La Storia siamo noi
Siamo noi padri e figli
Siamo noi
Bella ciao
Che partiamo
La Storia non ha nascondigli
La Storia non passa la mano
La Storia siamo noi
Siamo noi questo piatto di grano",La Storia,2010
Lucio Dalla,"La prima classe costa mille lire, la seconda cento
La terza dolore e spavento
E puzza di sudore dal boccaporto e odore di mare morto
Sior Capitano mi stia a sentire
Ho belle e pronte le mille lire
In prima classe voglio viaggiare su questo splendido mare

Ci sta mia figlia che ha quindici anni
Ed a Parigi ha comprato un cappello
Se ci invitasse al suo tavolo a cena come sarebbe bello
E con l'orchestra che ci accompagna
Con questi nuovi ritmi americani
Saluteremo la Gran Bretagna col bicchiere tra le mani
E con il ghiaccio dentro al bicchiere
Faremo un brindisi tintinnante
A questo viaggio davvero mondiale, a questa luna gigante

Ma chi l'ha detto che in terza classe
Che in terza classe si viaggia male
Questa cuccetta sembra un letto a due piazze, ci si sta meglio che in ospedale
A noi cafoni ci hanno sempre chiamati
Ma qui ci trattano da signori
Che quando piove si può star dentro ma col bel tempo veniamo fuori

Su questo mare nero come il petrolio
Ad ammirare questa luna metallo
E quando suonano le sirene ci sembra quasi che canti il gallo
Ci sembra quasi che il ghiaccio che abbiamo nel cuore piano piano si vada a squagliare
In mezzo al fumo di questo vapore di questa vacanza in alto mare
E gira gira gira gira l'elica
E gira gira che piove e nevica
Per noi ragazzi di terza classe che per non morire si va in America

E il marconista sulla sua torre
Le lunghe dita celesti nell'aria
E trasmetteva saluti e speranze
Per questa crociera straordinaria
Riceveva messaggi d'auguri
In quasi tutte le lingue del mondo
Comunicava tra Vienna e Chicago in poco meno di un secondo

E la ragazza di prima classe
Innamorata del proprio cappello
Quando la sera lo vide ballare lo trovò subito molto bello
Forse per via di quegli occhi di ghiaccio
Così difficili da evitare
Pensò 
Magari con un pò di coraggio, prima dell'arrivo mi farò baciare
E com'è bella la vita stasera, tra l'amore che tira e un padre che predica
Per noi ragazze di prima classe che per non sposarci si va in America
Per noi ragazze di prima classe che per non sposarci si va in America
Per noi ragazze di prima classe che per non sposarci si va in America",Titanic,2010

E alla luce che taglia il mio viso

E siamo pronti a qualsiasi cosa

Tra un manifesto e lo specchio

Eccoci qua
Siamo venuti per poco
Perché per poco si va
E il sipario è calato già
Su questa vita che tanto pulita non è
E ricorda il colore di certe lenzuola
Di certi hotel
Che il nostro nome ce l'hanno già
E ormai nemmeno ci chiedono più
Il documento d'identità
E allora eccoci, siamo qua
Siamo venuti per niente
Perché per niente si va
E c'inchiniamo ripetutamente
E ringraziamo infinitamente…

I hate to see that evening sun go down

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Luckie Strike,"There's a place I want to see
Away from everything I couldn't be
Thought I'd never find it but here I am
And inside the looking glass 
She whispered to me things I've feared
Till they all seemed faded
Till I couldn't feel
Fall behind
I've lost my mind and now I'm far behind
Will I make it home
Fall behind 
I've lost my time and now I'm far behind 
From me
Follow in without a clue
Find some time some tea for two 
Through the smoke I see it clear
But the party's over
I can't fight, I can't win
What the hell am I turning in
I don't know what who I am
And I don't give a damn
Fall behind
I've lost my mind and now I'm far behind
Will I make it home
Fall behind 
I've lost my time and now I'm far behind 
From me
Mr. Rabbit and his ticking pocket
Watch the crescent cheshire smile
Gave my heart away for a brand new game
Wonder how long since I've died...
Fall behind
I've lost my mind and now I'm far behind
Will I make it home
Fall behind 
I've lost my time and now I'm far behind 
From me",Alice,1997
Luckie Strike,"Everyone
And no one knows
Everyone asks
Calm down

Everyone asks still they know
I don't care what they know
And I don't care if it shocks you
If it shocks you I don't care
I've been thinking I need to stop

Lucky,"Hey, slow down, slow down find the rhythm in your step 
If you made mistakes don't waste time on regret 
Just keep straight pushing through all your problems 
If nothing else eventually time will solve them 

Yes, there's much power in clear and present anger 
But take it from experience love lasts longer 
We're gonna find our way down to victory 
We can come together even if we don't agree 

Wouldn't you like to know what's in my head 
Why don't you look in yours instead 
Find your way to happiness 
But slow down, slow down don't flip out get a grip 

And let Stubhystyle take you on a trip 
Back to 1993, when I thought I was hardcore 
I was a racist son of a bitch, I thought I was superior 
Then I altered my mind and I saw my strut was awkward 

Being selectively antisocial is bringing the world backward 
I want to change the world, I want to get high 
Everyone should make a difference before they die 
Don't follow me, don't follow fate just 

Find your own way 
Conformity's not as bad as they say 
As long as it's not the only way that you've tried, bro 
Get up, get up get out of bed 

Don't waste your life being depressed 
Find your way to happiness 
Slow down and find the rhythm in your life 
If you lost your rhythm, then you lost your drive 

Everybody says to find their own style 
They got to bring it back, bring it back down for a while 
Everybody wants to be their own child 
But their too busy trying to get into the crowd 

Well, I can't tell you who you really are 
All I can say is don't look too far 
I can't tell you who you ought to be 
As long as it's you, don't mean a thing to me 

It's your decision, it's your decision make it good 
It's your decision, it's your decision do what you should?",Slow Down,2000

And I wanna make her mine.
I hope tonight I will see her with the ragtop down,
Starlit sky, pretty little blue gleam in her eye.
She's my California girl.
Summertime is always the best.
Hanging out chilling with my friends.
Drinking juice making memories.
But summertime will never be the same.

So why waste another breathe.

When I stand before you, you search for somebody new.
Come Monday, find my way.
You drift from my worthless kiss.
Iæ?¦ captured by your godliness and a love thatæ?¯ slipped away.

I know it has no meaning.
So why does it hurt so bad.

Showed me graves on the ground and she said
There lies a man who fought for equality
There lies a boy who died in his struggle

Can all these heroes die in vain

I have lost my dignity
I had before trying
To please everybody
Some say to me
Yo yo
I look better when I'm drunk
Some say no no no
I look bad you know
Sometimes I cry
I cry but my crying
Never helps me none

''cause now I am a slave, a slave
I'm a slave
I'm just a liquor slave
I am a slave, a prisoner
I'm a slave

Coming back home

I cry lord I cry
But my crying
Never helps me

Like every woman
She's been trapped in this fairy tale

And hope it would turn into a handsome prince
How many frogs had she kissed in her life
None of them turned into a handsome prince
The little girl made a decision in her life, oh
And she promised to keep it

Man with the words of wisdom
They found his long black coat
On the banks of the river

'Cause he never came back
In it's pocket they found notes
He'd written some time ago
About his so called friends

It read, love all your friends
But never trust any one of them
Which got me thinking about
My very own friends

Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the deadliest of them all
I ask you now, tears in my eyes

Billy old Billy, Billy old Billy
Man with the words of wisdom
See them coming
Hear them talk

Never believe a word they say
He told me one day
Even behind the smile
That he wore on his wrinkled face

Everyday, you could see the scars
Of hurt from the past
Which got me thinking of
My very own, so called friend

Everything will be over

Begging for mercy, pleading innocent
Since my heart is made up to be as cold
As the barrel of this gun I hold
I would pull the trigger anyway

But payin' for some puss, girl, you must be mistaken greatly
You say you wanna taste me, blow and decapitate me
What you need ain't give me gravy, paid me, my dick ain't lazy
Trickin' is dead, holmes, she givin' me head phones
She thick in the red thong, I refuse to be led on
Cause I'm a leader, not a follower
She gon' be a squirter and a swallower
Late night gobbler
Big maniac, she a brainiac, just like she go to Princeton
In a Cadillac, fuck a battle rap, motherfucker, keep it pimpin'

Got me a drug dealer ride, put liq' with coke up in her eye
Tryin' to charge me for that trash ass, pussy, she out of mind
Same thang I can get out her pussy, I'm a get out her mind
Money in my pocket, good, but it ain't comin' out of mine
If you pay for sexual favors, your trick ass out of line
And with every time I call her phone number (Number)
My neighbor is what she lay her head under (Under)

Bitch, suck it while I'm behind the wheel, that's why I'm drivin' reckless
She a head hunter

I don't love her, I don't want her, you can have her, I got another
Did it however which way I could've, then I kicked her up out the Hummer
Nothin' but a head hunter, and she wanna taste me
Bitch, pay me, this dick ain't free
I said on how she bring it back, so how the hell could I pay for that
Choose me, she know the scope, it's pimpin', no love for a hoe
Lucky, yeah, they love me, and they wanted me to hit it
If I put that dick up on her, she gon' get out there and get it

It's my man

And no hero out of books

Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me

He isn't good, he isn't true

But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so

All my life is just despair
But I don't care

So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas
With that Texas playboy rag

I see that old Alamo and blue bonnets grow
When I hear that tune you see?
And memories start to roam of my Texas home
When I hear that melody

So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas
With that Texas playboy rag

Oh, mister fiddling man, now you understand
Why I love this melody?
To me it's more than a song
It takes me along back to where I long to be

So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas
With that Texas playboy rag

I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door, y'all, remember to wipe your feet
And then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow
And mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And mama said to me, child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge

A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe,1999

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

She's a gal that you adore

por los caminos mas lejanos
por los sueños que soñe
sera el reflejo del amor de lo que me toco vivir
sera la musica de fondo de lo mucho que senti

tiene la clave de cualquier generacion
en el alma de mi gente

en las manos del conguero
en los pies del bailador

mientras pase una conbarsa con mi rumba cantare
sere siempre lo que fui con mi azucar para ti

Y ahora vuelvo a recordar aquel tiempo atras
cuando me fui buscando el cielo de la libertad
cuantos amigos que deje 
y cuantas lagrimas llore
y hoy vivire para volverlos a encontrar

Y seguire con mi cancion
bailando musica caliente como bailo yo
y cuando suene una huaracha y cuando suene un huahuanco
en la sangre de mi pueblo en su cuerpo estare yo

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

And I pound on my crying radio

One will go where one will go

Where nobody hurts anyone
Can you feel it, do you see it?

Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And I know just what I have to do
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that
I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And headed out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
And I remember something that you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you",Return of the Grievous Angel,1996
Lucy Kaplansky,"I'm a ruby to someone somewhere
Not a piece of coal
Looking for a lover, looking for a home
Just some peace here in this old world

The sun will melt the glaciers
The mountains turn to dust
The rivers carve the canyons
What I do not live is lost

Mother, please protect me
Mother, please defend me
Mother, please don't abandon me

Only half a life has been my own
And half I never knew
Split the atoms of this half life
Let the phoenix rise anew

There's a face of love and kindness
There's a mother deep inside
And she knows a ruby when she sees one
And her arms are open wide

Mother, please protect me
Mother, please defend me
Mother, please don't abandon me

Just some peace here in this old world
Just some peace here in this old world
Just some peace here in this old world

Lucy Kaplansky,"In night, inside, at night
No whispers, no worries, no words
Just light fills the corner of your eye

Take me in,        take me in

Cold sky, dark Montana, long road
Running fence, radio, trucks blow by
Up high, no air, big dreams
Take me back, take me back



I want to show you everything, everything
I want to give you everything, everything

There's a chance now and then, now and then
No more cut and run, No more cut and run

Blue night, blue world, tracking you
I'm a scorpion and I'm coming after you
Running out of darkness and time
Looking for you, looking for you

Gonna sting you with a kiss from my lips
Gonna sting you with a piece of my mind
Gonna sting you with a taste of my skin
Then you're mine, then you're mine

Lucy Kaplansky,"Sadness is a little boy looking  
Out the window high above the city,
Counting statues of people on the buildings, 
Thinking that the people are forever,

He wants his father to be a statue, 
On the rooftop of his fatherless home,
So that he can always see him, 
So that he will never leave him,

Late at night in the darkness of his dreaming, 
His father's words fall down in a rainstorm,
And the words become hands that will guide him,
Through his life in the world just beginning.    

[Chorus:]
 
You cannot live in bronze or stone, 
Make your life in flesh and bone.

Stranded is a man no longer searching 
For the life he had hoped for and imagined
Courting fear instead of a woman, 
Holding sorrow as his only companion

Counting days like his money in the markets, 
And watching life from the window in his office,
Maybe one day I'll have the courage, 
Maybe one day I'll sail across the ocean.

But I feel safe in the light of my computer, 
This is how I choose to live,
Fixed in stone a man will wither, 
Running waters are the life of the river.

You cannot live in bronze or stone, 
Make your life in flesh and bone
Remember me...

Frightened is an old man limping 
Through the park on a dark December day,
He stands frozen at the base of a statue, 
And he hopes for a warm hand to help him,

Tonight he will dream that he is flying, 
Over banks of a river he remembers
His father's voice will echo all around him,
His father's hands will hold him in the sky,

Now I can sail across the ocean, 
Now I will sail across the ocean,
Now I am sailing across the ocean.

I cannot live in bronze or stone, 
I must live as flesh and bone.
Remember me, remember me, remember me...",Still Life,1996
Lucy Kaplansky,"We were sitting at a cafe 
You were listening like you had nothing better to do
You were feigning interest badly,
I guess interest is too hard for you
So I stopped talking, and just watched you
Watched the way your mouth made faces at me
Watched the way your eyes looked through me
Looking for something new you could take from me...

[Chorus:]
 
And I know what you are
You're the thief who steals from your friends
I know what you are and
Everything in the world does not belong to you

Everything you ever gave me 
Were just scraps you didn't want anyway
All the people you discarded
Guess you never thought you might want them back some day

I've been loyal, I've been honest
Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know what for
I've knelt down with all the others
But I'm not on my knees anymore...

And reach the days
When everything was new
When witches were birds that lived in trees
When dreams were movies God made for me
I talked to dogs
I knew why trees and kids cried
Why snow was white why people died
In show and tell
I talked about the shapes of clouds
And all the schoolyard angels who protected me
I am here and this is mine
I'm everywhere flying in line
Always looking for a place to rest
I hid in trees and built my nest
I made my nest of buried things
And the roots ran like secrets
Through six year rings
I found that secret places were better places
Nicer places that villains could not find
I do not lie
These places are mine

Lucy Kaplansky,"I used to hear him sing in a Bleecker Street bar
On that tiny stage with a borrowed guitar
His voice cut through like a speeding car
Tearing through the deals of the brokers at the bar

Then he sold everything for a Wall Street wage
A rich man's money is a rich man's cage
Pockets full of gold and a dead man's face
There was life in those eyes, now there's not a trace

How much did you pay
And are you sorry at the end of the day
Are you sorry at the end of the day

She used to be a friend and a wife and a daughter
Now she's walked on everybody like she's walking on water
She'll kiss you on the mouth while she takes what you give her
Better turn the other cheek when she walks away forever

'Cause you're just another rung on the ladder to the top
And once she started climbing she couldn't ever stop
With her entourage around her she sits on her throne
But she's the queen of nothing now, she's sitting all alone

And you found out what you wanted
Well it isn't what you need
And you curse this train you're riding
You curse it but you never leave

Quiet now, everyone still asleep
She can feel her heart beating, she can hear herself breathe
Her mother told her to be a dark mystery
But the darkness is out of control and she can't see
But at least she's alive

She's gonna hit the ground running from this dead end street
Saved by the power of her own two feet

Walks downstairs, icy wind blows
Face to face inside the front door
It's not a crime to need more
There's something I'm looking for

You're throwing us away, you can't do that

And me standing over you waiting for another round

I would tell you that I'm sorry, but I know what you would say

Said pack your bags, we're leaving

From the bottom of his barrel to the bottom of his well

A thousand cures and a thousand poinsons

In the footprints someone left there

Becomes only paper thin
And the wind on your face
Is freezing someone else's skin

And the sun is making movies
Slo-mo black and white
You wish you could breathe the cold air
And feel it move inside

I know what it is to be nowhere
I know what it's like
I know what it is to be nowhere

Long ago in your room
Pretended you were far away
Then you looked into your mother's eyes
Saw no one was reflected there

Now your secrets are your companions
You know them all by heart
They're written on your body
You read them in the dark

Carved underneath your sweater
So you'll always remember
At least they're something
To hold onto, hold onto

I know what it is to be nowhere
I know what it's like
I know what it is to be nowhere, nowhere

Go inside and say your name
And close the door

Oh I need a boy like you like a hole in my head 
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head 
You make me feel so bad that I wish I was dead 
Let the games begin 
Yeah here I go again 
I'm never gonna win 
It must have knocked me crazy 
It must have hit me hard 
People must think I'm lazy 
Like my shuffle's short 
Of playing a card 
Wild goose chase 
Wild goose chase 
Oh I need a boy like you 
Like a wild goose chase 
I need a boy like you 
Like a wild goose chase 
You better find somebody to take my place 
Let the games begin 
Yeah here I go again 
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)
I need a boy like you
Like a hole in my head
Hole in my head
Hole in my head
Hole in my head
Hole in my head
Like a hole in my head
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)
I need a boy like you (I need a boy like you)",Hole in My Head,2004
Lucy Kaplansky,"I had something, it fell from me
Something strong
Like a pounding drum, like ringing bells 
When I was young
I had something and it was gone

I had something  made me walk all night
Made me run from home, made me fight
I had something
Made me feel alone
Like an orphan waiting for a home

Chorus:
Every footstep that I take
Completes the circle my life makes
Every living thing has ties that bind
What I lost returns with love and time

I heard something, it called to me
And it told me I was saved
Not by God
And not by words
Not by any living thing

It was the voice that I once knew
Of my daughter or my son 
Not yet born
And not yet known
Another orphan waiting for a home

(chorus)",I Had Something,2004
Lucy Kaplansky,"Late afternoon back in New York town
Waking up as the wheels touch down
Pick up my guitar and walk away
Wish I was going home to stay

Line of taxis I wait my turn
Tar and asphalt, exhaust and fumes
Beside the road on a patch of ground
Taxi drivers are kneeling down

Beneath the concrete sky I watch them pray
While the people of the world hurry on their way
I think they're praying for us all today
The stories that fell from the sky that day

Chorus:
This is the land of the living
This is the land that's mine
She still watches over Manhattan
She's still holding onto that torch for life

Back home fire's still burning
I can see it in the air
Pictures of faces posted everywhere
They say hazel eyes, chestnut hair
Mother of two missing down there

I pass the firemen on duty tonight
Carpets of flowers in candlelight
And thank you in a child's scrawl
Taped to the Third street firehouse wall

There's shadows of the lost on the faces I see
Brothers and strangers on this island of grief
There's death in the air 
But there's life on the street
There's life on the street
(chorus)

Then I got in a taxi, said Hudson Street please
He started the meter and he looked at me
I glanced at the name on the back of his seat
And looked out the window at the ghost filled streets

I noticed the cuts on his hand and his face
And I said You're bleeding, are you okay?
He said ""I'm not so good got beat up today
And I'm not one of them no matter what they say

I'm just worried about my family
My wife's in the house and she's scared to leave""
And I didn't know what to say
I didn't know what to say
I said a prayer for him anyway
(chorus)",Land of the Living,2004
Lucy Kaplansky,"This news won't break my heart
It's already been blown apart
I feel like a helpless girl
In this tender troubled world

Another bomb lights up the night
For someone's vision of paradise
But it's just a wasted sacrifice
That fuels the hate on the other side

All in the name of a holy land
All to claim a line in the sand

Chorus:
Oh but the promised land
Is just across another line in the sand
Yeah but the promised land
Is just across another line in the sand

Just like at Calvary
Soldiers do the bidding of their king
And dreams are lost one at a time
Blown across both sides of the line

You can't kill a giant with just one stone
You can't erase the story of a family's home
A hate-filled heart still beats alone
Walking wounded on that endless road

And there's so much blood on all our hands
It cuts an even deeper line in the sand

Chorus

I hope a forgiving rain will fall sometime
And wash away that line

Chorus",Line in the Sand,2004
Lucy Kaplansky,"Answer me when I call to you
What became of the life I knew?
Tell me why I can't be free
Tell me what you expect of me
I'm so down about it
I can't sleep at night
I sit watching the bugs as they bounce off the light

Answer me when I'm calling out
Tell me, what's all the noise about?
Explain to me the rules of love
Tell me just what I'm guilty of
Somehow I must've missed it
I never knew I was blind
Repeat it real slow so I get it this time

[Chorus:]
I'm off and running to take what's mine
I'm off and running again
I'm off and running
To take what's mine
I'm off and running
And I won't get caught this time
With my soul on empty and my face to the wind
I'm off and running
I'm off and running again

Answer me when I call your name
What'd you do with my ball and chain?
I'm out here in the open air
And I can't find it anywhere
And I'm so lost without it
It was such a part of me
I guess I'll get along
How hard can it be?

[Chorus]",Off and Running,2004
Lucy Kaplansky,"I was only a girl when I went out on my own
You wrapped me up warm and just let me go
Now I live at the far end of this long distance line
And I'm just another one who's gone and left you behind

Wish we could look at your pictures, all the places you've been
I don't think you will but you can see them again
'Cause you can see them through me
The brown eyes I got from you
Now I wish I could give 'em back to you

This much I can say, this much I can do
When your heart is empty I'll try to fill it for you
'Cause I'm the girl who learned to love from watching you

Wish that I could tell you it'll all be alright
But you never did believe it through the trials of your life
You and I both know it just isn't true
When so much you love has been taken from you

I remember when you told me if we run out of time
How happy you were just to know she'll be mine
When I wrap her up warm, you'll be right next to me
'Cause they say that the red thread that ties me to you
Ties her to me

This much I can say, this much I can do
When your heart is empty I'll try to fill it for you
This much I can say, this much I can do
When your heart is empty I'll try to fill it for you
'Cause I'm the girl who learned to love from watching you
Watching you, watching you
",The Red Thread,2004
Lucy Kaplansky,"When I found you I knew that you'd be mine
It wasn't my first kiss
It wasn't my first time
It was the first time I gave my heart
When I wasn't just alone
I put it in your hands
And I followed you home

Now I'm on the interstate
Wishing I could sleep
I see you lying in our bed
You're waiting up for me
And while I'm taking in the view
I'm wishin' I could give you
What I wanted to
You know I wanted to

Chorus:
This is home
Where I want to be
This is home
Lets make a family
Baby you and me, baby you and me

She's lying on a bed 
In some crowded room
Trying to sleep
Not much else to do
The faces change around her
They speak to her sometimes
She's getting used to being left behind

When we find her
We'll belong to her
We won't see her first smile
We won't hear her first word
But ours will be the first hearts 
She holds in her hands
She can keep ‘em beside her
In her very own room
