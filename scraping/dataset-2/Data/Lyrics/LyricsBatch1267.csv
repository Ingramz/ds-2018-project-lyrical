Wesley Safadão,"Eu fui no camarote com CD para tocar
Uma batida bem frenética
O DJ chegou a pirar

E quando ouviu o porradão logo me perguntou
Que pancadão é esse que a galera já pirou?

É tchururu, tchereré
E faz o tchá tchá com a mão
Faz o tché tché com o pé

É tchururu, tchereré
E faz o tchá tchá com a mão
Faz o tché tché com o pé

Essa pegada é forte
Todo mundo que fazer
É só juntar as mãos e pro ladinho mexer

Tá indo pro outro lado
Sentindo a sensação
Mas pra ficar gostoso, ai Wesley Safadão

Wesley Safadão,"Se eu tivesse vergonha na minha cara
Eu não te ligava mais, não te procurava mais
Pra não perder minha paz

Você me cega, mas não me deixa surdo
Eu fico sabendo das suas andanças
Dos seus absurdos

Eu sinto ciúmes de morrer
Mas não demonstro pra você
Eu fico calado só pra ter você por perto

Eu já tentei te esquecer
Mas eu insisto em te querer
É nos seus braços que eu sou realizado

Aceito tudo de você
Porque você sabe fazer
Aquele amor que me deixa abobalhado

E esse é meu jeito de viver
Te perdoando pra te ter
Me iludindo só pra me sentir amado
E assim eu pago os meus pecados

Eu sinto ciúmes de morrer
Mas não demonstro pra você

Wesley Safadão,"Para de falar que não tem sentimento
De vez em quando liga só pra passar o tempo
Já que é assim, não sente a minha falta
Explica a ligação às três da madrugada

Alivia essa vontade
Eu sei que beija o meu rosto, mas quer minha boca
E quando me abraça, imagina o meu corpo sem roupa
E que morre de medo de me ver saindo com outra

'Tá sofrendo porque quer (quer, quer)
Podia 'tá comigo e 'tá sozinha

Seu amor é que nem chuvisco
Chove e nunca molha
Você só me enrola
Traz o mel e quando eu vou provar, 'cê pula fora

É que nem chuvisco
Deixa de migué

Wesley Safadão,"Eu entro no quarto e vejo sua mala fechada no chão
E no guarda roupa um vestido de solidão
Doeu demais meu coração

Pra buscar as coisas que não deu pra levar

Se eu já beijei sua boca?

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

Sees the sun going down

Wesley Willis,"This is a song that I'm gonna rap about, and sing about
It's called that ""He's Doing Time in Jail""
This is about this guy who slashed me in the face and back as I exited the 4 Cottage Grove bus
This is the dawn of a new era
So let me rap and sing about this song, as I exit the Cottage Grove bus

Once upon a time, on the 4 Cottage Grove bus
I felt like I was on the floor
I was talking to myself
Suddenly, a man in his 30s thought I was talking to him
Suddenly, he started yelling at me, talking vulgar

He's doing time in jail

He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail

As he yelled at me vulgarly, I tried to tell him to shut his face
But he refused to do so!
When I was about to get up and get off the bus, that same guy whipped out a box cutter on me
He followed me to the exit door, chasing after me, as I got off the bus
That was at 4358 South Cottage Grove Avenue
He then slashed me in the face, and then in the back

He's doing time in jail
He's doing time in jail

West Brom FC,"Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, I fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear

Insomnia

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
This insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature
Under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep
I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep

Never mind the coastline
Need a dime to pay the phone

All the lights are raining down.

Come on, come on, come on, let it go

On a highway...rows & rows of tired lives
Miles from Monterey

Overlooking a memory you once had
There's a light in a northern sky
And a picture of you that never dies

Pass the time and make it til Friday
I'm hypnotized living in a photograph life
You're still on my mind
All the homes and places I let go
I don't belong, California rides in my heart
A new place to start

Oh dawn is coming
There's something out there I'll find a way
Oh dawn is here

Watch out for the lonely people, they're hypnotized
Waiting for the end of the world to wake them back up
It's the same as talking to my baby
But those words I've lost
Surrendered to the daydream inside and come back alive

Oh dawn is coming
There's something out there I'll find a way
Oh dawn is here

What am I waiting for
There is no other way
I'm sure I won't remember

Arms open wide...say goodbye
You've had enough
Eyes on the road with nowhere to go

Still lost
The world is alive you can see it in his eyes
Still lost

Still lost
In a car on the beach & another in the street
Still lost
The arms of a ghost no one's there
Still lost

Who tonight will change your life
To jump on a plane and land a thousand miles away
Just to see what we came to be

We're lying on a beach in the sun
Looking for a hole in the sky
That we could climb out of

Flip on the radio
It's a song I've heard before
It's a song to burn the clouds away

All my friends get high

They say the day has to end
But we never get tired
All the lights shine
Beads upon your eyes, whoa I

Use stars as candlelight
Come here every night
There's no chance of them finding us today

All my friends get high

All my friends get high
All my friends get high
They're never gonna find us
All my friends get high
In the wide open space

All my friends get high
In the color of your skin
All my friends get high
At the bottom of your soul

All my friends get high
There's a hole in the sky
All my friends get high
With a place for everyone

Lying on the beach in the sun

Words he might have said
An arrow shot through his heart
And stopped him in his tracks

I'm running, running, running back to you

He lied awake counting minutes
He imagined he was underwater
Where she's swimming out beneath the surface
Together between the currents

I'm running, running, running back to you

People believe, I still remember
People lose and still regret
People become, I shouldn't have told her
People dream to forget

Hoping she might hear
In his mind, she is dancing

Little tiny eyeballs see the places I've gone
They keep pictures of my old friends, they'll always live on
Every summer we come together
Looking for the bluest wave

Try to catch one
Try to catch one, only the best one
Try to catch one
Try to catch one, you're the best one

And it's coming down, raining like a pulse of light
And we're riding on the longest wave tonight
And if we ever get there, we'll all get laid tonight

You'll see we're all the same, no matter what we feel
There's a little good in everyone, everyone can shine

Get up, get up
You and I will rise above
You and I will shine on, into the blue

You know they won't believe unless it's on TV

Got all the dough and all the women

I can't take it with me, I wish they could send me
To the moon and back with a cure for cancer

You're running from your life that you didn't see
That's like playing hide and seek with the grim reaper

You can run, but you can't hide
Spent your whole life trying to escape
When everybody stayed
Getting tired of living in a lie
Different nights, same town
Say goodbyes, but we tried
Cause we know there's no getting out
And when the pawns are playing themselves
I just lay and wait and straighten myself
(?) to the rhythm sells out
Bring them back to life, give them mouth to mouth

Back up and down everyday.
I'm getting kind of tired.
Talk to myself along the way,
People will start to think I'm crazy.
It keeps me sane, though.
I stare too much and too long,
I get busted all the time.

Does anyone really care
Or do they get that compliment too often?
I only hate what I don't like about myself.
I'm sorry if I see myself in you, 
'cause there's nothing you can do.
I only trust as far as I can see
And I forget all the things I trusted just weren't true.
Maybe if I believe in it just enough 

I'll remember that it really happened someday.
I try so hard not to care what you think of me.
I try so hard just to make you like me.

All the children of the world,
Red and Yellow, Black and White,
They are precious in his sight,

Mississippi, in sixty-one, they watched his Daddy die,
Guided by the light of a burning cross, that lit the delta sky.
Kevin and Willy, ten years old, they were best of friends,
The only way you could tell 'em apart was the color of their skin.

""Come on Willy,"" Kevin screamed, ""Let's get out of here!""
Willy's numb, can't even run, frozen there with fear,
So Kevin takes off through the woods,
Yelling ""I'll be back for you""
Running fast out of breath, can't stop and rest,
His Daddy would know what to do!
Rushing through the door,
He sees the eyes of a man,
His Daddy's washing the blood out of a sheet,
But it won't come off his hands!

[Chorus]
And the blood still runs down Cherokee Highway,
A senseless river filled with all they shared,
Just two dark sides to Cherokee Highway,
But black or white, the blood still runs red.

Now the fire, is at the fuse, in a town that just won't learn.
The word is out, make the white man pay, gonna watch his farmhouse burn.
Midnight, the flames begin, Kevins Daddy's the first to rise.
So he grabs his gun, and he grabs his wife,
But Kevin's still inside!
From the shadows comes,
A boy with darker skin,
Though they killed his Daddy he's gonna save his friend,
And he runs through the door, as the house falls in.

[Chorus]

Standing in the ashes,
He sees what hate really is,
Two little bodies both burnt black, can't tell which child is his!

Holland ist in Not
Ich koch meine eig'ne Suppe
Alles wie gewohnt
Supermann ist tot
Er rauchte wie ein Schlot
Ich fang an sein Grab zu graben
Für nen Hungerlohn

Als ihm wurde klar
Dass er gar nicht fliegen konnte
Nur ein Arschloch war
Genau wie do und ich
An den Kindertisch
Sich nicht traut, nen Furz zu lassen
Lieb mich oder nicht
Supermann, wir brauchen dich
Wie under täglich Brot
Kannst auch meine Schwester bumsen
Wenn es sich für mich lohnt

Wurde Fett und Krank
Kam nicht mehr in seinen Anzug
Und hat Abgedankt

Wer hat dich bestellt
Wer hat soviel Pinke Pinke
Wer hat soviel Geld

Mit Hang zum Personal
Sie liebte junge Männer
Mit Muskeln hart wie Stahl
Doch für Diamanten
Und 'ne Schußfahrt I'm Schnee
Stieg sie in die Federn
Mit dem dicken Bankier

Daß Männer halt so sind
Und man sah ihr deutlich an

Und sprach das magic word:

In 'ner Talkshow oder so
Da traf ich dann mein Spiegelbild
Auf dem Garderobenklo
Ich hab' nicht lang gefackelt
Und sagte ihm meine Meinung
Über die gesamte deutsche Wiedervereinigung

Diese zynische Bemerkung
Aufgebahrt I'm Büßerhemd
Und bettelt um Verstärkung

Da konnte ich in aller Ruhe

Westlife,"Some say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed
That with the sun's love
In the spring
Becomes the rose",The Rose,

Westlife,"Goodbye to you my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we've climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and ABC's
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
Goodbye my friend it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun
we had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

Goodbye Papa please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along
Goodbye Papa it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them, I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons have all gone
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons have all gone

Goodbye Michelle my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground
Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there",Seasons in the Sun,1999

But we're still trying

So you should know this love we share was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one way street just you and I just you and I

I'm never gonna say goodbye

That everything has got its place in time
Even the day must give way to the night
But I'm not buying

I see a love that burns eternally
And if you see how beautiful you are to me
You'll know I'm not lying

I have visions of many things.

What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.

Tucking shirts in, fixing ties to please her

Take a good look at her

And you make it better

We know what we've got
And we've got what we need alright
We're doing something right

You are the summer breeze
The wind blowing through the trees
You make the loneliness
All just disappear

On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shown the moon that night,
Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing",Good King Wenceslas,1993

And my mind could be set free
As wild white horses reached the shore
I'd stand alone and oversee

And if the bush before me burns
Should I turn my eyes away
And still the voices I can hear
As clear to me as light of day

I believed in my dreams
Nothing could change my mind
Now I know what they mean
How could I be so blind

Cold sands of time
(Winds that blow as cold as ice
Sounds that come in the night)
Shall hide what is left of me
(Come from Paradise)

I've been through times when no one cared
(Words that were mine)
I've seen clouds in empty skies
When one kind word meant more to me
(Shall last as a memory)
Than all the love in Paradise

Nothing could change my mind
Till I found what they mean
Nothing can save me now",To One in Paradise,1976
Westminster Festival Orchestra,"Lord Elderley, Lrd Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
With every virtue, every grace,
Ah what avails the sceptred race,
Here you see-the four of us,
And there are so many more of us
Eldest sons that must succeed.
We know how Caesar conquered Gaul
And how to whack a cricket ball;
Apart from this, our education lacks co-ordination.
Though we're young and tentative
And rather rip-representative,
Scions of a noble breed,
We are the products of those homes serene and stately
Which only lately
Seem to have run to seed!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
How beautiful they stand,
To prove the upper classes
Have still the upper hand;
Though the fact that they have to be rebuilt
And frequently mortgaged to the hilt
Is inclined to take the gilt
Off the gingerbread,
And certainly damps the fun
Of the eldest son-
But still we won't be beaten,
We'll scrimp and scrape and save,
The playing fields of Eton
Have made us frightfully brave-
And though if the Van Dycks have to go
And we pawn the Bechstein Grand,
We'll stand
By the Stately Homes of England.
 
Here you see
The pick of us,
You may be heartily sick of us,
Still with sense
We're all imbued.
Our homes command extensive views
And with assistance from the Jews
We have been able to dispose of
Rows and rows and rows of
Gainsboroughs and Lawrences,
Some sporting prints of Aunt Florence's,
Some of which were rather rude.
Although we sometimes flaunt our family conventions,
Our good intentions
Mustn't be misconstrued.
 
The Stately Homes of England
We proudly represent,
We only keep them up for
Americans to rent,
Though the pipes that supply the bathroom burst
And the lavatory makes you fear the worst,
It was used by Charles the First
Quite informally,
And later by George the Fourth
On a journey north.
The State Apartments keep their
Historical renown,
It's wiser not to sleep there
In case they tumble down'
But still if they ever catch on fire
Which, with any luck, they might
We'll fight
For the Stately Homes  of England
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Though rather in the lurch,
Provide a lot of chances
For Psychical Research-
There's the ghost of a crazy younger son
Who murdered, in thirteen fifty-one,
An extremely rowdy Nun
Who resented it,
And people who come to call
Meet her in the hall.
The baby in the guest wing,
Who crouches by the grate,
Was walled up in the west wing
In fourteen twenty-eight.
If anyone spots
The Queen of Scots
In a hand-embroidered shroud
We're proud
Of the Stately Homes of England.
 
Lord Elderley, Lord Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
Behold us in our hours of ease,
Uncertain, coy and hard to please.
Reading in Debrett of us,
This fine Patrician quartette of us,
We can feel extremely proud,
Our ancient lineage we trace
Back to the cradle of the Race
Before those beastly Roman bowmen
Bitched our local Yeomen.
Through the new democracy
May pain the old Aristocarcy
We've not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance what will be- will be.
Our heads will still be
Bloody but quite unbowed!
 
The Stately Homes of England
In valley, dale and glen
Produce a race of charming,
Innocuous young men.
Though our mental equipment may be slight
And we barely distinguish left from right,
We are quite prepared to fight
For our principles,
Though none of us know so far
What they really are.
Our duty to the nation,
It's only fair to state,
Lies not I pro-creation
But what we pro-create;
And so we can cry
With kindling eye
As to married like we go,
What ho!
For the Stately Homes of England!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Although a trifle bleak,
Historically speaking,
Are more or less unique.
We've a cousin who won the Golden Fleece
And a very peculiar fowling-piece
Which was sent to Cromwell's niece,
Who detested it,
And rapidly sent it back
With a dirty crack.
A note we have from Chaucer
Contains a bawdy joke.
We also have a saucer
That Bloody Mary broke.
We've two pairs of tights
King Arthur's Knights
Had completely worn away.
Sing Hey!
For the Stately Homes of England.

The Stately Homes of England,
Tho' rather on the blink
Provide a lot of reasons
For what we do and think.
Tho' we freely admit we may be wrong,
Our conviction that we are right is strong
Tho' it may not be for long,
We'll hold on to it
We might as well hold the bat
Till they knock us flat
Our dignity of race may
Retire into its shell
Our Minister of Grace may
Defend us none too well
But still if a child
Becomes too wild
And we're forced to use the rod,
Thank God
For the Stately Homes of England",The Stately Homes of England,2012

And I'll do my best to keep it right there
On your pretty face everyday
For the rest of my life

When you smile that smile
It's like the sun coming up on a blue sky day
And my heart runs wild
And all you gotta do is look my way
And all my worries just disappear
And I'm lost in your eyes
Everything's right in the world for a little while
Girl when you smile that smile.
Yeah girl when you smile that smile",Smile That Smile,2013

Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

[Nate Dogg]
But I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

[Chorus: x2]

[2 Pac]
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us party
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snithces
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets,
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies
Me and my fucking homies

[Chorus]

(Me and my homies)
Constantly we mash
(Me and my homies)
Gotta make that cash
(Me and my homies)
There's no need to ask
(Me and my homies)
We are still the best

But ain't no motherfucker step to me and said ""Spice you a punk""
Cause you know I whup his motherfuckin' ass

[Chorus]
Niggas be muggin' me, Don't show no love for me
Don't playa hate me love tha thug in me
Now when I walk on by, niggas be muggin' me
Don't playa hate me love tha thug in me

Now if your hoe come knockin' at my door, she
Must want a thug ass nigga for sure 
Cause it's the young playa Spiz-ice and I be stacking my paper 
Twenty four motherfuckin' seven, a nigga havin' it major
Now we can do this like playas
Or we can hop into some gangsta shit
Niggas be tryin' to clown, when your bailin' with your bitch
I almost fell, gettin' up out the car but see 
I had to pistol whip the nigga because he knows who we are
We the niggas with the Lex's, Rolexes laced up with diamonds
Timer, Timer, Baller, Baller
She fucked with the shot caller now 
Didn't need no scrilla to get her, she want a thug nigga
Poppin' collars, and at the same time clockin' dollars
Real as they come I got soldiers ready to rob at night 
And when a nigga goes to your jar you don't attempt to fight
You playa hate daily, talkin' the shit on the ace 
But you a bitch 'cause you never talk the shit to my face

[Chorus: x2]

I put the pedal to the metal and uh jump the Chevy
Heavy in the game
But about four five different ghetto names
I can't be tamed I'm a G to my heart 
I can't be changed I've been breaking these niggas down from the start
I'm hearing shit up in the streets man, niggas is crazy
I've been serving them dope fiends on that block
Since you was babies
And the world is yours, nigga you can have it all
But if you talk bad on this G ass nigga you'll take a fall, blaow
How many hoes want a nigga that get his ass kicked 
Car took, whupped and jacked ain't got no get back
I ain't the type to let no nigga jack me
Baby we cool if they run up on the Caddy

[Chorus: x2]

I'm off the Hennessy, when it's me she's callin' right back
I'm up in the Benzo on the mobile spittin' the game off the yack
I'm strapped with two blacks, 'cause I ain't the baller
Who be out there slippin'
She understands niggas be playa hatin' so she ain't trippin'
Saggy pants G-braids but nigga still out to get paid
I'm keepin' my mind up on my money and all my money is made
Shadetree niggas be tryin' to get in my mix
Conflicts, forty caliber cliques when I be burying tricks
She seen me knock niggas out now I do walk bys
Now I put faulty ass niggas between them chalk lines
See everybody be lookin' when I be bailin', trailin' indo smoke
See it ain't nothing but the smooth sailin'
And now I kick back and enjoy my riches on a sunny day
But sucka ass niggas be all up in my way
You're secure don't you worry bout a thang
I got these two twin glocks and when they cocked this is what they say

Verse 1, Ice Cube:

Let's make it happen, nigga, fuck rappin I'm bellin
With three time felons, nigga, who you tellin?
Doug Lou Ellen that a fool sellin
Thirty-six ounces what that amounts is
A whole chicken finger licken is the rumor
Catch a tumor you say I'm dickin my consumer
Suede Puma's as I walk down Florence
With warrants that don't go to court in Torrance
Tonight I'm buzzin thought I wasn't
Mack 10 and W.C. is like my blood cousins
Eleven strikes from armed robbery to stolen bikes
A nigga likes your motherfuckin Nikes

I shift gears when I see tears
Fuck a record, fuck a movie
I rack my uzi
On boosy niggaz that pretend to be friend to me
We the dopest niggaz on Hennessy in the industry
I did a lick well
I'm in a thick cell
Gold teeth, two motors and pig tails
And when I hear Westside Connection
I get the fuckin erection

Chorus, W.C.:

So, fuck what you saying, fuck who you tellin
I'm only bellin with some three time felons

Cause a five year joke leave yo stack dented
Got my pockets back swollen 
Motorola holdin
A nigga got the whole hood rollin
BG's get you what you want when you need it
I got them little niggaz all posted up and heated
Hogs put it down nothing less than a fat knot
Niggaz callin Mack's spot
Jackpot, the crack spot
Got the double up bomb can't wait
So won't you bounce rock skate
To where the cluckers hibernate
Where we livin like stars switchin cars like they leases
Servin ten pieces to your aunties and nieces
While the loot keep me blasted from Inglewood to Venus
Tatted Westside Connection on my back in Old English
So, nigga, what you want to bet on a set full of vet lick hitters
And, ain't a crew that can get with us
It's west coast, the most, I be yellin

Fuck a peace treaty, it's on with all you niggaz
Cause ain't no contaning me when I'm ringing these motherfuckin heaters
Causing tragedy
Tearing off your whole chest cavity
Mobbing through the neighborhood, nigga, twenty inch bollters
Fresh house, shoes, hair, rollers
Lenny want to kill me cause I got 'em all scared of this
Cutthroat janky environmental terrorist
Stickering my tapes hoping that they can silence me
Cause I'm a nigga that's yellin fuck society
But ain't no stopping this westside click
So, tell that bitch Delores Tucker to suck a niggaz dick
Cause I'm punking mo niggaz than Deebo

What's the Connection bitch you looking at it

So many foe's walk in my ?

Chalk another one, homicidal in the G ride
I swear I'm killing every nigga standing outside

I'm smoking everybody nigga bitches and all
Stretch 'em out in broad daylight motherfuck the witnesses

I am getting dizzy as the world keeps spinnin like a Frisbee

No hesitation I can run a nation from incarceration
30 years is what I'm facing
But give me 7 seas and 11 gees
I make enough cheese to bring wall street to its knees
Nigga please I got enough guns
To fill the empire state building full of 1's
Go to school is what you tell us
But nigga's in school is scared of the Good fellas
We got the Yayo you can just say no
But nobody makes a fucking move until I say so
That's how it is and that's how it's gonna be
Kids when you grow up who the fuck you want to be?
Like me ya black superhero
Got enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro
Ya honor I'm have to get rid of ya
Because it ain't no trivia about my house in West Bolivia
Blew the jury a kiss they rather dismiss
Them swim the big fish
You fucking guppies!

Not just sagging waving my flag and never will I ease up nigga
So stop asking see I was taught as a tiny loc on the set its all
About the pussy and money fuck the rest nigga this tech is quicker
To collect when I'm seeking all the jewelry and the money so miss
Me with that preaching teaching fuck all that bullshit I want to
Slang yea like Noriaga sit back watch my paper collect like the

President & like the police I want a gang of killers all on my
Side that's down to lie more crooked that St. Ides rip ride on my
Behalf as I call shots as if I was Saddaam Hussein
Jacking mother- fuckers for Dana Danes hated by many bit I don't care because I
Rather be feared than loved with a pocket full of dubs because
Gangsta gangsta's make the world go round & if you want a piece
Then you best to be down so quit chastising me analzing me

Before big balling sex cars and loot
Its like bitches been scandalous biting forbidden fruit
But gangster's don't deal with that shit, on the Westside
And since they regulating hoes I roll with the Best side
So check it as my lifetime is ticking
Coming up strong  licking and flipping chickens
Need cheese in amounts of G's
I gave up sports to slang Key's
But blamed it on my Knees
Make sure I got what I need
To make your order
Everything to baggies triple beams to jugs for my water
Like a snitch life's a bitch a world full of drama
Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma
Trauma brings the sad song on your way to killer king nigga
So now I stand with heat in my hand for my whole life span
Cause evil lurks the land
Plus I got a packet with this gang-bang jacket
Gotta hold it keep it loaded devoted since quoted

Now understand the situation, it was urgent
We, handeled this emergency urgently
I can't just have no nigga out there just workin' me, jerkin' me
Talkin' all kind of shit, dishin dirt on me, shit
He was a local nigga sheisty and didn't want to pay up
So I got dressed in all black and loaded the K up
And all I could think about is revenge as I lit the J up
And even though it was late night, I still fucked his whole day up
It was child's play, the youngster took me for a joke
Not knowin' Mack a maniac and I love the gun smoke
Make sparks in my barrel, shit flew through his apparel
Stupid motherfucker lost his life over dinero

I'm a throwback, that know how a gangsta do it and a hoe' act
Get off tha dick if you don't want to blow dat
'cause bitches trip the Bulls, act like Prozac.
Now there's Gangsta-ism, and tribalism

Point nigga Mack 10 from the Dub S-see
Wit a L.A. fitted hat and a fresh white tee
Fulla flair and pizzazz but I'm a straight up G
Cocky 'cause I'm rich, look good and I know it
But I'm confused on what to be, a deep boy or poet
Head is mandatory, bitch, there's so much to blow it
If I do fall for you I refuse to show it
So if you think I ain't pimpin, Man that shit is absurd
I stay hard on 'em, fulla 'izm, fuck what chu heard
You say you down for me, shit but that's only words
want to show me love bitch, I want to play wit a bird
So regardless of the weather, bitch don't get the chedda'
And keep big daddy ridin' two-three's or betta
Wood on the dash wit the peanut-butta' leather
And like that Al Qaeda love we can blow up togetha', Holla...

Now feds and undies when the gummy thristy homies
Looking funny I converted the street like the rap money
And now is all about the benjis and with this pen
Like pussy I pimp this lyrics like pimping cane
Leaning in my cadillac
Buffing on a De la Hoya checking ? for neighboors and high power lawyers

Homie, the same thing make you laugh, make you cry
And in the fastlane the strong survive and the weak die
That's the way the ball bounce and I often wonder why
But I nease it all
And not just a piece o' the pie
I used to hope and wish for everything I couldn't buy
was a young ghetto-boy that grew up in the eye
So I bowed to be a hustler and reach for the sky
And not only I'ma ballin'
Right now is mo' ta'

It's like a jungle sometime

You gotta use your mind, mouth and your muscle sometime

In the city o' looks
No hope or rolemodels
The black sheep of the family destined to fell
Predicted to spend my whole life in a jail-cell
Fucked up and not believe in the hype
I know I would be more then a feelin
I zoomed up and see the light
Nigga, got my mind right
Nigga, got my grind tight
Now a nigga is gettin' paid to skip
Skip to the lime-light

[Mack 10]
See, we all got problems
But some need a dress
And so at night I hit my knees and begged him for my blessings
And ask him for forgiveness to minimize my stress
Nigga, continue to know how to dodge this Smith & Wesson
And with his help I will perform in my best
And it's still hard with all this temptation and testenin'
If I'm wrong
Just accept it as a lesson
As I conquer all my enemies
And mashing with aggression, Lord

Don't forgive what's so femmé

I pull out the semi
Put hoe's up in Timmy
Just fuck it - it's Babylon
And nigga might have a bomb
Just like the Taliban
But I'm on neverland

I sit alone I my fo'corner room
Loaded ammo
'cause' in these streets like there's a gamble
And Run-DMC, times is getting harder
So I'm taking of my gold-fandenellin' to the author

But when you got it
Only few homies stay true
This game it's like russian roulette
We hustle to death
Mash for weather
Make the devil marker for cheddar

I don't hurt ya
It will only make you stronger
In this game you gotta have heart
This hustle will break you down
Pull you apart

Every time we hit the block and get are roll on
She be fully hooked up, Turning heads and necks
Mo niggaz and latinos on her then county checks
Especially when the relatives and cousins come around
Paparazzi get to popping its a buzz around town
The downiest bitch I every had
Niggaz call her hot motherfucker, I call her fifty-seven rag
We be swanging city to city, off the sticky icky
Drinking dark coming through slow motion at the park
thirteen's feet on deck, ass so wide
watch her front back and side to side
Like Uh

And a gang of bitches in her family
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty-three, sixty-four
Niggaz be pimping paying like hoes
A dime piece with switches, fully stacked in the romp
She a stallion, she hit the block with pumps
In all the beauty contest, she keep stealing
The way she be seesawing pancaking and three wheeling
Some like her with a candy, some with a pearl
Me I like her longer with a five twenty swirl
Im a ghetto rich nigga so I stay dropping cash
She high maintance I be gorilla hopping her ass
Like an erection I make her stand up
When a gang of niggaz whistling throwing they hands up
Fuck the american dream, its the ghetto nigga dream
So street niggaz hit the switch and sing the ghetto theme

Where my gat at nigga tripping off my bulls hat
About to let loose with the chrome tray dude 5 shots

But if you're biten this you better bring a dentist
Cause sucking these balls ah give yo ass lock jaws

Which way shall I go nigga what should I do
Should I bang with the red should I truce with the blue
Should I rock dope beats grab the mic and stay down
Or should I shoot out of town and flip this pound

I just had a scrap for the neighborhood Inglewood stereotype
Got to deal with the hype
Known to kick back with the fat sack f*** that
Where my gat at n**** trippin' off my bulls hat
About to let loose with the chrome tray dude 5 shots
And I put holes in yo bandanna
I push a Benz you still rollin' Gs
So n**** miss me with the set trip 
And start slangin' keys

[Ice Cube]
When I say itchy citchy
N****s get b****y b****y cause they heard of ah
Natural born murderer
I'm like Frankenstein is spankin' time
Layin' in the sunshine
With only one nine
Now who wants to bust with the never rust
Goin' platinum plus every time I cuss
So f*** the whole world black n****s
Better hope I don't grow my jeri curl back

Steper murderer stepin' out a Chevrolet
Sportin' a beenie like Marvin Gaye
Stalkin' walkin' in my big black chuck's
Standin' t'all in your freestyle session holdin' my balls
I'm peepin' game like a ref in '95
'Cause n****s be foul and bitten other n****s styles
But if you're bitten this you better bring a dentist
'Cause sucking these balls ah give yo a** lock jaws

[Mack 10]
Which way shall I go n**** what should I do
Should I bang with the red should I truce with the blue
Should I rock dope beats grab the mic and stay down
Or should I shoot out of town and flip this pound
S*** I never knew that my nuts ah get bigger
Checkin' major figures I'm hangin' with platinum n****s
It's Mack 10 and I'm Inglewood swangin'

F*** one love it's the bloody glove killin' honkey hoes
Leaving blood stains on Broncos

Jumpin' over chairs as I run through the airport
So I can catch a flight away from the drama
Number 32 chillin' in the Bahamas

Sucka ducks play the back

Check all my traps and dodge the fed co
I'm all about the mix like a f***in collage
And out the garage, is a Bentley Onage
With the brains blowed out, so the sun's beamin
I got the jackers drooling, and the hoes fiendin'
And since I'm West-side Connected got the streets on hype
I got big deals, big skrill, big wheels, big pipes

Twenty-inchers roll - go and get these hoes
Picky hoes want to roll with my n****roles
But be a freak about it, and I'ma see about it
Speak about it, no b**** I'ma be about it
Who want some of this, West running this

She's a dummy b**** - with a money pit?

Six-double-0-west n**** selling rich are you-bellin'

In front of the club and valet, do for talk and mack 'em trick

What is it like, tossin' them hoes?
And rollin' them fools on them vogues
Flossin' them chains, we doin' big things
And bustin' on punks at close range

Sit back and watch as it unfolds
B****es and suckers stunt so cold
This is the life we chose

Dope money and rapping s*** I'm all with it
And all I know is the street so that's how I spit it
Chicken-hawk see a bird, then I gotta get it
So if ya hood come up short, then I probably did it
And if lil' momma thick then I gotta hit it
The Trojan gotta be a magnum for me to fit it
If it was sherm on a stick then I probably lit it
The red beam is on your wig so I probably split it

To all them b****es that think they bootylicious
I think they nutritious - I think they do dishes
I'm makin' three wishes, or takin' they pictures
And spendin' they riches and f***in' they b****es
Ego maniac - little homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an a**hole and it ain't an act
So take a hit of that - and remember that
Where my motherf***in n****s and my b****es at?

Tree-i-ick! I'm Dub-see, the rider with the clique
And like a dragon it's nathin' but fire when I spit
And I can't shake these ghetto ways
A street rich n**** eatin' a bag of Lays
And rubber bands and braids
From the turf for the side, rings an ambulance
Where we keep the pistols smoking just like Afghanistan
It's gangsta the killa - the dope dealer
Back for mo' figgas - so trick bow down and po' the liquor b****

Gangsta's and girls make the world twirl
No hesitation I can run a nation from incarceration
30 years is what I'm facing
But give me 7 seas and 11 gees
I make enough cheese to bring wall street to its knees
Nigga please I got enough guns
To fill the empire state building full of 1's
Go to school is what you tell us
But nigga's in school is scared of the Good fellas
We got the Yayo you can just say no
But nobody makes a fucking move until I say so
That's how it is and that's how it's gonna be
Kids when you grow up who the fuck you want to be?
Like me ya black superhero
Got enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro
Ya honor I'm have to get rid of ya
Because it ain't no trivia about my house in West Bolivia

Its like bitches been scandalous biting forbidden fruit
But gangster's don't deal with that shit, on the Westside
And since they regulating hoes I roll with the Best side
So check it as my lifetime is ticking
Coming up strong  licking and flipping chickens
Need cheese in amounts of G's
I gave up sports to slang Key's
But blamed it on my Knees
Make sure I got what I need

Everything to baggies triple beams to jugs for my water
Like a snitch life's a bitch a world full of drama
Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma
Trauma brings the sad song on your way to killer king nigga
So now I stand with heat in my hand for my whole life span

There must be someone out there 
Behind the door to somewhere 
Waiting for me when I cross over 
There must be light at the end 
Sunsets on a warm horizon 
There must be someone out there for me

Westworld,"Once he loved her 
Once he could 
See her as a flower 
The days would rise 
And set in her eyes 
A sweetness he'd devour 
Slowly it took him over 
Seeds from the dark side 
Planted when just a boy 
Grew wild inside him now 

The skin between your heart and mine
Like sun to moon and earth to sky
And brains are washed in glossy lies 
'Til beautiful means perfect in our minds 

Hated himself 
All his life 
Couldn't own his blessings 
He pushed aside 
Every ray of light 
That photographed him shining 
Slowly he wanted more 
Than she could ever give 
With her he fantasized 
About a movie star 

The skin between your heart and mine
Like sun to moon and earth to sky
And brains are washed in glossy lies 
'Til beautiful means perfect in our minds 

I like the way you move in the sun inside your room
I like the way you move in the sun inside your room
When the sun, it kisses your skin
And makes me crazy while you're in
I can't see you big at all
Suck your life, oh yeah

Slowly he went too far; flame to the fire
His breath curling all the pages of a magazine 

The skin between your heart and mine
Like sun to moon and earth to sky
And brains are washed in glossy lies 
'Til beautiful means perfect
The skin between your heart and mine
Like sun to moon and earth to sky
And brains are washed in glossy lies

Oh no! Here it comes again
Can't remember when
We came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past
It always seems to come again
Again and again
Again and again, again oh

Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us
From the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm
Sail across the sea of light

Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night
Holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell

Bloody angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows shining ever-bright

Neon Knight!
Neon Knights!
Alright!

Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us
From the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm
Sail across the sea of light
Again and again
Again and again and again
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All night!

Take a look into my life it's messed up
My sister's on that dope man she stayed geeked up
My baby mamma screamin she don't want me to die
Got tears in her eye
But I just wonder why
'cause if I gots to die I gots to go, I ain't scared
With one up in my chest but two to my head
But don't kill my son because my son is all I got
And there's a very reason why the brothers slang rocks
My mutha wants to know why our son sells crack
I tell her (?) to put clothes on my back
And I don't give a fuck because the thug is in my blood
A there's a reason why I give my neighbor so much luv
My sister always screamin ""Real boy you needs to chill""
But she don't understand I gots to play my bill
My girl works a job that pays 5 a fuckin hour 
We needed more a dollars so I started slangin powder
I used to see my homies on the block gettin money
It just start (?) and shit and I was lookin bummy
But hey I ain't no dumby nigga I knew somethin was wrong
(?) my nigga to sit there, you couldn't pay (?)
He taught me to run this game and how to make a quick cash
He gave me what I need shiiit four and a half
A (?) and a do' just to get the truck crunk
I started drinkin gin and started smokin blunts
A .9 millimeter was the gun that I packed
But For-ty years-old and now on the gat

And when them hoes see me they be straight holla real
When I don't get ahigh-five I just throw up that peace sign
And go bout my bizness tryin to stay down for mine
'cause some of these hoes they be actin like they nice'n
Fool you take it back and quit your bitches turn trifflin'
Try to set a nigga'up, death for his meals
And don't give a damn about a slayer gettin killed
And see you wit your Dallas so they figure that you're on
And when they get their partnas quick to invate your home
But not a thang to me I stay strapped with my heat

There she's sitting in that room

Then she walked 'cross the street
Could she feel there's a heat
From my heart as it beats with her love
In her eyes other guys
See the fair that is there
But she might never
She might never know

And I was sitting lonely in my house,
Wanting to tell her,
Wanting to call,
And say I know I let you down,
Without thinking,
His love might fall
No more hurting,
No more clowning,
This emotion
Isn't drowning,
And if the river's gonna save our true love after all, after all, well

I'm chewing on my nails again
With my home across the street
Ain't got no place to turn to now
While you're cooking for that creep, well

What's the answer to this pain
I wanna get back to her love again
There she's sitting in that room

When she walked 'cross the street
Could she feel there's a heat
From my heart as it beats with her love
In her eyes other guys
See the fair that is there
But she might never know

As I turned so she waved
This was all that she gave
So what was there to trade in love
Just a past that was cast
In the groove of the move
That she might never know
She might never
She might never know",She's All on My Mind,1995

It's my verse, you can take it just how I give it
But for some reason you ain't feeling the realest, stay out my business
I ain't never kidding, I don't spit a bar just to spit it
If I ever rap a track about something it's cause I did it
But why'all still won't listen, they don't want us on this surface
Why'all want to keep us underground, they pass us up on purpose
But it ain't gone work, why'all can't converse with us
No one cares about the magazine articles in the gutter
What why'all thought we was, some little punks or something similar
We breaking all the rules like they was shot up with the cylinders

Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Wettling,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,1994

Wettling,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland

Wetton Manzanera,"From that open mouth
Through those burning teeth
By that lashing tongue
You have the power of speech

Vibrating air
From lungs that are pumping
Sets those vocal discords
That sets your heart jumping

Got a bright green light
Flashing in my face
Instead of someone's eyes
I get a visual display

Used to be flesh and blood
Right in front of me
Now a picture comes up
On a video screen

Don't you know it's not right
To remain in this silence

I want you to talk to me

Won't you talk to me?

Won't you talk to me?

An automate on, drive a GTI
Keep your shield intact, down reality
You're in another world, you don't listen to me

You're a rhythm machine
You've got perfect time
Recline your seat
And you'll turn on a dime

Robotic voice, aluminum frame
I'm so glad that you asked
Yes, I'm glad that I came

Another vacation is over
A September morning,
With the sun and the smell of the clover

Down by the gate
We sit and we watch all our friends go by
And pretend we don't hear the bell,
That rings through the summer sky.

I was happy with the kiss that she gave me,
It's just that happy was all she made me
Happy that was
Until I saw you

Heart beat, heart beat,
Why do you fail me now?
You hurt me, desert me,
In my darkest hour
Heartbeat, heartbeat,
Why do you keep me here?
How could I help but admire her beauty?
Standing on the line between desire and duty
Heartbeat, heartbeat
It will end in tears

I need a lover,
But love's such a dangerous place to be
Oh, if we were meant for each other,
Then why won't you answer me?

Don't keep me waiting,
You know that I long to be by your side
We could even be together,
Tonight

I was happy with the kiss that she gave me
But now there's nothing on Earth to save me
Why should I care?
I can't have you

Heart beat, heart beat,
Why do you fail me now?
You hurt me, desert me,
In my darkest hour
Heartbeat, heartbeat,
Why do you keep me here?
How could I help but admire her beauty?

Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico

There it goes again, the slamming of the door
Sometimes the river calls me
And at night it calls my name
Says ""put your troubles down beside me""

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year,
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Special, someone, someone
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

Who'll give me something in return
I'll give it to someone, hold my heart and watch it burn

I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

How can love be for a day?
I thought you were someone special, gave you my heart

Wham!,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know your not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know your not a fool

I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know your not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

What Made Milwaukee Famous,"ThereÂ´s some things I donÂ´t have now
Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
DonÂ´t answer the question of what I am to you",For the Birds,2008

But he's the one I want to lay my head upon his shoulder 

And keep it warm cause it's just about to get colder 

But I said I wouldn't see him, nor would I touch him 

He says he misses much and pursue per sound to suction 

through the phone, I try to hit the dialtone to clear the mess up 

or fess up, and say I'll be there soon just clear your rest up 

I can't dismiss it, no matter how much I just can't resist it

or it can blow up, other kissings affect like anisthetic 

It's never as good as the first time and you never do forget it 

Feeling pathetic, but I quote it like someone said it 

If you really love it then you should just let it, go..

I leave my lifecourse to the greater knowledge of the creator 

And if it's time to go, I won't hold back, I'll just let it, go.. 

Let it flow, if it's meant to come back then it shall do so

One night we stood in front of Homebase 

watched the club file out 

Mad people started runnin, that was the end of fun and 

one nigga stand in be	-boy stance, holdin his gun and 

started shootin, pollutin the curbside with shells 

Yellin buggin out cause someone stepped on his Gazelles 

or Asics, whatever it was, money's beef was basic 

It's tragic the way people takin anger and misplace it 

Now, mad are my peoples wearin scars and stitches 

cause niggaz choose to play the role of actin like bitches 

Don't take it hard, if it's not you, act like you know 

And all that unnecessary shit, just let it, go.. 



Let it go, let it flow 

Move on with your life and act like you know 

Been on my last breathe, been between life and death 

but I gotta let it go, can't deal with the stress 

I let it, go.. let it go, let it flow 

Move on with your life and act like you know 

Been on my last breathe, been between life and death 

but I gotta let it go, can't deal with the stress",Let It Go,1999
What What,"Woke up at 7:30 early in the morning last week 
Sun shining in my face, I wiped away the sleep 
From my eyes, from the beginning, oh shit, what do you know 
Two guys standin' with guns at my bedroom window 
I played it cool, peeped the tools they carried in they hand 
Two three-fifty-seven Mags and one on the bed stand 
I had my, piece under the pillow cause that's just how I do 
Started to reach for it, but then I guess they knew 
One nigga started laughin' and turned to his man 
He said, ""I don't think that she knows about this plan"" 
His man, just smiled, and nodded his head 
Aimed his gun at me and said, ""Get out of the bed"" 
I complied, with his wishes, bent down, to grab my slippers 
Nigga number one said, ""Hey now, no funny business 
Just, do what we say and everything'll be cool 
You'll hear a lot of things today but that's the number one rule"" 
I said, ""What the fuck is this shit, all about? 
We can discuss the problem and y'all, can break the fuck out"" 
Nigga number one said, ""That we not able to do 
But there's a tape deck on your table with a message for you"" 
It said: follow niggaz one and two's instructions carefully 
Or fucked up things will happen if you dare to be 
A heroine, these orders come straight from 
The President, of the American, People 
Then the tape just stopped, I looked at my watch 
Niggaz one and two had they guns up cocked 
And said, ""It's time to go, grab your things and get ready 
In thirteen minutes we all gotta be jetti, c'mon.."" 

Sitting in the, back of a van, with cuffs on my hands 
Six secret service men in black, one nigga in tan 
Who's driving? For three hours, we've been riding to 
Route 33, to a very small island and unloaded 
Niggaz one and, two at my side 
Number one glaring at me for the whole damn ride 
They seem to, travel in silence, express themselves in violence 
And I'm the target, shoving me back and forth 
With very very big guns 
What would you do in this situation? 
No place to run in the remote location 
Kept my patience, and stuck to the tape's advice 
Knew my crew could find me with the Negro Tracking Device 
I wasn't worried, but niggaz one and, two hurried 
They stepped, to the door, where the President was kept 
Punched in a passcode, I watched the door slide open inside 
Stood there we, and the President arose 
And my people said, ""Drop the guns, hop in your van 
Get the fuck off the island or we cappin your man"" 
The secret service men ran, what could they do? 
There's a lesson - never ever fuck with me and my crew 
Check it

What What AKA Jean Grae,"Got subjects locked in my cerebral cortex
On Ampex tape I'm circulating like a vortex
Check out my techs that use a synonym as inspect
Mentally badgering emcees with my dialect
When I inject memory cell motors retrospect
To recollect; too genuine skills I resurrect
Directed live from the 2-1-2, 7-1-8, and 5-1-6 area
Throughout borough to borough, state to state, world thorough wide
I ride, driving mass tracks to genocide
Verbal defender, the brain infiltrator
Break and fracture a sucka emcee's ""structal"" delegator
The pen and the pad and the microphone get blessed
With Nest, with ease now how I digress
Brothers are getting busy grabbing Teks while I apex
Verbal backshots coming without the latex
Watch the caption spin as the wax begin
How I'm rapping in to hit the backspin
Now end first verse in the blend
Herbalise to Resource done done it again

Chorus (2x)
One of the three the Natural R-e to the source
In the b-l-e-n-d
City to city (state to state)

NYC to worldwide rock thorough

Sides to kicks
Chops to sticks
Seas to sicks

Chest to Vicks
Corruption to politics
Sticks to stones
Stones to sticks
Not opposites flips
Cheese to cakes
Beefs to steaks
Bones to breaks
Decks to tapes
Good food to plates
Movies to dates
Cities to states
Odes to papes
Shaking MCs off their mics like earth to quakes
And now the hand of fate dealt me the higher intellect
Connect verbs, dissect words down to lecterns
W serves as the first repetition
H lines and curves take second position
A plays the third
The fourth brings the T
So hit two times so you get ummmmmmm
One of the three Natural R-e to the source
In the b-l-e-n-d

Chorus (2x)

My verbal attacks react to mental stimulation
I'm leaving gaping contusions caused by lyrical abrasion
No pausing, no waiting
I play the plus and starting to get in, shining like the sun
Lyrical patterns double up on the one
Like the name when expose the flame
I combust like aerosol or kerosene contained
Deaf ears turn the conversation severed
I set it off like Lateef and getting
Debted, forget it, it only happens because you let it
I move, swift tongue sliced crews beheaded
I said it again so let the repetition end

Forever pressures me
now I want to be
Wrapped in rhythm soul space and

Tempted when I get tempted to lie

There was a time I felt
The morning sun rose up for you
I would have whispered in your ear
I would make coffee for you
I would have crossed that line
I could have drawn it for you
Tell me that everything is fine
Couldn't you do that for me now?

Because I'm a fan
From way back when you faltered
Waiting for your man
If you can remember
I was standing there with you

Wouldn't you say
That I've been an idiot for you?
I couldn't shake you if I tried
I light a candle for you
Somehow the time flies by
And I haven't done it for you
And I haven't solved a single thing

I want the house, the house is a mess
If I knock your lights out, would you feel out of place?

Wheatus,"Just tell me his name
Just tell me you didn't get laid on our bedroom
And was it the same
Just tell me if his dick is bigger than mine
Do you remember the way it was when I was home
Before I left you all alone

I want to be eighty on the porch drinking lemonade with you
And its all that I can think about
Since you told me that you cheated
Eighty on the porch drinking lemonade with you
And its all that I can think about
Since you told me that you cheated on me

I knew that you would
I knew coz you told me in front of your family
And I did the same
So I guess that I should take half of the blame
Do you remember the way it was for us
Before all of the blow jobs on the bus
I want to be eighty on the porch drinking lemonade with you

And its all that I can think about
Since you told me that you cheated
Eighty on the porch drinking lemonade with you
And its all that I can think about
Since you told me that you cheated
Told me that you cheated on me
What should I care about a number
What should it matter to me
But are you out of love with no one
And now I know the end is here
Coz you replaced me

Just tell me his name
Just tell me you didn't get laid in our bedroom
Just tell me his name
Just tell me if his dick is bigger than mine
Just tell me his name
Just tell me you didn't get laid in our bedroom
Just tell me his name

For twin towers to hide behind,
And find you there.
When I left on that Sunday,
To come home on a Tuesday,
Well I never,
I never thought I'd have to see and watch the world explode

And I swear it was beautiful, before they sent those aeroplanes,
And I thought I would show it to you, just like my dad did
Hometown come tumbling down

When she came on a Friday,
I took her home the long way,
So she could see.
And she asked how they made it, and would they ever change it,
I said no way.
It's half of what you see, you none of what you hear believe.
And I told her that they remind me of Motown 60 Skinny ties,
What they thought the future looked like, where the Jetsons lived.
Hometown come tumbling down.

And watched it and we cried,
And we ran to the front line,
And some came home.
But I stay off the express-way,
Nothing to see there anyway,
That view sucks now.
There was I time the Brooklyn traffic couldn't get me down.

And I swear it was beautiful,
I hope they build them tall again,
Until then your imagination is all that you will have...",Hometown,2005

And as I drove I remembered that you made a tape
For me to play if I ever had a lonely day
I slipped it in and the Stereophonics came on singing about matches
Well at least someone still believes in the melody
I, I think that I've heard it already but I
I think that I must admit that as bad as it gets
Someone still believes

These pop songs are meant to be simple so people who make them we take them and break them in half
But as I drove I remembered that you made a tape
For me to play if I my ears were ever being raped
