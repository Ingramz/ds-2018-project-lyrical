Monty Python,"The most interesting thing about King Charles the First,
Is that he was 5'6"" at the start of his reign,
But only 4'8"" tall at the end of it.

Because of

Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England (Puritan)
Born in 1599, died in 1658 (September).
Was at first (only) MP for Huntingdon (but then)
He led the Iron Side Cavalry at Marston Moor in 1644 and won.
Then he founded the New Model Army, and praise be, beat the Cavaliers at Naseby.
And the King fled up North, like an axe, to the Scots.

But under the terms of John Pimms' 'Solomn League and Covenant',
The Scots handed King Charles I over to

Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England (and his warts)
Born in 1599, died in 1658 (September)
But, alas (Oi Vay!), disagreement then broke out (between)
The Presbyterian Parliament and the military
Who meant to have an independent bent and so,
The second civil war broke out and the round head ranks
Faced the cavaliers at Preston, Lancs.,
And the King lost again, silly thing (stupid King).

And Cromwell sent Colonel Pride
To purge the House of Commons of the Presbyterian Royalists,
Leaving behind only the Rump Parliament

Which appointed a High Court at Westminster Hall
To indict Charles I for Tyranny (gasp).
Charles was sentenced to death
Even though he refused to accept that the court had
Jurisdiction (say goodbye to his head).
Poor King Charles laid his head on the block (January 1649)
Down came the axe and

In the silence that followed,
The only sound that could be heard was a solitary giggle from.

Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England (Ole)
Born in 1599, died in 1658 (September)
Then he smashed (Ireland), set up the Commonwealth (and more!).
He crushed the Scots at Worcester, and beat the Dutch at sea in 1653, and then

He dissolved the Rump Parliament,
And with Lambert's consent wrote the instrument of Government
Under which Oliver was Protector at last, The End!",Oliver Cromwell,1989
Monty Python,"Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis
Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong
It's swell to have a stiffy
It's divine to own a dick
From the tiniest little tadger
To the world's biggest prick
So, three cheers for your Willy or John Thomas
Hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake
Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend
Your Percy, or your cock
You can wrap it up in ribbons
You can slip it in your sock
But don't take it out in public
Or they will stick you in the dock
And you won't come about",Penis Song (Not the Noel Coward Song),1989

Monty Python,"A one, two
A one, two, three, four

Half a bee, philosophically
Must, ipso facto, half not be
But half the bee has got to be
A vis-a-vis its entity, d'you see?

But can a bee be said to be
Or not to be an entire bee
When half the bee is not a bee
Due to some ancient injury?

No! It's Eric, the half a bee

Hoh hoh hoh, tee hee hee

I love this hive, employee
Bisected accidentally
One summer afternoon, by me
I love him carnally

He loves him carnally
Semi-carnally

No, semi-carnally

Monty Python,"We're Knights of the Round Table, 
We dance when ere we're able, 
We do routines and chorus scenes 
With footwork impeccable.
We dine well here in Camelot, 
We eat ham and jam and spam a lot. 
We're Knights of the Round Table, 
Our shows are formidable, But many times, we're given rhymes 
That are quite unsingable. 
We're Opera mad in Camelot,
We sing from the diaphragma looooooot. 
In war we're tough and able, 
Quite indefatigable, 
Between our quests we sequin vests, 
And impersonate Clark Gable. 
It's a busy life in Camelot, 
I have to push the pram a lot.
",Knights of the Round Table,1989
Monty Python,"It's Christmas in Heaven. 
All the children sing. 
It's Christmas in Heaven. 
Hark. Hark. Those church bells ring.

It's Christmas in Heaven. 
The snow falls from the sky, 
But it's nice and warm, and everyone 
Looks smart and wears a tie.

It's Christmas in Heaven. 
There's great films on TV: 
'The Sound of Music' twice an hour 
And 'Jaws' One, Two, and Three.

There's gifts for all the family. 
There's toiletries and trains. 
THREE WISE MEN: 
There's Sony Walkman Headphone sets 
And the latest video games.
 
It's Christmas! It's Christmas in Heaven! 
Hip hip hip hip hip hooray! 
Every single day 
Is Christmas day!

It's Christmas! It's Christmas in Heaven! 
Hip hip hip hip hip hooray! 
Every single day

Monty Python,"Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown,
And things seem hard or tough,
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,

And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough,

Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at 900 miles an hour.
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
The sun that is the source of all our power.
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
Are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,
We go 'round every two hundred million years;
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.

Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,
In all of the directions it can whiz;
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is.
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
How amazingly unlikely is your birth;
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space,
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth!",Galaxy Song,1991
Monty Python,"I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK
I sleep all night and I work all day.

He's a lumberjack and he's OK

I cut down trees, I eat my lunch
I go to the lavatory.
On Wednesdays I go shopping and have buttered scones for tea

He go to the lavatory.
On Wednesdays he go shopping and has buttered scones for tea.

I cut down trees, I skip and jump
I like to press wild flowers.
I put on women's clothing and hang around in bars.

He cuts down trees, he skips and jumps
He likes to press wild flowers.
He puts on women's clothing and hangs around in bars.

He's a lumberjack and he's OK
He sleeps all night and he works all day.

I cut down trees, I wear high heels
Suspendies and a bra.
I wish I'd been a girlie, just like my dear pappa.

Suspendies...and a bra?

Monty Python,"Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best
And

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
And

Always look on the bright side of life
(Come on)
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So always look on the bright side of death
A just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughin' as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
And

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life
(C'mon Brian, cheer up)
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

(Worse things happen at sea you know)

Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose?
You know, you come from nothing
You're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing

Always look on the right side of life

Nothing will come from nothing, ya know what they say
Cheer up ya old bugga c'mon give us a grin (Always look on the right side of life)
There ya are, see
It's the end of the film
Incidentally this record's available in the foyer (Always look on the right side of life)

Some of us got to live as well, you know
(Always look on the right side of life)
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
(Always look on the right side of life)
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to him, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1954
Monty Sunshine,"Stillness in the grove
Not a rustling sound
Softly shines the moon clear and bright
Dear, if you could know
How I treasure so
This most beautiful Moscow Night
Lazily the brook like a silvery stream
Ripples in the light of the moon
And a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Yes a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Dearest, why so sad, why the downcast eyes
And your lovely head bent so low
Oh, I mustn’t speak, though I’d love to say
That you’ve stolen my heart away
Promise me my love, as the dawn appears
And the darkness turns into light
That you’ll cherish dear, through the passing years
This most beautiful Moscow Night
Say you’ll cherish dear through the passing years
This most beautiful Moscow Night",Midnight in Moscow,1994
Monty Sunshine,"Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu
When the clouds roll by, I'll come to you
Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in lovers lane, my deary

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Every tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

Till we meet again
Down in lover's lane
Wait and pray each night for me",Till We Meet Again,1997
Monty Sunshine,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Where I keep my stacks
Deep in the study where my nerve endings react
There ain't no stoppin me
My feelings and thoughts I have monopolies
Magnetic fields and fields of dreams is my property
Poor people who are stupid die quickly
I'm a millionaire that's carrying all my assets with me

Mood II Swing,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
""Life is around you and in you""

With an outlook that is rotten
And an attitude to match it
Finds relief inside a hatchet
And he halved someone in Boulder
Justifiability is in the hands of the beholder
And you just don't know what people will do next

Mountains of pain,
Valleys of love,
Death without life,
And life without meaning

To the promise kept and broken
To the love that's never spoken
Just as surely as I'm in your ears
A dark figure slips from out of the shadow",Zen Archer,1978

Round here, there's nothing but thug niggas
Down here, nothing but hard heads
Round here, nothing but straight killas down here
And if you really want to know

[Magic]
I'm from the city of the wickedest, cut throat connivers
We keeps it gutter, till the day that we die
We roam the streets at dark, all we got to survive
Is our hands and our heart, our balls and our word
Just for sitting in my hood, I be screaming until I'm horse
You ever touch one of mine, I'm coming for you and yours
If you ain't got to jack in the murder, you ain't shit
When you hear the blacka-blacka, you know somebody got hit
Hope it ain't none of mine, and if it's mine
I be coming to get you die trying, survival of the fittest
We the sickest no disrespect, but these boys got heart
It could be the dope, but these boys play the part
Murder capital, just a couple years back
In my city, itching to put us right back on the map
When you hear the click-clack, you know it's time to smash
Playa in chest-tolic, catch a bullet in the ass

[Hook - 2x]

[Magic]
I still hustled the block, I keep on cock the 17 shots
I'm a 9th Ward nigga, so I can't be stopped
Fill a X fill a boy, whatever get us high
With money on my mind, so somebody bound to die
Be careful what you say, cause if my people feel played
You bound to get sprayed, hole in your fade
I'm in between your braids, we love cracking domes
We love car jacking, and breaking in people homes
Love concealing weapons, illegal firearms
I'm a felon, ain't no papers on this pistol in my palm
Suicidal, murder mo' common than crawfish
Nigga die, we second line ain't that a (bi-ay-itch)
Nigga got your number, no need to wonder
Who put, lil' whodi under
Crooked ass police force, them the biggest dope dealers
New Orleans made us killas my nigga, you got to feel us

[Hook - 2x]

This for my thug and thugettes, niggas in the ghet's
Throw up your hood nigga, represent your set

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
Look come on, come on, keep it real
No other nigga gon thug like me
Tear up a club like me, whack a nigga for free
Beat down the police, spit in the judge face
Slap a mo'fucker if he get out of place
Down here, what",Down Here,2006
Mookie Jones,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

When it seems like nothing but dark clouds
Are raining in on your bright, sunny day
Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain
You should be thankful, everyday
should be a celebration of life.",Da Rain,2006
Moon,"The last that ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Lost in a river last Saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

I see you in heaven far away

Vaughn Monroe 

Peak Billboard position # 1 in 1949
Monroe may not have sung it precisely this way  but a recording by him was not 
available so the words and music herein are taken from the sheet music as written 
by Stan Jones 
Monroes' version, as well as competing versions by Peggy Lee (# 2), Bing Crosby 
(#14), and Burl Ives (# 21) were all charted as just ""Riders In the Sky""
Later, The Ramrods took it to # 30 in 1961 with the parenthetical (Ghost) added, 
as did the Baja Marimba Band (#52 in 1966) and The Outlaws (#31 in 1981)
Lawrence Welk used the original title on his # 87 in 1961.


An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range""
""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""
""A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies.""

Vaughn Monroe 

Peak Billboard position # 1 in 1949
Monroe may not have sung it precisely this way  but a recording by him was not 
available so the words and music herein are taken from the sheet music as written 
by Stan Jones 
Monroes' version, as well as competing versions by Peggy Lee (# 2), Bing Crosby 
(#14), and Burl Ives (# 21) were all charted as just ""Riders In the Sky""
Later, The Ramrods took it to # 30 in 1961 with the parenthetical (Ghost) added, 
as did the Baja Marimba Band (#52 in 1966) and The Outlaws (#31 in 1981)
Lawrence Welk used the original title on his # 87 in 1961.


An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range""
""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""
""A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies.""

Moonflowers,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

So I lit a fire

Moongaï,"There's a season for the kings to leave
We're watching, watching
The revolution, those screams
Time is running, running
The revolution, those screams
And we're waiting, waiting

Is it the very end of something
Or is it just the beginning

Bitches at the front door
I got power, go to war
Leave me money, soldiers so I'll lay'em down, kill the poor
Tyrants want the greedy whore
Shake'em down, gimme more
The rich they paid protection plays the underscore
Give me yours
Grab onto the screams and wars
The private lives are at the core
Visions soar in my mind
All seeing I was blind
Blocking out the sunshine
Eternally, we be fine, globally
We decline anytime we mistreat
Murder everywhere we turn
Birth of a nation
Slaves on plantations
Traps keep us facin'
Distracted, rat-racin'
Poisonous, we taste it
Uncover truth let's face it

I'll be in the basement
Rallying for placement
Changing lives is basic
The future's now don't waste it
Get up off the matrix

(Oh oh oh oh)
Is it the last time, we talk together
The last time, we watch each other

To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson
You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson
Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions
To fall into seduction while playing a temptation
I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last
The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas
Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside
Stress brings me pain, I gotta hold my pride
When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide
Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives
You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her
I found myself in a blur
Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

You know the feelings start nature take it's course
Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce

With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future
Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right

It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug
One heart, one mind, one soul

Keep your money, she make her own cheddar
All she want from me is respect like Aretha
Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter
Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November
Have you seen her?
I think I did
But what I did wrong was take a love for granted
Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust
Easier said than done, I lust and I must

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

I figured it out all I need is a car to be so strong

Mama said, ""Oh, dear baby don't leave me""

Now I cruise on the high road to China
Got girls lined up way back to Ohio
Slicked back hair with pomade that just won't stop

And he said, ""Ahh shucks""

I wrecked that car on the night of my very first prom
Betty Lou got out and walked, in short, she was gone
So here I sit on this heap of a Buick
Best girl gone, oh I just knew it

[English translation:]

[WARRIOR'S GRAVE]

Amongst such ravage he arrived,
To a village once so calm.
Rooftops glowing the colours of flame
And the blood of the beloved on the ground.

Such anger did it raise to echo through all skies.
To beyond so many may have travelled
But not yet they were to take him along.

'though gathering his forces from those nearly defeated,
Alone it was his rage that shook the cruel enemy.
Hundreds of corpses he trampled underfoot,
His axe on their necks as a display of mercy.

""Blades of your swords shall be set free,
Iron so cold shall now redden!
Grant them a glimpse of your hatred,
Drown them into the streams of gore!""

""Behind your shields you shall now hide,
All you cowards better flee!
Should you past us desire to walk,
Our last man standing you must strike to the ground!""

Very few were spared to tell this story,
So immensely the blood took to flowing.
And so the time of the warrior did come
With an embroided blade in its hand
(but a man unyielding with his brothers by his side
As a legend he lives forever).

The nails of two witches hav touched Me

Their way to remember
Distant nights of Passion and Doom
Where, naked, have I bathed in velvet waters
Witnessed by an accomplice smile inside an innocent Moon

Serene were the beings who guided Me
Empty were the hands which undresses Me
To carve strange symbols unknown to Me

The skies in their blue and so vague tyranny

drinking of Love as insolent Vampires
Valsing through stars and skies
at that and all to come Winter nights

Like neophyte ravens in the strangest nest
Charmed by the wilderness of this strange host
Drawing naivety with our blood and semen
Ritually engraved in our hearts and chests
Marks of a pain, signs of a love crime
That will forever and never last

It is our way, this so mysterious way of loving
of welcoming thee, welcoming thee

Mash out niggaz, straight from the gutter you love it

Ain't nothin above it, we stomp y'all religiously
Watchin' paper thugs tryin' to hide behind the industry
From here to infinity, love thy enemy
Niggaz got the knowledge but don't know the chemistry

All inside your baseball hat and kneecaps
With baseball bats, 'til fame hit you with me till mini-mac
Full body black fatigues, lungs black from weed
In black limo tinted SUV's with Bill

Still, world, famous

Cold street intelligence, O.G.'s and Rebel Men
Grip quick, cock squeeze and Level Men to settle it

From L.A. to B.K., from B.K. to L.A.
Persistent and insistant on doin' it our way
Do you really wanna fuck with Danze?
When he comin' with them thugs in the van
Double clutch in his hands, my nigga

Rush in, gun-bustin', black seven plus tools on 'em

Never snooze on 'em, I'm short, haven't got room for 'em
I send you to God with no shoes
Clueless, real G's run this, we rule this
If you wanna get into some gangsta shit, let's do this

No question, no half-steppin'
Streets is my profession, heat in my possession
Hollow-tips is the answer; look around you see the signs
Say, ""No Smokin'"", but our guns got cancer

Yeah, 'cause I'm not, what you thought I was
Like my career was gon' fade like a fuckin' buzz
Raise the stakes high, I solidify
The grip that I keep on shit, get off my dick

At the block party, doug e. fresh, ""all the way to heaven""
Gettin my wop on (then) lead popped off
Niggas took flight like a 747 (and now)
The block's locked off (if) a head's popped off
Before I fuck around and get one slammed in my dome
And they record it on a camera phone
(fuck the world!) cause when god come for fizzy
I'mma tell his ass to holla back at me cause I'm busy (oh!)
Done with all the hard times and fucked up livin
I see the money bags and I'm on my way to get 'em
Can't nuttin stop that but powder sale or prison
Is you still down nigga? (hell yeah!) then fuck with us

They say that I'm a rude bastard, I left my manners at home
You fucked up and left your hammers at home
Ain't nobody stoppin my shine, we hit 'em like brrrap
If niggas get out of line, we hit 'em like brrrap
So, so, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
You cool, you cool, fuck you, fuck you

Damn, look they done stuck me in the brown section, permanently
Sayin that we are the niggas most likely to fail
They had the whole shit (mapped out) they wanted me to (act out)
Put obstacles in front of me hopin I wouldn't branch out
Raised me in a crack house, persuaded me to back out
Lash out, spaz out and blackout for nothin
And lame fucks with stains with a pair of dirty vials
Servin ass serpents with them devilish smiles
I'm on to you; c'mon dawg, I'm hostile on a good day
My only conversation is done in a hood way
Hood play hood pray to a whole different god
While standin behind gates we got whole different odds
Try to focus on your cards, a spade ain't a spade
Now put your faith on your ace dependin on when it's played
And when you come face to face, with homey with the blade
You shoulda cased the place, cause homey ain't afraid
Old cutthroat-ass nigga, you need to be rewarded
And when I say rewarded, I mean slaughtered and ordered to die
Where you stand, can't do it your owns, well I'm here for you homes

But till then, keep doing it like I do it

[Verse 1: Big Syke]
From the first day of birth it was like we was cursed,
For our destiny to ride away in a hearse
Unseen tomorrows so many hearts are hollow
Can't help 'em they'll put me down if I let 'em
I'm givin' fifty feet to the average friend or foe
And I'll kill you fo' you kill me if you don't know
Cause sometimes God put you in the path to kill
But not if your intentions are to hurt or steal
Constantly surrounded by despisers that's intoxicated
Cause all of us are gang related,
Later years fully gettin' there
What do we have here?
One day every family shall shed a tear,
I'm lost I can't find myself, I listen but don't learn
What's the call for help will God let me burn
So I'm takin' everyday like I'm livin' my last,

Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest
Slug in the chest one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets

Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive

Heh, so?
You say that like that means somethin' to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin' time
For you to be comin' home talkin' that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga)
We been gettin' along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. FUCK YOU!

Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin' to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin' sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin' to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry

For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry

Moms had to entertain many men;
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again.
I'm gettin' a bit older and I'm startin' to be a bother;
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin' like my father
Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough;
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin' care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile!
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry

For all this time, so sorry baby!

Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh, I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin' kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin', Jack!
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""Born to be a father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G
Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger;
If I wanted to to keep you breathin', had to be out of range-a
Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast
But livin' slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the titan you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin' by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry

Mora's Modern Rhythmists,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue

Tante cose che la bocca non dirà 
Quando ti risvegli la mattina 
Tutto il sole nei tuoi occhi 
C'è una luce che mi porta fino a te 
Un giorno in loro scoprirò 
Quello che tu nasconderai 

Occhi di ragazza 
Questo viaggio prima o poi 
Sarà finito 
Una spiaggia vuota senza mare 
Io dovrò vedere in voi 

Occhi di ragazza 
Quanto male vi farete perdonare 
L'acqua di una lacrima d'addio 
Sarà l'ultimo regalo 
Che da voi riceverò 
L'acqua di una lacrima d'addio 
Sarà l'ultimo regalo 
Che da voi riceverò",Occhi Di Ragazza,1998
Morandi,"Tu nel tuo letto caldo
io per la strada al freddo
ma non è questo che mi fa triste
Qui fuori dai tuoi sogni
l'amore sta morendo
ognuno pensa solo a se stesso
Scende la pioggia ma che fa
crolla il mondo intorno a me
per amore sto morendo
Amo la vita più che mai
appartiene solo a me
voglio viverla per questo
E basta con i sogni
ora sei tu che dormi
ora il dolore io lo conosco
Quello che mi dispiace
è quel che imparo adesso
ognuno pensa solo a se stesso

Morandi,"In questa notte di venerdì
Perché non dormi perché sei qui
Perché non parti per un week-end
Che ti riporti dentro di te

Cosa ti manca cosa non hai
Cos'è che insegui se non lo sai
Se la tua corsa finisse qui
Forse sarebbe meglio così

Ma se afferri un'idea
Che ti apre una via
E la tieni con te o ne segui la scia
Risalendo vedrai quanti cadono giù
E per loro tu puoi fare di più

In questa barca persa nel blu
Noi siamo solo dei marinai
Tutti sommersi non solo tu
Nelle bufere dei nostri guai

Perché la guerra, la carestia
Non sono scene viste in TV
E non puoi dire lascia che sia
Perché ne avresti un po' colpa anche tu

Si può dare di più perché è dentro di noi
Si può osare di più senza essere eroi
Come fare non so non lo sai neanche tu
Ma di certo si può dare di più

Perché il tempo va sulle nostre vite
Rubando i minuti di un'eternità

E se parlo con te e ti chiedo di più
È perché te sono io e non solo tu

Si può dare di più perché è dentro di noi
Si può osare di più senza essere eroi

Ma di certo si può dare di più

Ma di certo si può dare di più",Si Può Dare Di Più,

Y que si te nombro a cada una de mis musas

Sueño con que tus ojos cedan y se empañen
Que mis canciones sean la más cruel compañía
Si me preguntas por qué quiero que me extrañes
Puedo explicarte pero no lo entenderías

Y ahora que no puedo hablar
Voy a rogarle a sus recuerdos que aparezcan
Que por las noches sin dañarte, te enloquezcan
No queda nada si te vas, no queda nada si te vas

Y ahora que no puedo hablar
Porque hay palabras que sentaron la protesta
Te las llevaste, no eran tuyas, eran nuestras
No queda nada si te vas, no queda nada si te vas

Se fue rompiendo el lazo que antes nos unía

Sé que entiendes lo que digo

Solo son testigos de la otra mitad 

Dos besos son demasiado 
Y un beso no bastará 
Y aunque adviertan a soldados 
Si está enamorado en guerra morirá 

Ya no tienes que cuidarme porque yo 
Siempre he sabido que tus besos matan 
Que tus promesas riman con dolor 
Que eres experta en robarle latidos a mi corazón 
 
Y tú nunca juraste que saldría ileso 
Ya no te atrevas a pedir perdón 
Yo te confieso que no me arrepiento 
Y aunque estoy sufriendo podría estar peor 

Woah oh oh
Sabiendo que tus besos matan moriré de amor 
Woah oh
Sabiendo que tus besos matan moriré de amor 
Woah oh
Sabiendo que tus besos matan 

Para mí nunca fue un juego 
Para ti fue un beso más 
Y si vuelves a mi vida 
No es que estés perdida 
No es casualidad 

Ya no tienes que cuidarme porque yo 
Siempre he sabido que tus besos matan 
Que tus promesas riman con dolor 
Que eres experta en robarle latidos a mi corazón 

Y tú nunca juraste que saldría ileso 
Ya no te atrevas a pedir perdón 
Yo te confieso que no me arrepiento 
Y aunque estoy sufriendo podría estar peor 

Woah oh oh
Sabiendo que tus besos matan moriré de amor 
Woah oh
Sabiendo que tus besos matan moriré de amor 
Woah oh
Sabiendo que tus besos matan 

Ganaré la guerra para conquistarte 
No quiero admitir que te vas, que te vas 
Ganaré la guerra para conquistarte 
No quiero admitir que te vas, que te vas 
Yo perdí batallas por nunca aceptar que 
No eras fácil de olvidar 

Porque yo 
Siempre he sabido que tus besos matan 
Que tus promesas riman con dolor 
Que eres experta en robarle latidos a mi corazón 

Y tú nunca juraste que saldría ileso 
Ya no te atrevas a pedir perdón

Que te quedaste sola y que no soy ya el que te quiere 
Que no puedes mentirme porque ya sé bien quién eres

En cada noche una razón

Con un beso se fue el dolor
De esos besos que ganan guerras a tu favor

Unos besos salen del alma
Y otros besos del corazón
Y la magia es que yo en tu boca encontré los dos

Pero un beso que no esperaba
El que todo lo terminó
Hizo mal cuando te callaba
Y me robo una explicación

Y hoy me hace falta tu voz
Cuando llega el frío
Vivo en el vacío que tú dejaste al decir adiós

Y hoy me hace falta tu voz
Me sobra tu olvido
Y sentirme vivo con otros besos le pido a dios

Weak aside - no place for those our struggle
Leaves behind
Our Lord won¹t tolerate those whom through
Attrition fall
We must dominate !
With iron through our veins and a will made so elite
Hunting for our daily bread and the sinister close in sight
Hunger always drives the beast and the women fall prey
Leading all the wonderers to certain fate
Another victim reviled
I¹m staring at you through the eyes of the wolf
Tell me who is going to save you now !
Animal sense ever alert
Praise be to the father-war
As a servant I am serving myself and I bathe in anticipation
Unless you taste it you could never know
All the power our Lord bestow
With a bow and a kiss profane
Be a victor or be a victim

What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor

[Verse 1]
The name of this entertainement is 'Women lose weight'
Our first years of mariage everything was just great 
But after two kids And a weight gain factor 
The fact is Now she's completely unattractive 
Look fat chicks I don't mean to sound rude 
I tell her nice hit the gym And don't eat so much food 
But no Your shallow 
You need to run the course of unconditionnal love and so forth 
But how if desire's is not there That's just delayment 
Divorce is, child support, alimony payments 
My happiness I doubt discouraged 
So hurry for an easier way out of this marriage 
Meanwhile my secretary June well groomed 
When you gonna leave your wife I tell her soon mommy soon, I assume 
Or my destiny is blue Interestingly The only thing left for me to do is to kill her

[Chorus]
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I'm gonna have to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I'm gonna have to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss

[Verse 2]
My plans against or shenanigans Kinda ran thin
Knowin' nothing about poisoning And I can't swim 
Bad intentions pumping Might as well become numb 
Cut her lungs or the obvious robbery gone wrong 
But the catch is do I have the nerve to dispatch this 
Who can I get to help me murder this fat chick 
I guess I'll have to play a dude robbin 
On Wednesday The day she usually goes food shopping 
Anyway long story short hit the side of her Chrysler 
And sent her clean over the divider 
""You bastard"" she said 
As the wreck went tumblin down the hill I thought ""she has to be dead"" 
Later on get a call (from a) Lieutenant O'Rourke 
(had me) leapin like a frog We need you at the morgue 
So I selfishly pursue 
""boohoo"" there was nothing else for me to do I had to kill her 

[Chorus]
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
C'mon ya'll know I had to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss Kill her 
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
I had to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss 

[Verse 3]
So you mean to tell me officer you don't have no clue who did this hit and run 
No sir we don't have no clues right now 
This is terrible what am I gonna tell the kids? 
Pull yourself together sir 
I'm so broken up inside I just can't believe this 
I understand, I understand 
Catch the person who did this 
We're gonna try sir Please 
Screamin ""who done took my heart"" acting shakin up a lot 
At the funeral though everyone was lookin at me odd like I did it 
Like I was the reason my mates slain murmuring 
""I heard he was displeased with her weight gain"" 
While my secretary sort of a sexy blonde can't cook 
All she does is order from restaurants 
All of the sex you want I doubt could address, 
Clothes not washed proper and house look a mess and 
Talkin to detectives that was waitin outside 
How I took a long lunch break day the wife died 
I darn near turned pale 
And because of betrayal they indicted me, and gave me an impossible bail 
Good fortune to anyone admiring the rawtent 
Moral of the story is 
Desire is important 
So watch your weight It'll keep you mate smitten it's a given 
Though looking back I realised I didn't have to kill her 

[Chorus]
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
I didn't have to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss 
I killed her 
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
I didn't have to kill her 
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
Send that ass right to the morgue miss 

Well there you have it Keep thin trim Keep your mariage healthy Do you know what I mean?

This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Te dijo te amo

Moreno,"I got a big surprise when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me
So 
Bye bye blues
Bye bye blues

Bells ring
Birds sing
Sun is shining
No more pining
Just we two
Smiling thru
Don't sigh
Don't cry

Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;",The Sheik of Araby,2000

Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""

Moreno,"Questo vecchio cortile che
Ha un cancello sbiadito
Una scritta sul muro
Che mi ricorda qualcosa

Una strada che porta
Alla mia vecchia scuola
Una moto che passa
Come un pensiero di fretta

Se fossi ancora qui con me
Ti farei vedere io
Che la lezione d’amore
Che mi hai insegnato
L’ho imparato bene

Ripenso alla tua storia
E nella mia memoria
Riaffiorano i ricordi
E mi lasciano nodi in gola
Se ti consola stai qua, non cambiano gli odori
I sapori
Al massimo i negozi, i gestori
E per un sacco di fattori
Non capivo i tuoi esempi
I problemi frequenti che c’erano ai tuoi tempi
Il dolore è una lezione che ho imparato con l’amore
Beato chi ne gode chi del cuore ha il suo custode

Tengo una tua foto nella tasca della giacca destra
Sarei diventato matto mai l’avessi persa
Anche se è solo un’immagine in un indumento
Avverto che ti avrò e mi sento più coperto

Conservo quello che mi ha detto, tutti i tuoi consigli
E parlo dopo che rifletto, lo dirò ai miei figli
Di non cercare appigli e non mollare mai

Certe decisioni non le posso prendere
Che tanto non puoi scendere e io non posso scegliere
Di essere con te come immagino

Mi hai fatto crescere in un attimo

A fair ground's painted swings

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Morgan,"Però, (che cosa vuol dire però?)
Mi sveglio col piede sinistro
Quello giusto

Forse già lo sai
Che a volte la follia
Sembra l'unica via
Per la felicità

C'era una volta un ragazzo chiamato pazzo
E diceva sto meglio in un pozzo che su un piedistallo

Oggi ho messo
La giacca dell'anno scorso
Che così mi riconosco
Ed esco

Dopo i fiori piantati
Quelli raccolti
Quelli regalati
Quelli appassiti

Ho deciso
Di perdermi nel mondo
Anche se sprofondo
Lascio che le cose
Mi portino altrove
Non importa dove

Io, un tempo era semplice
Ma ho sprecato tutta l'energia
Per il ritorno

Lascio parole non dette
E prendo tutta la cosmogonia
E la butto via
E mi ci butto anch'io

Sotto le coperte che ci sono le bombe
È come un brutto sogno che diventa realtà

Ho deciso
Di perdermi nel mondo
Anche se sprofondo

Applico alla vita
I puntini di sospensione
Che nell'incosciente
Non c'è negazione

Un ultimo sguardo commosso all'arredamento
E chi si è visto, s'è visto

Svincolarsi dalle convinzioni
Dalle pose e dalle posizioni

Svincolarsi dalle convinzioni
Dalle pose e dalle posizioni

Lascio che le cose
Mi portino altrove
Lascio che le cose
Mi portino altrove

Sul tappeto ci si sdraia
A volte ci s'inginocchia
E nelle fiabe si prende il volo
Sulla tavola si apparecchia
Sulla montagna ci si solleva
Ci si ferma per un istante

With all your little toys
Your eyes have seen the world
Though you're only four years old
And your tears are streaming
Even when you're smiling
Please never be afraid to cry 

You're a beautiful boy
With all your little ploys
Your mind has changed the world
And you're now forty years old
You got all you can carry
And still feel somehow empty
Don't ever be afraid to fly 

All you beautiful boys
Creating multiple plays
You like to fence in your world
And settle down when you're old
You can run from pole to pole
And never scratch your soul

He was acting real smooth when I caught his eye
Silver tongued devil with an axe to grind
Said those things a girl likes to hear
Had a little way of whispering in my ear

But he played that game with every girl he met
I swear he didn't have a heart in his chest

Pulled up in the drive with a mighty roar
Played a good game, acted so tough
Had me believing that it could be love

When it came to commitment, he was scared to death

Heroes and villains become harder to identify
Kindred spirits separated at birth
Fighting for their place in time to be solidified
The clock ticks faster and faster
While time runs a marathon in this Babylon
But see, the end is only the beginning
The beginning of the calm before the storm

I used to dream of success, now success is inadequate
It seems the bigger I get, it's the more they get mad at me
'Cause it ain't no rules inside this fight that we battlin'
And it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it
And I swear it's like a fucked up reality
But creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate, I guess
And I ain't too big on duality, but
You think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me

So fly, no gravity
So high, Mount Everest
And the show must go on, yes
But I don't have to act in it
And they don't make a television that handles the frequencies of my channel
And there ain't no computer that can hack it
It just don't have the capacity
Hell naw that ain't happenin'
You hustle? Well we are Grand Hustle, nigga we mastered it
Y'all workin' on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes
Drink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we Catholics

Some say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all
From a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve
But if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed
And whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge
Fuck rules, fuck boss
You can be whatever you want
You could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold
In the springs, or the falls you could never see it all
If you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls?
Man I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far
Now I be beast mode up on these bars
Freak out a beat and then beat it out raw
Good God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety
I won't need Viagra naw, even if I had a dog
I be the canine, I'd have a ball
Better watch out when you cross my yard
I am a flame, I am the spark
I am in drive, y'all are in park
Look at my shot, look at the arc
Look at the crowd as soon as I start
Look in they eyes and look in they hearts

Unveiling the grim reality of duality
In which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt

Stranded between
My friends had waited,
But left without me
A glimpse on the platform,
We met on the train
She came from further,
Heading my way

Three days in April,
Three years ago
One black eyed stranger
I learned to know
Made all my plans stop
Shook me off track
Ten days of longing
I followed her back

Struck by the light
Circled forever
Over the city at night

Like a song,

Oh, I had a feeling that it might come this
I, I, I, I, I saw it in your eyes
I felt it when we kissed

You left me in the dust
Just another prisoner of your lust

To look the other way to get what you want
Throw out your troubles to find your song
Cause there's a change, a change in the air
In the air, in the air
Just one more minute here with you
All I give to have this come true
Can you feel it too
Can you feel this heart beating in time
Wishing it was yours but it's gotta be mine
Couldn't believe everything I feel
You walked in you saw me just there

Don't close that door, don't walk away
Don't shut your eyes, you can hear me say
I love you now more than everyday
It's OK

Give every moment to see your tear
Give everything I got from now til my last breath",In the Air [Album Version] [Version],2012

Come around and talk it over
So many things that I want to say

You know I like my girls a little bit older
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight

I ain't got many friends left to talk to

Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you

Stay the night but keep it under cover
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight

Try to stop my hands from shaking

But something in my mind's not making sense
It's been a while since we were all alone

But I can't hide the way I'm feeling

As you're leaving please would you close the door?
And don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right that don't mean I'm wrong

Another shoulder to cry upon
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight

And I've been wondering where can she be

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street

She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

That my baby she don't love me no more

She don't feel the same about us in her bones

Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down

You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime

She never liked my pick up truck parked up beside her Lexus
And I never wore them khaki's like she asked me
Just trashy old blue jeans, old skoal ring

She packed up her Chanel, said ""go to hell"", taught me a lesson
And now as far as she's concerned I'm in a deep and dark depression

But it's happy hour drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy went and hooked me up with some willie

But I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done, yeah

And she'll tell her friends I'm faking, my hearts breaking, time will take away my grin

Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingue traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,2000

Saved from evil and
Abandoned to be found

Heed the dragon's fire
Called up with anger
From the deepest agony
Break the spell, you son of a king
