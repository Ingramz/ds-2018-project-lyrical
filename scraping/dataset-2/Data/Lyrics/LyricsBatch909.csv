Ben Bridwell,"Well, I dreamt you were playing
An old guitar from a five-and-dime
There was a song trapped inside
With the sweetest tune
You said it was sad to sing

Where do you fall when you have nowhere to go?
Where do you go where you have no one to see?
What do you see when you have nothing to feel?
What do you feel when you're all alone?

It’s a song that circles round and around
Like a bird lost inside a cloud
Cut off from the stars and they’re guided in the light
Not sure which way is up or down anymore

Where do you fall when you have nowhere to go?
Where do you go where you have no one to see?
What do you see when you have nothing to feel?
What do you feel when you're all alone?

Tired of waiting
Clouds will be breaking
Soon you'll escape and
Someday we'll find a place in the sky",Falling from the Sky,2015
Ben Bridwell,"There's no way out of here
When you come in you're in for good

There was no promise made
The part you played the chance you took
There are no boundaries set
But time and yet you waste it still

So it slips through your hands
Like grains of sand you watch it go
There's no time to be lost
You'll pay the cost so get it right

There's no way out of here
When you come in you're in for good
And never was there an answer, there an answer
Not without listening without seeing

There are no answers here
When you look out you don't see in
There was no promise made
The part you played the chance you took

There's no way out of here
When you come in you're in for good
And never was there an answer, there an answer
Not without listening without seeing

There's no way out of here
When you come in you're in for good
There are no answers here
When you look out you don't see in
There was no promise made
The part you played the chance you took

There's no way out of here

There's no way out of here",No Way Out of Here,2015
Ben Bridwell,"If I die at twenty three
Won't you bury me
In the sunshine?
Please let me know
That you're still mine
Though I'm gone
My love for you
Is, oh, so strong

And when the grass grows over me
Let me know
You still love me
Never put nobody else
Above me
Then I'll know
My love for you 
Will always grow",Ab's Song,2015
Ben Bridwell,"Ohhoohohoo

Am I a good man?
Am I a fool, am'I a fool?
Am I weak?
Somebody tell me
Or am I just playing it cool
I have a woman
And I know shes no good
Still hold my head up high tryi'n to do the things a good man should
Does it make me a good man?
Am I good man?
Am I a fool, am I a fool?
Am I weak?
Somebody tell me
Or am I just playin' it cool
Shes has made, well, my whole life a mess
Still on the words staying by for love so she can always have the very best
Does that make me a good man?
Am I a good man?
Am I a fool, am I a fool?
Am I weak?
Somebody tell me
Or am I just playin' it cool
The best of her love she gives to someone else
Still before I hurt the little girl I would rather hurt myself
Does it make me a good man?
Am I a good man?
Am I a fool, am I a fool?
Am I weak?
Somebody tell me
Or am I just playin' it cool
She has made my whole life a mess
But still I work day and night for her so she can always have the very best
Does that make me a good man?
Am I a good man?
Am I a fool, am I a fool?
Am I weak?

Ben Bridwell,"If you don't love her you'd better let her go
You'll never fool her you're bound to let it show
Love's so hard to take when you have to fake
Everything in return
You just preserve her
When you serve her a little tenderness

If she's a woman she'll try to make it last
If you're a man now you'd better end it fast
There's no reason here, no treason here
Just the way a woman's mind
Well she has no name she has no shame
She just loves you

It's not easy to undo what's done
Or to speak too freely to just anyone
And if this takes more than you bargained for
Boy it's time you learned
Not to talk so loud, not to walk so proud
When you're comin' on",Any Day Woman,2015
Ben Bridwell,"Coyot', Coyotee
What have they done?
My little brother, where
Where do you run?

They strychinined the mountains
They strychinined the plains
My little brother, the coyote
Won't come back again

When you hear him singing
The few that are left
He's warning the human race
Of his death

Don't poison the mesas
Don't poison the sky
Or you won't be back
Little brother, goodbye

There will be no one to listen
And no one to sing
And never and never
Will there be spring

Coyot', Coyotee
What have they done?
My little brother, where
Where do you run?","Coyote, My Little Brother",2015
Ben Bridwell,"Well, in the morning, we'll have to pretend again, smiling
You'll be my good friend again, hold me
The light comes a-creeping in the morning, the curtain will rise again
I know, I know, because I've done this one before

Well, it's the end there, just the beginning, now I'm here
Caught in the middle, loving you comes
As easy as breathing, loving you comes, when everyone's leaving
I know, I know, because I've done this one before

I know, I know
Why must it be so?
Why ask for the moon?

Well, there's just so much, to want to be with her
Where was I when, she was in trouble? 
Now I'm here and too late, as usual in the morning, well, she'll be returning
I know, I know, because I've read this one before

I know, I know
Why must it be so?
Why ask for the moon?

Ben Bridwell,"Whippoorwill's singing
Soft summer breeze
Makes me think of my baby
I left down in New Orleans
I left down in New Orleans

Magnolia, you sweet thing
You're driving me mad
Got to get back to you, babe
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had

You whisper ""good morning""
So gently in my ear
I'm coming home to you, babe
I'll soon be there
I'll soon be there",Magnolia,2015
Ben Bridwell,"The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is its so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine

And if Jesus is the straight path that saves
Then I'm condemned to live my whole life on the curb
On the crossroad to the devil, I'll dwell and I'll count my years

You know that I got a little something I should say
I guess that I'm just so easily led astray
It's alright because I know my own way back home from here

And I don't fall of the wagon you know
I take a dive and go as deep as I can go
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow, this time.

And The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is its so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine

You know a little problem or two
I guess that I keep on taking a few
I've been told its not the best thing that I can do, right now

And I don't go looking for my sins you know
They come out waiting, and I just get on and go
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow this time

And The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is its so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine

Ben Bridwell,"Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I feel numb, born with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's ok I know nothing's wrong, nothing

Hi yo I got plenty of time
Hi yo you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

Home, is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home she lifted up her wings
Guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from the other
Did I find you, or you find me?
There was a time, before we were born
If someone asks, this where I'll be, where I'll be

Hi yo we drift in and out
Hi yo sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head
Ah ooh",This Must Be the Place,2015
Ben Bridwell,"But us, like other angry whores
Discuss what threats were made before
You don't need them anymore

You know more than I know
You know more than I know
You know more than I know

Instead we read the morning news
In bed, what endlessness ahead
And there's no more to be said

You know more than I know
You know more than I know

The blind may see but stay behind
Relief of all liability and greed
And there's nothing more you need

You know more than I know
You know more than I know

No one listens to it
They don't believe it
But it's the only way for me

You know more than I know
You know more than I know
You know more than I know

What crap, old chap, fills up the gap
We set like traps, like traps for us, the rats
And there's nothing more to catch

You know more than I know
You know more than I know
You know more than I know

Then bury me deep down among the weeds
That creep into the hearts of all the weak
And there's nothing more so weak

You know more than I know
You know more than I know
You know more than I know",You Know Me More Than I Know,2015

Can't live without their sun

To infiltrate their young

Oh! Will keep us together

And you find it's not the right way round
Unfolds a stare I'm homeward bound
And draws on tomorow
Deep city soul
Does she walk with you between the aisles
You're flying high over the groves
Devils heart is broken

All that we are
We cried ourselves dry
Everyone sees
The sweet light of change

Night time came in hooded cloaks
Slides through starlight and eyelids

Ben Christophers,"A deep river flows of weathered sins and weathered souls
A kiss a hooded kiss in the seeds of desire
So grief heavenly grief my love you're bringing to me
But you've got shipwreckers eyes and all a cutting stingray smile

I heard the wind has blown a blessed lie and lovers pains
Over streets and wires underneath alien streams
So sweet heavenly sweet my love you're bringing to me
But you've got shipwreckers eyes and all a cutting stingray smile

A river flows
Of weathered souls
But I can see shipwreckers eyes
And all that cutting stingray smile
A kiss a hooded kiss for the one I love

I crossed a lonely road a beggar with sullen clouds in my head
And these lines in my face for every tear you're away
So sweet heavenly sweet my love you're bringing to me
But you got shipwreckers eyes and all a cutting stingray smile

Birds flying home

I must learn how to cry
Before I can see where I'm going
Lord why does my sorrow make me feel so good



A new day dawns
Loneliness has been silent enough 'round here
Sunlight blinds our eyes
Everything is coming home to stay for good this time

Ben Christophers,"The trees are swaying in their pink noise up on the hill
Today's the day to remember always
It's three o'clock and the sun is as warm as warm can be
And I hear the church bells over the city

As if by magic you and me were there again
Then I remembered how you smiled if I was mocking you
Someone's playing music
And it's swimming from that window sill
We stood there listening
But I was thinking more about holding your hand

What does it all come down to
I'm losing myself
There's scissors for voodoo in my mind
I'm doing it my way
I'm doing it my way

The record player plays a lost soul for everyone
And all the sirens fill the dead street thrillers
Bring out the freak shows and the loveless for tomorrows news
And I heard the church bells over the city
And I said

Are you shading in my mind?

What does it all come down to
I'm losing myself
There's scissors for voodoo in my mind
I'm doing it my way
I'm doing it my way

Watch myself there on the bed

Suck me from the outside in

Hollow deep the food's so pretty

Close your mouth she is the victim

That was weird you seemed so phased by it
In a moment your life turns
Like a carousel inside

When you found your daddy's heart in you
All those things you hated were your cross
In a moment your life turns
Like a carousel inside

Bring on new soul
Can't escape it
Can't reply
For today

Down she goes and glitters as she moves
Strands of hair on water burned your eyes

Drags her heels over the noise
Lays down at the roadside of regard
A canyon in my broken mind
Echos deep inside the vale
There's dustcarts for the dead birds in the trees

Trans-atlantic shooting stars over mainline
Here they come suburban gods
To bless desire

Heaven hopes you find her here
The raincatchers
The devils blades
There's karma for the misfits of our times

Take this really you take my soul
Take me down when you laugh I fall
All this pity has broken me
But my survival lies with me

I'm going to love you as best as I can
I'm going to hold you close when I tremble
I'm going to love you as best as I can
I'm going to see you rise

I won't ever let you fall out of my senses
Fall out of my own hands
No I won't ever let you let you

Will I find my way home?

Oop shoop moogi mushy doggy, oh
Oop shoop moogi ay
Means son, don't go near the Eskimos
Please do what I say

My daddy was working
For the weather station
A little bit North of Nome
And I grew up in that frozen country
Where the nights are six months long

I used to play like I was an Eskimo
I put whale oil on my hair
And every night I would beg my folks
Let me sleep in the frigid air

I was seventeen and my voice was changing
But the girls didn't thrill me none
'Cause I longed to go see an Eskimo
On the banks of the old Yukon

One night I slipped from my daddy's house
A little bit north of Nome
I knew that I could get back by morning
'Cause the nights are six months long

And there she was
Sitting on a chunk of ice
Eating a frozen fish
And dipping her friskies
In whale blubbe

And I said, ooga shooga mooshka
Which means the love in my heart
Is a burning

And she said, ooga mooshka nooshka
And that means, back up, buddy
You're melting the ice

I went back home and I told my daddy
About this maiden fair
And how I felt I'd love to melt
Them icicles in her hair

Dad's trembling lips turned purple
And his breath began to freeze
It was then he told me
I could never rub noses
With pretty little Um Shog Nee

He said, son, when you were born
Well, the Eskimo and the white man
Were having a lot of wild parties, see
The Eskimos always brought the ice

Well, they's having a lot of fun, you see
So one night, this Eskimo named Pie Eye
That's right, son, a pie-eyed Eskimo
He stole my little boy and made
A icicle out of him

So I stole you to get even
I was gonna make a
Fudgesicle out of you

But I loved you like you's my very own
And I treated you just, you know
Just like the cold blooded
Little Eskimo that you are

So you see, son, you can never
Rub noses with Um Shog Nee no more
Because, excuse me, see, Um Shog Nee
Has the coldest nose in Alaska
And that's why I've always say

[repeat CHORUS]",Don't Go Near the Eskimos,

And still be friends

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.

As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa

And down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries

Arms areached smiling sweetly

Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

Down the lane I'd walk with my sweet Mary

Then I awake and look around me
At these four gray walls that surround me
And I realized that I was only dreaming

For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home

He couldn't reach little white dove, waiting on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her blowing kisses 'cross the waves

As their hands touched and their lips met, the ragin' river pulled them down
Now they'll always be together in that happy hunting ground

The words I've said or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting

The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning

I relived the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid along the roads I wandered

Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two

What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you",On My Way To You,2004

And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow clad Sierra Nevada
For soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Habanera

Shining in the the East, beyond them far;

A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Under summer skies 
I looked into your eyes

You said ""you're not like the rest"" 
And I nodded 
""No one understands me"" 
you said 
And I nodded once again, 
As if to agree that all men are indeed the same 

Somehow, you said, I was different 
For months on end I maintained 
A veneer of sincere interest 
As if I were listening 
As you re-lived every page 
Of self help and new age that you had read 
And 
I went in for the kill 
I'd read the same books 
I learned to ape the motions of a 'sensitive' human being 

And we were 'oh so happy' 
But you found things to fix 
And I knew it was time 
To move on 
So now you have me completely figured out 
You feel sorry for me 
I can't express my feelings 
I can't tell the truth 
We are all alike 
At puberty I was sworn to secrecy 
By the international brotherhood 
Of lying fickle males 
I can't tell you anything 
And 
I can't commit 
You're right 
I can't commit, to you

Regrets, regrets
I thought about the hours wasted
Watching TV, drinking beer
I thought about the things I thought about
Until immobilized with fear
And all the great ideas I had
And how we just made fun
Of those who had the guts to try and fail
And then I ended up in jail

Regrets, regrets
But just for a day
Seems the police had made a computer mistake
Said there must be thousands like me with the same name

""Good morning, Mr. Ben. 
It's about 6:30 
Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 

Um, just laying here in the bed, 
Half awake, half asleep, 
Thinking about you. 

I was 
Wondering if you were looking after your 
Most valuable 
Possession
Your mind. 

I was thinking about 
John Glenn, 
His space journey and all. 

They said that 
When you're in space you lose 
Muscle mass 
And the body 
Mass 
And I wondered if there was any 
End to it. 

Or whether, 
If you didn't exercise in space, 
How long it would be before you were just 
A head, or a mind,
And have no body or arms. 
You'd have them but you couldn't use them. 

I was wondering if 
If your body mass would drop to a certain level, 
And then it would stop right there. 
And keep whatever you needed to 
Use your mind 
Because it would still be working."" 

(30 seconds remaining) 

""Anyway, I was just pondering that. 
What do you think about, that? 

I hope everything is going alright. 
I may well wake up here in a little while

Let me tell y'all what it's like
Being male, middle-class and white
It's a b*tch, if you don't believe
Listen up to my new CD
(Sha-mon) 

I got sh*t runnin' throught my brain
It's so intense that I can't explain
All alone in my white-boy pain
Shake your booty while the band complains

I pull up to the stop light
I can feel that something's not right
I can feel that someone's blasting me with hate

I thought about the army
I dropped out and joined a band instead

Got a job at chick-fil-a

To lose my southern accent?

My little stage
And I swore I was listening
But I started drifting
Around the part about me
Acting my age
And now if it's all the same
I've people to entertain
I juggle one handed
Do some magic tricks and
The best imitation of myself

Maybe I'm thinking
Myself in a hole
Wondering who I am

Fool somebody else

East with them
And west within

With no one but me

It comes from the same place
And if my mind's somewhere else

Ben Folds,"Sara spelled without an 'h' was getting bored
On a Peavea amp in 1984
While Zak without a 'see' tried out some new guitars
Playing Sara-with-no-h's favorite song

Zak and Sara

Often Sara would have spells where she lost time
She saw the future, she heard voices from inside
The kind of voices she would soon learn to deny
Because at home they got her smacked

Zak and Sara
Zak and Sara

Zak called his dad about layaway plans
And Sara told the friendly salesman that
""You'll all die in your cars
And why's it gotta be dark?
And you're all working in a submarine""

(Asshole)

She saw the lights, she saw the pale English face
Some strange machines repeating beats and thumping bass
Visions of pills that put you in a loving trance
That make it possible for all white boys to dance
And when Zak finished Sara's song, Sara clapped

And he stumbled through the yard
And she shattered her last china plate
And spun off in the car
When he lunged onto the hood
She stopped to tell his she'd been wrong
He was thrown head over heels
Into the traffic coming on
But then...

All is fair, all is fair in love
Did you get my other letters
Sometimes I think I oughta call
Cause you know I often wonder 
If you open them at all
Every couple nights or so
You know you pop into my dreams
I just can't get rid of you
Like you got rid of me
Ooh, but I send my best
'cause God knows you've seen my worst
But then

All is fair, all is fair in love

Never breathing out
All this breathing in

On the side of the road

I want to know you're there

To leave without you
I want to feel the touch of my own skin
Against the sun
Against the wind

I walked out in a field
The grass was high and it brushed against my legs
I just stood and looked out at the open space
At a farm outside a little ways

And I wondered about the people who lived in it
And I wondered if they were happy and content
Were there children and a man and a wife
And did she love him and take her hair down at night

If I stray to far from you
Don't go and try to find me
It doesn't mean that I don't love you
And don't mean that I won't come back
And stay beside you

It only means that I need a little time
To follow that unbroken line
To a place where the wild things grow
To a place where I always used to go

And what I've thrown away
And where the hell I've ended up
On this glary, random day
Were the things I really cared about
Just left along the away
For being too pent up and proud

Woke up way too late
Feeling hungover and old
And the sun was shining bright
And I walked barefoot down the road

No I can't feel a thing at all

And I'm indifferent to the loss

That's leading me around

Since 1980 life has been no fun,
And I don't want to die- I left my family for the secretary

Her name is yuko she is 22
She and my daughter were best friends in high school
They same I'm crazy and it's temporary
But I refuse to rot like my contemporaries
I want to explode- in a kareoke supernova

I don't want to grow old
Won't you let me, won't you let me explode
I don't want to grow old
Won't you let me, won't you let me explode, uh oh
In a kareoke supernova, yeah

Last night she dressed me up in hip hop pants
The fat cheek style that rides below your ass
She wants to show me to her mom and dad
I told her I would not be down with that
''cause lately I can feel the years between us
And hope to god the friends at work don't see us.
Tonight she if I'd ever seen jesus
''cause she had backstage passes for the three of us

(chorus)
So now she's gone and broke my heart, god damn her
Turns out she's been fucking a drum programmer
She likes his style, she likes his rock star glamour
Well she's an infant, he can damn-well have her.

Lick on deez nutz and suck the dick 
lets get the fuck out after you're done 
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright 
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night 
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangster beats 
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets 
Peep, that shit got deep and it was on 
Number 1 song after number 1 song 
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat 
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at 
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do 
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2 
And the ends she got didn't mean nothin' 
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit 

Bitches can't hang with the streets, she found herself short 
So now she's takin' me to court 
It's real conversation for your ass 

I once had a bitch named Mandy May 
Used to be up in them guts like everyday 
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung 
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pro-tung 
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good 
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood 
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine 
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time 

I'm back to the motherfuckin' county jail 
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail 
I get's released on a hot sunny day 
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre 
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news 
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues 
I ain't been out a second 
And already gotta do some motherfuckin' chin checkin'

Move up the block as we groove down the block 
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the glock 
Kick in the do', I look on the flo' 
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo 
I un-cocked my shit,I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed

Yeah, I only get warnings.
But when I was broke I needed it more
And now that I'm rich,
I get free coffee.",Free Coffee,2008
Ben Folds,"Tread slowly from the car to the spa
Like a weary war-torn refugee
Crossing the border with her starving child
It's a struggle just to get to shiatsu
Present the waitress with your allergy card
And tell all of your problems
Leave no tip at all
Down at the shoe store with your friends
Speculate who might be fucking a guru

Rock on, rock on with your fashionable frown
Rock on, rock on. Spread the love around
Rock on, rock on with a fashionable frown
Spread the love around

Hard to remember how we managed before
We could afford real and nervous breakdowns
Or before the anthropology store
Was erected on Indian burial grounds
So really don't you see a little of yourself in the bathroom attendant that you just scowled at?
Or the child who's hiding inside as you wipe the smile off a teenage barista

Rock on, rock on with your fashionable frown
Rock on, rock on. Spread the love around
Rock on, rock on with a fashionable frown
Spread the love around

Spread the love around
Alright

You're gonna be alright, baby
You're gonna be alright, baby

Floating back from the spa to the car
State of bliss, and it wasn't the steam room
Sometimes life's not so bad
Now we know who's been fucking the guru

Rock on, rock on with your fashionable frown
Rock on, rock on. Spread the love around
Rock on, rock on with a fashionable frown

It was the start of the show
Hiroshima
and the people were shouting my name
as the house lights came down
and the spotlight followed me out
I waved down low to the crowd
as I busted ass on the front of the stage

[Chorus]
Oh-oh Oh!
They're watching me, watching me fall

Maybe it was the course of adrenaline
as the concrete rose to meet my face
Maybe it was the sheer embarrassment
that kept me conscious and standing as I
crawled back on the stage
and started pounding out the first song
There was blood on the keyboard
Oh my God.

You wanna see what's in my head?

What does she do with it if it comes back
A note from his assistant is there by the telephone
She wonders again as she turns out the lights

Kylie is calling from Connecticut
She says you've got the number
It says Kylie is calling from Connecticut
It's back on her mind as she closes her eyes

She believes there are things you shouldn't know about
When you've been married for thirty-five years
And her heart belongs to a man that she hadn't seen
Since a magical night when the children were small

We saw the couple in the coma and
It was we were the cliche,

I know I said it wrong
I walked you to the train

To my hotel room
And ordered me some food

Four, three, two, one,
I'm letting you go
I will let go
If you will let go

And if we both might
Be having the same imaginary conversation

I'm letting you go
I will let go
If you will let go

The ceiling opens in disguise

Ben Folds,"Blake says no one ever really loved him 
They just faked it to get money from the government 
And Blake thinks angels grow when you plant angel dust 
He shakes his pretty head 
But darling, trust me, trust me 
He's no valentine 
Though he said he would be mine 
His heart is in Alaska all the time 

Blake stays underwater for the most part 
He collects loose change for All Tomorrow's Parties 
And when Blake dates girls with tattoos of the pyramids 
He breaks their hearts 
By saying it's not permanent 
But in his velvet mind 
He believes with all his might 
We'll all go to Alaska when we die 

Blake makes friends but only for a minute 
He prefers the things he orders from the internet 
And Blake's been having trouble with his head again 
He takes his pills 
But never takes his medicine 
Like Candy in his prime 
He likes his shirts to shine 
And when it's two o'clock it feels like nine 

Blake says he is sorry he got through to me 
If it's okay he'll call right back and talk to the machine 
Blake says it looks like acid rain today 
He takes the fish inside 
He's very kind that way

Ben Folds,"When I got to the party
They gave me a forty
And I must've been thirsty
'Cause I drank it so quickly

When I got to the bedroom
There was somebody waiting
And it isn't my fault
That the barbarian raped me

When I went to get tested
I brought along my best friend
Melissa Mahoney
Who had once been molested

And she knew how to get there
She knew all the nurses
They were all really friendly
But the test came out positive

Uh-oh

I've seen better days but I don't care
I just sent a letter in the mail

When I got my abortion
I brought along my boyfriend
We got there an hour
Before the appointment

And outside the building
There were all these annoying
Fundamentalist Christians
We tried to ignore them

Oh-oh

I've had better days but I don't care
Oasis got my letter in the mail

When vacation was over
The word was all over
That I was a crack whore
Melissa had told them

And so now were not talking
Except we have tickets
To see blur in October
And I think were still going

Oh-oh

I've seen better days but I don't care
Oh I just got a letter in the mail

Oasis sent a photograph
Its autographed and everything

Ben Folds,"My friend has problems with winter and autumn.
They give him prescriptions and shine bright lights on him.
They say it's genetic, they say he can't help it, they say you can catch it - but sometimes you're born with it.
My friend despite he gets shakes in the night and they say that there's no way that they could have caught it in time takes his toll on him.
It is traditional.
It is inherited.
Predispositional
Day I've been wondering what is inside of me, who can I blame for it?
I say it runs in the family

My friend's depressed she's a wreck, she's a mess.
They've done all sorts of tests & they guess it has something to do with her grandmother's grandfather's grandmother saving war soldiers who probably infected her.
My friend has validation in some allergies that she dates back to the 17th century.
Somehow she manages in her misery.
Strips in the city and shows all her best tricks.
I mean well, I'm well well I mean I'm in hell well I still have my health at least that's what they tell me.
If wellness is this what in hells name is sickness?
But business is business and business runs in the family.

We tend to bruise easily.
Mad in the blood.

Running is something that we've always done well and mostly I can't even tell what I'm running from.
Run from their pity, from responsibility.
Run from the country and run from the city.
I can run from the law, I can run from myself.
I can run from my life, I can run into debt.
I can run from it all, I can run til I'm gone.
I can run for the office and run for my cause.
I can run using every last ounce of energy.
I cannot, I cannot, I cannot run from my family.

They're hiding inside of me.
Don't change my life.
Help me if you might but don't tell my family.
They'd never forgive me.
They'd say that I'm crazy.
But they would say anything if it would shut me up

Just as I reached into my pocket to find it empty of any ?????
I saw two broken twigs on the ground,
Shapped like the greek letters F & S,

F and S, helium, F & S,
These are the chemical symbols for Iron & sulfur
It was a sign I'm sure for me to make gold from these two elements,
I've been working all day over these hellish flames.

Locked in his bedroom
He saw the world
A web of answers
And cumshot girls

Tick tick tick tick tick
Tick tick tick tick tick

Don't bother blaming
His games and guns
He's only playing
And boys just want to have fun

He picked a soundtrack
And packed his bag
He hung his walkman
Around his neck

Tick tick tick tick tick
Tick tick tick tick tick

The way they fall
No cry, no whimper
No sound at all

And anyway
He always hears how much it means to people
There's a lot of forty-somethings 
Who wouldn't be in the world without it

I'm sorry that I left you
I met somebody younger on a plane

A nice smile
No kids either
She gave me complimentary champagne

Maybe that's why songs get sung

Three thousand cameras pointed at me.

""Well, you just knocked up the VP nominee's daughter.""

Already got a girl, and her name is Bristol.""

Your mother-in-law's a heartbeat from the presidency.""

Time capsule owner, cause I'm a brand new man
And I don't think I want it
I don't think I want it,
A roll of flies
Hang in behind me
What guarded up nights and questions, and photo-flashes burning,
And I'm so high, I can't recall my statements,
I only know I made them, because my face vibrated

But many wait, to what I'm saying
Always come back again, I can't ignore it
I'm a brand new man, but I'm still ṗrayin' for it

Wondering if you were looking after your

When you're in space you lose 
Muscle mass 
And the body 
Mass 
And I wondered if there was any 
End to it. 

Or whether, 
If you didn't exercise in space, 
How long it would be before you were just 
A head, or a mind,
And have no body or arms. 
You'd have them but you couldn't use them. 

I was wondering if 
If your body mass would drop to a certain level, 
And then it would stop right there. 
And keep whatever you needed to 
Use your mind 
Because it would still be working.""

Ben Folds Five,"Your Uncle Walter's going on and on
'Bout everything he's seen and done
The voice of 50 years experience
He's drunk, watching the television
You know he's been around the world
Last night he flew to Baghdad
In his magical armchair
Cigarettes and a six pack, he just got back
Now the spit's flying everywhere

Hey, hey, hey, hey (Your Uncle Walter's going on and on)
You're back so late (Where did you go that you were gone so long)
How could you leave me here so long with Uncle Walter

Your Uncle Walter saw who fired the shots
He drove his chair in the cavalcade
He's flown from South Africa
To countries where
They beat themselves on the backs with chains
There was a fleet of battleships
And 1 reclining chair
Headed north on the Arabian Sea
Now he's back to tell us what
He and his oldest boy Blair
They're getting rich with their mail order scheme

Oh, oh (Your Uncle Walter's going on and on)
We're so glad you're home (Where did you go that you were gone so long)
How could you leave me here so long with Uncle Walter

Your Uncle Walter told me
Everything he'd do if he was president
Oh what a perfect world
This world would be
If he was President now
But he's not

And he sees the children smoking pot
He knows that in a moment
They'll be shooting up heroin
Teardrops in his armchair
A 50 minute lecture
Tobacco juice rolling down his chin

Sing us a song 
Just in case by tomorrow 
It happens he's gone 
For two weeks and seven days 
Our fair foreign friend 
I have this feeling 
We might never see Steven again 

But we thought he was gone 
Now he's come back again 
Last week it was funny 
Now the jokes wearing thin 
Everyone knows now 
That every night now 
Will be Steven's last night in town 

He's charmed everyone here 
Except Tamara Easter 
Who later revealed to him 
Her innermost secrets 
Won us over with stories 
About Linda McCartney 
Lost points with the ladies 
For saying he couldn't love a 
Woman with cellulite 

But we thought he was gone 
Now he's come back again 
Last week it was funny 
Now the jokes wearing thin 
Everyone knows now 
That every night now 
Will be Steven's last night in town 

We were talking bout something 
Seems like was funny 
Then Steven got quiet 
I think Steven was mad 
Maybe he wasn't mad 
But we felt very strange 
In the moment 
But the moment was past 
And forgotten

But we thought he was gone 
Now he's come back again 
Last week it was funny 
Now the jokes wearing thin 
Everyone knows now 
That every night now 
Will be Steven's last night in town",Steven's Last Night in Town,1997

I dropped out and joined a band instead.

Grew a mustache and a mullet, 
Got a job at chic-fil-a.

And in June reformed without me, and they got a different name.

I couldn't keep the pace
I thought I was the only one moving in slow motion

I thought it'd get me through, it did

Never did

Regrets, regrets
I thought about the hours wasted
Watching TV, drinking beer
I thought about the things I thought about
Until immobilized with fear
And all the great ideas I had
And how we just made fun
Of those who had the guts to try and fail
And then I ended up in jail

Regrets, regrets
But just for a day
Seems the police had made a computer mistake
Said there must be thousands like me with the same name

When she was sick before she died
So I don't blame you if you never come to see me here again

""Good morning, Mr. Ben. 
It's about 6:30

Um, just laying here in the bed, 
Half awake, half asleep, 
Thinking about you. 

I was 
Wondering if you were looking after your 
Most valuable 
Possession
Your mind. 

I was thinking about 
John Glenn, 
His space journey and all. 

They said that 
When you're in space you lose 
Muscle mass 
And the body 
Mass 
And I wondered if there was any 
End to it. 

Or whether, 
If you didn't exercise in space, 
How long it would be before you were just 
A head, or a mind,
And have no body or arms. 
You'd have them but you couldn't use them. 

I was wondering if 
If your body mass would drop to a certain level, 
And then it would stop right there. 
And keep whatever you needed to 
Use your mind 
Because it would still be working.""

Doesn't want to let them get to know Keats or Studs Terkel
They'll never know what they have lost
But Sara, well, she just can't bear
The stupidity, the boredom, the grind
She stays at school so that she can hear
The sound of the life of the mind

And it's noisy up there
(Noisy up there)
It rocks me like a mother
Copernicus and Fortune's Wheel
Plato, Glenn Gould, and the New Deal
And it's noisy up there
(Noisy up there)
It rocks me like a mother

Sara already knows pretty soon she'll be leaving
Well, she's hoovered up whatever she can find
But she doesn't want to hear about
Pregnancies, foam fights, TV, take-outs, have sex, weddings
The sound of the life she'll leave behind

Yeah, it's noisy up there
(Noisy up there)
It rocks me like a mother
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
And it's noisy up there
(Noisy up there)
It rocks me like a mother

Ben Folds Five,"Yeah I want a different answer
So I ask you once again
But the truth in the silence and this time I got it
It's over

Thank you for breaking my heart
Now I know that it's in there
I left it wide open
And asked you to stay
But you know better

Guess I thought it wouldn't happen
That I could care until it hurt
And the ironic timing
The clouds and their linings
That open up and pour

And thank you for breaking my heart
Now I know that it's in there
What a fool to imagine
That you'd feel the same
But you know better

Rain has washed the leaves away
Skeletons and stars
I'm pulling the door to
And closing the blinds

So thank you for breaking my heart
Now I know what it feels like
And it hurts so badly
Tell me this will pass
Soon enough know better",Thank You for Breaking My Heart,2012
Ben Folds Five,"We'd hit the bottom
I thought it was my fault
And in a way I guess it was
I'm just now finding out
What it was all about

We moved to the west coast away from everyone
She never told me that you called
Back when I was still, I was still in love

'Til I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried
And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
And I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up, I've landed

The daily dramas she made from nothing
So nothing ever made them right
She liked to push me and talk me back down
'Til I believed I was the crazy one
And in a way
I guess I was

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye I tried
Treading the sea of a troubled mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye-bye, goodbye I tried

If you wrote me off I'd understand it
'Cause I've been on some other planet
So come pick me up
I've landed

And you will be so
Happy to know
I've come alone
It's over

But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar
It's okay to call
Now I'll answer for myself

Come pick me up
Come pick me up

I've landed",Landed,2013

Ben Frrankel,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,1995
Ben Gibbard,"Every scream went bleeding through these paper walls 
And all the make-up in the world couldn't hide the scars
I leave today, I'm packing light: a suitcase, some toiletries
The rolling hills and willow trees of Carolina wait for me

You never learned, the rules have changed since we were nine
This isn't school, boys don't assault the girls they like

The taste of blood, the claim of love
These two will here on cease to be 
Sprouting from your fists and tongue 'cause Carolina waits for me

Fields of grain go whipping by from the window seat
I'm drifting in, I'm drifting out catching up on sleep 
I couldn't get indentured since the very crest of 17
I left my keys and broken dreams 'cause Carolina waits for me

I will never forgive a single day
Mile markers seem to call my name and say, 
""You're safer now through every town, we'll light your way in reflective green"" 
All the way, the entire state of Carolina waits for me",Carolina,2004

Follow the dot
Coincidence makes sense
Only with you
You don't have to speak

They puzzle me

State of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency

Ben Gibbard,"Travelling north, travelling north to find you
Train wheels beating, the wind in my eyes
Don't even know what I'll find when I get to you
Call out your name love, don't be surprised

It's so many miles and so long since I've left you
Don't even know what I'll find when I get to you
But suddenly now, I know where I belong
It's many hundred miles and it won't be long

Nothing at all, in my head, to say to you
Only the beat of the train I'm on
Nothing I've learned all my life on the way to you
One day our love was over and gone

It's so many miles and so long since I've met you
Don't even know what I'll say when I get to you
But suddenly now, I know where I belong
It's many hundred miles and it won't be long

What will I do if there's someone there with you
Maybe someone you've always known
How do I know I can come and give to you
Love with no warning and find you alone

Ben Glover,"I can't form a sentence
To save my life
I try to coin a phrase
But I can't make it sound right
I feel helpless
A little dumb
I'm an educated fool
With a brain gone numb
All I wanna do is let you know that you
You had the heart to change the heart of me
You took me to a love I never knew

26 letters is all I got
To tell you how I feel about you
26 letters and you know I'm never ever
Gonna write the perfect paragraph
I try to express
With adjectives of thankfulness
But, I don't know if I can do it
With 26 letters

I could be a scholar
I could be a sage
I could write a million books
And be the latest rage
I still can't say enough
For what you've done for me
With this limited vocabulary
All I wanna do is let you know that you
You had the heart to change the heart of me
You took me to a love I never knew

On and on and on I go
With limited descriptive prose
And I give up 'cause I've said it all before",26 Letters,2001

Cause I already know
Things could be better,
Not like this Broadway Show

Always a reason
There's no time to talk
I don't want you leaving
And I surely don't want you to walk

Cause I never felt this way I feel before
Is this the blues? Almighty blues
I've never felt so lonely, since I lost my one and only

I can't go the distance
I can't close the door
Feel alone in a crowd
I can't take no more

Ben Granfelt,"Reflecting back on the life that I once knew
I'm pretty sure I could have changed a thing or two
In our restless youth, we were wild and running fast
And everyone I knew said, ""Boy, you'll never last""

I saw an ad for a player in a band
I took a train, guitar case in my hand
Like a dream, sweet music in my ears
Had a little luck on the course we were to steer

Never found another reason
You gave me something to believe in
You came and you saved me
Yes, I got what I need in
Faith, hope and love
Faith, hope and love

I settled down with my family, that is true
I kept my faith in the music to guide me through
And life can change if you really want it to
And you can change, too, just believe in what you do

Never found another reason
You gave me something to believe in
You came and you saved me
Yes, I got what I need in
Faith, hope and love
Faith, hope and love
