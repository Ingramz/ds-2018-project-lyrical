J.B. Lenoir,"Vietnam Vietnam, everybody cryin' about Vietnam
Vietnam Vietnam, everybody cryin' about Vietnam
The law all the days killing me down in Mississippi, nobody seems to give a damn

Oh God if you can hear my prayer now, please help my brothers over in Vietnam
Oh God if you can hear my prayer now, please help my brothers over in Vietnam
The poor boys fightin', killin' and hidin' all in holes,
Maybe killin' their own brother, they do not know

Mister President you always cry about peace, but you must clean up your house before you leave
Oh how you cry about peace, but you must clean up your house before you leave
How can you tell the world how we need peace, and you still mistreat and killin' poor me.",Vietnam Blues,1995
J.B. Lenoir,"Hey everybody, I was talkin' to you
I ain't tellin' you jivin', this is the natural truth

[Chorus]
I got them Eisenhower blues
Thinkin' about me and you, what on earth are we gonna do?

My money's gone, my fun is gone
The way things look, how can I be here long?

[Chorus]

Taken all my money, to pay the tax
I'm only givin' you people, the natural facts
I only tellin' you people, my belief
Because I am headed straight, on relief

[Chorus]

Ain't go a dime, ain't even got a cent
I don't even have no money, to pay my rent
My baby needs some clothes, she needs some shoes
Peoples I don't know what, I'm gonna do

J.B. Ritchie,"Well, I got a girl, she lives upon the hill
Well, I got a girl, she lives upon the hill
Sometimes she won't, sometimes I think she will
Got to shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker
Shake your moneymaker

Oh, I love you baby, tell you the reason why
I love you baby, tell you the reason why

J.B. Scott,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2008
J.B.O.,"Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried

All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

Oh Angie, don't weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie, I still love you, baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on baby dry your eyes

But Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive?
Angie, Angie
They can't say we never tried",Angie,1997
J.B.O.,"Kirchweih is' in unserm Dorf, ich geh' ins

Zwa, drei Stunden spaeter bin ich so richtig
breit.
Ich hab' scho' elf Stueck trunk'ng - und zwa scho
wieder g'speit.
Der Freedi aus'm Nachbardorf langt meiner Rosi an
die Titten.
Ich schrei ""Finger wech, die Fraa g'hoert mir!
Was sind denn des fuer Sitten?!""
Endlich gibt's an g'scheiten Streit, mir lassen's
richtig krach'ng.
Mir regeln des jetzt wie sich's g'hoert - wie
Maenner halt so mach'ng:
Und ich sag': Hose runter - Schwanzvergleich, die
Stimmung kocht gleich ueber
Wir packen uns're Rohre aus und messen das
Kaliber.
Hose runter - Schwanzvergleich, so macht mer des
als Mann.
Mit Wortverdreh'n und diskutier'n fang ich erst
gar net an!
Am naechsten Tag am Arbeitsplatz - der Schaedel
brummt wie Sau.
Ich kann noch gar net g'radaus schau'n - mei, war
ich gestern blau!
Der Chef bestellt mich ins Buero und bruellt mich
auch gleich an:
Er sagt, dass ich ein Saufkopf bin und sonst nix
anders kann.
Er meint, dass er was Besser's waer, da platzt
mir doch der Krag'ng,
Nur weil er viel mehr Kohle hat, geb' ich mich
net geschlag'ng:
Ich sag' nur: Hose runter - Schwanzvergleich, die

J.C. Heard,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy

J.C. Heard,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?,1990
J.C. Heard,"Back home again in Indiana,
And it seems that I can see
The gleamin' candlelight,
Still shinin' bright,
Through the sycamores for me.

The new mown hay sends all its fragrance
From the fields I used to roam.
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash,
Then I long for my Indiana home.

Oh, I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea,
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me;
A vision fair I see,
Again I long to be;

Back home again in Indiana,
And it seems that I can see
The gleamin' candlelight,
Still shinin' bright,
Through the sycamores for me.

J.C. Heard,"I'm confessin' that I love you,
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin' (That I Love You),1994
J.C. Heard,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1994

Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo

J.C. Heard,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go

Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Sweeter than the roses in May

Old black magic that you weave so well

J.C. Heard,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.

I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2002

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.","He's Funny That Way, (She's)",2004

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

That never did come true?

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

J.D. Crowe & the New South,"Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you 
And I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow 
Oh but I'm so afraid of losing you again

If heaven were to hear my heart's confession 
Oh wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you
Yes I'm so afraid of losing you again",(I'm So) Afraid of Losing You Again,1999
J.D. Crowe & the New South,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1999
J.D. Crowe & the New South,"Yesterday I finally found out where you are,
but I don't think that I should look around.
With you out there and me down here,
there's just no in between.
So I'll just wait for you to come on down.

Why don't you, come on down to my world,
come on down to my world. 
The door is open you know where I'll be.
Why don't you, come on down to my world,
come on down to my world.
My heart is closed and you have got the key.

The plans we made, began to fade, you changed your mind,
and left me for the new love you have found.
The only thing now I have left to do is cry.
So I'll just wait for you to come on down.          

Why don't you, come on down to my world,
come on down to my world. 
The door is open you know where I'll be.

Why don't you, come on down to my world,
come on down to my world. 
My heart is closed and you have got the key.

You're gonna run away and hide

I've seen lots of pretty girls
The one like you, the one like you 
For your love's one of a kind
And it eases a worried mind
Loving you, just loving you

The sweetest love I ever knew
Is the love I get from you
I'll always keep on loving you
You hold the key to my heart
And I know it'll never part
Forever I'll be loving you

Oh I know there is no doubt
You're the one I can't live without
I'm loving you, only you
My every dream now is real
And I know I always will

There is no other girl

The passion was not ours to keep (to keep)

Rejection comes in and cuts so deep (so deep)
Now everywhere I turn
All my bridges burn
Why can't you see all I need come set me free

'Cause I still can feel you always
My love can heal you always
It too can heal you always
Alright, always
I still can feel it always
I still believe it always
I can't conceal it always

Everywhere I go, it's like you're there beside me
Possession makes my heart pretend, pretend
Cause I just can't let go
Why did love ever find me
To give affection once again
But too late
I feel I tried inside
With all of my pride
Why can't you see all I need come set me free

That those happy days again will bring.

Four and twenty blackbirds started into sing.
Sing a melody of love, a song will win your lady fair.
Sing a song that mentions love and you will yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

Sing a song of cheer again,
The skies above will be clear again,
Those happy days are here again,
Sing a song of cheer again.

Let your frown turn summerset, get yourself a good quartet.
In the evening by the moonlight
You can hear those darkies singin'.

Sing loud, sing soft,
Sing sweet, sing hot,

Nearly nobody minds

Wavin' at the limousines

It's the same Cadillac that they use
In a graveyard scene

Some other mornin' you go back to school
As if nothing has changed
Well, there's no use playin' if you're winning
At a losin' game

There's trouble in paradise
You're payin' for everything twice
Too much at half the price
A little too soon

When you looked into my eyes, and you said goodbye
Could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
Till I feel your

Rain
Feel it on my finger tips, hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like
Rain

Here comes the sun...here comes the sun
And I say...never go away

Waiting is the hardest thing
I tell myself that if I believe in you
In the dream of you
With all my heart and all my soul
That by sheer force of will
I will raise you from the ground
And without a sound you'll appear
And surrender to me
To love

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain
I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain

I'll stand out on the mountain top
Until I hear you call
My name

J.D. Souther,"If the world was flat 
I?d walk off the edge
But I can?t ?cause it?s to big and round

I can just see myself 
Falling through space
Grateful not to be found.

Trouble with living here in the future 
And sailing the Dutchman?s sea
Is the trouble with love in the present tense
And the fear of eternity.

See no matter where you are
You?re about to come round 
To just where you?ve already been.

Don?t be afraid
It happens to people
And then it happens again and again.

Go off this marble 
Leave something here 
For somebody else but you.

Awww it?s a pity
Most folks don?t realize.

If the world was safe 
I?d fly in my sleep
Crashing right through these blue walls.

Doubts and fears would rise 
Like a duster in Texas
Cushion my deadly fall.

The problem is worse 
If you?re religious
What keeps your head in its place?

They think what they think
But you know what you know
The secrete handshake of fate.

If the world was you
I?d travel extensively
Visiting some places twice.

Scrambling for purchase
Wherever it?s slippery
Against all and any advise.

I?d sleep upside down
For a new view of heaven
Dream at both ends of the night

All through the middle 
I?d breathe with you
Knowing we?d be all right.
(Then we?d go)
Twisting into the light.

J.D. Souther,"Out in the shiny night, the rainwas softly falling 
The tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away 
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling 
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace 
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say 
We thought we could change this world with words like ""love"" and ""freedom"" 
We were part of the lonely crowd Inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, expecting to fly, we would meet on that shore in the sweet by and by 
Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away 
And some of the stayed behind inside the Sad Cafe. 
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore 
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more 
Now I look at the years gone by, and wonder at the powers that be. 
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and let's the rest go free 
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall 
But things in this life change very slowly, if they ever change at all 
There's no use in asking why, it just turned out that way 
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Cafe. 
Why don't you meet me at midnight baby, inside the Sad Cafe.",The Sad Café,2011

Just when the sun shines the brightest
And the world looks alright again
Then the clouds fill the skies
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

My love never meant much to you dear
For to you I was always a friend
Oh why did I fall
You have no heart at all
Sometimes you just can't win

I can't live like this any longer
Not knowing just where I stand
I know I shouldn't care
But sweetheart it don't seem fair
Sometimes you just can't win


And then when the sunshines the brightest
And the world looks alright, again
The clouds fill the sky's
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

No sometimes you just can't win.......

Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your loving arms again

If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere in the lonely night
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now

Oh I've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain

Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your loving arms again

It's not the same as it used to be
And it's not too late to realise our mistake
We're just not right for each other

Love has slipped away left us only friends
We almost seem like strangers
All that's left between us are the memories we shared
Of times we thought we cared for each other

There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us

Some day when she's older, maybe she will understand
Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye
Will tear at my heart forever

Fuck with the kid, gotta throw ya moms over the bridge

I'm the reason custies is comin' to the Carter Buildin
And it ain't no tellin what I do
They may find ya body on 16th smellin like a (*jew*)
I'm the number one stunna when it comes to the east
In the Jag with the .40 cal under the seat
Nigga this is my block, Name a nigga who run me out
Friday come, you and you have your money out
Son, my gun'll bring a playboy bunny out
Somebody gotta die, I'm a try ya hunny out
Send her to ER with half her tummy out
No see-section, no infants comin out
She can't have babies again
Me and Kay gettin money so its feelin like the eighties again
Holla!

Ayo, You boys is silly, I'm next since Pac and Biggie
And I'm Bout Major Figgas like Dutch and Gillie
Catch Shells all-star weekend down in Philly
On my hip, pack heat like a bowl of chilly
Look - I Clap milli's, act willy, you a chump
Only kid in the hood with elevators in his truck
See, I flash bucks, rock all black doors
And my watch ice'd out like Jacobs store
When you boys gon learn I got this game lock
What you got for your deal, I spent on Xbox
Keep frontin like you hungry, I'm a feed you a biscuit
I got rock and roll bullets, leave limps like bizkit
So hey, its ya life involved - act like it is
My chain light gray like trash can lids
If one of y'all take my chain - none of y'all live
You like, ""I ain't do it Shells"", One of y'all did!

'Cause A lot of y'all are fakin', one minute is asolama laken
2 minutes later is where's my salamy bacon
Niggaz swear the product the makin' requires rockin a aprin
They liars cause its Betty Crocker they bakin
Not that I'm sayin that I Cook, Cause I don't
I keep it as raw as you seen it before it was put on the boat
The hookers'll open they jaw for free
Fuck being a gentleman, ya girlfriend open the door for me
When a pimp walk the beat, you shut up one day
The day the dick had ya mother next up one way
I come up one way drunk pushin a porshe
Make beef and I'm cookin the sauce - Gravy!
I be lookin like a boss
I pop at ya hood on ya snorkle til I have the fur lookin like a scarf
Lookin like I robbed 'em
Tell cops is easy to find like chinks in a nail shop
Holla, cheah!

Ayo, get back get back for I click clack click clack
Where that shit at? Get that 'for I bust shots!
Get crunk if you want to, drunk if you want to
Front if you want to, And get slumped with the gun too
Gimme mine cause any time I could run through
And put ya brains on the mini blinds in sun roof
Try run dog, you can try hide man
But when I bust the gun dog, you gon die man
I drinkin rum dog and I'm gettin high man
Say good bye man or a prayer - ""Aman""
Look It ain't hard to get at you dudes
I screw waitresses that'll slip shit in ya food

I'm a bubble like vinegar and baking soda

Ayo, I'm a D-Block nigga - I don't respect wack rhymes
If you had a gat in a clock, you couldn't kill time
Y'all cowards don't want beef, why even start?
Y'all like dicks in the pool - none of y'all hard
Come through in the spit white 330 with a mean birdie
Holdin my hammer cause she know its dirty
You got questions, holla at me - I tell you what's what
Lay you on ya back and y'all chumps'll really see what's up
On the real, y'all niggaz better chill
Think ya crew spittin flames - I'll put ya hot dogs on the grill
It gotta be a conspiracy if niggaz ain't feelin me
Like a nigga with no eyes - y'all not seein me
Call me a director - I give clips to ya broad
Bullets is like gum - How they stick in ya jaw
Go 'head, call the narcs - I put a hole through ya heart
And leave you on the train tracks in a shopping cart
This ain't just beats and bars, Its things I'll do to you
In Compton fuck, I'm tryin to get through to you
The gauge'll open ya chest like vics
How you went from being soft to hard - niggaz is dicks
I don't wanna hear nothin bout ya coke and ya toast
Liars get shot in they tongue - I'll put the mack to ya throat motherfucker!

And the pain pops me another one to the brain, I let the strain do what you can't

I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense

Be assessing my involvement, second guessing my delivery

It's kinda fucking insane, are you in power exchange?
I guess I'm just out of my lane, I know I'm losing my brain
But, I know it's hereditary baby 
'Cause your mama was a G and your daddy wasn't there so you be trying to play with me
But, but that ain't the wave
But if I'm keeping it true, I know why I be this way now
We don't speak, we say evil things now
We don't sleep no more, we need space now
She gone leave and go and her find her a bae now
Ouch, ouch
That's pain, yeah, oh so painful
Trying to change, just let me die in the rainfall
I can't save her if she don't want to be saved, how
Please God, do something for me God
She cut me deep just to see if I'ma bleed out
I know this what I need, but who's to say what I need
What you say to your demons?
What you say to your heart when it's walking away with your feelings?
But didn't you know I tried, tried, tried, tried
Tried to be the guy in your life
But you tied my soul, spirit, and mind and dullness all your life
The fuck you want me to say?
And if I'm keeping it true, it's probably never gone change

But I guess it's hereditary baby, why you playing with my heart?
It's hereditary baby, you could've said this from the start, yes
But, ain't that a waste? A big fucking waste of time
A big fucking waste of time, yeah

Yeah, uh, ok, I remember all the better days
Used to spend a hella lot of time
Catching something, heck I didn't wait
Guessing I was probably out of line
Then you said ""don't speak to me""
I'd be like ""ok, it's fine""
That's just gon' pull on the fight, know that we said one of us upset
Then we just not gon' sleep tonight
Man this shit has turned all bad
Call mama, call dad, call Izzy, call Precious, call Pat
It's like she spit in my face
And the world's fall down on me and I can't handle the wave
But I'm finna get medicated, maybe it'll take the pain away
A relationship will make you have a fucking revelation
But, but that ain't a waste, no
It's never been a waste of time
Never been a waste of time, no

Uh, want me to tell you the truth?
What you expect me to say?
Cause if we keeping it true, it's probably never gon' change
But, I guess it's hereditary, baby
Why you playing with my heart?
It's heredity girl you was just playing from the start, yeah
But if you let me explain, shit

Hey, we really need to talk
But, of course, you never answer your phone
I just don't think this relationship is working out
You never make time for me, you never show me off
You just never make me feel special
I mean, I want to work things out, but I would need you to change first
And we both know, that will never happen",Hereditary,2017

You don't't need to give me reasons 
I understand 
Somethings are best kept secret 
And you've done all you can 
I want no recompense 
Just as much as you can give of yourself 
If that makes sense 

 I'll keep it confidential 
It's secret, confidential 
It may come as some surprise 
But I can stay secret from prying eyes 
So don't worry, I'll keep it confidential 
Between you and me 

 Go on tell me that you love me 
Show me you dare 
We may not venture out in public 
At least I know, you care 
It can't be guaranteed 
Just give me what you can of yourself 
That's all I need 

 I'll keep it confidential 
It's secret, confidential 
It may come as some surprise 
But I can stay secret from prying eyes 
So don't worry, I'll keep it confidential

It is a mean life, and it's killin' me 

I got a letter from my home, 
All of my schoolmates, they're dead an'gone 
It'll make you worry, 
It'll make you wonder 'bout days to come 

My mother used to talk to me, 
I was young and foolish, Brownie could not see 
Now, I have no mother, my sisters 
And my brothers, they don't care for me 

Mama used to fall on her knees an' pray, 
These are the words, mother,she used to say 
She would say: ""Brownie, wha-oh, 
My son, please change your way"" 

Now, I'm goin' to change my way, 
I'm growin' older each and every day 
When I was young and foolish, 
I was so easy, easy to let 

I was a gambler and a cheater, too, now, 
It's come my turn to lose 
This ole sportin' life, 
Got the best hand, what can I do? 

There ain't but one thing Brownie done wrong, 
I liv'd that ole sportin' life too long 
Friends, it's no good, please believe me, 
Please leave it alone",Sporting Life Blues,2006

J.J. Demon,"[Chorus:] 
We're saying RIP to everyone we know
Our glass is now half empty
But the tears will overflow

And still we're screaming
RIP to everyone we love
Is everyone below mad at 
Everyone above?

This is the valley where animals live
Stresses like wind to a man on a bridge
Stand on the edge with the city below
Below the city is 60 below

Is he alone? Is he a shadow?
And will he be home in the minute of battle?
He's roaming of vandal
No roman candles lit on the night that he died

Let it be I
Should've been me in his place
Scared as I stare in the face of his mother
In case I discover the fear in the fate

My brother I sent another prayer into space
Rest in peace to Prince and Thief 
Can we speak to 
Ghosts?

[Chorus] 

Cold is the hand on the angel of death
Drawing you to it's embrace 
From a caress
Reducing to strangle your neck

Pulling into and from grace
This is your fate
Stare into the eyes of your sin
Every morning you begin

Who are your family?
Who are your friends?
Lost in the culprit of needles and pins
Tommy was itchin'

The fix in the kitchen
He made a decision 
He wanted to scratch
Chasing the dragon

But facing the dragon
Is not really something
He wanted to catch
But he finally did

I wonder
Did he try to repent?
As life slipped from his eyes
Scratching

[Chorus] 

We still love you
We will miss you
We still love you
Is it blissful?

We still love you
We will miss you
We still love you
Is it bliss?

Eric, My cousin 
I call to your spirit!
Answer!
I know you can hear it!

I conjure your soul with these lyrics!
Manifest some kind of appearance!
Scare us
I don't even care 

It's better then just wondering
Where it was that you were carried
I helped carry you physically to be buried
But the rest, every individual varies

Party rockers, non-stoppers, and our names are def

The 'F' is for fresh, 'A' and 'D' def

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Steals across the meadows of my heart

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

I just recall picnic time and you.",Theme from Picnic,1960
J.J. Johnson,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1961
J.J. Johnson,"What's new?
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Lovely as ever I must admit

Oh, what's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee, but it's nice to see you again

What's new? Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand
I understand, adieu

Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed: I still love you so

J.J. Johnson,"Nobody's heart belongs to me
Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

",Nobody's Heart [From by Jupiter],1963
J.J. Johnson,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

J.J. Johnson,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

A very strange, enchanted boy

Without a love of my own

And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow

No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand

J.J. Sheridan,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory,1999
J.J. Sheridan,"There's a spot in my heart,
Which no colleen may own.
There's a depth in my soul,
Never sounded or known;

There's a place in my mem'ry,
My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

[Chorus]
Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,

You'll guard me and you'll guide me

Made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me

J.J. Sheridan,"I don't know how to love him.
What to do, how to move him.
I've been changed, yes really changed.
In these past few days, when I've seen myself,

I seem like someone else.
I don't know how to take this.
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.

And I've had so many men before,
In very many ways,
He's just one more.
Should I bring him down?

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love,
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny,
I should be in this position.
I'm the one who's always been

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,
Running every show.
He scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me,
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope.

I'd turn my head. I'd back away.
I wouldn't want to know.
He scares me so.
I want him so.

J.J. Sheridan,"Christine:
Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Once in a while
Please promise me you'll try

When you find
That once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way things might have been

Think of me
Think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me
Trying too hard
To put you from my mind

Recall those days
Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you

Raoul:
Can it be
Can it be Christine
Bravo!
Long ago
It seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were

My one companion
You were all
That mattered
You were once
A friend and father
Then my world
Was shattered

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Wishing you were
Somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed,
Somehow you would
Be here

Wishing I could
Hear your voice again
Knowing that I
Never would
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed
I could

Passing bells
And sculpted angels,
Cold and monumental,
Seem, for you,
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Knowing we must
Say goodbye
Try to forgive
Teach me to live
Give me the strength
To try

No more memories,
No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye.",Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,2000

She real thick, nice shape 5-4
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click, in the Expo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Damn natural, never walk from the store
Gimmie a minute, and get down with a pro
P. I. M. P. P. O. get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex, we can sport mine called S.E.X
Platinum link, all in effect
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax

Then we head to the bar
Never give her money, 'cause she know she a star

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)

23's like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro' girl, if you want to blaze
You can let your hair down, while the AC blow

I'll keep it on the low

Rather be, let it test why'all

Can I undress to relax why'all

Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it, if it's that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I can't believe how they sent them off
Took the number then I'm in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling, shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it, but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces, checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh, he flossing
Baby girl, I don't do this often
In the five double 0 for sho'
We still ride the Cadillac, slam the doors
Suppose I kick back, keep the flows
Dressed to impress, then flex the ho
Check the dough

Before I strip you, I just need to know
Can I do you?

Had me feeling on your booty, and the brother was a fiftyball
For you, I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was start wondering when if I'm a get the draws
Let me know if I'm in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin through stunting why are you running
Cause I'm coming with some pimp-type game
Iced out charm, chromed out truck
Coming through balling like I don't really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty, an purple, with the windows up
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me, backing me
To a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb??????
Hold it in, then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out
Don't ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk

The money, power, money and power
How can this world rotate without this money and power?
If I had money, I'd keep my peoples outta poverty
'Cause ain't no more starvin' when y'all around me (Shiiit)
This what it gotta be B, and every playa got paper
Shinin' like a superstar, with matchin' minks and gators
Keepin' our family off this poor table
Cause ain't no food on it
And every crab up in this bucket gotta move on it
I'm just a ghetto boy

Livin' in this ghetto world
Stayin' with' this ghetto chick
Hopin' to have a ghetto girl
And after all, ain't no spaces for that
How can we live up in this world, when ain't no place for the blacks?
Cause every dollar got a dream behind it, we seem to be blinded
Malcom X, he had to dream to remind us
Believe me, havin' money can have this world fucked up

Until I seen the hustle, when niggas ridin' stretch Navigators
But, more now then later, I should come up
Cause I seen my homie on the block, slangin' rocks
And then his spot get gunned up
I never visioned it'd be homicide
Because they told me he'll live
That's what they said when my homie Boosie died
Could all these millions bring my nigga back?
Could all these millions feed children?
Could all these millions make my spirit fat?
Would all my friends become my enemies?
When my family becomes astonished
Will my strengths becomes an enemy?

J.P. Johnson,"Gee, how I miss
Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

Now I run my hands
Through silvery strands,
You left me blue turning gray over you.

You used to be
So good to me,
That's when I was a novelty.

You've found someone new,

J.P. Jones,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Blue tears keep on fallin', for you dear
Now you're gone
Blue days, black nights
My heart keeps on calling for you dear

Memories of you make me sorry
I gave you reason to doubt me
But now you're gone and I am left here all alone
With blue memories, I think of you

J.P. Nadeau,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2006
J.P. Pennington,"Won't you please turn up the lights
I can't hardly see
Thank you kindly but that don't help
Maybe it's just me
It seems I've had this problem since
My baby packed up to leave

You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh, the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin' in my heart

Could you pull those curtains back
And let the morning in
What's that you say? Oh, is that a fact?
Well it still seems mighty dim
I guess I'll just have to live this way 
Unless my baby comes back again

You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh, the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin' in my heart

And as the last ray of love 
Slowly disappears
Alone in this endless night
I just see one thing clear

You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh, the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin' in my heart

Night is fallin' in my heart
In my heart
In my heart

Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speakin'
Ha ha ha ha ha, oh you sweet thing
Do I what?
Will I what?
Oh baby, you know what I like

[Chorus]
Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a pony tail a-hangin' down
That wiggle in the walk 
And giggle in the talk
Makes the world go 'round
There ain't nothin' in the world
Like a big-eyed girl
That makes me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose, like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby, that's what I like

What's that baby, but, but, but?
Oh honey
But?
Oh baby, you know what I like

J.P. Richardson,"Well in North Carolina, way back in the hills,

Hey there Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are lookin' good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want
Listen to me, Little Red Ridin' Hood
I don't think little big girls should
Go walkin' in these spooky old woods alone

What big eyes you have
The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
So, just to see that you don't get chased
I think I ought, to walk, with you for a ways

What full lips you have
They're sure to lure, someone bad
So, untill you get to grandma's place
I think you ought, to walk, with me and be safe

I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
Till I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walkin' with you alone

I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf, so I won't

What a big heart I have
The better to love you with

Even bad wolves can be good
I'll try to keep satisfied
Just to walk close by your side
Maybe you'll see things my way
Before we get to grandma's place

J.P.R.,"Huh
Yea baby girl, you know how it's going down
2003, Do or Die, J.P., Twista still

Well, when I heard a knock at the door
Must of been the girl that I met on the lo
She real thick, nice shape 5-4
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click, in the Expo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Damn natural, never walk from the store
Gimmie a minute, and get down with a pro
P. I. M. P. P. O. get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex, we can sport mine called S.E.X
Platinum link, all in effect
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax
P.L.A.Y.E.R., giving her eyes
Then we head to the bar
Never give her money, 'cause she know she a star
Did you want to ride in my car?

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)

23's like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro' girl, if you want to blaze
You can let your hair down, while the AC blow
Before you get in, I just need to know

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
I'll keep it on the low
Do you? Do you?

In the mood, like yes why'all
Rather be, let it test why'all
Light the be	 if it's special
Can I undress to relax why'all
Well, stretch out like a Lex ball
If it's that raw, to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it, if it's that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I can't believe how they sent them off
Took the number then I'm in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling, shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it, but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces, checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh, he flossing
Baby girl, I don't do this often
In the five double 0 for sho'
We still ride the Cadillac, slam the doors
Suppose I kick back, keep the flows
Dressed to impress, then flex the ho
Check the dough

Do you? (Do you? Do you Do you?)
I'll keep it on the lo
Do you? Do you?
Do you?

An it really don't matter, where we go
Let's sip this Henny, pop this Mo
Before I strip you, I just need to know
Can I do you?

Now I was kicking, when I met you in the club
Had me feeling on your booty, and the brother was a fiftyball
For you, I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was start wondering when if I'm a get the draws
Let me know if I'm in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin through stunting why are you running
Cause I'm coming with some pimp-type game
Iced out charm, chromed out truck
Coming through balling like I don't really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty, an purple, with the windows up
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me, backing me
To a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb??????
Hold it in, then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out
Don't ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk
Do you like the way I ride
Do you like the way I pimp spree's
You can let me down easy
Cause' still ill be the player Twista slash be a P.I.M.P
Now baby, do you?

J.P.R.,"Ohh yeaahhh
Whoaaa-ho-ohhhhhhh

I wonder what my life would be if I
Had that paaaper (Ohhhhhh)
I'm just a ghetto boy
A little ghetto boy (Ohhhhh)

They tell me it's like
The money, power, money and power
How can this world rotate without this money and power?
If I had money, I'd keep my peoples outta poverty
'Cause ain't no more starvin' when y'all around me (Shiiit)
This what it gotta be B, and every playa got paper
Shinin' like a superstar, with matchin' minks and gators
Keepin' our family off this poor table
Cause ain't no food on it
And every crab up in this bucket gotta move on it
I'm just a ghetto boy

Livin' in this ghetto world
Stayin' with' this ghetto chick
Hopin' to have a ghetto girl
And after all, ain't no spaces for that
How can we live up in this world, when ain't no place for the blacks?
Cause every dollar got a dream behind it, we seem to be blinded
Malcom X, he had to dream to remind us
Believe me, havin' money can have this world fucked up
But it can't answer yo' prayers, when you get down on yo' luck

I wonder what my life would be if I
Had that paaaper
I'm just a ghetto boy (Ohhh yes I am)
A little ghetto boy (Ohhh)

Now if I live on top of the world
Shinin' like, diamonds and pearls (Diamonds and pearls)
Still a ghetto boy (Yeaah)
A little ghetto boy (Mmm)

I done lived my life up in the, ghetto
Mama workin' hours
Tryina feed a, family
Daddy's in and out
Takin' baths with' broken showers
Next-door neighbor gave us the vapors
Callin' cops, cause we known to plot
Break in they home, on some bogus capers
But I never thought that it would affect me later
Until I seen the hustle, when niggas ridin' stretch Navigators
But, more now then later, I should come up
Cause I seen my homie on the block, slangin' rocks
And then his spot get gunned up
I never visioned it'd be homicide
Because they told me he'll live
That's what they said when my homie Boosie died
Could all these millions bring my nigga back?
Could all these millions feed children?
Could all these millions make my spirit fat?
Would all my friends become my enemies?
When my family becomes astonished
Will my strengths becomes an enemy?
Is this ""pretend to be? 
A vivid and magically?
A vivid and magically
I wonder, I wonder

I wonder, whoooooaa-ooohhh-oaahhhhh

I wonder what my life would be if I
Had that paaaper (Had that paper)
I'm just a ghetto boy (Ohhh, ohhh)
A little ghetto boy (If I liiive)

Now if I live on top of the world (The world)
Shinin' like, diamonds and pearls (Diamonds and peaaarls, yeah)
Still a ghetto boy (Mmm)
A little ghetto boy

Back in the days, when I was poor
I'm not poor anymore
But somedays
I said I wish that I was poor again

Back in the days, when I was poor
I'm not poor anymore (Da-da-da-da)
But somedays
I said I wish that I was poor again (Ohhh)

I remember when I stole deep
When it was cold outside
Sellin' packs and holdin' heat
Run up and I fold in the street
Penitentiary moldin' me
And the city get as cold as, thugs
I wonder will I come up? Get gunned up?
Turned up? Or anotha' sta-tistic
And my mama just goin', ball-istic
Realistic-ally, don't wanna do the caper
But I gotta get the paper, niggas ballin'
'Cause the county judge is callin'
And the lawyer keep stallin'
Why my niggas keep fallin', victim
To the same old theory?
Another bad outcome, leavin' mothers just out-done
Then it suddenly just sinked in
That my nigga just died last weekend, tears rollin'
And I'm goin' off the deep end
But I gotta stay stong, for the mothers and the kids
Just standin' there lookin' at the chalk line
In his hand was a cocked nine
Now should I walk a straight line?
'Cause ""Time After Time""
I just wanna rewind, and talk to you
At the grave site, gave it to 'em every day and night
But it's alright, and I really wanna talk to you
I really wanna talk to you (Just really wanna talk to you)

Wassup junior, I've been waitin' to say this for a long time
I love you nigga, and I miss you

I wonder what my life would be if I (Whoooaa)
Had that paaaper (Whooaa)

You make me happy when skies are grey

I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
And I hung my head and cried

J.R.,"It's gravity
Keeps pullin' me down

I pen songs for the perishin' and parishioners
Them hearers and them listeners, the home and the visitors
This is not a game, you can't tame or make it purty
They say the earth cursed, so our mouths stay dirty
There's mud on the track, a slug in ya' back
Police done pulled you over wit' a gun in ya' lap
And you ain't the power to make it through this parade
The workers can't keep the profit everything here is vain
My job oppressive, I strive for my blessin's
The pastor so corrupt it's hard to ride with his message
Riches destroy the owners, the government think they own us
My onus is to keep the police from ridin' all up on us
Leavin' money to kids who spend it on getting' blitz
Say, what's the point of livin' to give it up in the end
Then again, all my sin has been pinned to the cross
I know I'm free forever from this land of the lost

[Chorus]
Yeah, every time I think I'm flying
I'm just falling
So close to touching the sky
But gravity keeps pulling me back down
But I can't stay here forever
I want to go, ooh one day! 
I want to go
Somewhere where there's no gravity

Somebody told me there was no such thing as truth
I said, ""If that's the case then why should I believe you?""
Murder, money, and mayhem, every place that I lay in
My problems follow suit, I'm tailor-made for this, ain't I?
It's deep. You wanna go deep? I'll take you deep
Reality is really just cheap
Yo' eyes wide open apparently, but you sleep
And everything you have in your hands you'll never keep
So why hold on, I flow on to go on, before long I float on
Eternal life is what I'm thinkin' I'mma bank my hope on
Believe me, easy is irrelevant
The devil want us burning for the hell of it
Elephants in the room say we can't talk about impending doom
Or we gospel rappin' or preaching people out of they shoes
It's cool, I'll be that dude. We glued to our depravity, 
Until somebody free us from this gravity. Fly!

Then I heard a hater say he ain't fire no more!
What?! That was me standin on your block with the razor blade
In my mouth back when hip hop was hip hop
For those who don't know or forget
To make y'all happy with Mary J. who Puff came to get (Me)
Then who called for Total to make y'all see (Me)
Then who he called again for Special Delivery (That a be me)
There's nothin you could tell me, I rocked every hole in the wall
Then arena to arena with R. Kelly
Who made you feel beautiful while gettin lifted (Me)

The only anger I got, is when I'm f**kin up a E beat
Keep runnin your lips and I'm a have you dancin like the crips
Turn your six pack to some barbeque rib tips
Mother hot damn this man jam like a phone
And plus the sh*t I get more draws than a dresser 
When I flow, there's no one deafer
Make you make the ugly face like Lamont's Aunt Ester
You can't stealth me my tank is too healthy
Even negative situations help me

J.R.,"Hair, check!
Shoes, check!
A brand new fit, lookin' cool, check!
I'm lookin' in the mirror like oooh, yes!
To cover for an insecure dude, check!
But she won't feel me and they won't like me
If I ain't in them J's or them brand new nikes
Let's dig deeper inside my psyche
When it's all said and done even I don't like me
He live in the gym and his hair stay faded
Late model car so they think he made it
He's Christian, he gave his life
But he still ain't satisfied in the savior Christ
Still finds his identity in looks and cars
If he only knew that he ain't have to look so hard
If he looked in God
It may seem odd
But he be so satisfied, he can leave it all

I'm not the shoes I wear
I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm not the house I live in
I'm not the car I drive, no

I'm not the job I work
You can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ

Got her hair done, toes, nails
Is that Her, well it's hard to tell
Cause she's so caked up in all that make up
It's like she tryna make up for what she ain't but
She's a saint, but so confused
Cause she's been rejected by all these dudes
That tell her on a scale of 10 she's a two
But that ain't true
If she only knew
In Christ she is loved, she secure and accepted
Never be rejected by God whose elected her
Her beauty is her Godliness
And she ain't gotta flaunt it cause it's obvious
Identity is found in the God we trust
And any other identity will self destruct
Identity is found in the God we trust
And any other identity will self destruct

I'm not the shoes I wear
I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm not the house I live in
I'm not the car I drive, no

I'm not the job I work
You can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ

Hey, how do I gain success
Why do I say I'm blessed, huh
Is it the car that I drive
Or the place that I rest
Or the way that I dress, now, now
Is the cause of my pride
The stage and the set
Or my face in the press, now, now
It's the applause that dies
When the praise is less
If my face is depressed, then, then
It's cause my value and worth is in the volume of the work I produce in the booth
It's a prize and a curse if defined by the perks when the truth is through
Man I won't feel like I don't want to live no more, no more, no more
Cause they don't like me, like they did in 04, 04, 04
So I swallow my pride empowered by God, I'm complete in Him
He's got peace God's priest, I'm in
In His presence weak is strength
Meet His kin
We His brethren
Read this list
Me forgiven
He's dismissed guilt and my sin
And then I find my worth cause I'm Jesus' friend

I'm not the shoes I wear
I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm not the house I live in
I'm not the car I drive, no

I'm not the job I work

By nothing on God's green earth

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,
