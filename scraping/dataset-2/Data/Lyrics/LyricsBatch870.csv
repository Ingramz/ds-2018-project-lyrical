Quintet of the Hot Club of France,"Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away
That's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay

All up and down the whole creation,

I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation,
Oh, for the old folks at home

Ah-oh-oh!

Oh, my my!

Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home

When the weatherman says it's raining
You'll never hear me complaining

Quintet of the Hot Club of France,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Quintet of the Hot Club of France,"You went away
I let you

And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

Forget about me

And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love

Quintet of the Hot Club of France,"Why shouldn't I take a chance when romance passes by?
Why shouldn't I know of love?
Why wait around when each age has a sage who has sung

To be sure when day is done
That the hour is coming when you'll be kissed

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Quintet of the Hot Club of France,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

 While my heart keeps on singing 
 Just a lonely refrain

 Hoping I'll find my love, find my love

 Who knows some day someone may come along
 And change my lonely song to happiness

If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

To the eyes of Dinah Lee!

Ayer quemé mi casa

Si te preguntan di que no sabías nada
Hoy no me detendrán
Ayer quemé mi casa
Aún tengo en la retina
el humao de las llamas
mis páginas escritas
Ayer por la mañana
bajé a por gasolina
Despues quemé mi casa
por no quemar mi vida
Hoy no me detendrán
Puedo tratar de acariciar la luna
Puedo viajar lo lejos que soñé
Puedo volar sobre las nubes sucias
después de ver mi casa arder

Quique González,"Hay una calle que lleva tu nombre
En la ciudad del viento
Después de tanto tiempo
Me harté de esperarte y se cayó el letrero

Fin de temporada
Para todos los amantes de lo ajeno
Todos los teléfonos que esperan tu llamada
Están ardiendo

Soy veraneante accidental
En la ciudad del viento
Subo la montaña que se oculta
Tras el vuelo de tu falda

Tengo en la memoria la estructura
De los labios incorrectos
Y otra de las formas que aparecen
En los mapas que dibujas
Cuando te desnudas

En todos los lugares te encuentro
En todos los lugares
Me siento un habitante más
En la ciudad del viento

Hay una calle que lleva tu nombre
Pero no me acuerdo
Después de aquel invierno
Traté de encontrarte en los cafés del puerto

Fin de temporada
Para los cantantes y los camareros
Doblan las campanas y las caravanas
Salieron del pueblo

En todos los lugares te encuentro
En todos los lugares
Me siento un habitante más

En la butaca del cine, en una boca de metro
Y en todas esas esquinas que solíamos doblar

Es una historia que se escribe en los portales
La breve intensidad de las primeras luces
Y los conserjes de noche cuidan de los hostales
Y todas las camareras que quisieron escuchar

Algo tendrían que contar los escalones
Con pantalones arrastrados por el suelo
Algo el asiento trasero que me ofrecía tu coche
Y el humo del cenicero que acabó por rebosar

The other day sometime ago on the radio
They played that song again it still sounds the same

Outside my window all the rain is pouring down again
The night is still its way past three
Another cup of tea 'coz I can't sleep
In two hours you'll get out of bed
Chocolate milk with cheese on toasted bread

And outside my window all the rain keeps pouring down again

A lot of dates and names and places
Great deal of women I have known

But as I sit here and remember all the things that I've been through
It appears to me quite clear now how one thing always remained true
I have a gift that have make me wonders to write and sing a song
It pulled me through a lot of hard times and probably will do so for quite long

Two continents I've traveled
I've made a million friends
I've talked to press, TV and radio
I've been exhausted, joyed and bored beyond sense

I have recorded things I've written great deal of albums I did sell
I've done what many only dream of
It's been sheer heaven mixed with just a little hell
I've seen my face on the covers of the magazines

We go through many different stages in our life though short it is
We take on symbols sounds and faces but in the end you're all there is

This is me playing and me singing it's for you all to either love or hate

Is no life at all

Even my pubic hair has got it's share of split ends

The ways of fate are vicious or is that just an excuse we use

I'm a man always very cautious before I choose, oh yeah
I'm a man always ready to wait many years
I have practically nothin' left to shred if I'd lose again
My prize seem to be to end up choking on my tears

For when the lights have gone out I seem unable to sleep
The pictures flick in my mind I close my eyes still I see
I'd give it all that I've got to make it go away
Nothin' can change what's been done nor what we do or say

I can feel it coming how it's crawling up from inside
Less time now in between to recover and there's nowhere that I can run or hide
I wish that I could scream and shout out really smash all things up in my realm
To let go of my regrets and anguish but tell me how to smash one real bad dream

Once again I have found myself awake in the night

To toss an eye exchange a smile from miles apart it seems
And yet it's hard to tell what's really happing from dreams
Is it just that we've both thinking is this stuff for real
And what if in the midst of this all what if some would see

If this real it seems to me to be good ol' infatuation
What if I am wrong and mix the facts with my imagination
Knee deep in this mess no wonder I don't sleep too good at night

Hey, were you looking my way or was I standing in the way
I'm like a moth hot for the flame I just can't help it

I've been thinking should you accept an invitation
Can't help this fascination and yet if you were here I'd freexe
I count the days 'til I'll see you again and wish you'll be there
And yet if you would come near again I'd get those jelly knees

So we toss an eye exchange a smile but we never move too close
And yet make sure to make it short we want no one to know
Can I help that I am wondering is this for real
Are you thinking much the same as I then you must feel like me
Until the two of us have come to terms with how to act from now on

Qwote,"[Trina: spoken]
Hi this is Trina
And I'm standing 5'2 125 pounds 34, 26, 36
Beautiful lite grey eyes, long black curly hair that
Hangs down to the middle of my back and right now I'm home alone and
I'm looking to try something new so if your listening
Why don't you leave me a message
Ha ha ha ha

[Chorus:]
Take your hands and close your eyes and picture me
Touching your thighs do you feel your body next to me
I'm in your mind but physically it feels so real when we're on the phone
The way you talk and the moan I put your body to the test it's not
A fantasy but it's phone sex

[Trina:]
What's your description I told you mine I was feeling real horny
Called the party line dude sounded so good I ain't waste
No time I'm a take my clothes off and just go for mine
The way that he was talking and describing himself I picture
Reggie bush and I ain't seeing nothing else my eyes closed tight
On the living room couch one hand up my (umm) putting fingers
In my mouth cheating on my man I'm getting my freak on long as it ain't real
I ain't doing nothing wrong just a dirty fantasy on the
Football field me laid in the grass wanna love how it feel
Pulling on my hair biting on my lips throwing it back thrusting my hips
Pouring champagne down and he taking sweet sips got me bout to climax he took me on a trip ah

[Chorus:]

[Trina:]
The next day I called the party line again I was looking for that voice
That's when I bumped in a thug that sounded like trick to me
You should have heard that nasty fantasy
He made me see us in a school house
I was the last student left and was bout to walk out
He said bend over and show him a shot in my private school skirt
So aroused I got hard as a missile I blew on his whistle playing back and forth
For this nigga I can't dismiss you he asked can I kiss then I got wet
This phone bone thing is getting better than sex don't need protection everything's
Safe I even let him spank me I came on his (ah) I know he was so amazed
To hear me come on the phone we wasn't playing no games
We was getting it on ah

[Qwote:]
Do you feel me baby sexing your body touching you softly
Making you want me go head close your eyes
Put your hands on your thighs let's fantasize
From the other end of the line do you feel me baby sexing your body
Touching you softly making you want me go head close your eyes
Put your hands on your thighs let's fantasize
From the other end of the line

We are the warriors at the edge of time
We lurk inside your brain, hide inside your minds

Take heed prisoner, I am the one
Your battle is over before it begun

Many tournaments fought in this land
Flying banners now dashed in the sand
The colours you wear will not keep me
For a child on the run, I am free

The courts and knights of the table
Bold stories of dragon and fable
Your sword is red-stained I can see
For a child on the run, I am free

Silks, satins, riches in plenty
Acres of land, four and twenty

With needles in their flesh

R Romanelli,"Qu'on ne touche jamais aux folies, aux orages
Qui, chez moi, naissent et meurent entre passion et rage
Et que mes grands délires me fassent toujours escorte.
La raison est venue, j'ai demandé qu'elle sorte.

Qu'on ne décide pas de mes joies, de mes larmes.
A chacun son soleil, et à chacun ses drames
Et si le noir, pour moi, est couleur de lumière,
La raison, que m'importe, et qu'elle aille en enfer.

Mais comment voulez-vous, qu'un enfant laboureur,
Si on lui prend sa terre, fasse pousser ses fleurs,
Ses fleurs?

Que jamais on n'écoute, derrière mes volets,
Pour voler mon piano, pour voler mes secrets.
Mes secrets sont pour vous, mon piano vous les porte
Mais quand la rumeur passe, je referme ma porte.

Qu'on ne m'ordonne pas, je suis reine en mon île.
Je suis femme en mon lit, je suis folle en vos villes
Et j'ai choisi mes hommes, j'ai bâti mes empires.
Au diable la raison, et vivent mes délires!

Mais comment voulez-vous qu'un grand Pierrot de Lune
Écrive des chansons, si on lui prend sa plume,

Qu'on ne touche jamais,
Que jamais on n'écoute,
Qu'on ne décide pas,
Qu'on ne m'ordonne pas

Fleurs éclatées comme l'amour à la lumière,
Fabuleux, il marchait,
S'avançant dans le soleil, l'homme en habit rouge,

Dessous les ciels pourpres et or
Au-delà des frontières
Ou qu'ils s'endorment, enlacés
Comme d'éternels fiancés
Dans la blonde lumière

Pour toujours et à tout jamais
Au jardin du silence
Sous leur froide maison de marbre
Dans les grandes allées sans arbre

La chaleur de notre sourire
Comme étreinte dernière

Now we aint talkin about your ordinary girl man, 
There's there's something special about this one
You know what I mean
I mean she fly on the outside but,
It's what's on the inside that counts, right?
Let's get it!

That girl don't walk like the rest of them, 
She don't step out of line because she's reppin' Him, 
Hair and her nails done right, 
But she had better look when you look at her life
she's unimpressed by things
Not desperatae for a man cuz she bows to a King
Past dudes coming at her on the Ave.
But she's transformed, got dope character to match
She walks it out with such class, 
And doesn't put her hope in what she knows won't last, 
So you won't catch her bent in the club
Next Morning, 
Hung over, 
Can't remember the club
And she aint trying the club
And she aint trying to be a diva
But she hope you see a change
Not a frame when you see her
Still fly, but aint gotta be flawless
Some ladies look good
But a Godly women is gorgeous

From her walk to her talk to her hustle, (so cool)
Everything about her so fly (yes you)
Cause sister holds it down, 
In and out of town, 
There's something about this girl
That girl, you girl, 
I see you work, 
Your work, uh huh, 
Cause sister holds it down
there's something about that girl

She stays on the A game,
Glasses, bags in moderation
She aint a slave to the fashions
But she's still a model of the ligtht, 
Following what's right
Not a slave to her passions
Home girl, so thorough
Her steps male it obvious, 
She's not of this world.
She dont chase temporary pleasure
the moment looks good, 
But eternity is better.

She has no problem being anonymous, 
Knowing that God is glorifierd through her accomplishments
She stays shining, not hot in it.
Non-stop!
Cuz she knows who she riding with
Shorty from the block but she liberaeted
Ex-diva
Now she's on that brand new life
So she's proud as sheep

They say, I'm built a little different, 
My shine a little brighter
The way my smile glistens,
Means I made it through the fire
And I appreciate all the dudes that paved the way, 
Cause iron sharpens iron, 
Now I'm sharper on my game
They say behind a good man
Stands a great woman
But I wouldn't be great
If my man wasn''t human
He's taught me hoy to pray, 
Bea a pillar in my home
Yo, my baby girl is coming
So I gotta let then know, 
It's more than being pretty
Dudes noticing your cloths, 
It's about a humble heart
Letting God take control, 
There's nothing like a women, 
Who can walk with pride

Harder than that nigga barrelin' thru ya hood wit two chains
Swangin' like he's nuts, 'cuz he don't give a fuck

It's that westside, connected with that nigga who flow so wreckless
He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I bet this

See no skeep falling off my jeans

Staring in my rear view cant slow down

Arrest me now

I say that I hustle everyday
My men's don't sleep, we always up

Yeah, it's the DJ Khaled, Khaled, Khaled
I do this for the projects
I got the mothafucking gutta on this track
I got the projects on this one

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can to your target
Nothing can save you know

See you dun push the wrong button
And cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka, it was mine

Time and time
They get me out the tandem
Me are da true, I traded mine in
For caveman king

You don't wanna fuck with
The Southside Gotcha boys
Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas
Y'all some boxy boys

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the street life

Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top, east to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled, nigga we the best

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Yo, bdah, bdah, bdah
Khaled, go let me see 'em
Hand me the fucking clever
'Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the evil Kinevel people
Who try to stunt

Call me Danny Glover
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel
Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Nothing can save you now

Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon' shoot a hundred rounds
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old Chevy and Figaro
Blood shed apart my feet

And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me, I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye

Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah
It's the final warning

Khaled, these niggas talking
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin'
I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin

'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors
Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake
I'ma tell you once don't be scared of the Dre

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who your calling
Nothing can save you now

I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that
And it ain't gon' take all day
We know where you live at

I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep 'em mad shawty
That's how we kill 'em babies
Holla Khaled, and tell him I'm on the way now
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town

Look at me it's shawty
So bossy, and I don't feel like that
Can't stop me now, now, now
You see what's happening?
Big shit dun popped off
I'm the best nigga, you can ask Khaled
I'm the best nigga

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you're calling
Nothing can save you know

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can do your target

Now it's over now sings the fat bitch
And you was thinking about marriage
And I was thinking about me
And my shit was so far from being together
I was out here blind on these streets
Trying to beast a rhyme over beats
And these pussy niggas so weak

And my mind was thinking so fucked up
I put hip hop before anything
A lost king though I was finna reign
But for you it's something I can not explain
And I was fighting so much disbelief
And these pills can bring much relief
And I just wanted to be in them flashy lights
With them shining chains and that mink

And I was still chasing rap
And you began hating that
'Cause you would bear all the burden
And I wasn't there that's a fact
And my dreams seemed so close to reach
And there was I so wrong
'Cause when I realized all the hurt I caused
I put a pistol to my dome
Like fuck it I ain't want to live life

The first bed I slept on came out the garbage can
But I knew when I got older I would be the man
Ain't no one ever made it back from where I'm from
But I knew if I kept grindin' oh my time would come
When my daughter was born I really thought it was over
Had to get a nine to five but that's when I was the brokest
If I was gon' change my life you know that I had to focus
Started doing talent shows hoping that somebody noticed

Finally finally finally I get to put the past behind me-hind me
Now everyday meh hustle and grind remind me
No have to struggle anymore 
Ain't this what we do it for 

So many tears we've cried 
So much pain inside
But hear me it ain't over 'till it's over
So many years we've tried
And me no tell no lie

Think rich either that or we die poor

See in the hood its playing ball hustle crack or you die
Born to lose so I had to hustle from day to night
Knew it would happen when I started rapping at the age of five
They told me I wouldn't make it never said that I couldn't try
Grew up with killers my homies were dope dealers
But I don't judge em at all 'cause God knows that we all sinners
Somehow I turned out different now we only getting bigger
And now everybody in the Caribbean's ridin' with us

So finally finally finally I get to put the past behind me-hind me

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying

      Time can't seem to erase
      The vision of your smilin' face

Splashin', callin' out her name 
Just gotta see Jane 
I left her arms to find my way 

To find a place for me in the world outside 
I wasn't alive, I could not survive 
The frantic pace, the constant chase 
To win the race, turned my heart cold inside

Runnin' up a world insane 

Just gotta see Jane 
A town of steel that isn't real 
It could not feel what's in the heart of me 
I was so alone in a world of stone 

I missed her arms, that once held me 
That made me see, I was the lonely one 
But now and then I was runnin' scared 
And I could feel the touch of time 

Turnin' the wheel of life to yesterday 
When love and happiness were mine 
I gotta find that world of Jane and me 
Liked it used to be 

Oh, I gotta see Jane 
Her love for me I pushed aside 
Walked out alone 
To face a world turned cold 

Although I tried I could not survive

Lookin' sexy all the way to the bottom

Now she twerlin' around it, then do a split right in front of it
Ready to go back up when she look at how thick the money get

R. Kelly,"This song goes out to my mother
The one I love
And the one I lost
When it comes down to her
Thinkin' about what my mother's done for me
The love she's given me
Makes it easy to do  a song like this
So this one's for you ma
I love you

Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me
Boy hurry to Sunday school

Filled with the long of glory
We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring

Oh Sadie
Don't you know we love you sweet Sadie
Place no one above you sweet Sadie
Well well well (living in the past)

Sometimes it seems so funny
No money can turn your life around
Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papas' old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry

Sometimes she'd be so happy
Being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song

Oh Sadie maiden
She's loving my song in a special way
Well, well, well
Sweet Sadie
Living in the past

Oh she's never sinning
In love she's always winning yeah
My my my my my
I love you mama

I just can't forget
How you gave me love, oh no
If there's a Heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love
It's a mean world without you
And I surely miss you much mother

And now that you're gone
I'm gonna carry on
'Cause your're cryin' lady, woah Sadie
When I think about the things that you done for me
Hey it brings a joy way down deep inside of me, yeah woh

But I wanna be early, fool
So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in just like the old school
Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery
The sun's blazin', the day is feelin' good to me
I can just smell the funky beats
You know the flavor in between the sheets

I saw my boy Big Al, said Just keep it straight
He said, I know I got a novelty to validate

Are you ready for me?
Before I start, I just wanna get a few things off my chest.
(Take ya time brother)
You see, being in the business that I am in, looks like everything I do,
Everywhere I go, and everything I see,
Seems to be through some kind of magnifying glass-yes- Can I talk about it?
(Talk on,talk on)
While you're looking I suggest you take a good look'
And I hope you find just what it is you're looking for 
(Amen)

Just like that song says- ain't nobody's business what I do
Now can I move on?
(Move on, move on, move on brother Kelly)
I remember when I was trying to be somebody, but I just didn't know nobody
(I didn't know nobody)
But now
(Now)
I said now
(Now)
Can I say it again?
(Gon' and say it again)
Now, every since God has blessed me, it seems that things are going a little 
Bit different(yes it is)

Folks ain't it funny how things can say sometimes,why,even the Statue of 
Liberty want some bump and grind
Can I getta witness off up in them jeeps (Amen)
I don't see nothing wrong with a little truth
Now-now, wait a minute, go that way
Ya see the good book says that the truth is the light,please, I think it's time 
To turn on your lights and see the truth
Can, Can I talk on?
You don't know where I've been, you don't know where I'm going, You don't know 
What I do.

Can I get a witness?
So before you go trying to pass judgment on me, pass judgment on yourself, 
Worry bout yourself, and what yourself is doing, and where yourself is going, 
And who yourself has been with

R. Kelly,"You remind me of something
I just can't think of what it is

You remind me of my jeep, I want to ride it
Something like my sound, I want to pump it
Girl you look just like my cars, I want to wax it
And something like my bank account
I want to spend it, baby

It's something about your love that's got me going crazy
Baby, you know I want you real bad
And girl I really like your freaky style
How can I be down with you?
So get a little closer to my ride
I want to get to know you lady
And hip me up on how to get inside you
Listen, pretty baby

I want to roll it, roll it, roll it, roll it
Is all I want to do for you baby
Girl, it's something kind of sexy
Goin' on about you babe

You remind me of my jeep, I want to ride it
Something like my sound, I want to pump it
Girl you look just like my cars, I want to wax it
And something like my bank account
I want to spend it, baby

You remind me of my jeep, I want to ride it
Something like my sound, I want to pump it
Girl you look just like my cars, I want to wax it
And something like my bank account
I want to spend it, baby

Now I would like to take you on a ride tonight
Girl, you know we'll have so much fun
And give you everything your body needs
Satisfaction guaranteed
So pull up to my bumper and let the system sound
Girl, I bet cha' I can drive you crazy
And let me be the one to drop you off
Babe, listen to me

I want to roll it, roll it, roll it, roll it
Is all I want to do for you baby

All of my rhymes fall all of my days I trade
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade

All you see is the break lights
And hair blowing you know where we going
Or at the club in the rear frontin'
Poppin droppin'
The amounts of cats but we ain't trying to hear nothing
Probably was wilder than wobbly are you the wiggy to give me
Hold me down and make me slow down to be twissy
Keep the ice out the club life - change face
Get on love wife while he on the license plates
Wait - make me think about you even when your not around
Use the bathroom put the toilet seat back down
Got me some sprinkles the hair with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin' lovin' all my ways
Jigga keep me jiggy all of my days

In the middle of the night
Got me thinkin' bout cha babe
Got me dreamin' about cha baby

Baby it's yours forever and ever baby

Everybody want to know the prices of spouse droppin'
Keep it on the low are Kelly style it's quite shockin'
A year ago all I did was spend nights hoppin'
In the club in search of pretty faces and night stalkers
Who would have thought I'd walk down the aisle
Rice droppin' got you a nice rock and
Now it's on and poppin' droppin' holiday platinum bracelets

Mais comment font ces autres à qui tout réussit?
Qu'on me dise mes fautes, mes chimères aussi
Moi j'offrirais mon âme, mon cœur et tout mon temps
Mais j'ai beau tout donner, tout n'est pas suffisant

Quand des larmes me rongent que d'autres ont versées
La vie n'est pas étanche, mon île est sous le vent
Les portes laissent entrer les cris même en fermant

Dans un jardin, l'enfant, sur un balcon des fleurs
Ma vie paisible où j'entends battre tous les cœurs
Quand les nuages foncent, présages des malheurs
Quelles armes répondent aux pays de nos peurs?

Si l'on changeait les choses un peu, rien qu'en aimant donner

Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say

Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and scarf

You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay
But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away

And these two women they, they poured
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that

And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin' me and shit
Hittin' me with all sorts of type shit (Damn)

On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife

Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be dropped off

Comes back on around and back on around

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
In a state of shock that's what it left me
Take it from a man who knows
That three ain't company
No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself

Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house
And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help
Must be because of what my old man did to her

Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands

There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you
(If I could turn back)
Forever honest and true to you
(If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you
(If I could turn back the hands)

(If I could turn back)
That would be my will
(If I could turn back)
Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands
(If I could turn back the hands)

I'm going down, yes I am
(If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
(If I could turn back the hands)

(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
(If I could turn back)
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you
Love you love you love you

I do all this for you
You contemplating on me
Or is it him
Or is it me
Or is it him
He told you he'd be there for you
And he wasn't
I told you I'd be there for you
And I was
And still is the real is
Who takes care of biz
Took you from apartments
And got you home like The Wiz
I'm not the kind of guy
To give you everything
But if you're real then
You can get some ice in your rings
You and me straight to the crib
Off the tour bus
Spottin' my eyes, fireplace, big as us
It really don't matter
Who's first in the shower
Fruit platter from a young maid every hour
And when it comes down to the dollar
You can have it
All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit
Friends come around don't be ready to change
Treat me like a stepchild when I'm up on my game
Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain
So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name

Ooh baby, I want you here with me
And give you everything
That your heart desires
Lady can you feel me
Do you wanna be with me for always
Baby can't you see
What you do to me
when he do the things that he has done to you baby

You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
Cause I can do those things if I'm wit you, baby

Now who took you in when that nigga put you out
And who picked you up when that nigga put you down
Restraining orders keep that fool from around
Had to set you up in a spot downtown
See I was the one who was there for you
But I'm not the one that's gonna play the two
Channel bags in the trunk what you gon' do
You could treat the future like a menu
As long as I'm the only one to bend you
And when you wanna take a flight I'm the one to send you
Never be the one that's out to hurt you
Tell you that I'm there and then desert you

Ay, tantas cosas que quiero
Decirte yo quiero
Hacer por ti
But first we must dance

Private cotillion style
One lady's fantasy
Trip to Milan tonight
Exclusive shopping spree

Mansions await, your scent
That smells just like treasure
Dining with me in suites
That overlooks the shore

As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Dancin' with a rich man
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance?
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
Dancin' with a rich man
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

Kissing the feet of you
While listening to bonsais
And your angelic grace
Wearing Victoria

Passionate love with you
Hearing you, ""Oh, oui oui""
Some antique jewelry from
Kenshire’s gallery

As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Dancin' with a rich man
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance?
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
Dancin' with a rich man
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

And when you'll elevate
Like visions of grandeur
Mademoiselle and me
Behind the villa doors

Sunsets on yellow sand
That’s where we rendezvous
Chapels of Valentine
Is just to name a few

As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Dancin' with a rich man
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
Dancin' with a rich man

Yo, for those who live the way that I live
We came a long way
From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow
Ain't nothing free in the world in life
No matter who you are, everybody got they price
And some cost more than other's
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips

I never heard her ask for some car with the chromed out wheels
But all she wanted was some love and affection
But all I did all the time was neglect
The fact that she was lonely, I used to be her homey
I used to talk about how I was gonna get us out of the hood
But as long as we're together as a family, then it's all good

Because any man can make a baby
But it takes a real man to be a father
Talking 'bout a family, the kid, you and me
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality
You see love is wrong and love is right
But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking 'bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality

Be careful were the words the last time we had our talk
And your truth sound absurd so my pride just let you walk
When all the time knowing that I didn't mean
To hollar out and call you bitch and tell you leave
I admit it, I was wrong but now it's over come on home
I can't take it here is where you belong
Even out the window looking for the mailman
I hope he's got a letter says, I'm missing you, in the mail
And then I saw you with another, made it hard for me to breathe
But when I played the game for gives
I should've played the game for keeps

You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell
You don't like my songs well it pays the bills
And you cut me down 'cause I keep it real
Sometimes I want to fly far away from here
To another place it ain't worth these tears
Sometimes at night when I close my eyes
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying
If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust
See I work so hard just to get ahead
If it wasn't for God I'd probably be dead
Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down
But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out
If yo had  your way it'd be lock and key
Everywhere I go trouble follows me
Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind

Forgive me father for I have sinned
When was your last confession

His true fears he left without a care
And that was more than I could bare
When you need my help I never tell you no
When I need your love you got somewhere to go
I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit
I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick
I get mad as hell but that's ok
Kick off these shoes 'cause I'm here to stay
I gotta let you know got no time to play
So feel me and all that you hear me say
What I'm building up you can't tear it down
'cause it's built on solid Rockland ground
We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style
Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky
Nothing inmy view, hey I can fly
Y'all just hate, I can't take no more
And if you feel me raise your hand and show

This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel
Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo

'Cause when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no

And then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it)

Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell, the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah (ooh, yeah)
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too, too many times
Now I can't come around

When a woman's fed up
Mama taught me along time ago 
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
Oh no, it's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
Then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it)

Yeah
You can cry a river
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago

Yes, it was and I miss her

See I was the one who picked her up 
When so called friends let her down

And I was the one who took her in 
When that fool put her out,

Tell me why?

Why?

I wanna know
 Why, baby?

Now I put my trust in him
I can't believe he slept with her behind my back
I went out on a limb
I even covered up to keep his thing in tact
What he had in me was something real 
That's so hard to come about
But he betrayed me
There was a photo and some laundry that I found

What you mean ""What's going wrong""?
Kelly's telling me that you're sleeping wit another woman
Just because she sees me with her doesn't mean I sleeping with her
Well, if you not sleeping with her what the hell you doing with her?
Damn, I could be just talking to her
Or you could be just sleeping with her. 
Now son, man to man, we both know the game
Yeah, but what's that?

Wait a minute, now you know all about heartache and pain.

And tear down the walls in this house
You used to tell me sweet things
Sweet things in the morning time
Now all you do is hurt me
And think that everything is fine

You better be careful what you say to me
'Cause it might turn around on you
You better be careful what you do to me
'Cause somebody might do it to you

Now who was there for you when your ass was out of work?

R. Kelly,"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you


Don't let him sing you a sad song No baby
Waiting for love like this too long
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby
All that you need I can give you
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on
I do, satisfy you
You don't have to wait on him

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
the first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, Armor All Benz and endless papes
God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
without the FBI catching feelings

[Chorus]

From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 
Up in the hotel, smoking on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

[Chorus]

Growing up project-struck, looking for luck dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up, giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny?  Getting put on to crack money
With all the gun play, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

Everyday is a scuffle 
Turnin' them corners to get my hustle 
Every single dollar is a struggle 
That's how it is comin' up in the ghetto 

[Maus-Berg: ]
Now I don' been through it all pushin' work on the boulevard 
Runnin' from the 5-0 in somebody else car 
Ghetto dreams so it seems to be easy 
Think about my life & I get queasy 
Pumpin' the pimp knowin' it ain't helpin' me 
But the ghetto got me trapped thinkin' this is how it's s'posed to be 
A cold thang when you knowin' yo' gang ain't got yo' back 
But you still put yo' life on the line for no snaps. 

[R.Kelly: ]
This ghetto world is one big battlefield 
That's why we get rich and move to them hills 
Everywhere we go the haters tag along 
But don't let that stop you get yo' hustle on 

[Maus-Berg:] 
But dog you gotta do yo' thang get yo' grind on 
Eliminate the fake & keep yo' game strong 
Don't let the streets be yo' downfall 
Keep it real with yo'self & you gon' rise 'til you ball dog 

[Chorus ]

[Quik:] 
It's gettin' down to ground level but tryin' to keep time 
'cause my hustle & my tustle is my beats & my rhymes 
And I'm lovin' this collabo' 'cause Rock Land is saucy 
And Quik is trying to get Versace staying flossy wit Mausy 
But the... 

[Maus-Berg: ]
...drama don't stop but you can make it better 
Don't point your finger at the next man get yo' cheddar 
Lifestyles of a thug ebonic definition dog nothin' but love 
But we gon' ride to 'til we can't ride no mo' 
Pop a bottle a pair of D's and let the wind blow 
When you get it appreciate it 'cause those who ain't got it gon' hate 
Every dime is a struggle so I'ma suffer everyday 

[Quik: ]
Now my conscience got me wonderin' do I be in the flow 
And this sucka's got me wonderin' if he friend or foe 
Now do I sin to grow, knowin' there's consequences 
And I'm tired of gettin' bent 'cause it's dullin' my senses

One nice day and now she calling me boo

And you calling me singing the sad tune
I wish Kelly would pick up the celly
Got a Philly in a telly with cramps in her belly
Now I can get freaky with some K-why-jelly

The more the pressure

Sitting high up on a hill
Pressin' the buttons on the control
Flipping through channels on TV
Wondering when you're coming home
And take care of family
At least you can call and say I'm busy
At least you can say I'm running late
At least you can give some kind of notice
Let somebody know that you're okay
At least you can take some time to phone
At least you can just one day stay home
At least you can take me out to eat
If you love me, you would've done those things
You won't miss me till I'm gone
Impossible to drink from a well that's gone dry, yeah

I decided to stay home tonight
I decided I'ma treat you right
I decided to be there for you
Decided to be on my P's and Q's

Decided I'ma take you out weekends
Decided to give you a reason to trust
These are decisions that I make for love

Enough is enough no more running around
(Searchin' for what's right here at home)
Because my luck is 'bout to turn around

And I just can't let it happen whoa whoa I

I wish, I wish, I wish

Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

How I used to kick it on the front porch

And how I used to lay back and smoke weed

I wish that I could touch you now

It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

And how I used to club hop on weekends

Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half

How I used to street perform on Friday

And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday

Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind
That what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down

I know stress, drama, niggaz upsettin my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, tryin to put dents in my armor

But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a betta bitch
You heart the rhetoric, Jigga hit me over the head
With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothin' gon' change

Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsche's
Boxes with glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest you've been warned
But niggas don't get the picture 'til the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinkin' 'til six in the mornin'

In the back of the club with ma-ma
Poppin' bottles of Cris with ma-ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma-ma
Throwin' hundreds up for grabs for ma-ma
Cause it's about to go down tonight
I'm a be drinkin' 'til the early liz-ight (that's right)

Take three honies just to make me feel ri-zight

They say my, my, my, my
Anytime they see them big things only cause I

Don't worry 'bout expenses cause I got that sho' 'nough
Ready to BOO like I'm fresh outta jizzail

Pop Cris if you like, my ice glist' in the light
I'm wit Roc-Land right, so I'm rich for life
I'm like Heaven, everybody wanna get to me
How you make it to the gates and forget the key?
I'm the one God chose so you blessed through me

Hey yo I come through stunnin',
Plus I'm gettin' blunted in the new six-hundred with the big rims on it
We rock rocks that'll light ya shoulders
Gotta lotta hot cars but the drops is colder (ah)
You see V-I-P me, Kelly, Gotti, and Hov'
Drinkin' Cris' like its H-2-O
All we do is spend cheese cause we love the dough
Mami roll more trees before it's time to go

If you got cash money then you feel this shit
And if you rollin' on them things then you feel this shit
If you drunk off in the club then you feel this shit
If you'se a motherfuckin' thug then you feel this shit
If you smokin' on some 'dro then you feel this shit
And if you off that ecstasy you got's to feel this shit
If you sippin' on some Cris' you got's to feel this shit

R. Kelly,"I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood

I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
I wish, I wish, I wish
Good Ol' America!

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
Came to let you know
That your baby boy ain't doing so tough

And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days

You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennesy
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you
Folks don't know the half
I would give it all up
Just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little days and party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
And you know I can see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay

And if I never leave this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Now ever since this money come
Been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish I could trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed

But Y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin' 
This real shit off like a gun

Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em

Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you

Folks don't know the half
I would give it all up
Just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolensces

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
And you know I can see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay

And if I never leave this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a herse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst

And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears 
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you

Folks don't know the half
I would give it all up
Just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Standing here throwing them songs at me
Somebody pray for me

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place
And you know I can see your face
I know you're smiling down on me

Yes, I get busy and know and I do all I can (can)
Had to meet up with them Terror Squad niggas, my man (man)
Yeah, I see a couple of niggas that look real bugged
In the corner frontin' like a bunch of real, live thugs
Frontin', stackin' my ones and I'm countin' these figgas
Got a cooler bitch that's mo' thug than some of these niggas
Fuckin' me now, suckin' my ass late
Straight drinkin' the Henny, sippin' with no chaser
When my bitches be thuggin' niggas that catch vapors
Lovin' how my bitches be givin' me paper
One by one, watchin' y'all niggas drop off
You wack niggas will feel when you hear my gun pop off
Get my rocks off, that's when I'm quick to knock your block off
And hold a gat when I'm fuckin' and never take my socks off

Yeah, we thuggin', rollin' on dubs, and
Off up in the club, wildin' like what
Got Cris' on pop, Henny wit no chaser, and mami don't stop
Throw it up, six o'clock, 'cause I got four hon-eys in the drop
And my man Joe's got the keys to the spot
And it's full of honeys, panties with no tops
We take a puff of dro and be like (oo-oo-oooh",We Thuggin' [Remix],2001

Yo, yo who's dat?

Step into the crib with me tonight (What's up baby)
Kelly's in the mood to make it right

The party's over here and gettin' down, yeah

Hands in the air
Drinks everywhere
Party in the hills
Keepin' it real
Dance out of town 
Ladies all around
Me and the crew doin' what we do

Yeah, beat is bangin' up and down your spine
And all the single women here are fine
(It's a beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing)
Let your body give into your soul
Release the freak in you and lose control

Girl there's a party goin' on
My temperature's warm
So let me freak you through the floor
While the bass is bumpin'
All night if your body can handle

Chillin' at the house on the hill
You gotta say my my my like Johnny Gill
Hey, rich girl, poor girl get the same respect
You can all drink for free and call Earl collect

At the moment of truth with burden of proof
We stack so you can spread love like I chose
The lyrical genius with the R&B messiah
And the roof, the roof we sets on fire

But as long as the party is jumpin, we ain't concerned
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
And everybody who was somebody was there
With they hands in the air bringing in the new year
Yeah, ah-yo, come on

Baguettes on the wrist, it's just for shine
'Cause ain't nobody checkin' out the time
Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind
Baby it's all good so dance tonight

Yeah, beat is bangin' up and down your spine
And all the single women here are fine
(It's a beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing)
Let your body give into your soul
Release the freak in you and lose control

All we want is a party
A reason to celebrate
Now that we got the money, oh yeah
We dance the night away
Nothing but the hands up

So thugs, pop yo' toasters, but don't approach us or
Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsche's
Boxes with glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest you've been warned
But niggas don't get the picture 'til the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinkin' 'til six in the mornin'

In the back of the club with ma-ma
Poppin' bottles of Cris with ma-ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma-ma
Throwin' hundreds up for grabs for ma-ma
Cause it's about to go down tonight
I'm a be drinkin' 'til the early liz-ight (that's right)

And if you rollin' on them things then you feel this shit
If you drunk off in the club then you feel this shit
If you'se a motherfuckin' thug then you feel this shit
If you smokin' on some 'dro then you feel this shit

Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
I wish, I wish, I wish
Ghetto America

Rollin' through the hood, just stopped by to say, what's up
And let you know your baby boy ain't doin' so tough
Even though you passed, goin' on four long years
Still wakin' up late at night cryin' tears

Just thinkin' about those days you used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember, we'd brag on how rich we would be
To get out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears
And what everybody is sayin'
Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half

I would give it all up just to take one ride
With you
How I used to kick it on the front porch
With you
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
With you
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now, I'm just missing you

How I wish, I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow

I know, I know you're in a better place

See you again someday

Ever since this money come, it's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say, boy, you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness

Man, I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin' this real shit off like a gun
I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I was iced up with a Bentley and a house

That's why fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits
And fake-ass players get a real player hatin 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come round
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof until my shit is goin' down

And how I used to hoop off in them to tournaments
With you
And how I used to club hop on weekends
With you
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences

I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you

Voices in my head been tellin' me to come to church
Say, the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreamin' of windows, black-tinted like a hearse
But wakin' up to life sometimes seems worse

And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies, man
Want me to save the world, I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans

Oh, I can't believe my ears

How I used to street perform on Friday
With you
And how I'd go to church on Easter Sunday

You know I was in the hood
I just thought I'd stop by
Holler at you for a minute
Pour out a little liquor or some'in'

Nigga, we done been through a lot of shit together
From runnin' these streets to bein' down for whatever
And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of shit to tell you
Things I should've said way back when we was younger

Remember when we used to roll hand in hand
And now I'm trippin' on how I really miss you, man
And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay

It's all good now (My nigga)
We out the hood now (Mmm)
We had the same ideas, but not the same careers
We shared the same old laugh, and now the same tears

You were my homie, my sconey, my Roni
My nigga and never placed no bitch before me
Man, I sear to God I love for that shit
Why'd you have to get hit
Where was I, what time was it

You were supposed to get older with me
On stage, hands on shoulders with me
Coppin' them Range Rovers with me
Sittin' on thangs and smokin' trees

And if it wasn't for the will that God had made
I'd turn back the hands of time and take your place
Sittin' here sippin' on this Hennessy
Just thinkin' about how much you meant to me (My n***)

Even when you're gone you will always be my nigga
When you went home I'm still missin' you, my nigga
I'm feelin' like the timing was wrong, my nigga
I know you're smilin' down sayin' carry on, my nigga

Some times my nights can get long, my nigga
Some times I feel God did me wrong, my nigga
So I had to write a song, my nigga
Just to let you know that you're still my nigga

I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh, I)
I wish, I wish, I wish

Little son is lookin' at me like, ""Where is my daddy?""
And your thirteen-year old daughter is mad because she understands
Promised your mama I'd take care of the family
But she's so hurt, she turns away my helpin' hands

Damn, I wish your a** was here, my nigga
To grow that gray beard and smoke that cigar, my nigga
And we would talk about you gettin' up out this game
And you would tell me how it keeps callin' your name

(We used to ride-ride-ride)
Never afraid to (Die-die-die)
But some times we (Cry-cry-cry)
Askin' the Lord (Why-why-why)
They're tearin' down these projects

We were homies for like 20 thug years
Sat in church and cried the same thug tears
You remember when Vibe World Premier
How we used to share the same old gear

And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay

(It's all good now) My nigga
We out the hood now
It's so easy for folks to say, ""Rob, just live on""
When I'm dyin' every second that you're gone
Nevertheless I try my best to be strong
Hopin' you said your prayers before you went on home

When we stood on these blocks and just shot the breeze
We'd slapbox dead in the middle of streets
And if a fight broke out, you would take up for me
You're all I have left of these ghetto memories

I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh, I)
I wish, I wish, I wish

Uh, uh, yo' dog, I can't explain how I miss you
We stayed together, coppin' cane, poppin' pistols
I miss you most
Puttin' the doo rag over your bean head
Even out the hood on the scene you brag (Whoa)
Comin' up off the fiends for bags
Runnin' up out the cleaners, drag
You was the closest nigga I had
Look how we stayed aces
Hustled, made big faces
I wish we could trade places
Fuck givin' you ice, I'd rather give you life
And the things that I had, I'd give you twice (Oh,
Yeah)

So what the deal, my nigga, I know you holdin' it down
If you could see me you would say I'm talkin' soft right now
But it's hard for me to see when I'mma see you again
And I know it's fucked up, I gotta talk through this pen
But you'd died for the love of the dough
The love of the block, sixteen you was runnin' the spot
Boy, your mama used to hate how we stood on the curb
Hangin' with wild thug niggas, smokin' the herb (Mmm,hmm, hmm)
I'm gonna keep pourin' this liquor and that's my word
This here is for niggas that be flippin' them birds
(Oh)
Word up!

Even though you know you will always be my nigga
(Whoa...whoa...oh...oh..)
Even though you're gone you will also be my nigga
I'm feelin' like the time when I'm high, my nigga

I'm feelin' like time
I'm strung out, sayin', ""Radio, please don't take the nigga out this song

I'm like the sun, I'm tryin' to shine on everybody
You know what I'm sayin'
But it's like situation after situation, you know
So I write about it to get it off my chest, you heard

Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth

(Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't want to let me live

When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out

Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah

I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin'
'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the kid with his paper a pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo', we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memory
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors before careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine

(Fo' real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(Fo' real tho') It hurts to know you want to see me fail
(Fo' real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(Fo' real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held

They turn they backs on you, who was there believin'
Who said your troubles were only for a season
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus

So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me and lift me up (Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Man, I tell you it's enough to make you want to give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and to brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another
And stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what want to see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dining
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are high
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fight
Frankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired
Have dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is alive

(Fo' real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(Fo' real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(Fo' real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(Fo' real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me

And as for robbin', here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
Media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard

The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U-S-S-Y, let's have some fun
S-s-y, that's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, he cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U-S-S-Y

I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown
Hands down, mami had the bombest pussy in town
One dip in the girl pool, that's all it took
One sample of the snapple, and ya ass was whupped
Have you buyin' Gucci sandals, matchin' pocket books
Blowin' up her beeper ringin' her phone off the hook
Ball players they spit money, rappers they spit time
All a while they both clamin' that they never spent a dime
Business guys, she would victimize
Have 'em paying rent on condos in the Miami high rise
We ask her, who pussy is this look her right in her eyes
She said this pussy's yours daddy, tell 'em nothin' but lies
They didn't believe it, but they wanted to, needed to
She had the type of body, that you didn't want leavin' you
So they ignored all her flirtin' ways
And put a ring on her finger I'm like, Earth to Dave

[Chorus]

I ain't no rapper, but I'ma say my shit
When it comes down to that motherfuckin' clit, clit, clit
Niggas are sick, sick, sick, turn on you quick, quick, quick
That's why I be givin' mami much, dick, dick, dick
Why'all chumps be coppin' them furs, and all that
Feining for this pussy, as if y'all was on crack
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back
Y'all cats that be babysittin', and these balls need to be smacked
It's this nigga named Monroe, that I know from way back
He hit the lotto bought his girl a Cadillac
Now this bitch be creepin' behind this niggas back
He busted her guess what, he still took the bitch back
3 things niggas love, money, pussy, and drugs
Can't get one without the other 'less you soft in love
Now take it from a player whose done all the above
Niggas it's the lesbian, R&B thug

That's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U, I see you

The P is for the pearl tongue that I like to tickle.
The U is for uterus, down deep in the middle.
SS is so slippery when I go up inside.
Pussy's good and if you gettin some I know you know Y.
See I got my first shot when I was bout seven.
Her father called my house he said,
""I need to talk to yo son Devin.
My daughter she's eleven and she goes to the same school that yo son goes to.
And she said today she got screwed.""
But my daddy answer the phone so no drama, and all he said was,
""No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!""
Then I was suspended three day, taken from school.
It was like a vacation.
Niggaz lookin' at pussy at the pool in our apartments.
I started hittin' hard when I was small.
Let me recite a story lesson for all of y'all.
See pussy's like a wound it would never heal,
The more ointment you put on then the better it feels.
Cuz it's

[Chorus]

Niggas would do anything
For some pussy, hey, hey, hey, oh

I just wanna take you home with me

She get it from her momma
You can't tie a sweater over that ass, or hide it in pajamas
We lay back, blowin' ganja
DVD, she make it hard to watch a flat TV, whoa
I crept up behind her
Mami threw it like a quarterback, I caught that like Rice
I call mami Montana, bandana
Tied her hands up, this is gangsta love
Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked
This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude
Poured a glass of Army, got mama in the mood
Then she stripped for me like the ""Moulin Rouge""
I think I might wife her
Y'know, powder blue Roc-a-Wear suit, white Nike her
Add mami to the cypher
R.O.C. for life cuz, the gang motherfucker

[Chorus]

I make ya hotter than the next bitch, no need
For you to ever sweat the next bitch, with speed
I make the next bitch see the exit, indeed
Gotta know you're ver-ily respected, by me
You get the keys to the Lexus, but no drive
You get your own 2002, she through ridin'
Keep yo' ass tighter than Versace
That's why you gotta watch yo' friends
You gotta watch me, they connivin' shit
See I just wanna freak your body-adi-adi
I know you don't do this for everybody-adi
But everybody ain't as horny as me
And your body's, callin', me

[Chorus]

Uhh, yeah
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans
Y'all know the first date wearers
To make objects bigger than they appear like a rear view mirror
Oh her shoe game is real
She gave 'em the Christian Libountins(?) with the four inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear
Is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?

Girl I hear you callin', let's stop stallin'
Do what we came to do

It's like the ""War of the Roses"" goin on in my house
It's a little separation but I know how to fix the situation
Mami just sufferin from love deprevation
So I gotta give her thug reperations
Put it in the life until love leg is shakin
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens
Then we laughin and we back friends

You don't have to fuss and fight
Why don't you just spend the night
Baby let's just kiss and hug

Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle

Said, ""You never spend timey, what's up with that?""

And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat

Sex so intense, all that's on my mind
It ain't feel this good since the very first time
I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away
I'm tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face

Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low
Like a one against the grain

Got the sun against my brain
A girl in my ear
I like her for her
I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her

Both got a little bit of money
I mean, 'cause y'all both broke

Then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke
And if you got money and he ain't got no paper
He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you
When y'all both get some paper, you'll see

We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather

""He's gon' start his own label, he'll never be able""

Well, nigga you've been wrong before
And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him
We move through the hood like identical twins
But it just so happen that a nigga made it rappin

Stop through the hood, to say what's happenin?

Invest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger
And do things like, pull up to some clubs

What the fuck, pop that Cris' my nigga
And then he wants to know how many chips I done sold
Well, it ain't y'all business what's behind my doors

But y'all niggaz don't appreciate shit

Nope, Hov's still here like Rogaine
Ask your boy what he did to the Hov' game

How he jeopardized the whole game
Now when we see each other it's so strange
I don't know whether to hug him or slug him

I don't know whether to cap him or dap him
I don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happenin
But what I do know, all the niggaz that you know
Locked up doin a few doe, but who knows?

Maybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm buggin too

Just take my hand, and believe, in our fu-ture
Gettin' you open like matchin' doors
Sheets and covers on, the floor
And if the bell should ring, we won't answer
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, and now you
Want to tell, what I want from you

Baby tonight I want to see you naked
So dim the lights
Baby tonight I want to see you naked
I want to see you tonight
Baby tonight I want to see you naked
Oh babe, oh babe, yo' body's the reason for sight

Mami shake ya body body, don't hurt nobody hottie
It's me in the god-body, R. Kelly, the John Gotti
Of R&B thug and me I would say I'm probably

The hardest rapper to ever cop on poppy and put it in a song
Ma how could you go wrong?
Ha ha ha ha worse than a armed robbery
Know that I'm armed properly, whenever the arm's rocky

You can go on clockin' me, ain't nuttin' gon' stop me
High as Allah I be, movin' in peace but I
Move with the piece, so them, dudes in the streets
Will never remove my piece, ha ha, got me

Niggaz'll never get me, I never move sloppy
Move with the Glock 50, got some Tupac with me
Let's not test my gangsta, just, raise your glasses
Mami, shake ya asses, this is a thug classic

Make a hole, make a hole and let the queen come past
I come through in the speedboat, with 808's in the glass
Push big things here, bet most of y'all crash
Back to trainin' lightweights, you in the wrong weight class

Haters, stay awake, fuck the Harlem shake
We 'Slam' dance like onyx, check my Ebonics
You got, heat nigga you thinkin' we won't blaze?
Gotta come hard 'cause these are the last days

When I do it I do's it, ain't no more to it
Ask Ice Cube I puts my back into it
From car dealers to Macy's, the cashiers embrace me
We train like the Navy for whatever the case may be

I pass on the 6, they don't impress me much
I want the bulletproof 7 'cause the doors lift up
They pick the best of all girls, so how y'all sound?
I got the best of both worlds, holdin' me down

Panties and bras all the way from the bed to the sofa
For all you R&B so called playas, I'm bout to coach ya
Sit right there, and watch me freak yo girl chocha
Tongue all down her throat as if a nigga was trying to choke her

R. Kelly,"Dear God, how can I explain myself?
Oh God, bless me indeed when I'm so confused
Enlarge my territory
Place Your love and protection over me at all times
Help me
Keep me away from evil, somebody answer me
Allow me not to cause pain

Police in the background, screamin', ""Put the thing down""
That's how hard I was trying to put my thing down
Sirens ringin' out, old ladies screamin' out
All this attention for me and I'm barely sixteen now

It's feelin' like a dream now
Handcuffed, roughed up, I'm tossed in the bing now
I'm lyin' next to fiends now, that's the end of the story
Let me bring y'all niggaz back to the very first scene now

December 4th, a child is born
Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on
That's how we do it when the man of the house is gone
You either stand or fall, I chose to stand

The hawk outside, so I blow my hand
It's a cold, cold world but I overstand
Tryin' to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn
Can't cope with bein' broke, I'm a man, c'mon

Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin' through
Son, just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Get the best of you

Late one night I was rollin' the streets
Just thinkin' about what's goin' on with me
And trapped in this thug life, tryin' to break free
But this thug life just keeps callin' me

I'm livin' life way too dangerously
I'm drownin' in my misery
Looked in the mirror, there's my enemy
'Cause poppa never was a part of me

""Take one step at a time"", mama said
Sweet memories still remain in my head
All of my life been lied to, misled
Voices be like, ""Don't you wish you was dead?""

No ground to place my feet, I feel the fire under me
A way out is all I need, somebody, answer me

Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin' through
Son, just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Get the best of you

Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free
'Cause ain't no goin' home for me
It's a cold, cold world but I blew my hand
A true first 'cause I knew that man

I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first
And I couldn't stand the thought of
My momma steppin' foot inside a church
All I try to do is try to get up out the dirt

Guess, he's tryin' to do the same
Told me, get up out his turf
I wanted to talk to him but that shit'd never work

We was cut from the same cloth
And what was under his shirt was his momma's rent
His young brother's clothes, my nephew's food
And with that I suppose and with that I froze

Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron folds
And this story is told for young soldiers
Who never choose the life we chose

Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin' through
Son, just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Get the best of you

Tears in my eyes as I look up
I'm tryin' to hold back my pride but reality is screamin'
Gotta get a job 'cause momma also screamin'
Streets are just like drugs and it's like I'm out here fiendin'

Forget all the hits in the industry
'Cause ain't no exceptions in this game for me
Look, neither God or my enemies
I choose God 'cause He understands

This young man with a thuggish heart
Whole world in his hands but still torn apart
Like I'm so close but it's still so far
Nightmares of me in a swervin' car, oh

No ground to place my feet
(My feet)
I feel the fire under me
(Hey)
A way out is all I need
(All I need)
Somebody answer me

Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin' through
Son, just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Just don't let it
(Just don't let it)
Get the best of you

Chorus: Nas (set to Eurythmics ""Sweet Dreams"")

Street dreams are made of these
Niggaz push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin a key
Everybody's lookin for somethin..
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggaz with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin for somethin..

[Nas]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothin on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
the first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
without the FBI catchin feelings

Chorus

[Nas]
From fat cat to papi, niggaz see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holdin gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Livin with moms, gettin it on, flushin crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from bein rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 
Up in the hotel, smokin on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back livin sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hoppin in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

Chorus

[Nas]
Growin up project-struck, lookin for luck dreamin
Scopin the large niggaz beamin, check what I'm seein
Cars, ghetto stars pushin ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwin rocks at the crazy lady
Worshippin every word them rope rockin niggaz gave me
The street raised me up, givin a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was livin it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny?  Gettin put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, paintin the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggaz went for theirs, flippin coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressin, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spendin never holdin out

When I'm rolling through your city
Show me love
And ladies when you see a boy
Give me love
And though I'm not conceited (right)
Its just my space sometimes I need it (right)

That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows
Ja lets break bread together
Pray together
That we grow strong together

Help each other through the stormy weather
Lets hurt together
Lets cry together

Then together we'll make it better

Right out of the blue sky you were heaven sent

The title would read a strong black man and that's for real

And in and out of relationships with out appeal
Ain't nobody else on Gods green earth for me
If we turn ourselves together, we'll make the perfect team of dreams
Change me for the world as long as I exist
Always in the kitchen cookin' up my favorite meal

Miraculous woman you are
Incredible, unforgettable, 
You're the world's greatest by far
Sensational, so lovable, 
My Cinderella you are
So beautiful, ghetto fabulous, 
You're the reason I wish upon a star
As I lay me down to sleep, 
I pray your heart I'll always keep
And I hope you feel the same
So baby come and hop aboard my life and 
Just let love take us away

Dream Girl let's take a flight, 
Far away to a paradise
Dream Girl let's take a ride, 
Destination rainbow skies
Dream Girl let's kiss and hug, 
On a beach with white sand and all white doves
Dream Girl let's cuddle up, 
Somewhere wherever and make sweet love

Baby you are my Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream Girl

My sunshine, my blue skies, 
Love is who you are to me 
My angel, my peace of mind, 
Woman you have come to set me free
Lovemaking, breathtaking, 
Sweet Valentine's to me
Heart racing, creating 
An incredible fire within me
I believe in you and me, 
Together for all eternity
And I hope you feel the same
So baby come and hop aboard my life and 
Just let love take us away

Baby this love we make is too good to be true
Heaven must really love me because heaven sent me you

Giving me love baby

R. Kelly,"Mansions, hill and acres
Women, drinks and caterers
I would toast until the break of dawn
Swimming pools and strippers
Conversation six figures
Never crossed my mind to call home.

[Chorus]
There's a note on the bathroom mirror
Telling me that you've had enough.

It took you leaving me
For my blind eyes to see that you mean.

[Repeat: x8]
Far more 

Than this planet to me
Than the air I breath
From here to overseas
Girl you're all I need
Than the mountains and trees
You mean more than the birds and the bees
Honey take it from me
You are all I need

Hanging out with friends
Never calling to check in 
Neglecting you in every way
Taking the home front for granted
What was straight, is now slanted
And I don't know what to do about this letter.

[Chorus]

It took you leaving me
For my blind eyes to see that you mean.

Far More 

More than this planet to me
More than the air I breath

You mean more than the birds and the bees
Honey take it from me
You are all I need

Far more 

Ever since you've been gone
I realize girl just what it is I had at home
Oh Baby, you mean far more
Than this planet to me
Than this air I breath

I'll be damned if I'm gon let this bullcrap take me away from you 
Cause I vow to give my all and girl I'm a man of my words

See I did it back in 98 of September 
You took her from me yea right you don't remember 
I remember so clearly we were coming from an opera 
How clever you were when you slipped her your number 
(ooh) I know that makes y'all wanna know 
(ooh) Who's really on the down low 
You wonder why we're always at it there it is 
Sleeves up Mr. Biggs 
Cause I'm about to get, wild, wild, west 
Sick and tired of your mess

It can mean anything you want it to mean
Anything you say it mean, that's what it means
If you say sex? then probably
Some say it means pushin' a lex, then probably
This one white chick said gettin' real smokey and feelin' free
This black chick said sippin' Hennessy in V.I.P.
Well, well, you can say what you want, that's what it is
All I know is that the thoia thoing man its the sh*t
Afro's, cornrow's, hair weave's you gotta love it
White, black, brown, even Japanese, you gotta love it
And you know somebody out there goin', ""man I like the beat
The hook is real tight, but I'm a keep it real, dog, it puzzles me""
No rules in this music industry (y'all know!)
If it feel good and make ya move your feel (y'all know!)
And if the bass is bumpin' in your jeep (y'all know!)

Uh yo yo! Everybody's talking
About the good old days
About the good old days
Huh I remember when me and my brothers
We used to sit up on the porch in the
Summertime and just talk about just making it
You know what I'm saying being successful
Following up our dreams you know and I
I believe that's every kids dream
You know what I'm saying to rise and
Be somebody but damn!
Sometimes we just get caught up

I ain't got no money
And I ain't got no friends
Looks like my world is coming to an end
No food on the table, no clothes on my back
No shoes on my feet and
I just bearly got a used Cadillac
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah
Ghetto for ya
So I took this remix and
Rearranged gotham city

City of love a city of peace
For everyone of us
'Cause we all need it,
Can't live without it
Gotham city for the ghetto yeah!

Gotham city for the ghetto,
That's what I'm talking 'bout
Ghetto fabulous, to a nigga health be hazardous
If you wanna test raffishness for the respect
S.T.R.I.N.G.S. Yes. (oh yeah)
Fuck the rest give me the best
Why should I have to settle for less
When I could push the V-12's with finesse
(scratching) and all that mess
If you try to hold me back
Would I keep on struggling till I hit the sky.
Even if you wanted to you can't deny
Gotta feed baby girl who would die

We keep talking about escalating
Well who's gonna go first
Guess I'll be the one to step up
If you don't follow me it would be the worst
Every time something goes down
Somebody's crying ghetto tears
Hope I'm not raining on your parade
But this is not what keeping it really is
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah!
Ghetto for ya,
So I took this remix and rearranged
A gotham city

Check it out
Now motherfucker wanna act surprised
'Cause you're afraid to change scared to rise
That's why you ass get left behind
They got a sight, they got a mind
'Cause ain't nobody gonna stop the dream
Talk that shit, block my cream
Negativity you gotta let go
Heaven gotta see for the ghetto

We all need hey hey hey
Gotham city for the ghetto yeah
Calling on heaven
Send your love down, to the ghetto yeah
Talking about a land where oh yeah
Where there will be no more crying,

Last night was incredible. Listen. Check it out. 

Last night, I felt the skies open up and rain down heaven
Last night, I felt the sun, the moon and the stars come together
Last night, I heard an angel speak to me he said us forever
And while we were making love, I saw visions of a tropical river

Touched a dream
When you were here with me

Said we rewrote the book of love making history

Last night you brought my dreams to reality

Now last night, I could have sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings
Last night, I heard a massive choir lift their voice and sing
Last night, I saw the world living in peace and harmony
While we were making love, I felt my soul being set free

The sun will shine after the storm 
Oh yes it will and Mother Nature guarantees
Jumped the mountain and touched the sky

And give those amorocity 
Provided us with food to eat

Fills our vacancies but together the perfect chemistry 
Forever anniversaries

Nigga what ya heard, it's Kells and Hov
With the second coming of Best Of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking

Big chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig?
No reward that's the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I, on the other hand, relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this
Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave his life for some shit like this

Got a lot in common, I'm so mean and vicious

The way the wrist shine it's so magical

In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking

Big chips! I'm a boss I said
Tilt my hat and I cross my legs
Like old ladies at the park, I toss my bread
And the pigeons start flocking, ballin' like Bishop Loughlin
And stick Cochran on any DA why try to stop him
So any gunplay, that is an option
I been doing this since niggas was wopping
Rockin' Izods with the matching socks, and
Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching
To try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See I ain't never been a fronter
Or fake it till I make it type nigga
Ma I don't want ya number
Either you're coming or alone ya
Either you know what you want ma, or I don't even want ya

Now we about to show ya how wild it gets
When a girl at the party when she backin' it
Now this girl dance freaky 'cause she passionate
If I ask for some chips, then she stackin' it
She don't need no introduction, she's a diamond of daw
And I don't mean no janitor, the way she mopping the flow
Tattoo on her backs saying 'ready to go'
Man this girl must get pimped away I'm ready too hoe
I'm going to take you out to ghetto girl around the globe
Freaking in the kitchen girl, go somewhere around the stove
In the chumps we chilling in some hotel robes
I put her towels on her body and massage her toes
There ain't nothing like some sex on a Friday night
But then again nothing like some sex in any night
After that gotta go got appointments girl
I'm a doctor, I got other clients girl
Now listen up close, I won't say it again
Skip a dog y'all cat is a man's best friend
Lil' Jon and Luda on the first class flight
From ATL we about to get it crunk tonight
Where we going?

Hey Kelly!
Oh damn! There go expensive Chris
At the bar behind all the most expensive shit
And his car always got the most expensive kit
So his gun always got the most extended clip
Hey! Luda Luda, I'm built to last
Nicknamed double barrel and I'm built to blast
Since your girl ain't a freak, well you gotta convince me
Cause I'm all up in the fifth getting straight Lewinsky
And smoking some of that ""Kill Bill""
Ten Mil motherfucker I'm still trill
Can't party with the women that like it dick
Refuse to cut my hair like Michael Vick
Dirty bird even judges say the birds are dirty
We the reason that the clubs start closing early
Walk up and watch the crowd start moving quick
And I ain't gotta pay the DJ to play my shit

[Chorus]

[Lil' Jon]
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
With the bull pimp cup man I'm sloppy drunk
I don't broke into club it's the king of crunk
Let the anal way find, and and the woofers blow
Throw some ass in my lap and I'm good to go
I spread a shined out bottle, crack a beer
While the ladies are all rubbing my neck and beard
No need to even ask it, who's the boss?
When the dreadlocks slam and the roof come off
The crunk juice got me up all night shit
And in last year making that bite shit
Not an essay calling me Loc De Niro
Stunned with my hell day, Oaklezero
Fresh by the front and I'm ready to play
Got the dog but I knew my had to lie (ok)
BME turn millionaire, and we all like 'what what, yeah'

90 other time I would say it's over
Since the party so live, I can keep it going
Shit don't stop till six in the morning
Come seven o'clock a nigga still ain't yawning
Baby girl leaving now on her toes
Hangover, wait a minute girl you leaving your clothes
And tickets gonna sell for a major show
If yousa a hater at the booth and the booth is closed
And move out the way I'm a Luda fan
Up north, dirty south, west eastside man

We want to see you shake your booty in the place right now

With what I'm bout to say boy
Here we are once again
And I'm having second thoughts boy
I'm not messing with you head
But I changed my mind boy
I don't know why I'm here
At the same time I want you near
If you want me to leave
I will understand
See I would just have to respect
Your wishes boy
Cause if I stay ain't no telling
What may happen boy
Although you look so good to me
It's best that I leave

[Chorus]
I'm scared of being next to you
Because of what I think I might do
Boy your turning me on right now
Can't get down like that right now
Don't want to disturb the flow
But this is not my M.O.
Hold up wait a minute movin' too fast
I want somethin' like this here to last

Don't say no baby
Not right now baby
I want to be your lady
You got me going crazy
Well I guess I'll stay for a minute
Then I have to go boy
This moment is so temptin'
Right now it's not what I want boy
Maybe if we just embrace
With a simple kiss boy
But that'll only make things worse
Hope I'm not getting on your nerves boy
I just want it to be right for both of us
When you don't have to say a thing to make me comfortable
Boy you make me so weak when you look at me
But right now I'm a little confused I think it's best that I refuse

[Chorus]

Supposed to be playing cards
Or watching a movie
But we keep locking eyes boy
Now why you trying ta tease me
This room is getting heated
Would you open a window
I think I should go now
Cause I can't take this no more

But sis, I don't want to waste your time

But I done told you time and time again
Whatever you're going through
You can come and talk to me
And I will say a prayer with you

But I done prayed and prayed night and day

That you're washed up and you're through
But sister's here to let you know
Boy you're gonna make it through

Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again

Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins

Just wait, let me make a phone call

Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?

Mm hmm, similar to what I used to go through

Really?

Yes, and sometimes I still do

Yeah?

See it doesn't matter who you are
Or where you're from
If you struggle, God will use you

Amen sister, what you're saying is so true
Rob are you there?

Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you
It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do

Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship
Knowing that, that was no way for me to live
A young girl like me, raised up in a good family
Way too young to endure such misery
And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
(He hit me) at any given time
(He hit me) no reason at all
(He hit me) so so hard
(He hit me) my God, sometimes I'd fall
Mama asked what happened to me
And I'd take up for him
She said that devil's a liar
And pray get rid of him
And now I'm going to school, hitting those books
I'm doing fine

I was a freshman in college and uh
I had just made it on the basketball team
I had all the skills it took to make it
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's
And the coach came to me and had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was I brake down and cry 'cause
Everybody knows me, knows that basketball is my life
(Algebra) I studied hard
(Chemistry) I gave my all
(Calculus) oh my God
(English) so many flaws
Playing ball didn't look to good for me
My future, could not see
I had lost all my beliefs
And gave up on all my dreams
Then I went to church on Sunday
And the pastor began to preach
It was like he was talking to me
When he said I can do all things
In Christ that strengthens me
And for me that was enough

We were separated at least for a month or two
She was wilding in the clubs
And I was out there doing wrong too
And we would walk around the house
Putting each other down
I mean right in front of the kids
We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident
And almost lost my life
And guess who was there for me
My wife
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way
When we said there was no way
I'm out the hospital and back at home
Planning another wedding day, I tell you

Now all of these things were happening in one family
But that's okay, 'cause there's nothing God can't achieve
I don't care what the problem in your life may be
'Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed
And if you didn't know, now you should know
All you gotta do is take this family's life for example
Now Mom and Dad are married again
Four kids now, 'cause they just had twins
Little sister all grown up now
She's a lawyer, married with one child now
Two years, big brother's out of college
And man he's got his hands full (hallelujah)
Blessed with skills, blessed with knowledge
Now he's playing for the Chicago Bulls

R. Kelly,"I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then i look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before i knew it
Here comes this truck now

Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now 
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years i've been straight

You saved me [4x]
Gave me a second chance
You saved me [3x]
You saved me

Now i've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said God's good
I just laugh at 'em

But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and 
That's when I knew

You saved me [4x]

Now i was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside i was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before i
Knew it I was on my knees

Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do
I don't think i'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted Christ that day
Halilujah now i'm free

You saved me [4x]

I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back 
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so 
I call my mama to calm my nerves

(mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone

You saved me [4x]

You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooooooh You saved me

You gave me it was by grace You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me

No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2 
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out
You saved me
You stepped in ooh save me

You saved me",U Saved Me,2004

R. Kelly,"When I wake up in the morning time and see the sun I say
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus for waking me up today
I think about his goodness and the wonderful things he's done
Forgiving me, setting me free and casting my sins away
And soon as I was about to fall you stepped right in on time
Picked me up, and let me know you had nothing but love for me
And those lonely nights when I thought that I gonna lose my mind (my mind)
Lord, You were my company

And now I feel joy (when I think about you)
I feel strength (when I think about you)
No pain (when I think about you)
And no rain (when I think about you)
I get glad (when I think about you)
And raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you)

And in the midst of the storm you were the shelter in my life
Even though (I was doing wrong) and even though (I fell off)
No-one can help me out, the way you helped me whenever I was in need
When trouble was chasing, I was weak (mmm) you kept your hands on me
My God you sacrifised you life that I might live for eternity
Despite my faults, you heard my cry (yes you did) and forgave my inequity
No-one can understand, the way you understand when it comes to my heart
Lord you gave me a brand new start

Believe he gave his only son (all of the world) to all the world
He chose to love (oh, yes he did) so how can we not (how can we not) send our praises up

I feel joy (when I think about you)
Feel strength, yeah (when I think about you)
There's no rain (when I think about you)
No more pain (when I think about you)

Then I raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you) oh I

I feel joy (when I think about you)
And peace (when I think about you)
Feel your presence (when I think about you)
Coming over me (when I think about you)
Then I start to fall, yeah (when I think about you)
Down to my knees (when I think about you)

And we can take a shower together
Get cozy in stormy weather
And if u ever going through something

Ya just keep on lovin a thug
Massage and some sex when I tell u its time
U ain't neva gotta want for nothing 
As long as u down and u ready to ride

Have yo head all off up in da sky
And we be going (weo weo weo weo)

[Verse 2: Chingy]
You actin like you dont hurr me
Come nurr me quick
Bacon, and take a puff of this green from jamaica
Just bought a new yacht with 4 rooms and a bar
No you're not that used to bein around a hood star
My papa told me good girls always go fast
So if I touch her right thurr aint no need to get mad
I could take you from the club to paradise
Used to my chicks, I like them thick
Plus naughty and nice
The way you sweep me off my feet, you should be a broom
The way you smell, should of had your own perfume
So knock knock, who's there? Jackpot (that's hot)
Ran with the old head so fuck the sex
Do it tickle when I lick your neck?
Better get you wet
Lookin' at your sexy ass make me wanna write a check

And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

Wanna keep you flawed with no dough
Pimpin' ain't easy
Trust me I know
When gangstas and hos
Go go go go go go together
Like chinchilla and bad weather
I'm good but been better
All my bros, chedder and glamorous things
Copped a few cars
A crib with a east and west wing
'cause this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness
'cause I want the p-you-s-s-why
Got a lotta niggas wonderin' it ain't just I
Gotta keep ya cash comin' and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got
Shit, she probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and Irv and Jeffrey quite icy
Sip seraphin
Who doesn't like me
And the murderous I-n-see

If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

How many girls does it take to get to
Mack status
Player status
Pimps that get
Ya boy half rich fore we hit show bis
But show bis brought next level chicks
Pull up in them hot cars go and buy the whole bar nigga
I came from the dirt what you want me to say
I'm at the top of the world and life's a pussy buffet
And that's why I get m-I-a
Shut the game down so the busteras can't play
Hell yeah I splurge money
Hell yeah I act funny
Look at you like fuck you
All the shit I been through
It's a wonder why I'm still here
Said I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its mighty strange how you right back here

If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

I wonder why love is about money
And why you wanna take it all from me

My life is dark but its lovely
Crimes cars cribs ain't that right Kelly?
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Y'all bitches don't know
Money ain't a thing
Mami need a lil change
Girl I'm pitchin' quarters
Closest to the arches but live in a fortress
New Benz's new Porsche's
New cases new lawyers
I'm becoming the infamous notorious rule
Niggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Niggas don't possess the heart that I do
And it's a wonder that I'm still here
Thought I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its kinda funny how you right back there

If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got

The coldest winter ever and I'm so icicle-ish

The movement is flavorful, bags of licorice
The drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace
There's no forgettin' this, the way that I'm reppin' this
My bodyguard's big but do that make me rebelish
I'm in the Hamptons, game stronger than Sampson

Before I toss chips, first, get naked

Tilt my hat and I cross my legs

And the pigeons start flocking, ballin' like Bishop Loughlin
And stick Cochran on any DA why try to stop him
So any gunplay, that is an option
I been doing this since niggas was wopping
Rockin' Izods with the matching socks, and
Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching
To try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See I ain't never been a fronter
Or fake it till I make it type nigga

Either you're coming or alone ya
Either you know what you want ma, or I don't even want ya

I heard you forgave over and over again
But when I found out I love you, you became ammune to my sins
Laid wide awake in da middle of my sleep (I see dead people)
And sometimes it's me Lord 
I never wanted to be a thug father
I only wanted to be a son of a father
That's how it sounds inside, worse than da war in Iraq, when it's me against I
I gave up da weed and somehow I'm still high

Stop people from rapin' me, take away all this jealously and prejudicy

It's hard to believe in what I can't see
I got to get this money and feed my family

Whatever in me guides my life, dear lord don't let me die tonight 
But if I shall before I wake, what shall I say 
Its been a good run from hoodlum to outin' da states
How could one who made so much foul mistakes, still be allowed to have a smile on my face
How whatever da case I'm glad it wasn't murder, in a town you never heard of
From a nickel plated burner
Now my life straight like a perm, tried to take da spot I earn

But da devil is a lie cause I believe within'
You're da reason that I'm still here, even though I don't act like it 
Even though I hear my callin' and fight it 
Fools do me so wrong, its hard to stay righteous
Pimpin' was allowed to happen I'll hide it 
Believe me lord I want you, got money and fame but still it just won't do 
Sometimes I don't like who I am, when I look in da mirror my reflection is uncle sam (uncle sam)
And every night I have these weird dreams, that a preacher trapped inside of me wake up and can't

I got da whole music industry sold, but it still don't matter

Whatever in me guides my life, dear lord don't let me die tonight
But if I shall before I wake, I'd accept my fate
I did what I did my heart was in da right place (ohhh)
I guess so I can live it put food on my plate
You must still love me not to let it in by three that day

Call me Mike Piazza
Once I get 'em in, my fly casa
It's hot tubs, heated pools and no rules
Call your old dude and tell him he old news
Tell that fella you feel like Cinderella
With both shoes and it's almost two
Fuck a storybook endin, we bendin the rules
This is somebody's girl part two, now move

[Chorus]

Uhh, let me at it
Somebody's girl is sittin in my lap
Whisper two words and we both break out
My Maybach seats is just as big as a couch
Not the same girl now that the mic's at your mouth
Oh that's gettin nasty, let's get naughty
Rollin around like a fo'-wheel afterparty
We stop at a red light, there go your girls an' 'em
Now we got the green light, driver follow them (let's go)
You're rotatin with a guy that spend money like the world spin 'round
First guy to ever put the singin rap down
Say the name Kels and these chicks spellbound
Because these chicks know I put the ""12Play"" down
I gotta have it, I just can't stop limpin
Maybe because I just can't stop pimpin
No matter what I do, I can't stop leanin
When the fresh Prada's on and the sun is shinin
Girls it's your boyfriend
With that remix that keeps you clubbin
Dis collabo' crack got you fiendin
The industry kings and the rest is dreamin

[Chorus]

The moral of the tale, if you love your tail
Treat her well, keep her 'way from Hov' and Kel'
Because we can't stop pimpin
We put it on her 'til she can't stop limpin
She'll be a goner, you can play tough guy on the corner
I smoothe her out in the sauna
Yeah, I blew it out in the Bahamas, yeah
Your lil' mama got a stellar arm
We got it on like a telethon

In that tight-ass room, pullin' the cars out
And the mirror pointin' at your reflection, killing yourself
You American Pie, stop feeling yourself
Nigga, you just a worker, go deal yourself
Stop being a server, get a meal yourself

And the only time I call to hang, is when me 
And deep blood is up scheming on the gang bang

R. Kelly,"This song is dedicated
To the city of New Orleans
From the whole world, let's go

I feel your heartbeat, I see your tears fall
I see your hands go up, now you've given up on it all
I see your head go down, I know you've lost hope
You're walls keep on comin' down and you can't take no more

Every road you travel seems like your journey's end
That life's an endless battle that you can't seem to win
Well I say, stand up and claim what's yours
Leave those troubles behind and don't you look back no more

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

I know your struggles and I feel your pain
You're doin' everythin' to stop yourself from goin' insane
Tryin' to find the strength to fight your way back
But life keeps swingin' on you 'cause you're under attack

You prayed and cried about it but still no change has come
My life is livin' proof that you're not the only one
And that's why I say, stand up and take your place
Hold your head up high and put a smile upon your face

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

When the storm sends it dark clouds
(And put it right over you)
And a step seems like a million miles
(And you don't know what to do)
You gotta stand and be strong now
(You've got to get up now)
And the morning will come and victory will be yours, yours

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world

Let your light shine, let your light shine

R. Kelly,"Seven o'clock in the morning 
And the rays from the sun wakes me 
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me 
And a voice yells, ""Good morning, darlin"", from the bathroom 
Then she comes out and kisses me 
And to my surprise, she ain't you 

Now I've got this dumb look on my face 
Like, what have I done? 
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here 'til the morning sun? 
Must of lost the track of time 
Oh, what was on my mind? 
From the club, went to her home 
Didn't plan to stay that long 

Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes 
Searching for my car keys 
Tryin' to get on up out the door 
Then she streched her hands in front of it 
Said, ""You can't go this way""
Looked at her, like she was crazy 
Said, ""Woman move out my way""
Said, ""I got a wife at home""
She said, ""Please don't go out there""
""Lady, I've got to get home""
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs 

""Shh, shh, quiet 
Hurry up and get in the closet""
She said, ""Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down""
I said, ""Why don't I just go out the window?""
""Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"" 
""Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet""
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out 
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house 

Then he walks in and yells, ""I'm home""
She says, ""Honey, I'm in the room""
He walks in there with a smile on his face 
Sayin', ""Honey, I've been missin' you""
She hops all over him 
And says, ""I've cooked and ran your bath water""
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar 

Throws her in the bed 
And start to snatchin' her clothes off 
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on? 
You're not gonna believe it 
But things get deeper as the story goes on 
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone 
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate 
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late 
He hopped up and said, ""There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it""
And I'm like, ""God please, don't let this man open this closet""

He walks in the bathroom 
And looks behind the door 
She says, ""Baby, come back to bed""
He says, ""Bitch, say no more""
He pulls back the shower curtain 
While she's biting her nails 
Then he walks back to the room 
Right now, I'm sweating like hell 
Checks under the bed 
Then under the dresser 
He looks at the closet 
I pull out my Beretta 
He walks up to the closet 
Get close up to the closet 
Now he's at the closet 
Now he's opening the closet...",Trapped in the Closet [Chapter 1 of 5],2005

I've been kicking it with your girlfriend
Oh what am I gonna do?
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I've been kicking it with your girlfriend

Go ahead and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel
When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real
I should've been a man and told you a long time ago
Instead of stunning I should have broke it down and let you know
Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind 
And I blame myself for wasting your time
Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me
But her body language kept on temping and teasing me
And plus she knew what she was doing when she did it anyway
I knew what she was doing too and that made it okay
Truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]

Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down
These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around
I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feelin her
And how we get away sometimes and make love
I never wanted to dislead you
At first I just wanted to please you
I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again
Because I came between you and your best friend
I did not ask for this
It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed
And the truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet, I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm sorry again
Never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry again
But girl I love her
I'm sorry again
I never meant to make you cry, no
The first one out the closet

Body up now she heated got me heated up

So her how I hit the bottle and spend it up
You don't gotta worry bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home

Now bring it up and shake it shake it

Four times platinum hate it or love it I'm still number one
Still in the hood one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches cum
I mean the one with the ring and the tongue
Compton uh Kelly found her in the slums
Shaking that rump both hands on the pumps
Send her home with me I'll have your girl yelling 
Kell's my bitch drunk but until girlfriend still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt let her drink red rum

Me and are been around the world and we'll give it to you just how you like it girl

R. Kelly,"Seven o'clock in the morning
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, ""Good morning, darlin"", from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise, she ain't you

Now I've got this dumb look on my face
Like, what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?
Lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long

Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, ""You can't go this way""
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, ""Woman move out my way""
Said, ""I got a wife at home""
She said, ""Please don't go out there""
""Lady, I've got to get home""
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs

""Shh, shh, quiet
Hurry up and get in the closet""
She said, ""Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down""
I said, ""Why don't I just go out the window?""
""Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor""
""Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet""
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house

Then he walks in and yells, ""I'm home""
She says, ""Honey, I'm in the room""
Walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', ""Honey, I've been missin' you""
She hops all over him
And says, ""I've cooked and ran your bath water?
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar

Throws her in the bed
And start to snatchin' her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it
But things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, ""There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it""
And I'm like, ""God please, don't let this man open this closet?

He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, ""Baby, come back to bed""
He says, ""Bitch say no more""
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed
Then under the dresser
He looks at the closet
I pull out my Beretta
He walks up to the closet
He goes up to the closet
Now he's at the closet
Damn he's opening the closet?",Trapped in the Closet Chapter 1,2005
R. Kelly,"Well,
Now he's staring at me like
As if he was starin' in a mirror

She yells honey let me explain

He says you don't have to go no further
I can clearly see what's goin' on
Behind my back, in my bed, in my home

Then I said wait a minute now hold on
I said mister we can work this out

She said honey don't lose control
Tried to get him to calm down

He said hoe I should've known
That you would go and do some bogus shit up in my house
But the Christian in me gave you the benefit of the doubt

I said we need to resolve this
Then he stepped to me, I'm like whoa
There's a reason I'm in this closet

He says, yeah like what, are you talkin' clothes
I met this girl at the Plagis club
And she told me she didn't have a man

Then he said man please,
I'd kill you if you didn't have that gun in ya hand
And I said but yo chick chose me

He said don't give me that mack shit please
His phone goes off and then things get a little more interesting
He steps a little closer
I point my gun and says I'm not the one you after

He says son I bet you didn't know my man
Did she tell you that I was a pastor

I said well good that's betta right
Why can't we handle this Christian- like
And I started to put the gun down
Til I saw his face still had that frown

She started cryin', sayin' baby I'm sorry
Then he said baby not as sorry as you're gonna be
I started inchin' out

He says no I want you to see this
Said I gotta get out this house
He said not til I reveal my secret
I'm like what is goin on inside his head
Then he takes his phone and calls somebody up and says
Hello, Baby, turn the car around
Listen I just need for you to get right back here now (Click)
He looks at me and says well since we're all comin' out the closet
I'm not about to be the only one that's broken hearted

She said what do you mean
And he said just wait and see
I said somebody betta talk to me
And then his phone rings
He picks up and somebody says sweetheart I'm downstairs
And he's like I'll buzz you up
I'm on the fifth floor, hurry take the stairs
And I'm like who is this mystery lady that you're talking to

He says in time you both will know the shockin' truth
Baby this is something I been wanting to get off my chest for a long, long time

Then I said nigga I'm a shoot you both if you don't say what's on ya mind
He said wait I hear somebody comin' up the stairs
And I'm lookin' at the door
He says I think you betta sit down in the chair

I says I'm gonna count to four
1, he says mister wait
2, she says please don't shoot
3, he says don't shoot me
4, she screams
Then a knock at the door, the guns in my hands
He opens the door, I can't believe it it's a man",Trapped in the Closet Chapter 2,2005
R. Kelly,"Well, here we are the four of us,
In total shock me and her,
I close my mouth, and swallow spit,
As I'm thinking to myself this is some deep shit,
Then I said so your gonna tell me he's the one
You've been talking to,
He says yes, I says no, he says yes, I says no,
He says it's the truth,
I yell ""all of y'all asses crazy,
Let me up out this door"", cause this is way
More than I bargained for,
And then she says wait,
I'm sure we can all fix this, then I said I'm late,
Cause I ain't got a damn thing to do with this

Then she said wouldn't you like to know
Just how it all begin,
Then I thought to myself and said quick you got 3 minutes,
Then it got real quite,
I said somebody start talkin', then she said
And then she said ""my god rufus, I got just one question,
How could you do something like this I""m so hurt?""
He looked at her and said bitch please you got
Yo nerve, with all yo club hoppin'
Lying sayin' you was shoppin',
And now here you are in
Our home, and you calling
Me wrong, she said ok you busted me,
And that much I agree,
You caught me cheating,
But this is a little extreme,
He said you are my wife,
Sleeping behind my back,
And now I come home and you got him in the closet,
How extreme is that?

She says but she's a he,
Then he says please you can't judge me,
She says Rufus this is crazy,
And I said stop arguing,
I did not stay here to hear y'all chew
Each other out, so get to the point,
Or I swear I'm out, excuse me please,
But I think I can explain what's going in
Here, my name is chuck, and I've been
Knowin' Rufus for bout a year,
At midnight creeping around with him it's been a living hell,
Sneaking in and out of hotels,
I said brother spare me
The details, then Rufus said chuck please,
Don't say nothin' else, then she screams Rufus
You son of a bitch,
And he says Kathy go to hell,
I said I thought you name was mary,
That's what you said at the party,
Man this is getting scary,
I'm gonna shoot somebody

Then Rufus starts yellin' and screaming
Saying cathy this is all yo fault,
She throws a pillow at him
And says you was creepin' too the only difference
Is you didn't get caught,
Chuck screams out we're in love
Cathy says love my ass
Rufus say they gettin' married
Then I shoot one in the air,
Then I say not another one of
You sons of bitches say a word,
Cause all of this shit I'm going through
Is unheard, grab my cellular,
Sayin' this is so wrong,
Call up my home,
And a man picks up the phone",Trapped in the Closet Chapter 3,2005
R. Kelly,"Now I'm dashin' home
Doin' 85
Swervin' lane to lane
Wit fire in my eyes
I got a million thoughts
Goin' through my mind
I'm thinkin' about what I'm a do and who I'm gonna do it to when I get home
How could I have been so blind
And then I look in my rear view
I cannot believe this
(Who who who)

Damn, here comes a police man
He drove right up on me and flashed his light
Then I pulled over without thinkin' twice
He hopped out the car and walked over to me
And said license and registration please
I looked up at him and said
Officer, is there somethin' wrong

He said no, except for you was doin' 60 in a 45 mile zone

Then I said officer
Let me explain please
Ya see the truth of the matter is
Is that I got an emergency

He said no excuses
And no exceptions
He flicks his cigarette and then gives me the ticket

Said have a nice day and walked away
I said yeah right and drove away
Then I turned my radio on
And did 50 all the way home
I pulled up in the driveway
Hopped out and slammed the car door
Then go around the back
Bust up in the house and she screamin'
Whats all that for

Then I'm like woman I called this house
And a man picked up my phone
Then she said calm down
Did you forget
My brother Twan came home
Oh

And that's all I could say was oh
Wit a stupid look on my face
Said I forgot he came home today

And she said that's okay
Because honey I understand

She said you don't have to explain
Then I took her by the hand
I kissed her and then we went to the room
Then I turned some music on
Apologized one more time
Then went down and start gettin' it on

And she started bitin' her lip
Grabbing me and makin' noise
Now we makin' love and she's my ear whisperin'
It's all yours
I said I love you

And she said I love ya, too
Then a tear fell up out my eye
Then I called her my sunshine
And then she looked at me

And said baby go deeper please
And that's when I start goin' crazy
Like I was tryin' to give her a baby
The room feel like its spinnin'
We keep turnin' and turnin'
As if we were in a whirlwind
The way our toes are curlin'
The next thing ya know, she starts goin' real wild
And screamin' my name

Then I said baby, we must slow down
Before I bust a vessel in my brain

And she said please no don't stop
And I said I caught a cramp

And she said please keep on goin'
I said my leg is about to crack
Then she cries out
Oh my goodness, I'm about to climax
And I said cool
Climax
Just let go of my leg

She says you're the perfect lover
I said I cant go no further
Then I flip back the cover
Oh my God, a rubber",Trapped in the Closet Chapter 4,2005

Well, well, well
What the fuck is this
A condom in my bed
Ya better start talkin', bitch
'Fore I take a match and
Burn this motherfucker down
I said you better start talkin'
And start talkin' right god damn now

Then she said baby
I'm so speechless
Then I said my baby
You gone be breathless
If ya don't start talkin' quick
Woman, I'm gone have a fit
You don't know what ya fuckin' wit
Girl ya better cut the bullshit

Now its obvious somebody has been all up in my home
In my bed, and plus I smell cigarettes
Now and sniffin and lookin around
Suspicious like someone's here

Then I looked in her eyes and in her eyes
There was so much fear
Pull out my gun said is he still here
She shook her head and said no
I'm checkin' behind every door
She cried out he left right after you called
I said what the fuck was you thinking
You thought that I wouldn't find this out

Then I said you must be crazy or on crack to have somebody off 
Up in my motherfuckin' house
She hopped up and said that's enough
She said I cant take no more

And then she said you made your point
But now its time to even the score
She said I know all about last night
And where you went when you left the club

Said that's right, nigga I was there
Wit this guy in the back of the club
I said I thought you was wit yo girls

She said I thought you was wit yo guys
She said you was at that bitches house
And don't even try to act surprised

Said bab, she said shut up
Don't you say a word
It ain't nothin' you can say
That I ain't already heard

Then I said woman, don't you try to turn it all around
Cause the fact still remains that someone else was in my house
Then she said you're right about that
Somethin' did go down, but I don't have to turn it around

Cause what goes around comes back around
I'm movin' a little closer to her
She's trippin' over the furniture
She said wait first, just let me explain

I said no need to, just give me his name
And then she said uh, uh
I say uh what
She said please sit down in a chair
And I say no, I'm standin' up
And she cries out I'm so scared to tell you because of what ya might do
And I screamed look girl you better give me this man's name and I'm not playin' wit you

She says okay, wipes her nose and asks me about a girl named Tina
I thought to myself, said it sound familiar
I said I probably know her if I seen her

Then I say anyway girl, 
What the hell does that got to do with this man
She said he know my girl Roxanne
I said who the hell is Roxanne
Then she says Roxanne's a friend of mine who know with this guy named Chuck
Chuck's cool wit this guy name Rufus

And I'm sittin' here like what the fuck
Then she says Rufus wife, Cathy
We both went to high school
She introduced me to
The policeman that stopped you",Trapped in the Closet Chapter 5,2005
R. Kelly,"[Chorus]
I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend
Oh what am I gonna do?
Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end
Baby, I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend

Go ahead and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel
When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real
I should've been a man and told you a long time ago
Instead of stunnin' I should have broke it down and let you know
Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind
And I blame myself for wastin' your time
Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me
But her body language kept on tempin' and teasin' me
And plus she knew what she was doin' when she did it anyway
I knew what she was doin' too and that made it okay
Truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]

Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down
These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around
I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feelin her
And how we get away sometimes and make love
I never wanted to dislead you
At first I just wanted to please you
I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again
Because I came between you and your best friend
I did not ask for this
It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed
And the truth is that we don't even regret it
Up out the closet, I will be the first to say it

[Chorus]

I'm sorry again
Never meant to hurt you
I'm sorry again
But girl I love her
I'm sorry again
I never meant to make you cry, no
The first one out the closet

Like, you know when you got a good girl,
Or you know when she means something to you, & you got like, a name.

Here we go again
Here we go

[Mike Skinner]
Like I had a name for this girl, I used to call her ""Ladybird"",
Cos she always played red, in Connect Four.

[Leo The Lion](Chorus)
Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realize, I realize why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

[Kano]
Look, 
I call her ""Nite nite""
[?]
But we getting on fine right,
I don't wanna spoil it,
I don't why I can't commit to girls,
And I tell white lies, I'll find out the hard way,
Cos she got my favourite smile, her favourite style,
The first hotel, My favourite time, 
And maybe later we could have a baby, maybe a baby boy, my 
Favourite child,
""I'm way too tired"", My favourite lie,
I wasnt too sure of her favourite rhyme
The windows are steaming up like it's naked time,
Wait, we're way too bait,
I bought her favourite shoes, or they better be,
And she's even my favourite size,
And she knows I hate holding hands, and I'm hooded up when it's 
Bait inside,
So I guess she's my favorite, right?

[Leo the Lion]
Right,
Cos nothing comes close to you.

[Kano]
So numbers? No boys are taking yours,
And no girls are taking mine,
Groupies? **** that, I'm taking time,
We speak from like 8 till late at night,
When we gets on top, drop my favourite line:

[Leo the Lion]
Girl, I ain't going nowhere.

[Kano](spoken)
I plain ain't going nowhere,
But, I like you, and it might take some time,
But really I'm like:

[Leo the Lion & Kano]
Here we go again,

[Leo the Lion](Chorus)

[Kano]
I call her sometimes, and I wake her up at some dumb times,
Touch my phone, and her number my thumb finds,
Cos she's ideal, like a nice meal,
And a night in, with a nice feel,
Maybe some wine,
Maybe sometime we could hold hands in the park, in the sunshine,
Sometimes,
Be patient with me if I got 3 raves in 1 week,
Or in a studio, away for a week, 
One we could book a vacation and leave,
But please: ""No drama"", I don't need beef like (?)
I'm just focused on making the peas, Breaking the team, Chasing a 
Dream,
I ain't on the street, maybe sometimes, 
But you can't say I don't make enough time,
We speak everyday and meet everyweek,
So I dunno. Maybe it's me.
You? You got it planned out,
I don't make plans,
You know me, I wait and I see,
But if we were together, or even now,
If we weren't ""sort-of"", but were together,
Would you be faithfull to me?
Treat me massage me and make me a tea?
Come link me, lay and wake up from sleep, and look hot like 80 
Degrees?

[Leo the Lion]
And you know I never say that sort of thing

[Kano](spoken)
See? That's an angel to me
I wouldn't have said that before, you get me?

[Leo the Lion](Chorus)

[Leo the Lion]
No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, ow,
Baby we could do this again sometime,
I even have a special name for you,
It's ""Long Baby"", cos you always on my mind, yeah.
I'll tell you straight, so straight, yeah,
I won't tell my mates,
No, no, I know, No, I know,ohhh

Girl I'm surprised you this nasty
But its cool cause I always wanted to go down on a girl that reminds me of me

But in ya center I heat it up in the Mourning like Alonzo
And I'd get it, I'd bit it, I'd split it, I'd hit it up in a Tahoe
Bravo, make make make it clap I'd break break break ya back
Then tuck tuck tuck you in so you can take take take a nap
Then back to making dividends I'm in the wind
Somewhere hot, I stay on islands longer than Gulligan
Sipping on a pina colada, little mama I'ma make ya holla
How does it sounds when you making love on a Million dollars
I can only imagine lets make it real baby
Like D'Angelo ""How does it feel"" baby
I know I talk a lot shit but I can back it up (up up)
Like BBD flip it, rub it down, smack it up (up up)
You so bad when you call me for duty
You so fine I'm so sad that you feeling so woozy

Don't get caught up in the gossip, them chicks is jockin' girl
They just jealous, everybody hates when Cris is rocking ya world
Hey girl, hey friend, how you doing, where you been
Enough of that talking, lets begin, break it in
Shake and spin, take it in, say amen

Girl, it ain't no other way to describe you
Your momma raised you right
Yeah, I like that, it's like

Sittin' here in love rehab, I'm so crazy about you, dear
Doctor of my soul, I will never check out of here
Filled my prescription when I came to you and needed peace
You took me in and gave me joy and, girl, now I'm free
You are my circle, when I needed to talk you had my back
You my homie we go back, thank you for your love rehab

Doin' bad, ain't nobody in my life
I'ma kill a nigga or somebody gon' murder me soon
I'm a hope fiend, I need a woman in my life
Could you take me to the emergency room?

I need somebody that can nurse me back to health
'Cause I'm out here lovesick, shakin' like Pookie
You took me up outta the hoopty
Put me in the Lex 300 and got me blowin' on dookie

Now why do I respect ya, 'cause she down for a nigga
Before I was rollin' city to city
She got me screamin' out ""Yes Sir"", like I'm Pretty Ricky
Lookin' freaky, freaky while I'm smokin' on the sticky-icky

When I'm down and out, you be rubbin' my back
Because I miss you, you know I got issues
When I'm ridin' dirty and I got the thumper
And the law pull me over you will hold my pistol

Sick of how the women harm on me, you charmin' me
In the pharmacy of love, body be right I wanna hit you
You like a veteran when I need some medicine
You better than Exederin, fellas in trouble that wanna get you

I thought I knew what real love was till I met you
I'm reminiscin' on the love we had
I'ma stay sick forever hope I never get well
'Cause you got me in a love rehab

Sittin' here in love rehab, I'm so crazy about you, dear

You took me in and gave me joy and, girl, now I'm free
You are my circle, when I needed to talk you had my back
You my homie we go back, thank you for your love rehab

So many problems, so many people, so many decisions
So many roads that I have to choose, yeah
But still I'll roll the dice and pray that I don't lose
There were times that I got weak, fell short
I couldn't go on and she came through

So many friends, so many liars, so many haters
Sometimes I just don't know who to trust
But yet and still I turn the wheel of life and try my luck
There was a time when I was broke, didn't have a job
And this woman, she showed me love

Oh, since we first met, I've been risin' like an escalator
Now five years later, we have come up like an elevator
You made me better, babe, when I thought I was goin' crazy
I was just about to lose my mind, then you put me in your love rehab

Sittin' here in love rehab, I'm so crazy about you, dear
Doctor of my soul, I will never check out of here
Filled my prescription when I came to you and needed peace
You took me in and gave me joy and, girl, now I'm free
You are my circle, when I needed to talk you had my back
You my homie we go back, thank you for your love rehab

If I hit it I'ma spit that love flow
Forget what they all say
She the only one that helped me
Hit her with a little bit of 12 Play

When the Twista wasn't proper sippin' Vodka
I could remember tellin' the love Doctor ""I need some help""
Through the fire like I'm shocker, love it every time I rock her
Cock a pistol when I think I bleed to death

My surgeon and my methodome
The only one I talk to when I'm left alone
You the one that helped me fight through my challenges
Tell me what's my psychoanalysis

I thought I knew what real love was till I met you
I'm reminiscin' on the love we had
I'ma stay sick forever, hope I never get well
'Cause you got me in a love rehab

Sittin' here in love rehab, I'm so crazy about you, dear

Fuck me? Girl fuck you!

You ain't gotta worry about me no more
And the next time your ass get horny
Go fuck one of your funky ass friends
Hell yeah, you probably doing that shit anyway

You be sweet to me and I'm sweet to you

You may think I'm lyin' but it's the truth
'Cause I ain't gotta lie to kick it
It's easy for me to be pimpin'

To avoid the life lookin' ruff
Head and attitude all messed up
All ya gotta do is holler at Kells

Wanna get with a real balla that's makin' that real paper
If she want a good life, shop, hop out fancy cars
Award shows, party, mingle with the stars

Now if she understand that I am her burning man
And when it comes to sellin' out she's my sold out crowd
And if she's not the type that got a lot girlfriends

And let you know that Virginia will rise again}

I know you're feeling pain right now
And you don't wanna talk right now
I know you're going through something
And you don't wanna be bothered right now

Not gonna lie and say I understand
I just wanna be here for you if I can
To hold your hand and be by your side
And together we will get through these times

And we will cry together
And we'll fight this together
And we'll be strong together
Stand together, pray together

Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise up

Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up

Now I know the burdens that you've had
And you don't think nobody cares
A storm comes out of nowhere
And you're feeling like it just ain't fair

Not here to preach about the private side, no
'Cause I understand and now is not the time
See I just wanna help you make it right
Walk with you, holding the candle light

And we will cry together
And we'll fight this together
And we'll be strong together
Stand together, pray together

Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong

No color, no color

You are my sister and I'm your brother

And side by side we'll face this thing
Standing tall, you and me

But I want them to know that I love em
I appreciate them for supportin' R. Kelly

All different cultures

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winkin' eyes at me when I roll up on dem dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm wit' my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's wit' her man lookin' at me, damn right I'm a flirt
So, homie, don't bring your girl to me to meet 'cause I'm a flirt
And, baby, don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause I'm a flirt 
(It better be real tight too, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Please believe it unless your game is tight, and you trust her

Man, that's just the way it goes

All the ladies think I'm handsome
Jewelry shining, I stay stuntin'
That's why these niggas can't stand 'em
I'm a chick magnet
And anything fine, I'm baggin it
And if she got a man, I don't care
Ten toes, and I wanna be 'cause I gotta have it
Now, now who do it like B-O-dub?
Girls on me when I walk in the club
Game ain't tight, I'm a take yo' chick

With a rich nigga, fly young dude
Ride wit' me, lil' mama can't lose
Don't get mad at me, homie, 'cause yo' girlfriend choose
See, this is how goin' down in da 6-1-4 from the Nati up to Cleveland even in Toledo
I'm a boss, and you know it
I got the money, I'm a show it (that's right)
If I give yo' girl one chance to talk to me, homie, she ain't gon' blow it
And I stay fly, my game's so tight

In the club fuckin' wit' honies like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to da club
Creppin' all over the floor wit' his girlfriend in da club
And wonder why all these playas tryin' a holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga, I'm a holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin' through the mall
If I could, man, I would probably walk out wit' all of y'all
Yeah, yeah, homie, you say she yo' girlfriend
But when I step up to her, I'ma be like buzzin' and
Believe me, man, this is how dem playas do it in the Chi

That in the Chi is so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind
But Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test
You fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago
Let me get you to this real west
It's real strong
Real fat and real long
Doggies in the building
Holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it
Something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home
Work that filling till it's gone

Poppin' everybody
Got themselves another body
Knockin' out
Without protection though
That's my confession
But at the spot
If you just think
Your gonna listen
You can drop it like it's hot
Hold up

Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to
Shining like I supposed to
In the club, fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wondering why all these players trying to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gonna holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt with all of you
Yeah, yeah homie you say she's your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm gonna be like, ""cousin""
Believe me man, this is how them players do it in the chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff your bitch
'cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)

(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)

Hey homie, if you ain't getting no money
you better keep her away from me your dig.

Well if you love you girl
And wanna keep you girl
Don't be walking up and asking me to meet you girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I've seen you girl
Better treat your girl right
'cause another man will
Better eat you girl like another man will
'cause you leave your wife
And I see you wife
That be for real
How long you think that's finna be you wife
Well I'm living the life
You just getting it right
Your old lady look at me
'cause you ain't hitting it right
She probably used to like you
'cause you're the bitter type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass looking thick in the light
I noticed she was checking me
And digging the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that price
You know smack that thing
Sit that right
Up on that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pulling on her hair
Like we getting in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll suit 'er just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
'cause you might catch me
Trying to catch a glance up her skirt
The McLaren in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

(when I, when I, when I, when I) pull up to club
All the shawties be like (damn twenty-eight,eights)
Then I be like girl you know just who I am (don't hate, hate)
Say I done fell in love wit a stripper you all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down
I be like como se llamas little mama? mi llamo pain, what is your name?
I'm feeling your vibe
And I'm hoping you feel the same
I'm a wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
He's so fly
And yes, he's so cool
Hey shawty (hey shawty)

I don't know what you all be thinking
When you bring 'em round me (mane)
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B (mane)
Do you know what that means?

Playas get lonely too... too... 
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes 
Playas get lonely too... too... 

[Verse 1:] 
From, my iPhone to my sidekick 
Jet planes, schedule hectic 
My love life, I neglect it 
Had a fast car, but I wrecked it 
Plenty chances to fall in love man
So many weekends, I went to clubs man
In the fast lane, my life's a picture flick 
Let my drink decide, who is the next chick 
I ain't gone lie,all the blanck it matter to me 
She say she me love me, but it's just chit chatter to me 
But deep inside I was always missing something 
But I'm a thug so I'm always on something 
So many girls always drinking and having fun 
Life's a beauty shop and I keep my hair done 
Seem like I'm on a marry go ride 
Man it makes a thug wanna settle down, 

[Chorus:] 
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes 
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too...(oh I do) 
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes 
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too... (... and you know I do) 

[Verse 2:] 
I wanna settle down with you 
Baby you and me 
A Life that's brand new 
Quit running these streets 
Take away your pain 
Chase away the rain 
Off my love game 
I might even change my name

Uh, uh V.I.P. 
Uh, uh R.O.B 
Always in the spot light 
Living the good life 
All of that something still just ain't right 
Videos and all of these interviews 
When all I really want is to be next to you 
I spend more time with my cars now 
Land of the Hollywood sign, I'm a star now 
My life is more than the cars and awards 
It gets lonely and I can't ignore 
Always in the streets going hardcore 
I spend a couple of G's when I'm bored

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes 
Playas get lonely too...(oh I do) too (oh I do) 
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes 
Playas get lonely too... (oh I do) too (... and you know I do) 

[Verse 4:] 
Party lights mixed with lonely 
Nights mixed with birds grass 
Flights mixed with, 
Nobody to share it with 
Out of all the, after parties 
I still need somebody 
To be there when a playa's going through some shit 
To be there when a playa can't ever see...

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes 
Playas get lonely too... too 
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

'Cause I'm happy to be right next to you.
Thinking about the way you talk and the things you say
Make me stay so damned addicted to you

And I can't let go of your money and your time
And when touch me in my places, you send chills right down my spine.
I want you to know that you got me hypnotized
And I'll always be right by your side

You got my body, soul, and mind.
If loving you is wrong baby
Then I'd rather be wrong, baby
'Cause I, I can't live without you

Then, I'd rather be wrong, baby
'Cause I, I ain't right without you.

Friends say that we won't last but, I know that ain't so
'Cause they, they don't see how you love me
They judge me off the loves I had in the past, but his love's good to go
And you make me so dam happy.

They don't know, what it is to have everything
When you never had anything to show for
Since you brought me out of all my misery
I never had a man to love me like you do, it's do damn true
And if loving you is wrong
Then to hell with what the right folks do

And tonight she said she want me to take my time
So, I took her down and asked her if she liked that, and she say hell yea
Then I started to hit it from the back said its cool and she said hell yea.
She said ohh baby just take control baby as long as you take it slow baby
And we can hit it all night baby
She gave me the green so I had to go 
Start screamin my name on the window
And everytime I start goin real fast, she looked at me and said 

Yellow light 
Hey

Hey

Hey

Gota slow it down

I told her that I want to beat it up fast
So mama let me know when your down
Tonight she don't want a drill section
She wanna feel it so she told me to take it sloww
I'm so used to mackin it pokin it back to back
When I attackin it I wanna go n get inn
She blew the whistle like *whistle* be still
Hold it in now roll it in
She lifted her pumps to hold my face
Because she want me to control my pace
She said she wanna feel it all
Slidin through the wiffles of the walls 
'Cause the feelin was too cold to wait.
Well I can bring it 
Down to 50
Down to 40
Down to 30
Any speed you want me to
I can do, for you.
Shorty tell me how you want it
Do you want the lambo ?
I give it to you like uhuhuhuhuh

Or do you want the 64 ?

R. Kelly,"Seems like we're done here
Looks like that's everything
She walks by, one last time, 
Checks for her things and leave the keys behind
There will be more tears
As she's beginning to drive away
Its all clear now, there's no real reason to have the pain
Now I know love has kept me here, and my pride has kept me here
And hope keeps singing it's alright, I'll be fine

But she'll be going elsewhere
And she'll be lying else where
And she'll be wanted elsewhere
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
And she'll be living elsewhere
And she'll be laughing elsewhere
And shell be happy elsewhere
And I'll be just fine without her, someday

That's what I keep telling myself

Was it the right thing
Was this our biggest mistake
Still call sometimes but she's got nothing to say, And still she stays away
It's got me questioning, if I ever meant the same to her
How could she, Why would she
Do these things put me through this pain now
If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad
That she don't think it's not worth a fight, she won't try

But she'll be trying elsewhere
And she'll be loving elsewhere
And she'll keep secrets elsewhere
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
And shell be willing elsewhere
And shell be giving elsewhere
And she'll have feelings elsewhere
But hope keeps saying kells you can make it

But in the meantime I can't sleep I can't think
There's so many things in my head
Things she said, things that she meant
Things that I started feeling the day that she left
Things that I slept on
Things that I should have accepted
Things I expected and the things I neglected
I better get up off my ass
Get first flight out, and get her back

Or else

She'll be living elsewhere
And she'll be crying elsewhere
And shell be feeling elsewhere
And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
She'll be smiling elsewhere
And she'll be laughing elsewhere
Giving all of my sweet love away elsewhere
That's the reason why I gotta catch that flight

Sex that we're having here girl, oh
This is, this is number one
Sex that we're having here, girl, oh
(You better ask somebody)

Can't nobody do it like us
Can't nobody mix, chop, and screw it like us
All over the living room, hittin' it like us
In the middle of the night wake up the building like us

And it's okay if you wanna brag, the sex so good
Go and pat yourself on the back, and 'em haters
They gon' hate, but we just gon' keep blowing up
'Cause girl, they gon' hate anyway

You are now rocking with the best
I'll make you forget about the rest
Having sex with you is like making hits
Girl, we got egos, they can't tell us
That we ain't the shit and no

I'm in your mix like a number one record
And the beat goes on and on
And it don't stop you keep going, from the night on through the day
And I love it when you take me down and make me say

Number one
Sex that we're having here, girl, oh
This is, this is number one
Sex that we're having here girl, oh, Keri

You know you stay at the top spot
When you're breaking me down just like a chop shop, hey
Cutting like some blades on a caddy
That's how you're working me, daddy
Every time you put that on my womb

You are now rocking with the best
I'll make you forget about your ex
This one here's a race where you don't wanna come first
I know what I'm doing, ain't no need to rehearse, yeah
A lot of dudes just be going nowhere fast

But you be steady cruising like you want it to last

That's how you made me a chocoholic
And right now my body's callin'
I gotta know how, you got the know how
Baby, you the champ of all that goes down

If your dick was a gun, it was stone cold
With my R&B thug when I bang, bang
You know Kells and Keri hook up like that
You make it number one

You and me, in this bed, just what I was wishin'
Them other girls was cool, but it's somethin' they was missin'
And I don't call them back ever since we hit it in the kitchen

That night at my home, trench coat, nothin' on
Your sex got me gone, went straight to my dome
And I love it, girl, I love it, ooh, I love it, girl, I love it

Girl, there's somethin' about you that thrills me
That's why after we lay, you get to know the real me, yeah

All I wanna do is make this last
I'll kiss you up, I'll kiss you down, be real quiet, or making sounds
Take it slow, or take it fast

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Now usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to a hotel for just a one night stand
See, I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight

Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothin' like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child

Tellin' myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seein' this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothin' like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm 'bout to handle my business then put that girl in my kitchen

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (uh, that's what I told her)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)

All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasies
I can have you co-starrin' in one of my movies

Tell me what your name is, I can make you famous
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexin'
Now I ain't got nothin' to do, tonight I got away for my crew
I just wanna put some in you and I can tell that you want it too

And I'm ready, babe and you're ready, babe
So come on ladies let's get up out of this club
Kel's dreamin', Rese's after party come on fuck with us

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up

Ooh, this song has got me hungry, baby, baby
So tell me that you want me, baby, baby
And girl, I'll love you 'til the sun shines
And girl, I promise I will make you my mine

Around the world in and out of clubs hangin' with chicks
And I don't see nothin' wrong with havin' a kid
Sounds like heaven's callin' us
And girl, well, it's about makin' love

If you choose me I guarantee
That the rest of your life would be man drama free
I think both of us should leave this club
And get somewhere alone with me
Where there's no phones to ring and plant this magic seed

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Your house, my house don't matter, heat it up
Your city, my city don't matter, give it up
Somethin' about being with you make me wanna, baby
Put them pills on chill and girl give me my baby

You can play all you want but I know you feel it too
For 3 weeks you been talkin' about extra bedrooms
In New York meetin' with the realtor
There somethin' you wanna tell me, just say it, I'll pay it

Oh girl, I'ma take care of you
And I'ma still hold you like we brand new
So don't get it twisted for 30 somethin' weeks
I'm still gon' hit it and baby sit it, baby sit it

Or selfish babe (no ah)
Girl, I'm just thurstin' (no ha)
For that booty, babe

And it's all your fault, baby, you look so good
It's all your fault that it feels like wood
And you look so bored up in this club so let's go
We can hop in the Lamborghini, roll to my big home

Shorty let's go crazy, let's make a lil' Kelly

I'm lost without a cause

Who on earth can I turn to

I look to you
I look to you

After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you

Yeah

And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song

I look to you, you

About to lose my breathe,
There's no more fighting left,
I'm sinking to rise no more,
Searching for that open door, door

Every road that I've taken
Lead to my regret.
I don't know if I'm going to make it.
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.

Yeah, 'cause there's a few things that I would like to know
Before I fuck with you

Oh, baby could you learn
Could you learn to love a troubled man?
Oh, baby could you learn
Could you learn to love a troubled man?

You sure you wanna roll with me? I'm a complicated man
Live my life close to the edge, it ain't near safe to stand
I'm Trouble Man, always into something
Numb to the consequences, guess it's coming if it's coming
But so much shit they say that I can't do because I'm famous
Guess I should live in a bubble like these other entertainers
The danger's so enticing to me, I don't even notice it
Guess I get away or get arrested before it's over with
Prison sentence every year, got everybody after me
Reaper on my heels, I'm just praying he don't catch a G
Imagine me and you, somewhere happy with a few hundred mills,
Sill I could go to jail for some years,
Cause I push it to the limit, the danger's so exciting
I'm loving every minute, girl this life ain't nothing like it
And you only live once so as long as I'm alive
I'll be living on the edge
Shawty, sure you wanna ride?

Oh, baby could you learn
Could you learn to love a troubled man?
Oh, baby could you learn
Could you learn to love a troubled man?

Yeah, hey, hey and they say if the drugs ain't the death of me
The lifestyle will be!
Law keep arresting me, sucker wanna kill me
Still we're in the fast lane, grind break, next speed
A million dollar sports car, smoking on the best weed.
Fist fights in night clubs for rap beefs,
Shootings, retaliations, yeah, it's that deed!
I guess they just got to catch me when they catch me
Cause I'm putting it in they life if they attempt to disrespect me
Especially since I know they say what go around come around
That's why when we go around I keep a gun around
The bullshit, there be none around here
But I got a secret though, I wanna change, I swear!
But suckers won't let me and feds still sweat me
So I'm looking for the worst to have you praying for the best
Think you can help me if they get me?
Could you handle shit for me?
Think about it!
Is your body sure? the answer for me

Oh, baby (exactly)
Could you learn?
(Think you could learn to love a nigga like me?)
Could you learn to love a troubled man
(I know what I need) yeah! (and it's worth it, you know)
Yeah, yeah, baby could you love?
(Just think about it for a second)
Could you learn to love a troubled man, yeah?
(I mean could you find me near?)
I deserve you!

Girl, would you give me a number?
If I had an OK car, not much money
9 to 5 with a future on me, oh
Tell me, would you ever fuck with a brother like me?
(If I did time in my life, time, time in my life
Time, time in my life)
Tell me, would you give your sex to me?
I really want to know
(If I was fighting in the club, fighting in the club
Fight, fighting in the club, fighting in the club)
Hey lady,could you learn
Learn to love a troubled man?

Hey, hey, hey baby
Could you learn (tell me could you learn?)
Could you learn to love a troubled man?
(I mean if you knew he was really,
Really a good hearted person, man
Do you think you could put up the bullshit to the outside, man?
I mean if you saw the good qualities within, man
Could you, could you ignore all the bullshit that they are saying?
I'm a product of my environment,
I can only act as good as life allows me to act

What I need is a good influence like you
You know what I'm saying?

You could fly right back to me, yeah

I was your eagle, you were my dove yeah
And nothing would come between us, no, no, no
Now the fun and laughter, going to the park
And all the pictures we took
Now it's all gone away

And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh baby
I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
And baby I, I never meant to clip your wings
Now I'm wishing you
You could fly right back to me, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
Baby girl I never,
Meant to clip the wings of an angel
When I was supposed to love you baby
For eternity
Now I'm wishing you
You could fly right back to me, yeah",Clipped Wings,2012
R. Kelly,"I can't believe you're playing me like this,
I thought the love we shared, the good times we had, remember?
Yeah

Feels like it's over,
My heart tells me she's in love with someone else.
Gave me the cold shoulder
But this I lost 'cause I can find me somebody else

If she wanna hit the town
And party all night with her friends
If she wanna fool around
Then two can play that game baby

You got me feeling single,
About to give up
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me, girl
Feeling single,
Night is young,
Hit the club
Take somebody home with me

Get it, get it
Get it, get it
We can get it, baby
Get it, get it
Now I'm better single

She said forever
Turned out to be the biggest lie
Of all time
And she changed my weather
Rainin' all day
No chance of sunshine

If she wanna hit the town
And party all night with her friends
If she wanna fool around,
Then two can play that game baby

You got me feeling single
Feeling single,
About to give up
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me
Feeling single,
Night is young,
Hit the club
And take somebody home with me

Get it, get it
Get it, get it
Till the morning, baby
Get it get it
Now I'm feeling single

The way I see it, girl, not gonna do right
About me, baby girl
And I might as well (I might as well)
I might as well get out and mingle, girl
'Cause you got, you got, you got me feeling single

Yeah
And I don't wanna do it, baby,
But you're gonna make me
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me,
Treat me right, baby
Be in my house, in my room, in my bed, in my arms at night baby
And she's gonna love me, baby
And she's gonna give all lovin' lovin', baby",Feelin' Single,2012
R. Kelly,"Oh yeah, listen
I used to say I'll never let a woman break my heart, no
And I used to say I'll never let no girl leave me scarred
I was so, so proud
'Cause in the midst of us breaking up
Ooh baby I talk like, I was so, so tough
Now I can run up all day, call you out your name, girl
But at the end of the day, I'm just a fool for you baby
Oh yeah, girl
I'm just a fool for you baby
Alright now baby, yeah
And I don't mind

I used to tell my friends no girl could ever break me down
Oh no, not I
No girl is sweet enough to ever turn my world around
And you changed my mind
'Cause every time I walk out of the door
Ooh baby, I yell out, I ain't coming back no more
Hey now I can run up all day, call you out your name, girl
But at the end of the day, I'm just a fool for you baby
Oh yeah, girl
I'm just a fool for you baby
Alright now baby, hey
And I don't mind, I don't mind

And I don't care what my friends have to say
Baby they can't stop me from feeling this way, oh no
Whatever the cost, I'm willing to pay
'Cause I can't see me walking away
I'm your baby girl
Oh yeah, whoa, no na na, baby
Na na baby, baby, baby

I'm just a fool for you baby
A fool for you girl
Alright now baby, yeah
And I don't mind, 'cause your loving's just that good baby
Ooh, my friends say I'm crazy
But I'm crazy about you baby
Yes I am, I guess it's my honey
That's why her love keeps me running, for you baby
I'm a fool
I'm a fool, yeah
For my baby, baby, baby",Fool for You,2012
