John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers,"When I was a boy of eleven years I never saw my pa
Never understood what divorces were I hadn't grown that far
Loading our belongings on a little horse and cart
Mama said that she and daddy were now apart

These are the things I still remember from so long ago

Going to the seaside once a year, castles in the sand
Going to the fairground with my pennies counted in my hand
Going to the circus crying if I saw a clown
Walking on my six foot stilts and never falling down

These are the things I still remember from so long ago

Yelling at my brother, he's in hiding, won't play in the snow
Everything I do he just won't follow, doesn't want to go
Playing in the fields pretending I'm a Buccaneer
Threw a sword, accidentally hit him in the ear

These are the things I still remember from so long ago

Playing up the garden always building huts of turf and mud
Playing in the woods when an owl attacked me, mopped away the blood
Blowing up a rubber boat and patching up the holes
Falling in the water, dripping wet and catching colds

These are the things I still remember from so long ago

John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers,"Ah, you can talk about the pit, barbecue
The band was jumpin', the people too
Ah, mess around
They doin' the mess around
They doin' the mess around,
everybody doin' the mess around

Ah, everybody was juiced, you can, bet your soul
They did the boogie-woogie, with a steady roll *
They mess around
They doin' the mess around
They doin' the mess around,
everybody doin' the mess around

Now, ah, when I say stop don't you move a peg
When I say go, just ah, shake your leg
And do the mess around
I declare, do the mess around
Yeah do the mess around,
everybody's doin' the mess around

Now let me have it there boy

Now you got it boy

Now this band's goin' to play from, 9 to 1
Everybody here's gonna have some fun
Doin' the mess around
Ah, doin' the mess around
They doin' the mess around,

John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers,"Man's a filthy creature
Raping the land and water and the air
Tomorrow may be too late
Now's the time that you must be aware
Nature's disappearing
Polluted death is coming, do you care

Garbage going nowhere
Soon the dumps will spread to your front door
Lakes and rivers stagnant
Nothing lives or grows like years before
Nature's disappearing
The world you take for granted soon no more

Read about pollution
Make manufacturers uncomfortable
Boycott at the market
Containers that are non-returnable
Aluminum, glass and plastic
Eternal waste that's not destructible

We're a generation
That may live out our natural time
But as for all our children
Born to suffocate in human slime
Nature's disappearing
And we are guilty of this massive crime",Nature's Disappearing,2010
John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers,"I've been living with the Bear
In a big house full of blues
Going back through the years
Hear any record you choose

The sun is shining down
And the Bear is rolling in the shade
Everybody is gonna boogie
Blues roll night and day
Turn on all of the people
Who got no place to stay

All the men of Canned Heat
Are part of my family
I'm gonna remember
The things they did for me

I got to be moving
They call me Wandering John
I'll see you, old Bear
I'll be back 'fore long

John Mayer,"I just remembered that time at the market
You snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rode down aisle 5
You looked behind you and smiled back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave

Can't remember what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to

Our love was comfortable and so broken in

I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say she's gonna be good for me
They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity

Your mouth was so dirty
Life of the party
And she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrain

Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say
Say

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
The poses for pictures that aren't being taken

I loved you
Gray sweat pants
No makeup
So perfect

Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect, so flawless
I'm not impressed

I want you back",Comfortable,1999
John Mayer,"I know you've been swarmed,
I read your complaint,
You're needing someone older.
And though I've been warned,
To live day by day,
There's something takin' over
Did you expect to kiss me one time,
While lookin' at me with the same eyes ever again?

So come on and say it!
So come on and say it!
It's time that we say it!

You can cross the line whenever you want to,
I'm calling it love soon.
Close your mind and waste sometime if you have to.
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now.
It's what we are

Your mother complains, that you need a man
You haven't mentioned me yet.
And all of your friends don't know who I am
I've been your best kept secret
I understand I wasn't part of the plan
A dollar short of it, and early
But I am your man.
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it!

You can cross the line whenever you want to,
I'm calling it love soon.
Close your mind and waste sometime if you have to.
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now.
It's what we are
It's what we are

Let's bypass the bullshit
And move on because the minute hand
Moves faster than you think it does.
And by no fault of yours,
And by no fault of mine,
The bottom line is layin' in
The bed that we've been playin' in tonight
We've been playin' in tonight

I'm callin' it love soon
I'm callin' it love soon

You can cross the line whenever you want to,
I'm calling it love soon.
Close your mind and waste sometime if you have to.
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now.

It's what we are",Love Soon,1999
John Mayer,"Midnight
Lock all the doors
And turn out the lights
Feels like the end of the world
This Sunday night

There's not a sound
Outside the snow's coming down
Somehow I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind

3:02
Space in this room
Has turned on me
And all my fears have me cornered me here
Me and my tv screen

The volume's down
Blue lights are dancing around
And still, I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind

Daylight is climbing the walls
Cars start and feet walk the halls
The world awakes and now I'm saved
At least by the light of day
At least by the light of day",Quiet,1999
John Mayer,"Don't know why tori came by,
I could see by the look in her eye,
Tori'd been driving round the town for a while
Plying with the thought of leaving
I don't know why, tori just smiled
And mentioned something about how you were right
Must have been hard to see
Through the tears she was hiding
She said I might not be seeing him soon.
I got a few things I've been waiting to do

Hey
Tori came by,
Tori came by tonight
Hey
Tori came by,
She says to say ""goodbye""

Looked outside,
At the car in the drive
And the suitcase,
On the backseat inside
Sure, it's so,
She can't look out behind at the road
She said I might not be seeing him soon.
I got a few things I've been waiting to do

Hey
Tori came by,
Tori came by tonight
Hey
Tori came by,
She says to say ""goodbye""

Don't look down.
She seemed alright
You might be asking ""where is tori tonight?""
Somewhere out on the highway,
I'm sure that she is fine",Victoria,1999
John Mayer,"My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said ""well anyway""
Just dying for a subject change

Oh, another social casualty
Score one more for me
How could I forget?
Mama said ""think before speaking""
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon

We bit our lips
She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good, what just slipped out and what went wrong

Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again.
How could I forget?
Mama said ""think before speaking""
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one

I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me

Oh I'm never speaking up again
Starting now

One more thing
Why is it my fault?
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
I just want to be liked
I just want to be funny
Looks like the jokes on me
So call me captain backfire

I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me

Oh I'm never speaking up again
Starting now",My Stupid Mouth,2001
John Mayer,"Suppose I said
I am on my best behavior
there are times
I lose my worried mind

Would you want me when I'm not myself?
Wait it out while I am someone else?

Suppose I said
Colors change for no good reason
words will go
From poetry to prose

Would you want me when I'm not myself?
Wait it out while I am someone else?

And I, in time, will come around, come around
I always do for you

Suppose I said
You're my saving grace?

My grace

Not myself, my myself and I,
When I'm someone else
When I'm someone else
When I'm someone else
When I'm not myself

John Mayer,"I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been
You held this letter
Probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm
In the mood to lose my way with words

Today skies are painted colors of a cowboy's cliche'
And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky
Are next to mountains anyway

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way
But let me say

You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5's

Guess you had to be there
Guess you had to be with me

Today I finally overcame
Trying to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to
Lose my way but let me say

You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
No more 3x5's
Just no more 3x5's",3x5,2001
John Mayer,"I am driving up 85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
I'm just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

'Cause I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia, why?

I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul

Either way I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia, why?

So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay
Still ""everything happens for a reason""
Is no reason not to ask myself if I

Am living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, tell me why,
Why, why Georgia, why?",Why Georgia,2001
John Mayer,"I've these dreams of
Walking home
Home where it used to be
And everything is
As it was
Frozen in front of me

Here I stand
6 feet small
Romanticizing years ago
But it's a bitter sweet feeling hearing
""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" on the radio

And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be more like they
Were at the start of me
Had it made in 83

Thinking bout my brother Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother John
But on an 18 month delay

Here I stand
6 feet small
And smiling cause I'm scared as hell
Kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actor's names have changed
Oh well

Well these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be more like they
Were at the start of me
If my life was more like 1983
Plot a course to the source of the
Purest little part of me

And most my memories
Have escaped me
Or confused themselves within dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of 1983

You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards
Replace the shutters but
That's my plastic in the dirt

Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox
When came the day that it got
Thrown away and don't you think I should have had some say
In that decision

If only my life (repeated till fade)",83,2001

It always comes around
Back to you
I tried to forget you
I tried to stay away
But its too late

Over you
I'm never over
Over you
Something about you
Its just the way you move
The way you move me

I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit ever game I play
But forgive me, love
I cant turn and walk away

Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette

Should have smiled in that picture
If its the last that Ill see of you
Its the least that you
Could not do

John Mayer,"I never liked this apple much
It always seemed too big to touch
I can't remember how I found
My way before she came around
I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name
She keeps a toothbrush at my place
As if I had the extra space
She steals my clothes to wear to work
I know, her hairs are on my shirts

I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before
The day
She called up and came to me
Covered in rain
And dinnertime shadowing
And as her clothes spun, we spooned
And I knew I was through
When I said ""I love you""
Friday evening, we've been drinking
2 AM, I swear I might propose
But we close the tab
Split a cab
And call each other up when we get home
Falling asleep to the sound
Of sirens

From the battery
To the gallery

In scented, glossy magazines
And I can't remember life before her name",City Love,2001
John Mayer,"Check your pulse
Its proof that you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days

Scared of the world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors

Lamplight makes the shadows play
And posters take the walls away
The TV is your window pane
The view wont let you down

So put your faith in a late night show
I bet you didn't even know
Depends on how far out you go
The channel numbers change

Scared of the world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors

Though lately I cant blame you
I have seen the world
And sometimes wish your room had room for two

So go unlock the door
And find what you are here for

To see the colors of the city lights

Hits her like a sunrise

She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can

Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything

She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands

She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand

John Mayer,"""Welcome to the real world"", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat
Take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding
Up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world

Break out the winter clothes
And find a love to call your own
You, enter you
Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue

Who knows what will be
But I'll make you this guarantee

No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors
I'm learning you
And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do
I'll say to you

No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?

And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

We should take a ride tonight around the town
and look around at all the beautiful houses
something in the way that blue lights on a black night
can make you feel more
everybody, it seems to me, just wants to be
just like you and me

No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
Come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times

Up the broken pieces of yesterdays life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind, it cries Mary
The traffic lights, they turn, uh, blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags down stream
'Cause the life that lived is,
Is dead

The names it has blow in the past?

It whispers no, this will be the last

John Mayer,"I never liked this apple much
It always seemed too big to touch
I can't remember how I found
My way before she came around

I tell everyone I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name

She keeps a toothbrush at my place
As if I had the extra space
She steals my clothes to wear to work
I know, her hairs are on my shirts

I tell everyone I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before

Covered in rain and dinnertime shadowing
And as her clothes spun, we spooned
And I knew I was through when I said, ""I love you""

Friday evening, we've been drinking
Two A.M. I swear I might propose
But we close the tab, split a cab
Call each other up when we get home
Falling asleep to the sound of sirens

I was born a house cat
By the slight of my mother's hand

I think I'm gonna stay home

I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I used to be in my M-Z now
You'll never find me 'cause my name isn't there

Home life
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life

I want to see the end game
I want to learn her last name
Finish on a Friday
And sit in traffic on the highway
See, I refuse to believe
That my life's gonna be
Just some string of incompletes
Never to lead me to anything remotely close to home life

Been holding out for a home life
My whole life

I can tell you this much
I will marry just once
And if it doesn't work out
Give her half of my stuff
It's fine with me
We said eternity
And I will go to my grave
With the life that I gave
Not just some melody line
On a radio wave
It dissipates
And soon evaporates
But home life doesn't change (Home life doesn't change)

I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I'd love to walk to where we can both talk, but
I've got to leave you 'cause my ride is here

And my home life
You take the home life
You keep the home life
I'll come back for the home life
I promise
Home life I promise
Life, home life

One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body Is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body Is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em

just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but

About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul

Either way I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay
Still everything happens for a reason
Is no reason not to ask myself

I got a reflection with a different name.
Got a brand new blues that I can't explain.
Who did you think I was?

In the morning when the day begins
I'm makin' my mind but change it back again.
I am a shifter of the shape I'm in.
Who did you think I was?

You've got my number but I always new the score.
Who did you think I was?

Am I the one who plays the quiet songs?
Is he the one who turns the ladies on?
Will I keep shinein' 'till my light is gone?
Who did you think I was?

Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls
Ever breaking record off
For something someone yelled real loud one time?
Oh, everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily

Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon
For the war that's raging on inside
Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly

We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for

Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrender with their life on the line?

We're never gonna win the world

Ow Dolly mae, girl, you must be insane
So unsure of yourself leaning from your unsure window pane
Do I see a silhouette of somebody pointing something from a tree?
Click bang, what a hang, your daddy just shot poor me
And I hear you say, as I fade away...

I try to keep an open mind
But I just can't sleep on this tonight

Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train

Don't know how else to say it,
I don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own

Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train

So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find away to say that life has just begun

Had a talk with my old man
Said ""help me understand""
He said ""turn sixty-eight""
""You'll renegotiate""

""Don't stop this train
Don't for a minute change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly we'll never stop this train""

Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
When you're all still around
And you're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
Till you cry when you're driving away in the dark.

Singing stop this train I want to get out and go home again
I can't take this speed it's moving in
I know I can't
'Cause now I see I'm never gonna stop this train",Stop This Train [Acoustic Set],2008

The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from
Being just a number
How do I hold my head
To keep from going under

I wanted water but
I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through

When the world keeps
Testing me, testing me, testing me

How did they find me here
What do they want from me
All of these vultures hanging
Right outside my door
I hear them whisperin'
They're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long
Without a kill before

Down to the wire
I wanted water but
I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher

Testing me, testing me, testing me

Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
Can't seem to keep these vultures
Out of my tree(sometimes he says trail)
Powers is made, by power being taken
I keep on running
To protect(sometimes he says control) my situation

Down to the wire

Oh, on the phone you said you wanted to run off with me today

Your voice comes thrashing wildly through my quiet bed
You say you wanna try again

Why you wanna break my heart again
Why am I gonna let you try

When all we ever do is say goodbye
Oh, all we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
Oh, all we ever do is say goodbye

And by the time it landed you were gone again

When the roads are quiet
No one is around
To track my moves

Race in the end of lights
To find the gate is open
She's waiting in the room
I just slip on through

You get in
You get done
And then you get gone
You never leave a trace or show your face
You get gone

Should have turned around
And left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again

Enter the morning light
To find the day is burning the curtains and the wine
In a little white room
No, I'm not alone
Her head is heavy on me
She's sleeping like a child
What could I do?

You get in
You get done
And then you get gone
You never leave a trace or show your face
You get gone

Should have turned around
And left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again

I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too

Suddenly I'm in over my head and I can hardly breathe
Suddenly I'm floating over her bed and I feel everything
Suddenly I know exactly what I did, but I cannot move a thing
Suddenly I know exactly what I'd done and what it's gonna mean to me, mean to me
I'm gone

I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing

Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

So young and full of running, all the way to the edge of desire
Steady my breathing, silently screaming,
""I have to have you now""

Think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Maybe this mattress will spin on its axis and find me on yours

The streets will flood
With blood of those who felt the same

Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
I made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, 'till the day you came

Yes sir
Come on let's have a drink
If you insist

It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place
Except you and me

Set'em up, Joe
You know John I got a little story that you oughta know,
Wait' till you hear 'bout this""

We're drinking my friend,
To the end Of a brief episode
I am tellin' you that's what happened
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road, (Here's to you, cheers)

I got the routine (Oh no you too)
So drop another nickel in the machine

Man, I'm feeling so bad
I wish you'd make that music dreamy and sad


I could tell you a lot (You too, right?)
But you've got to be true to your code (okay)
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

You'd never know it, but buddy, I'm a kind of poet

Well yea that's right, I've got a lot Of things to say

And when I'm gloomy You simply gotta listen to me
Until it's talked away

Let's have another drink. Bartender fill it up again, will you?

That's how it goes
John, I know you're getting very anxious to close

""You don't know me well enough""

Tony thanks for the cheer
I hope you don't mind me bending your ear

'Cause this torch that I found
Must be drowned or it or soon might explode

Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

Take it home, now
That long,
That long, long road

It was some kind of miracle that I survived

And have to laugh
We lived through a lifetime
And the aftermath

But I don't want to lose you know

To let a day
Slip on by
Without even seeing each other at all
But this is the time you'll turn back and so will I
And those will be the days you can never recall

And so we embrace again

John Mayer,"Walt Grace, desperately hating his whole place,
Dreamed to discover a new space,
And buried himself alive,
Inside his basement, tongue on the side of his face when,
He's working away on displacement,
And what it would take to survive.

'Cause when you're done with this world,
You know the next is up to you.
And his wife told his kids he was crazy,
And his friends said he'd fail if he tried,
But with a will to work hard,
And a library card,
He took a homemade, fan-blade, one-man submarine ride.

That morning, the sea was mad and I mean it,
Waves as big as he'd seen it,
Deep in his dreams at home.
From dry land,
He rolled it over to wet sand,
Closed the hatch up with one hand,
And peddled off alone.

'Cause when you're done with this world,
You know the next is up to you.
And for once in his life it was quiet,
As he learned how to turn in the tide,
And the sky was a flare,
When he came up for air,
In his homemade, fan-blade, one-man submarine ride.

One evening,
When weeks had passed since his leaving,
The call she'd planned on receiving,
Finally made it home.
She accepted,
The news she'd never expected,
The operator connected,
A call from Tokyo.

'Cause when you're done with this world,
You know the next is up to you.
Now his friends,
Bring him up when they're drinking,
At the bar with his name on the side,
And they smile when they can,
As they speak of a man,
Who took a homemade,
Fan-blade, one-man submarine ride.","Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967",2012

That some people grow old
Without losing a part of their soul

There's a light in your eyes that is pure
That you won't give away anymore
But just think of the things
We can talk about now
You're no one 'til someone lets you down

Yes, I have heard
There are some that avoid
All the pain that will come the fall
But if that's the case
It would surely erase
All the joy that you feel
When the hurt fades away

where all of the walls all continually change

Maybe It's got nothing to do with me

Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers be good to your daughters too

It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do

You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth of

Looking out for every girl
You are the god and weight of her world

John McCrea,"I'm walking alone again
With my headphones on
And I don't want this anymore,
To hit the streets without a chord
Now this city is my song
Where I submerge myself
Taking a long walk around the block
Every little step,
Every single step becomes a note
That I draw on the staff lines of the sidewalk

I'm walking alone again, with my headphones on
And I really really wanna run
But at this moment, I'm listening to a very very soft song

I'm walking again alone
With my headphones on
And now I speak and I'm screaming
Because I can't hear my own voice

I'm walking alone again
With my headphones on
I have to walk between smog
Behind sunglasses, inside my clothes

Sometimes,I feel that every simple thing has a sound
And if it does
What kind of shape does the silence have?

Even if the silence is still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence walks with me
No one really hears it

Sometimes I feel like everything has a sound
And if it does
What kind of shape does the silence have?
A sparkling new? A pocket size?
A white one? A smoke one?
One that you can use as a tattoo
Or as a flag as an umbrella
To protect you against the rain
Of noise that the city has?
Or maybe it's a package,
Where the secret comes from

Even if the silence is still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence walks with me
No one really hears it
Even if the silence is still with me
No one can hear it
Even if the silence is still with me",The Headphonist,2003

John McCusker,"It being in the springtime and the small birds they were singing
Down by yon shady harbour I carelessly did stray
The thrushes they were warbling, the violets they were charming
To view fond lovers talking, a while I did delay

She said, my dear don't leave me all for another season
Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you
I'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish Nation
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu

He said, my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience
You know I love you dearly the more I'm going away
I'm going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation
To comfort us hereafter all in America

Then after a short while a fortune does be pleasing
“Twill cause them for to smile at our late going away
We'll be happy as Queen Victoria, all in her greatest glory
We'll be drinking wine and porter, all in America

If you were in your bed lying and thinking on dying
The sight of the lovely Bann banks your sorrow you'd give o'er
Or if were down one hour, down in yon shady bower
Pleasure would surround you, you'd think on death no more

Then fare you well, sweet Craigie Hill, where often times I've roved
I never thought my childhood days I'd part you any more
Now we're sailing on the ocean for honour and promotion
And the bonny boats are sailing, way down by Doorin shore",Craigie Hill,2014
John McCusker,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star,2014
John McCusker,"I can tell by the way you're walking
You don't want company 
I'll let you alone and I'll let you walk on 
And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see 
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee 

Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be 
When we look back and say those were halcyon days 
We're talking about jubilee",Jubilee,2014
John McCusker,"There was a time when we?d be the last to leave 
Watching the sun come up while everyone fell asleep 
The music was always loud and I?d smoke and drink too much 
Until I?d fall in your arms and into your lovin? touch 
Now as the years roll by, time has reeled me in 
I?ve slowed down a notch or two from the way things were then 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

Remember the days when we?d pack our bags and run 
Chasing a crazy dream into the morning sun 
Now as the twilight falls, I find I?m satisfied 
Watching the fire glow as long as you?re by my side 
Here in my heart it seems, time has passed me by 
I love you as much today as the very first time 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

I still want you the way I wanted you then 
If I could do it all over, I?d do it all over again 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you

John McCutcheon,"Often I sing for my friends when death's cold hand I see

But when I am called who will sing one song for me

I wonder who will sing for me

When I'm called to across that silent sea who will sing for me



So I'll sing till the end and helpful try to be

I wonder who will sing for me...

John McCutcheon,"How many times have you heard someone say,
""If I had his money I would do things my way.""

How little they know, well, it's so hard to find,
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.

Oh, once I was waiting for fortune and fame,
Had everything that I needed to get a start in life's game.

Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime,
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.

No money can buy back your youth when you're old,
Or a friend when you're  lonely or a love that's grown cold.

And the world's richest person is a pauper at times,
Compared to the one with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over and my time has run out,
All my friends and my loved ones I'm gonna leave them no doubt.

But there's one thing for certain, when it comes my time,
I'm gonna leave this old world with a satisfied mind.",Satisfied Mind,1987

Above earth's lamentation.
I hear the real, thought far off hymn
That hails the new creation
Above the tumult and the strife,
I hear the music ringing;
It sounds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing?

What through the tempest loudly roars,
I hear the truth, it liveth.
What through the darkness round me close,
Songs in the night it giveth.
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging.
Since love is lord of Heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

When tyrants tremble, sick with fear,
And hear their death-knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near,
How can I keep from singing?
In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging.
When friends by shame are undefiled,

John McCutcheon,"It was the early spring and the strike was on
They run us miners out of doors
Out from the houses that the company owned 
We set up tents down at old Ludlow

I was worried bad about my children
Soldiers guarding from the railroad bridge
Every once in a while bullets would fly
Kicking up gravel underneath our feet

We were so afraid they'd kill our children
We dug a cave about seven foot deep
We carried the young ones and a pregnant woman
Down into that cave to keep

That very night the soldiers waited
Until us miners was fast asleep
They crept into our little tent town
And they soaked our tents with kerosene

Then they  struck a match and the blaze it started
And the roar of the gattling gun
I made a run for the children but a fire wall stopped me
Thirteen children died from their guns

I'll never forget the look on the faces
Of the men and the women that awful day
As we stood around for to preach their funerals
And lay the corpses of the dead away

Then we took some cement and we walled that cave up
Where those thirteen children died
And I said, ""God bless the mine workers' union,""

When life was slow and oh, so mellow.
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain was yellow.
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender and callow fellow,
Try to remember and if you remember the follow.

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow.
Try to remember when life was so tender that
Dreams were kept beside your pillow.
Try to remember when life was so tender that
Love was an ember about to billow.
Try to remember and if you remember then follow.

With the people here working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes nor barley nor wheat
But there's gangs of them that's what I've been told

But all that I found there I might as well be
Where the mountains of mourne sweep down to the sea
I believe that when writing a wish you expressed
As to how the fine ladies in london were dressed
Well if you'll believe me, when asked to a ball
They don't wear a top to their dresses at all!

Say if they were bound for a ball or a bath
Don't be starting them fashions now, marry machree

You remember young peter o'loughlin, of course
Well, now he is here at the head of the force
I met him today, I was crossing the strand
And he stopped the whole street
With one wave of his hand
And there we stood talking of days that are gone
While the whole population of london looked on
But for all these great powers, he's wishful like me
To be back where dark mourne sweeps down to the sea

There's beautiful girls here - oh never you mind!
With beautiful shapes nature never designed
And lovely complexions, all roses and 'cream
But o'loughlin remarked with regard to the same:
""that if all those roses you venture to sip,
The colour might all come away on your lip""

In a lonely grave unknown lies the heart that beat so true
He sank faint and hungry among the famish'd brave
And they laid him sad and lonely within his nameless grave


No more the bugle calls the weary one,
Rest, noble spirit,
In thy grave unknown! I'll find you and know you,
Among the good and true,
When a robe of white is giv'n for the faded coat of blue


He cried, ""give me water and just a little crumb,
And my mother she will bless you thro' all the years to come;
Oh! tell my sweet sister, so gentle, good and true,
That I'll meet her up in heaven, in my faded coat of blue.""

Long, long years have vanished, and though he comes no more,
Yet my heart will startling beat with each footfall at my door;
I gaze o'er the hill where he waved a last adieu,
But no gallant lad I see, in his faded coat of blue.

Do you mind if I sit here down by your graveside,
And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun,
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done
I see by your gravestone you were only 19
When you joined the great fall-in in 1916
I hope you died well and I hope you died clean
Or young willie mcbride was it slow and obscene.


Did they beat the drum slowly did they play the fife lowly
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down
Did the band play the last post and chorus
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest


Did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind
In some faithful heart is your memory enshrined
Although you died back in 1916
In that faithful heart are you forever 19
Or are you a stranger without even a name
Enclosed then forever behind a glass frame
In an old photograph torn, battered and stained
And faded to yellow in a brown leather frame.


Did they beat the drum slowly did they play the fife lowly
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down
Did the band play the last post and chorus
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest


The sun now it shines on the green fields of france
There's a warm summer breeze makes the red poppies dance
And look how the sun shines from under the clouds
There's no gas, no barbwire, there's no guns firing now
But here in this graveyard it's still no man's land
The countless white crosses stand mute in the sand
To man's blind indifference to his fellow man
To a whole generation that were butchered and damned.


Did they beat the drum slowly did they play the fife lowly
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down
Did the band play the last post and chorus
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest


Now young willie mcbride I can't help wonder why
Do those who lie here know why did they die
Did they believe when they answered the call
Did they really believe that this war would end wars
Well the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain
The killing and the dying were all done in vain
For young willie mcbride it all happened again,
And again and again and again and again

Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down

One sword at least thy rights shall guard,

No light in the window, no welcome at the door

Here's where they sailed their wee boats on the burn 
Where are they now? Some are dead, some have wandered 
No more to their home will the children return

Strands of clouds go slowly driftin' by
In the park, the dreamy bees are droning in the flowers among the trees
And the sun burns in the sky.


Now the sun is in the west
Little babies lay down to take their rest
And the couples in the park are holding hands and waiting for the dark
And the sun is sinking low.


Now the sun has come to earth
Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death.
Death comes in a blinding flash of hellish heat that leaves a smear of ash
And the sun has come to earth.


Now the sun has disappeared
All that's left is darkness, pain and fear.
Twisted sightless wrecks of men go crawling on their knees and cry in pain
And the sun has disappeared

I wish you peace and joy
I'll sing this song of times long gone
And pray you will enjoy

Were on a christmas morn'
When my dear father sang his songs
And christ the king was born

The songs he sang so loudly rang
Throughout our happy house
But when mother took her turn,
He sat as quietly as a mouse
The fondest memories I recall
Were on a christmas morn'
How mother sang the sweetest songs
And christ the king was born.

And I sing on christmas day
I sing a song to days long gone
And those who've passed away
I have four children proud and strong
And they have children too
And on christmas morn they sing along
Just like we use to do
The fondest memories we shall have
Take place on christmas morn'
My children's children sing their songs
And christ the king is born.

And at his blessed birth the stars
Their exultation voiced.

Chorus:
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him

Again the heart with rapture glows
To greet the holy night,
That gave the world it's christmas rose,
Its king of love and light
Let ev'ry voice acclaim his name,
The grateful chorus swell
From paradise to earth he came
That we with him might dwell.

And the rising of the sun
Young and free as the island breeze
Their lives had just begun

Till a dark day in November
With the seering cold that starts
Stalked the hunter with his bow
And put an arrow through her heart

[Chorus]
And the cold wind blow
He was brave but he lay low
By her body in the isle of mist
I saw her give him one last cold kiss
One last cold kiss

Now swans like people
Talk of only one in this fair side
Though they brought him 20 ladies
He would take no other bride

And they say he will not move
From the place where she did fall
Once so proud he's beaten now
And he will not rise at all

[Chorus]",One Last Cold Kiss,1999
John McDermott,"Of all the money that er'e I spent
I spent it ingood company
And all the harm that ere I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I have done
For want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill ne the parting glass
Goodnight and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that er'e I had
Are sorry for my going away
And all the sweetheart that er'e I had
Would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls, unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I will gently rise
And I'll softly call
Goodnight and joy be with you all

If I had enough money to spend
And leisure time to sit a while
There is a fair maid in this town
That sorely has my heart beguiled
Her rosey cheeks and ruby lips
I own, she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Goodnight and joy be with you all

John McDermott,"My young love said to me
""My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind""
And she stepp'd away from me
And this she did say
""It will not be long, love
Till our wedding day""

She stepp'd away fromme
And went through the fair
And fondly I watch'd her
Move here and move there
And then she went homeward
With one star awake
As the swan in the evening
Moves over the lake

The people were saying
That no two e'er were wed
And one had a sorrow
That never was said
And I smiled as she passed
With her goods and her gear
And that was the last
That I saw my dear

Last night she came to me
She came softly in
So softly she came
That her feet made no din
And she placed her hand on me
And this she did say
""Oh it will not be long, love
Till our wedding day""",She Moved Thro' the Fair,1999

I stand in this quiet place
Where the silver light of countless stars
Falling on my face
Though they all shine so brightly
Somehow it comforts me to know
That some that burn the brightest
Died an eternity ago

Chorus
But your light still shines
It's one small star to guide me
And it helps me to hold back the dark
Your light's still shining in my heart

I'm learning how to live without you
And I never thought I could
And even how to smile again
I never thought I would
And I cherish your heart's memories
Cause they bring you back to life
Some caress me gently
And some cut me like a knife

Chorus

Can your soul be out there some where
Beyond the infinity of time
I guess you've found some answers now
I'll have to wait for mine
When my light joins with yours one day
We'll shine through time and space
And one day fall on a distant age
Upon some stranger's face

But your light still shines
It's one small star to guide me
And it helps me to hold back the dark
Your light's still shining in my heart
Your light's still shining in my heart

O Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

""Though all the world betrays thee,
One sword at least thy rights shall guard,
One faithful harp shall praise thee!""

The minstrel fell! But the foreman's chain
Could not bring that proud soul under;
The harp he loved ne'er spoke again
For he tore is chords asunder;

Thou soul of love and bravery!
Thy songs were made for the pure and free,
They shall never sound in slavery.""",Minstrel Boy [With Overture],1999

The day you took my hand.

And, yes, I know how lonely life can be.
The shadows follow me, and the night won?t set me free.
But I don?t let the evening get me down
Now that you?re around me.


And you love me, too.
Your thoughts are just for me;
You set my spirit free.
I?m happy that you do.

And once a page is read,

Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream
The women in the meadow making hay
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin

And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play
For the breezes blowing o'er the seas from Ireland
Are perfumed by the heather as they bloom
And the women in the uplands diggin' praties

Speak a language that the strangers do not know
For the stranger came and tried to teach us their way
They scorned us just for being what we are
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams

Or light a penny candle from a star

Today I saw some ruins of the Roman worlds decline
And I climbed those Spanish steps, you heard so much about
But Rome has lost its glory, I don't know what it's about

I wish you were here
When the shadows falling and all the rushing traffic's still
I wish you were here
When the bells are ringing on the Seven Hills

I'll make my way to a small cafe
I wonder what you did today
I wish you were here

Dear one at home, I just flew in from Rome
Paris is a postcard all decked out in colour chrome
So I climbed the Eiffel Tower, I prayed at Notre Dame
But I just can't find the romance and I wonder why I came

I wish you were here
On the Champs-Elysees, lovers walking hand in hand
I wish you were here
When they take one look at me and seem to understand

This city of light is a lovely sight
But the first bright star I see tonight
I wish you were here

Now I write this from the plane
Drinking cheap champagne
Wondering how two people got so far apart

Wish you were here
Here in London where the rain is pouring down
I wish you were here
On this airplane headed back to New York town

I'll never leave you alone again
I'm coming home but until then

John McDermott,"You may travel far from your own native home
Far away o'er the mountains far away o'er the foam
But of all the fine places that I've ever been
There's none can compare with the cliffs of Dooneen

It's a nice place to be on a fine summer's day
Watching all the wild flowers that ne'er do decay
Oh the hare and the pheasant are plain to be seen
Making homes for their young round the cliffs of Dooneen

Take a view o'er the mountain fine sites you'll see there
Yes in a high rocky mountain in the west coast of Clair
Oh the towns of Kilkee and Kilrush can be seen
From the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Dooneen

So fare thee well to Dooneen fare thee well for a while
And although we are parted by the raging sea wild
Once again I will wander with my Irish colleen
Round the high rocky slopes of the cliffs of Dooneen",Cliffs of Dooneen,2007
John McDermott,"Wild mountain thyme : to the mcpeake family of belfast

Oh the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly bloomin'
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the bloomin' heather
Will ye go lassie go and we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme?
All around the bloomin' heather
Will ye go lassie go

I will build my love a bower by yon pure crystal fountain
And on it I will pile all the flowers of the mountain
I will range throug the wild and the deep glen sae dreary
And return wi' my spoils to the bower of my deary

If my true love she were gone I'd surely find another
Where the wild mountain thyme grows around the bloomin' heather
Oh the summer time is comin' and the trees are sweetly bloomin'
And the wild mountain thyme grows around the bloomin' heather

John McDuffy,"We meet, and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

You smile, and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss, and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart.",And the Angels Sing,2005
John McDuffy,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,2005
John McDuffy,"I was born in a bunk
Mama died and my daddy got drunk
Left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road

I grew up in a dusty shack
And all I had was a'hangin' on my back
Only you know how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road

But it's home
The only life I've ever known
Only you know how I loathe
Tobacco Road

I'm gonna leave and get a job
With the help and the grace from above
Save some money, get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco Road

Bring dynamite and a crane
Blow it up, start all over again
Build a town, be proud to show
Give the name Tobacco Road

Cause it's home
The only life I've ever known
I despise you ''cause your filthy
But I love ya, 'cause it's home",Tobacco Road,2005
John McEuen,"I knew a man Bojangles
And he danced for you
In worn out shoes
With silver hair, a ragged shirt
And baggy pants, the old soft shoe
He jumped so high, he jumped so high
Then he lightly touched down

I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked at me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg a step

He said his name, Bojangles
And he danced a lick across the cell
He grabbed his pants
In fettered stance
Oh, he jumped up high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!

He danced for those
At minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years
How his dog and him traveled about
His dog up and died, he up and died
After 20 years he still grieves

He said I dance now
At every chance in honky tonks
For drink and tips
But most of the time
I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit

He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him
Please, please

John McEuen,"I am a pilgrim and a stranger
Traveling through this wearisome land
And I've got a home in that yonder city, good Lord
And it's not (good Lordy it's not) not made by hand

I got a mother, a sister and a brother
Who have gone to that sweet home
And I am determined to go and see them, good Lord
Over on (good Lordy over on) that distant shore

As I go down to that river Jordan
Just to bathe my weary soul
If I could touch but just the hem of His garment, good Lord
I believe (good Lordy I believe) that it would make me whole

I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.

Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.

Till the day you found me, there among them was I.

We will make changes as any family will.

I'll teach you how to shoot a gun
You may find it lots of fun

Tuesday there's no matinee

You can come around and play

Send your mothers on Wednesday
Because Wednesday's old hens' day
But Thursday is sublime
I'll have lots of open time

Friday night will be the test
If Saturday you're still my guest
Sunday you can come and rest
With a bad, bad man

I'm enlightened but frightened
Tho' my interest you've heightened
It might turn out to be
That you're much too much for me

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

And flowers to raise.
There are amateur dramatics

And I go to civic luncheons
When there's someone to remind me
And I study the piano
And I never look behind me.

It's a merry little kingdom
Full of merry little chores.
Lots of gardening and fixing,
All very outdoors.
In the driveway is a sports car
I shouldn't have bought.

And if on occasion I think about you
I eliminate the thought.

So I read a little here
And I sew a little there
And the children disappear
And the castle needs repair
And I never shed a tear
And I never turn a hair
And then!
It's a pleasant little kingdom
Full of pleasant little things,
Full of scintillating dinners
With neighbouring kings.
There's a castle in the country
For weekends of rest
And we entertain at parties
In the little time remaining
And we're entertained by others
And it's very entertaining.

An efficient little kingdom,
The dominion of the Queen,
Where at any given moment
The ashtrays are clean.
There are many little battles
Which never are fought.

And if on occasion I think about you,

And I head another drive

You would think we were alive.

I keep telling myself I'm the bravest individual I have ever met
Funny, but suddenly I can't swallow I think I'm going to die
Sometimes, if you pardon the word, I sweat!

Then you say to yourself
I'm the bravest individual I have ever met

Good, Your game makes very good sense
I get results, isn't that fine?

Got back my confidence and then
Even pulse a hundred and nine

You fail at whatever you try

And keep telling yourself I'm the strongest, soundest stoica
Daringest man, who's most heroical

The more you'll be wandering blind

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1955

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it

Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

And the last time we spoke you said
You were afraid of my touch
And then you went your way
I stumbled down a highway; I went mine
You know, I think it's funny the
Way infatuation gets beat up by the time

[Chorus]

Well, I see your life has evolved
Into one big masquerade
And all of those old fools you used to run to
They shot you full of old age
Well, don't go expecting too much, no, no
From this new love affair
Probably fall flat on its face
No one to pick you up, no one who cares

[Chorus]",Do You Think That's Fair,1979
John Mellencamp,"Everything is slower here; everybody's got a union card
They get up on Sunday, go to church of their choice
Come back home, cook out in the backyard
And they call this the great midwest
Where the cornfields row and flow
They're all five years ahead of their time
Or twenty-five behind; I just don't know
All the young men talk about their four-wheel drives
And how much money they're gonna make on Friday night
And they like to brag about how they mistreat their girlfriends
Hey, let's get drunk, party it up, start a fight
And they call this the great midwest
Sure make a hell of a car
And the old hearts, they race their way though the night
The upheaval of who they really are
Growin' up under normal conditions, television and radio
That's just about all of this whole world
That any of us get to see, get to know
And they call this the great midwest
Where you sacrifice body and soul
And no one really wants to get even
Most of us find it hard enough just lettin' go
Don't get me wrong, I ain't complaining
I ain't braggin', nor do I mean to place blame
That's just the way things are around here
And there's a future carryin' my name on it
Sayin', hey man, you gonna stick around here?  You better get on it
If you're gonna stick around here
You better make yourself some real good friends
Well, I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth
So I can't talk about the big-city life
But if you want to talk about bein' bored and runnin' away from yourself
Hell, I talk to you all night
And they call this the great midwest
Where livin' is just gettin' by
And people trade in their happiness
For a smokestack, a big money deal in the sky",Great Mid-West,1979
John Mellencamp,"Well, west of Zion
They got a hot sport brewing
Handcuffs and kisses
For the people who live there

Hey, just a little, little, little night dancin'
Night, night, whoa, night dancin'
Hey, just a little, little, little night dancin'

They keep everything jumping

John Mellencamp,"God gave Moses a few little rules
And he said I want you to pass them around
Take a look at those old tools
I can't believe the shit that's going down
You're supposed to have a good time
But I think you take it a little too far
Watchin' your life in vista-vision
A monkey on your back, a brand new car

Well, Shakespeare threw down his pencil
Said, I think I'm gonna start layin' brick
Too much of this Romeo stuff enough to make
Anybody sick
""To be or not to be,"" I mean, what's that supposed to mean?
I'm changin' my image tomorrow
Be a groupie, make the scene

[Chorus]
Pray for me if you want to
If you don't want to, don't stay
Somebody shot the vicar, and the minister's on his way
Sellin' open legs on the corner
Punchin' Judy, workin' uptown
Pray for me if you want to
Before some fool shoots you down

The man in the cage is always for freedom
The way of the transgressor is hard
Cain, and Abel, and their old man
Playin' croquet in the back yard

Up beat on the back street
I don't really want to get involved
Won't someone help me to my feet?

John Mellencamp,"Well, I'm all gassed up
The car is waitin' outside
I got three more hours on this loser's job
And then I'll be ready to ride
I got this cowboy comin' with me
This guy's name is Jeffrey Jack
He can shoot the eyes out of a pool ball
He can get the young girls into the sack
We'll go down to the dance hall
Locals will be kickin' up their heels
They'll be drinkin' tequila sunrises
Until the morning light fills up the window sills

[Chorus]
And then I'll be with Sugar Marie
She's the only girl I know that can make me forget about me
Come on and dance with me, Sugar Marie
She don't ask me any questions when it's time to leave
She works down at the truck stop
Where she polishes the spoons
She gets colas and burgers for the boys
On those hot summer afternoons
She's got this girlfriend named Linda
Linda's got a tattoo that says Christ
Well, she ain't half bad to talk to
And I reckon she looks pretty nice
We'll drive down to the dance hall
Sittin' there, waitin' on me
Jesus, you know it feels pretty good
And sometimes I need some good ol' company

[Chorus]

She don't ask any questions
And she don't flirt with the other boys
She belongs to me: Sugar Marie

I never thought I needed no one
I can make a big enough mess myself
Oh, but when I finally found someone
She made me respect myself

Out of this old town tonight",Sugar Marie,1979
John Mellencamp,"In the cool of the evening
I don't know the reason
But I long to touch
Some young tender hearts sometimes
So I go to this party
With a bunch of me hardies
They say don't get too cute
Don't get too smart
'Cause these people are crazy
They toot coke and drink wang-foo
And they talk in some crazy tongue

There's a slit-eyed lady
Sayin', don't you be so stupid
I may look old, but I'm still good fun
Still good fun
Yeah, I'm still good fun

Well, I ain't that choosy
I'll flip-flop with a floozy
If I figure there's no strings attached
But sometimes I lose my feet
Underneath the back seat
And I have to fly my heart at half mast

Well, this old bitty
She was smart and she was witty
She was really out of control, you know
It was stumble or fall
I had my back to the wall
I didn't know whether to bet or win, place or show

[Chorus:]
Welcome to Chinatown, she said
I'm gonna lay your body down, she said
I ain't no queen, but I'm wearin' this crown
She said,
Welcome to Chinatown
Welcome to Chinatown

Well, she shimmered and she shook
What she wanted, she took
She shook like some rickshaw ride
She stuck her fingers down my throat
'Til I almost choked
I thought I'd gone to heaven and died

Well, she took me by the ear
And said, what do you want to hear, boy
You want to hear those crazy old lies
I said nothing you can say girl
Can drive me away
Just check my complexion
Make sure I'm still alive

You tell me that you love me, but
This ain't no way for you to live
You hold so tight your fingers are broken
I take more than I care to give
But it's heartbeat to heartbeat
It's push, and shove, and steal, and prove
It's hand to mouth sometimes
If we run hard enough someday, baby
Gonna find some room to move

All of this showin' and provin'

Make me feel like I want to feel

Maybe it's a change of plan
Now that your dreams have left me behind
Or is it another man

Baby, this could be our last chance
Now you're actin' like it's no big deal

John Mellencamp,"I was watching a movie the other night on T.V.
The actress reminded me of you
Her attitude, the way that she smiled
She was doin' a part, girl, like you used to do
I do believe you played it better
If it wasn't better, it was just as strong
I would've called you up on the telephone that night
But somehow, girl, it'd been all wrong

I heard you married a stranger
In a horse and carriage that was covered with gold
Well, you wanted to be different and still fit in
I wonder if you feel different at all now that you're older
Hope you didn't lose that innocent laughter
Oh God, I hope time didn't take that away
All those junior high nights underneath the front porch light
A good Catholic girl during the day

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, just watching the time grow
Old enough to know that these memories can't hurt a thing
Oh, oh, just watching the time grow
If I saw you today, girl, I wouldn't even know ya

Well, I know it wasn't that big of a love affair
But, boy, it sure seemed like one back then
When I parlay the memories into their proper places
I can see, now, we were no more than friends
Oh, your kisses sure tasted sweet
But I guess any kiss tastes sweet at fifteen
I just hope your touch is as warm to your ol' man
As it seemed like it was to me

But the day still slowly slips on by
And when that five o'clock whistle starts to blow
I'll be gone in a wink of an eye

Tonight, I'm gonna see my baby again
And that long-haired girl will be smiling
When she sees me walkin' in
Well, alright, she looks so good
That she just has to be a sin
Tonight, I'm gonna see my baby again

We'll walk over to the East Street Montgomery Pier
She says she likes holding something dangerous
She pulls me close and whispers in my ear

And you're the boy that makes me feel like I'm alive""

You hope it disappears by tomorrow

They wish that somewhere they can find a spark
Well, their sights, and visions, and dreams are set high
They think the world can be won with a smile
I hear 'em giggle out loud, lost in the crowd
Give me a cuddle when we get outside

I'm glad to see everything's alright with you
Alright, then hold me tight; kiss me

This time I think I'm really in love

And let that tape deck blow
And look at the honey I was holding that night
I'd say, ""Hey, girl, you're the one""
And then I'd laugh when I'd take her home
You got your arms around my shoulders
You got my soul confused with my heart
You were too smart to believe all those tired lines
And I was too dumb to know what had started

I hope you don't lose that innocent laughter
I hope time doesn't take that away

Sometimes life is too ridiculous to live
You count your friends all on one finger
I know it sounds crazy just the way that we live

Smile in the mirror as you walk by
Between a laugh and a tear

When this cardboard town can no longer amuse you
You see through everything and nothin' seems worthwhile
And hypocrite used to be such a big word to you
And it don't seem to mean anything to you now

Don't be discouraged by the future forget the past
That's old advise but it'll be good to you

That someday him and Justice and Nation would get together again
But Justice held up in a shotgun shack
And she wouldn't let nobody in
So a Nation cried

Oh oh
When a Nation cries
His tears fall down like missiles from the skies
Justice look into Independence's eyes
Can you make everything alright
Can you keep your Nation warm tonight

Well Nation grew up and got himself a reputation
Couldn't keep the boy at home no no
He just kept running 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Independence and Justice well they felt so ashamed
When the Nation fell down they argued who was to blame
Nation if you'll just come home we'll have this family again
Oh Nation don't cry

Oh oh

The angels are descending to wrap me up in red velveteen.

I don't control much of my home life.
I'm not an old man, but I'm not young anymore.
Haven't kept in contact with any of my good friends,
So I live with strangers and sleep on another man's floor.

Mansions in heaven; I see myself walking with the King.
The angels are descending to wrap me up in red velveteen.

As I pack my suitbag, 'cause soon I'll be leaving;
Going back to the Earth, which is where I come from.
Withstood the heartache,
Kept on believing;
It ain't winning or losing,
Just the singing of the song.

As I walk along the ocean shore.",Mansions in Heaven,1989
John Mellencamp,"Never give an inch - that's what I say, son.
When it's too tough for everybody else,
Hell, it's just right for me.
Now my lips are bleeding
From the selfish things that I've done,
And my heart: it lies at the bottom of the ocean.
Sometimes a great notion...

Wanted to make love to my girl
In the backseat of my car.
So, I took her to the drive-in picture show.
So, I filled her up with
Lies and a strong love potion,
And I'm sittin' here, watching the movie alone.
Sometimes a great notion...

Sometimes the best plans
Have been known to go astray.
So, you better put your seatbelt on.

John Mellencamp,"Henry worked at Sears or somehwhere.
Theo did, too.
They both got themselves a van together;
Nineteen seventy-two, Ford.
Drove around all night, long playing music very, very, loud.
Big noise all the time;
Little legends in a little town.

Moments of time they shared together.
Moments of time between two friends.
Standing on street corners with shirts unbuttoned.
There was a moment in time they swore they were friends to the end.

Couple of wild boys;
They told me they could hear the grass grow.
Theo used to say, hey Henry, man,
I'm screwin' this cat.
You're just holdin' it.
I never knew what they was talking about,
But they laughed like they both thought it was funny.
Theo and weird Henry went chasing after something,
And neither one of them believing in nothing.

Moments in time they shared together;
Called themselves the ""He-man women lovers club,""
Throwin' pop bottles against the wall just to get some attention.
There was a moment in time they swore they were friends until the end.

Theo's out there, living it up, doing a little Earth shaking, somewhere.
Henry sent a postcard from a better place,
But I can see them both sitting there laughing and breathing.
I can still see that smile on weird Henry's face.

I want, I want to live;
To see it all;

We both get hurt by what was said.

I can't seem to fill.
Been a parent, had three children,
And a big house on the hill.
Hundred dollar in my pocket,
And it didn't buy a thing.
Now there's a void in my heart
And a hole in my dreams.

Well, I poured miles of concrete
And strung wire for telephones,
Dug ditches when I was a young boy;
When I first left my parents' home.
Sang my songs for millions of people;
Sang good and bad news.
Now there's a void in my heart
And a fire at my fuse.

Well, I did everything just like they said
So I could find happiness.
Went to school and got a college degree,
And at my job I did my best.
As I sit here alone, tonight,
I see a billion just like me,
With a void in their hearts and running from eternity.

There's a void in my heart I can't seem to fill.
I do charity work when I believe in the cause,
But in my soul it bothers me still.
Hey, Lord, well, you made me like I am;
Can you heal this restlessness?
Will there be a void in my heart

With sad blue eyes, walking on eggshells so you don't see her frown.
Is this your family, Jackie Brown?

Dream of vacationing on a mountain stream
And giving the world more than it gave you.
What ugly truths freedom brings
And it hasn't been very kind to you.
Is this your life, Jackie Brown?

Is this your meal, Jackie Brown?
Barely enough, I've seen people throw more than this out.
Is this your home, Jackie Brown?
This three room shack
With no running water
And the bathroom out back.
Is this your grave, Jackie Brown?
This little piece of limestone that says another desperate man took
Himself out.
Is this your dream, Jackie Brown?

But who gives a damn about Jackie Brown?
Just another lazy man who couldn't take what was his.

And workin' from nine to five

By the end of the day, all the kids would go play
And I'd come staggering home
With a dream in my hand and a master plan
That wouldn't leave my mind alone

There goes that sleek young silhouette
He don't drive no Corvette
But he stings just like a Sting Ray
And that's my only redemption in this house of detention
That keeps me from simply blowin' it all away

And walked their floors
And I ain't gonna do it again

I'm not gettin' down on my knees
And beggin', please
Can you throw me a crumb now and then?

Wasn´t nothing we couldn´t do

She could burn a woman down
If she felt she´d been unkind
Or if she thought she was coming on to me
It drove her out of her mind

We just did what we did
Whenever we wanted to
Yeah, it´s true
We just did what we did
Whenever we wanted to

She was my very best friend
My biggest enemy
On judgement day we could go either way
It was all the same you see

She was not afraid of Satan
In fact she thought he was a joke
Said she´d tear off his tail
And run her fist down his throat

[Chorus:]

She was the apple of temptation
The apple of my eye
Used to rest on a bed of burning coats
Every single night

And I know she´s out there somewhere
She´s wrestling in the bones
With confetti in her hair
You can bet she´s not alone

Keep your mind straight ahead
Don't get no funny ideas about we
Or you'll wish you were dead
That's what I am thinking she must be thinking
The girl I spent fifty three bucks on last night
She give me a look from the corner of her eye
That says, ""Boy, keep acting right""
How surprised was I 
When she leaned over and whispered in my ear
 
Get a leg up
Get a leg over boy
Get a leg up
What's the matter
Are you shy, shy, shy?

To see what she had in mind

And my best girlfriend lives down the road
Together we will thrill ya
And I'm thinking to myself
I could be lucky Pierre tonight

If I could get a leg over boy
You know I ain't that handsome
But you know I ain't shy, shy, shy

Don't go making hasty judgements
Because sometimes they could be wrong
Nothing wrong with a good time
Just keep yourself protected make a list
And you can bet your life that the women don´t know
The little girls are acting like this
So the next time a young one moves up

Started workin, when he was 21
Got fed up and quit
When he was forty three
He said, ""My whole life
I´ve done, what I supposed to do
Now I´d like to maybe do something
For myself
And just as soon, I figure out what
That is
You can bet your live
I´m gonna give it hell""
He says...

I want to live the real life
I want to life my life close to the bone
Just because I´m middle-aged that
Don´t mean
I want to sit around my house and watch TV
I want the real life
I want to live the real life

I guess, it don´t matter, how old you are
Or how old one lives to be
I guess, it boils down to what we did
With our lives
And how we deal with our own
Destinies
But something happens
When you reach a certain age
Particularly to to those ones, that are
Young at heart
It´s a lonely proposition when you realize
That there´s less days in front of the horse
Than riding in the back of this cart
I say... 

I want to live the real life
I want to life my life close to the bone
Just because I´m middle-aged that
Don´t mean, I want to sit around my house and watch TV
I want the real life

Am I the only one that feels this way
I'd buy myself some stylish clothes
But I sure hate to pay

Gonna make these dreams come true

I'm gonna stop puttin' myself down
I'm gonna turn my life around

Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

Ahh you've gone to the finest schools, alright Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
A complete unknown, like a rolling stone

Ah you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discovered that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal  

How does it feel, how does it feel?
To have on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

Ahh princess on a steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking, thinking that they've got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you've got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel, ah how does it feel?
To be on your own, with no direction home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone",Like a Rolling Stone,1993

John Mellencamp,"Tony Jones stabbed Alice Jones
On their first anniversary
Down in Dallas, Texas
In a small apartment
With nobody present
He pulled out a knife
And he stuck it to her
He left her bleeding
On the floor in the kitchen
With cake on her fingers
And her wedding ring holding
In her hand was a note
That said the wicked must suffer
And he drove off quickly
To his girlfriend's apartment

That he was sad and mixed up
And he didn't know what he was doing
That he'd always loved Alice
And he begged for forgiveness
So he threw himself
On the mercy of the jury
And he told how his father
Had beat and abused him
Back in grade school
In the basement den
And that maybe prison
Was the best thing for him
And he said, ""Oh God, can you forgive me?"" yeah

Without any heels
Leather soles
Kind of a slip on deal

And take into its ancient depths

Unequal to the sweeping curve of life

Human wheels spin round and round
While the clock keeps the pace
Human wheels spin round and round

At this short success of age
This pale reflection of its brave and
Blundering deed

Now dreams beyond my earthly fault
Knowledge, sure, from the seed

While the clock keeps the pace
Human wheels spin round and round

And take into its dark embrace
This love, who in my beating heart endures
Assured, by every sun that burns
The dust to which this flesh shall return
It is the ancient, dreaming dust of God

Suzanne, how will you sleep at night

And she played on a steel guitar
And the drifters did come and they'd go
And she'd put on her crown
And she'd sing them a song
And some drifters would stay here the night
But they never did stay long

And throw your jewels and your crown on the floor

From the afternoons by the public swimming pool

In a big hotel down in Austin, Texas
She had cut her long hair off
And replaced it with
Blue eyes of sadness
Still acted like we were kids
And she told me that she had to marry
And she asked me if I did
Still remember

Ridiculous for me to see
When I think about the real gone stories
And how time holds the winning hand

And the young can't understand
That they look at me
When they look at themselves

On your front door some night?
Would you open the window
And drop me down the key?

On your bedpost that same night?
Would you open up your heart
Or try to get the best of me?

What if I came knocking
On your brain the next day
And ask for your truth and your love and your honesty?
Would you build up your big walls
And try to hide behind that smile
Or would you try to pull the wool right over me?

So what if I came knocking?
So what if I came knocking?
So what if I came kicking
And it scared you a little bit
And I came on strong
Would you think
That there's something wrong with me?
Or could it be your fears
Of trying something real
Or just afraid to touch
A guy like me?

What if I came knocking?
What if I came knocking?
What if I came knocking
On your front door some night? Ahh

So let's just say it worked out
Like a storybook dream
And we lived happily ever after
Fa la la la
But what if I came crying
After just a few weeks
And said I misread my heart
This is not really meant to be? yeah

So if you hear some knocking
On your window tonight
You can bet that it's probably me
But let it be known
That we're just a pair of tumbling dice
And the outcome of these crap shoots
Is hard to see

So what if I came knocking

Babe break me off a piece of your love
Once it's on I can't seem to get enough
So keep it up, keep it comin', uh what
Break me off some baby

You're wicked, baby so do what's right
Break me off a piece of that love tonight
Like a steel guitar that I love to play
Everyone loves Jesus on judgment day
You get hot just like gasoline
In your cashmere shirt and your cut-off jeans
I've been workin' all day, here's what I made
Baby what you say break me off some

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Down in Mexico there's a man I know
Who gave away his future for a piece of gold
He washed his hands in Noah's flood
Now those mountains they're just red as blood
I left this place just to come with you
Walkin' off the mesa in some dead man's shoes
I've been workin' all day, here's what I made
Baby what you say break me off some

John Mellencamp,"Hey, don't I know you from somewhere
Yeah, it was down in New Orleans
In one of those back-street bars in the quarter
Between Desire and Honalee
You were dancin' with a friend of Michael's
I remember how we met
You were talkin' to ol' Jimmy
And you lit my cigarette

[Chorus:]
How come you can't remember?
This is me you're talkin' to
From May through September
It was all about me 'n you, baby
It was all about me 'n you

Well it looks like to me
That you have conveniently forgotten everything
This confusion that has surrounded you
Is this your morality and not your brain
You've got a birthmark below your navel
You wear a size seven and a half shoe
You got this Rolex watch that I suspect you cobbed
From that doctor who said he loved you

[Chorus:]

Well you told me that you lived in the wind
Like a bird who never touched the ground
And if you did you would surely die without making a sound
""Live, let's live"", that's all you kept sayin'
And our summer was full of life
We're gonna send them a postcard, and show 'em what it's like to be alive
But I never wanted to leave your side
No, I just couldn't believe that you'd lie
No, I never wanted to say ""good-bye"" baby

These are the days of farewell
Halfway undecided that's our peace, that's our peace

Be careful the friends you keep
He might not really be your friend
He belongs to the wishing and the wandering
Be careful too much at stake
You don't want ever to be wronged
Don't you ever let the dirty business make you clean

[Chorus:]
Amen Amen

Glory be to God I will bless the Lord at all times
His words shall continually be in my mouth with praise
For I am here today 'cause He said that I would live
There's no reason why HIV shouldn't have missed my daughter and my life
But it did through the eyes of God, he saw fit for me to be here
I will praise the Lord at all times
As we live in the last days the Devil will always be up under my feet
And I will praise his name
Hallelujah

Don't you pretend to be something
That you are not hear me my friend
I'll tell you what I know it will only sicken you
Let us be grateful for what you've got
Help me to know what I am not
Of my friend there are people who are wondering

Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow
But farewell Angelina, the night is on fire, and I must go

There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream
But farewell Angelina, the sky's changing colors, and I must leave

Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild
Farewell Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while

See the cross-eyed pirate sit perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun
And the corporals and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast
But farewell Angelina, the sky is trembling, and I must leave fast

King Kong little elves in the rooftops they dance
Valentino-type tangos while the hero's clean hands
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone
Farewell Angelina, the sky is flooding over, and I must be gone

The camouflaged parrot, he flutters from fear
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears
What can not be imitated perfect must die
Farewell Angelina, the sky's flooding over, and I must go where it is dry

At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks

(somebody's killing somebody)
Gonna drown the man in the water (shout it out)
And the water was shiny like a new knife
But Poppi stopped at the banks of the delta
He said this sure ain't worth this man's life
Someday the wind of change
Is gonna blow on through
And put all of these jokers right
See man and sing now

[Chorus]

Papa got a brand new bag
Delta blues got 'em dazed and confused
Came a long way crazy
Seems the abuse
Is racism's baby
It's wild
'Cause I connect the word with pain
Now some smile when they scream the name?
Funny how the times have changed
And the rhymes have changed
But some cat's frame remains the same
Agitating adjective
What gives? Die ""n"" word die
But I want to live
Known' all this
Where the word came from
I must be three times stupid
And stuck on dumb
If I use it and confuse it
With a term of love
Now popular culture
Can't stop 'til it gets enough
Underlined in marketing campaigns
I feel undermined
Heard the ""n"" word promotes the bottom line
Down by the river there's a great divide
Let's ride

[repeat: x4]
Don't call me nigga cause you know I don't like it like that

Shout it out
Yeah shout it out

In the clear blue sky
Floating out on the ocean

Let me count the blessings

Let me say good luck to the people raising families
Let me say thank-you to the men who grow the bread

And that we all got someone to keep the stones from our bed

Looking for an angel but they ran out of time

Ain't a gonna need this body much more

Washed up and worn out for sure

Sick or dying
And I'm here all by myself
All I got left
Is a head full of memories
And a thought of my upcoming death

I'll die easy
And I know my life
Is not in vain
Because I loved
And I fought with many
And the people they loved me just the same

John Mellencamp,"I wish I could give you an answer
As to when life really begins
I wish I could tell you where we went
When our days here come to an end
Wish I could see the future
The same way I see the past
Wish I could draw a conclusion
Why nothing here seems to last

[Chorus]
I can't even make a guess
Or an uneducated thought
All I can do here is my best
And be thankful for what we've got

Why do so many suffer
Oppressed to the end of time
Why does freedom move so slowly
Unable to speak its mind
Some say it's a circle
Others think we live on the wing
Why are promises broken
And some think life don't mean a thing

[Chorus]

I hope you can be a child of life
With big dreams for everyone
And know that dyings as natural as birth
And our troubles here they don't last long
I have worried about many things
Most of which did not come to pass
Hope you find someone to give you love
And that your love will last

Six feet underground
Don't be calling no minister
I don't need one around

Well my grandma she told me
She'd be waiting at the gate
She said that the fix was in
And that she's already prayed
And the rest of my family
Will be waiting there for me too
They'd already taken care of my sins
And there's was nothing for me to do

Into the darkness of night

Get the best of my soul

Complaining about this life all the time
Surely something good here as the world spins by
Could you please stop being so mean

This will never work out that's what you say
It's the end of the world again yesterday
When I see you coming at me I'm gonna walk away
You need to stop being so mean

Your outlook is haunting us all
Like the ghost of our love down at the dark end of the hall
If you can't say nothing good then don't say nothing at all
And you need to stop being so mean

You're a big boat up the river blowing off steam
My head is spinning from your company

Down the same dirty road

The other man's belly full of unbearable pain

John Mellencamp,"Put your guns out on the table
Throw your bullets on the floor
This weary old house can't take it anymore
From the ovens in the kitchen
To the chains out in the dirt
Rope hanging in the bedroom
That's some of our dirty work

The distant sleeping shadows
That lie out in the yard
The wind that distorts the meanings
Of who we really are
Saluting of ourselves
As we pass by our mirrors
This show of phony adulation
Just masquerades all our fears

So we open up our eyes at midnight
See the setting of the sun
Foundation is crumbling
The inner structure's gone
Used up by corruption
And the passage of time
We hope we've got some fight left
Cause our children
Our children are dying

So we think that forgiveness
Is a God given right
And equality for all
Is just a waste of our time
With our nickel plated Jesus
Chained around are necks
Handing out verses of scripture
Like we wrote it down ourselves

Respect that we once had
Went up the water spout
Tried to keep it secret
But the secret was found out
Got to thinking high and mighty
Like everything was a lock
Some now say this house
Can be taken without a shot

So the hole gets dug deeper
With every wedding bell
And we sell each other down the road
Until there's nothing left to sell
And slowly but surely
We disappear without a trace
We point our fingers at each other
And say what the hell happened to this place
Without a shot
Without a shot

The actress reminded me of you
Her attitude, the way that she smiled
She was doin' a part girl, like you used to do

I do believe you played it better
If it wasn't better, it was just as strong
I would've called you up on the telephone that night
But somehow girl, it'd been all wrong

I heard you married a stranger
In a horse and carriage that was covered with gold
Well, you wanted to be different and still fit in
I wonder if you feel different at all now that you're older

Hope you didn't lose that innocent laughter
Oh, God I hope time didn't take that away
All those junior high nights underneath the front porch light
A good Catholic girl during the day

Old enough to know that these memories can't hurt a thing
Oh oh oh, just watching the time grow
If I saw you today, girl, I wouldn't even know ya

Well, I know it wasn't that big of a love affair
But boy, it sure seemed like one back then
When I parlay the memories into their proper places
I can see now, we were no more than friends

Ooh, your kisses sure tasted sweet
But I guess any kiss tastes sweet at fifteen
I just hope your touch is as warm to your ol' man
As it seemed like it was to me

John Mellencamp,"I knew this colorful woman once
She drank and had a roving eye
In the morning she was always mournful
She’d cry and apologize
But she’d always repeat herself
Find comfort with a stranger and sing
She never took much notice
In the courtesy of kings

She had pictures of Cuban artists
And paintings from Rotterdam
Promises that she made
She never could stay true to them
She said she loved me so deeply
Then she’d spit in my face and scream
And she never took much notice
In the courtesy of kings

She had the face of an angel
And a smile no one could deny
But the heart of a devil
Beat deep down in her inside
She spoke of judgment and forgiveness
Her other lovers didn't mean a thing
She never took much notice
In the courtesy of kings

We parted in the middle of nowhere
I haven’t seen her since then
She always kept my mind busy
She made her lies seem like a hymn
Sometimes I wonder if I’d see her
If I would still recognize
Or just remember her as a dream
And respect her for the love she used to bring
If I could show her

And I still breath you in my lungs
And I wish I could stop breaking down

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could love you out loud
But I'll just keep it to myself
Wish I could hear how it sounds
To be with you and no one else

Don't make a sound
Don't tell a soul

It's 7:00am and I just want to call you
And tell you I'm falling in love
But, there's somebody else inside these four walls
If she smells you on my skin
I can't let her know where I've been
I wish I could be with you now

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could love you out loud
But I'll just keep it to myself
Wish I could hear how it sounds
To be with you and no one else
Wish I could love you out loud
Because I'm under your spell
Wish I could tell the whole world
But I'll just keep it to myself

Don't make a sound
Don't tell a soul
Don't tell them anything
And I won't let you go

Don't say a word
Don't tell a soul
And I shiver at the thought of you
I can't believe that you love me too
And we quiver when we touch
I can't believe I love you so much
And I hate it when you walk away
I know we can't go on this way
But there's magic when we touch
I can't believe I love you so much

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could hear how it sounds
Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could hear how it sounds
Wish I could love you out loud
But I'll just keep it to myself
Wish I could hear how it sounds
To be with you and no one else
Wish I could love you out loud
Because I'm under your spell
Wish I could tell the whole world
But I'll just keep it to myself

Don't make a sound
Don't tell a soul
Don't tell them anything
And I won't let you go

Wish I could love you out loud
But I'll just keep it to myself
Wish I could hear how it sounds
To be with you and no one else
Wish I could love you out loud
Because I'm under your spell
Wish I could tell the whole world
But I'll just keep it to myself

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could hear how it sounds
Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could hear how it sounds
Wish I could love you out loud",Love You out Loud,2003
John Miceli,"Listen
I was born on the other side
Just always looking to you
I made it over the great divide
Now I'm coming for you

Your forces lined up in battle
Your soldiers and your machines
The sun been blacked out by shadows
The darkest hour now you've ever seen

And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

I rose up on the doctor's slab
Like Lazarus from the pit
And everyone wants to take a stab
Decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit

I've been held up on money
I've been beaten out of spite
You want a piece of me honey?
Lose or win

You know you've been in a fight
And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

On March 6th, 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell
To the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the
War. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana,
Then from New York to Chicago. And when it
Joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state.
Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew
Into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings
Big songs and has big hits. You can try and
Tear him down.

Now there ain't much difference
Between a bridge and a wall
Without me right in the middle baby
You'll be nothing at all

And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down
  
And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

Try and tear me down",Tear Me Down,2003
John Michael King,"Every duke and earl and peer is here
Everyone who should be here is here
What a smashing, positively dashing spectacle
The ascot opening day

At the gate are all the horses
Waiting for the cue to fly away
What a gripping, absolutely ripping
Moment at the ascot opening day

Pulses rushing, faces flushing
Heartbeats speed up, I have never been so keyed up
And second now they'll begin to run,
Hark a bell is ringing, they are springing forward look, it has begun

What a frenzied moment that was
Didn't they maintain an exhausting pace?
'Twas a thrilling, absolutely chilling
Running of the ascot opening race

John Michael King,"When she mentioned how her aunt
Bit off the spoon, she completely done me in
And my heart went on a journey to the moon
When she told about her father and the gin
And I never saw a more enchanting farce
Than the moment when she shouted, ""Move your bloomin'""

I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No it's just on the street where you live

And oh the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care
If I can be here on the street where you live

",On the Street Where You Live [From My Fair Lady],1992
