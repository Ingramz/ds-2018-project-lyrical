Ginny O'Connor,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart",It Happened in Monterey,2007
Ginny O'Connor,"Don't need no palace paved with gold
Don't need more cash than banks can hold
When I get to feelin' a feelin'
For something there ain't too much of
My sweet lil' darlin' gives me her love
 
Don't catch me chasin' round at night
I'm not impressed by glamor sights
Lil' darlin' may not be as pretty 
As some other gals you can see
But my lil' darlin' only loves me",Li'l Darlin',2007
Ginny O'Connor,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin' that he's so willin' 
To make whoopee

Picture a little love nest 
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest 
Think what a year can bring

He's washin dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks,
Thats what you get folks, for makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Five thousand dollars per;
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You pay six to her.""

He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge, right into jail.
You'd better keep her
I think it's cheaper
Than making whoopee.""",Makin' Whoopee,2007
Ginny O'Connor,"We want to multiply, are you gonna do it
I know you're qualified, are you gonna do it
Don't be so circumscribed, are you gonna do it
Just get yourself untied, are you gonna do it

Feel the heat pushing you to decide
Feel the heat burning you up, ready or not

Some like it hot and some sweat when the heat is on
Some feel the heat and decide that they can't go on
Some like it hot, but you can't tell how hot 'til you try
Some like it hot, so let's turn up the heat 'til we fry

The girl is at your side, are you gonna do it
She wants to be your bride, are you gonna do it
She wants to multiply, are you gonna do it
I know you won't be satisfied until you do it

Some like it hot and some sweat when the heat is on
Some feel the heat and decide that they can't go on

Ginny O'Connor,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love,2007
Ginny Owens,"This road is winding, narrow and steep
And I can't keep walking with frozen feet,
My spirit is not willing;
My heart is cold as ice;
Thaw out my convictions;
The passion's left my life

[Chorus]
I don't want to be a flame
I want to be a raging fire!
Tired of my will, my way,
Your calling's higher
Oh, I know it's time I stopped running from the Truth
So I'll stand here still, until I'm filled
I want to be moved
I want to be moved by You

Want to be a rebel with a Holy cause,
Stand against the Devil and hold up my cross,
You have a mission for me; a reason why I'm here,
To radiate Your glory, with sweet songs to Your ears",I Wanna Be Moved,1999
Ginny Owens,"The pathway is broken
And The signs are unclear
And I don't know the reason why You brought me here
But just because You love me the way that You do
I'm gonna walk through the valley
If You want me to

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not who I was
When I took my first step
And I'm clinging to the promise You're not through with me yet
so if all of these trials bring me closer to you
Then I will go through the fire
If You want me to

It may not be the way I would have chosen
When you lead me through a world that's not my home
But You never said it would be easy
You only said I'd never go alone

So When the whole world turns against me
And I'm all by myself
And I can't hear You answer my cries for help
I'll remember the suffering Your love put You through
And I will go through the valley
If You want me to",If You Want Me To,1999
Ginny Owens,"Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.

When I feel afraid Think I've lost my way, 
Still you're there right beside me.
Nothing will i fear as long as you are near, 
Please be near me to the end.

Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.

I will not forget your love for me and yet, 
My heart forever is wandering.
Jesus be my guide and hold me to your side, 
and I will love you to the end.

Nothing will i fear as long as you are near, 
Please be near me to the end.

O lord of my heart;
Nought be all else to me
Save that thou art

Thou my best thought
By day or by night,
Waking or sleeping
Thy presence my light

Riches I heed not
Nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance
Now and always

Thou and thou
Only first in my heart
High king of heaven,
My treasure thou art",Be Thou My Vision,1999
Ginny Owens,"Turnin' molehills into mountains,
Makin' big deals out of small ones,
Bearing gifts as if they're burdens,
This is how it's been.
Afraid of coming out of my shell,
Too many things I can't do too well,
Afraid I'll try real hard, and I'll fail
This is how it's been.
Till the day You pounded on my heart's door,
And You shouted joyfully,
""You're not a slave anymore!""

""You're free to dance-
Forget about your two left feet
And you're free to sing-even joyful noise is music to Me
You're free to love,
'Cause I've given you My love(repepte after bridge),
And it's made you free
After Bridge(I have set you free!"")
 
My mind finds hard to believe
That You became humanity and changed the course of history,
Because You loved me so.
And my heart cannot understand
Why You'd accept me as I am,
But You say You've always had a plan,
And that's all I need to know.
So when I am consumed by what the world will say,
It's Then You're singing to me, as You remove my chains-
 
Free from worry, free from envy and denial
Free to live, free to give, free to smile",Free,1999
Ginny Owens,"I could travel over oceans, cross the deserts, climb the mountains
Just to share your story, bring you glory, and win souls for you.
I could sing like an angel, songs so humble and so thankful
Full of drama and emotion, so the world would know your truth.
I could give away my money and my clothes and my food
To restore those people who are poor, lost, and down-and-out.
Oh, I could succeed at all these things,
Find favor with peasants and kings,
But if I do not love, I am nothing.

I could live a flawless life,
Never cheat or steal or lie,
And always speak so kindly, smile warmly, and go about doing good.
I could dedicate myself to do what everyone else wants me to-
Listen to them, compliment them, say the things I should.
I could show up every Sunday, lead the choir and bible study
And they all might come to know me as a leader and a friend.
Oh, I could achieve success on earth, but success cannot define my worth
And all these actions, all these words, will not matter in the end-

Songs will fade to silence,
Stories, they will cease.
The dust will settle, covering all my selfless deeds.
So as I strive to serve you,
Won't you make it clear to me,
If I do not love, I am nothing.

If I cannot live my life loving my brother,
Then how can I love the one who lived his life for me?

Sent to earth from heaven,
Humble servant, holy king,
Come to share a story, get no glory, and save my searching soul,
You knew that I'd deny you, crucify you, but nothing could stop you from
Living for me, dying for me, so that I would know-

Songs will fade to silence,
Stories will cease,
The dust will settle covering these selfless deeds.
But your life here has made it clear enough for me to see
That if I do not love, I am nothing",I Am Nothing,1999
Ginny Owens,"There's a young Mother with three children
Got a stable income and a faithful husband, too.
She's searchin' for her life's meanin',
So she says to her shrink, ""I'm leavin' home soon!""
Just decided that she couldn't take it anymore,
Didn't look back, she just snuck out the back door-

[Chorus:]
What is wrong with this picture?
We applaud this behavior
Admire how she breaks away-
Oh, it's so clearly cloudy, in the land of the grey.

There's a young Senator,
Gifted politician,
So consumed by pursuing his career.
Use to care about what the people wanted,
But now he's learned how to say what they want to hear.
A million lies and scandals bear his name,
But you'll never see him hide his face in shame-

[Chorus:]
What is wrong with this picture?
We applaud this behavior
He's a hero if he makes mistakes-
Oh, it's so clearly cloudy in the land of the grey.

What's wrong? What's right? Absolute confusion.
What's black? What's white? Everything looks hazy.
Such scenarios bring me to only one conclusion-
Maybe we've all gone crazy.

Three little kids are prayin' Mama comes home,
And a little town feels violated and betrayed.
Meanwhile, two very unhappy people
Try to excuse the messes that they've made.
But you'll never hear it stated quite that way,
We can't handle it here in the land of the grey.",Land of the Grey,1999
Ginny Owens,"Got a stack of books 
So I could learn how to live 
Many are left half read, 
Covered by the cobwebs 
On my shelf 
And I got a list of laws 
Growing longer everyday 
And if I keep plugin away 
Maybe one day 
I will perfect myself 
Oh but all of my labor 
Seems to be in vain 
And all of my laws 
Just cause me more pain 
So I fall before you 
With all of my shame 
Ready and willing to be changed 

Own me 
Take all that I am 
And heal me 
With the blood of the lamb 
Mold me 
With your gracious hand 
Break me until I'm only yours

Oh you call me daughter 
And you take my blame 
And you run to meet me 
When I cry out your name 
So I fall before you 
In all of my shame

Feet wondering empty streets
Voice crying out loud
Heart aching with every beat

Ginny Owens,"How many days, Lord, have I walked in this wilderness?
A thirsty pilgrim with no water to drink.
And this barren place is making me crazy,
But as I wander on, I am forced to think.
Seems like I have spent so much time searchin'
In a dry and weary land where there's no Truth.
But I think I'm finally realizin',
That my only hope of water is the well that comes from You, So-

Rain down Your love upon me
Pour out Your mercy on me
Please won't You take me to Your springs of life
'Cause I'm dying for deliverance, only You can save me,
I'm waitin', won't You take me,
To Your springs of life.

Oh God, You are my God,
And my spirit seeks You,
But my flesh has failed You time and time again.
And now I've chosen this desert when Your love was waitin',
But Your stubborn child longs to understand-

Ginny Owens,"He could have prospered in the suburbs
Instead of working for the poor
Down at the inner-city mission
Where there's so much disappointment and very few rewards.
For every victory there's a failure
On these harsh and empty streets
But if you ask what keeps him going
He'll say, ""I know where I'd be if Christ had given up on me-""
Chorus:
Beneath the symbol of a lost cause
Is where I take my stand.
Beneath the emblem of a Roman cross
of a Sacrificial Lamb.
Cause love never claims the victory
Till it finally gives it's all.
And that's why the grave is empty
Beneath the symbol of a lost cause.
I've been a slave to popular opinions,
And I've memorized the Gospel of success,
I've had a taste of the politics of power
And the glamour that commands the world's respect.
But when my eyes are turned to Jesus,
Nailed on a Cross to die for me,
I hear a cock crow in the distance
And it shatters my illusions and drives me to my knees-

Where the humble are honored and the hungry come to feast-",Symbol of a Lost Cause,1999
Ginny Owens,"You find this situation just a bit uncomfortable;
You'd rather stay far away from reality.
For you to understand would be clearly impossible;
So you shut your eyes and swear you can see.
Claiming there is a God, but does that mean anything?
So condescending to those that you don't understand;
Just too easy to make them your enemies.
Like an ostrich, you bury your head in the sand,
And then shout about all the things you believe.
But if there is a God, don't you think He can see
What you really mean? What you're doing?

[Chorus:]
You can't find the answers
Till you learn to question;
You won't appear stupid
Just ask for direction.
You're insecure and it clouds your perception
So stop and listen
And learn a lesson in love without condition.
So place all the souls that you know
in their own little box;
Quite convenient to handle them that way;
You're the only one you know who carries a cross
You don't care what they care about anyway.
And You talk to your God,
Prayin' for those who sin,
For their eyes to be opened.

[Chorus:]

You can't find the answers

Let Your words be mine

Said he came for the sick and sightless
He said that was you and me

Spending everyday on the defense
And building walls no one could ever climb

He granted me my freedom

Ginny Owens,"One day I decided I'd aspire to higher ambition
So I set out on a mission to change the world
Armed and dangerous with my well meant words and best intentions
I went sharing my convictions with every livin' soul
But it wasn't long 'til the lightning flashed
The storms of disenchantment crashed
And my ambitions were scattered by winds of doubt
And it wasn't long 'til I learned ot see
Life wouldn't always be easy for me
So I wrote a little song to remind myself",Prelude,2002
Ginny Owens,"I used to see the world in black and white
Now I find myself lost in a fog of gray
I thought the good guys always won the fight
But I've learned life simply doesn't work that way

But I've seen that isn't always so
I thought the inner-peace would come from trusting who I am
But it's really about trusting who I know

So when the winds of change try to blow me over
And the shadows of confusion hide the truth
I will hope in the One who is forever
I will run to You
I will run to You

Ever since the moment life began 
Humankind has tried to solve its mysteries
So many things we cannot comprehend
So we draw conclusions that we can believe
Well, I know that Your hands have placed the earth upon the seas
And pitched a tent in the Heavens for the sun
The author of the universe is the father who loves me
So, only one conclusion can be drawn...

When I face the questions that seem to have no answers
And I know my friends are but a precious few
I will hope in the love that never changes
I will run to You

Though the perils of life seem so great
And hope seems so frail
You never fail, no
Shadows may not disappear
But You've always made it clear
Truth will prevail
You will prevail

Why do I choose to second-guess you?

To hear what you say and live every day
Like you asked me to
I just want to simply love you
Many times you spoke of us as children
Childhood seems to me so long ago
You say I can trust you like I did then
If I give you my hand then you'll lead me home

Oh...to fall on my knees
With the fresh disbelief
Stirred once again a the story
of how you loved me

[Chorus]",Simply Love You,2002
Ginny Owens,"I've spent half my lifetime watching time go by
And wondering where it went
When I try to fall asleep at night
I lay there feeling spent

Contemplating what the next day's gonna hold for me
Tossin' turnin', my mind is churnin'
Thought won't let me be

Every morning meets me with a list of all I have to do
Every evening greets me with the knowledge that I'm never through
Every taste of success makes me vow to never fail
Feels like I just chase my tail

Chorus: 
There's gotta be something more than running circles for a living
Gotta be something better than just trying to survive
Gotta be some important puzzle piece that I am missing
Gotta be something more to life.

If every picture tells a story, Mine must be a mystery
'Cause I lose sight of who I am and who I am 
And who I'm supposed to be
Looking back on what I've built
And all that I've achieved
Only leads me to believe

Tired of these hopeless places
Bored with my earthly things
So I must fill my empty spaces
With the love that heaven brings",Something More,2002
Ginny Owens,"A million miles away from anything familiar
A thousand places I would rather be
So I choke back the tears and try to find the bright side
Though I find it hard to see beyond my suffering
In my heart I know your plan is so much bigger
But this small part is all that I can see
And I believe you haven't left me here to wander
Still I can't help but ponder where you're leading me

(Chorus)
And I ask why this road
Why this way
And this load
Tell me how far must I go 
Till I see
Till I know 
Why this road
A million miles away from anything familiar
What was it like to be so far from home
Though you came in love
The world misunderstood you
There must have been some days when you felt so alone
But you endured, cause there was joy before you 
Joy that came because you sacrificed
Since you gave yourself just to spend forever with me
Surely I can trust you'll lead me through my darkest times
When I ask why....(Chorus)
From here I can not see
Why you'd choose this path for me
But I don't have to understand to believe
That you know why
You know why this road
Why this way 
And this load
You know how far I must go 
Till I see

All that really matters is

And hear them calling to me-

It's very clear, I must move on,
And sing a new song,
It will define who I become,

So show me how to sing along
To this new song-

To find the source of my strength,

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

A little bit of freedom, all we're left

And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know

A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here

Gino Marinello,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,1998

Questa stanza non ha più pareti
Ma alberi,
Alberi infiniti
Quando sei qui vicino a me
Questo soffitto viola
No, non esiste più.
Io vedo il cielo sopra noi

Che restiamo qui, abbandonati
Come se non ci fosse più
Niente, più niente al mondo.

Che vibra per te e per me
Su nell'immensità del cielo.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2007

To see laughter in the eyes where tears used 
To be

I'd calm this dawn
But the storm is me insensible and free
Now that you know I've come here to go
You're suddenly sad you've been mine

You're suddenly glad I'll be gone

Gino Vannelli,"Where am I going
Have I gone to far
Have I lost my mind
Where are my eyes
Oh have I seen to much
Have I lost my touch
Losing directions from growing infections
Poisoned desires of reaping life so young

What will I be like
When my head is bear
And my legs are weak
Will I be strong or barely keep alive
When I'm thirty-five
Reaching dimentions that shatter conventions
Leads me to fear that I'm growing old too soon

With every step and every breath
It's farther from youth and closer to death
And that things I've realized
Now beckon me to shut my eyes
And I will grow to the age of maybe eighty years
In such little time
With this venturous mind

What am I saying
Don't I know myself from experience
I'll never change
Nor cease to sail the sky
Till the day I die
I'll come to conclusion with fear or illusion
I'll live how I feel
Cause no matter how fast or how slow
Youth will go

Gino Vannelli,"If I came back just a cripple from the war
Would you hold me close just like you did before?
And what in the world would you do
If I could not make love to you?

The question is not whether the freedom we've got
Is worth the consequence of war
The question is just, can I hold you at dusk
Without you asking me for more?

A post-war eunuch
A lover that is lame
Some famous hero, and one shares his name
But where in the world would I go?
You're all that I love and all I know

The question is plain
Could our love still remain
Without its carnal ecstasy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If I lose all of you and half of me?

We can't be that asinine to think that nineteen sixty nine was the way it should be
There's a new moon with an old shine
So it's time to open your heart as wide as you see
Sing a new song of mobility
Get a new fix for seventy six
And now whether our hair's short or long
The issue is not really if it's right or wrong
But as long as it's clean .... right
I've gotta realize that our new found philosophies
Were only synthesized in the delusion of a flower child scene
There's a new star in an old space
So it's time you open your soul and set yourself free
Sing a new song of totality
Get a new fix for seventy six
So we thought we were cool and free
But then our heros blew their minds
With X and why's and LSD oh what a sin
Friend we gotta comprehend and we gotta learn from the past
And not dwell in it again and again and again

 Would you pledge you allegiance if death be the fate you may find

Wondering what dark secrets you keep
Away from me

From a memory
I feel my way through darkness

I can see better
I dream that we share our lives

Something tells me to believe in you

I feel you near but you're not there
And I feel quiet despair
Of what I might do
I hear a voice inside of me
That cries through the uncertainty
That I feel for you
There are no answers
But I'll take my chances

And talk about the future
Throw your weapons to the ground

No I can't believe this is the way

I wanna run to the highest mountain
I wanna stand in the light of the sun
I wanna ask all this world to forgive the man that I've become
And now I call on the angels above
Won't somebody hear won't somebody hear

Got a shoe box full of letters
Got a ring that I should pawn
There's a picture on the table of the way we were
I wish to God I could forget
But I still think of her I think of her

I wanna run to the highest mountain
I wanna stand in the light of the sun
I wanna ask all this world to forgive the man that I've become
And now I call on the angels above

I couldn't bear to face
One more day
If I should lose this love
I couldn't stand the pain
I can do without better things in life and still get by

I might just lay down & die

I staggered on the edge of hell
Stealing coins from wishing wells
And if the world went up in flames
What did I care
But when I look into your eyes
You know I suddenly realize
For the first time in my life baby I'm scared

About the tears that I cry

I can learn to forget if only I try

Watch the silly minstral with his empty arms spread
His life hanging by a thread

Can't you see through his disguise

Watch him juggle on one foot
Maybe a riddle for a damsel in distress
He's just a clown in a court of thieves
Who conspire for a kiss
It's off with his head dare he show his loneliness

Watch the little funny man walk on his hands
See the little princess laugh as hard as she can
Her every wish is his command

It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts

But that don't worry me none in my eyes, you're everything

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band

Gino Vannelli,"The coolness of your kiss
The lingering of your sigh
Your sweet yet unconvincing smile
Tell me no lie
Is it a wish for second youth
The age of lost romance
Or does a half-forgotten dream need one more chance
It's your life, what can I say
Right or wrong, either way
You owe it to yourslf to have your day

Well I must admit I'm crushed
Bewildered and betrayed
Still I won't hold you to the promises we made
Ah, love is such a mess
It's a painful work of art
Seems it's every man for himself to find his heart
So say goodbye and say no more
See what lies outside that door
You owe it to yourself to know for sure

No tears, no lies, no long goodbyes don't be cruel, baby
Just let me wish you well

A pointless twist of fate
The sun will rise the sun will set
All for it's own resplendent sake

But fools like you get mist eyed
As you walk along the strand
You claim your eyes can see eternity
In a single grain of sand

Seeking Heaven in the ruins waisting away
Believing life is but a dream
That's why the world kills you constantly
Constantine

Don't speak to me of love or tenderness
Your notions of romance
The moon will wax the moon will wane
And there are those who would fall into a trance

See the stars in your hallowed sky
A million poets strong
Not a bleeding word is ever heard
And the stars keep shining on

Yet there you sigh all mystified staring at a rose
As if your eyes have really seen
That's why the world kills you constantly
Constantine

Sooner or later
You'll choose to be smart
You'll see the world for what it is
And not some sacred work of art

Ginuwine,"Baby, I've got many problems
But my momma won't help me solve them
So I come to you (you you)
But your ass don't wanna be bothered
So I come around don't wanna be bothered
So I come around trying to be down
But you're acting like a silly clown
Ask me for $50
Said to myself
Well I'll be damned
Why are you trying to give me such a very very hard time
When I spend the money on you
You can't get a little of the bump and grind
There must be another man (man), holding your hand (hand)
Please tell me
Baby, baby
I will

I'm trying to go on without you here in my life
I don't wanna accept the fact that your no longer mine
Just to know there's somebody else who's holding and kissing you
It makes a guy like me feel like I'm a fool

So girl, I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done
I'm sorry for all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes, I am
I'm sorry for all the things I did, I'm sorry, yes, I am

I'm trying to cope with these emotions everyday (day)
I realize it's too late now you're gone away
Is there something that I can do to reassure
That I won't hurt you like this anymore

So I'll do anything
Anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done (tell me one thing I have to do)
I'm sorry for all the things I did I'm sorry, yes, I am

So I'll do anything, anything you want
My word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me for what I've done 
I'm sorry, I'm begging you, I'm begging me

I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
That's my word is (that's my word is bond)
Please forgive me (can't you tell, can't you tell by the look in my eye)
I'll do anything 
That's my word is bond (I like that)
Please forgive me (please forgive me I'm sorry) 
Everything I've done
I'm sorry

Can we try to make up for the Lonely Daze?
I love you baby come with me
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay

No waiting all night long let's start the love making

Ginuwine,"Anyway you wanted me
I was there for you
Undeniably
Time over and time again
You shut me out
I thought I was your man
I kept it real with you
But you was fake with me

As I close my eyes
I start thinking things
Is this love real love
And all that it brings
When I close my eyes
Only you I see
With another man
This is killing me

[Chorus]
I am your man
But only when you're lonely
If I was to bounce
That's when you'd want me
I am your man
But only when you're lonely
You say its not the same
But I love you only

My heart got broken
When my heart got opened
Repeatedly. You said you needed me
You cheated me
I'm tired of being all alone
Since you won't call me on the phone
I've got it together now I'm gone
Lone gone, listen

As I close my eyes
I start thinking things
Is this love real love
And all that it brings
When I close my eyes
Only you I see
With another man
This is killing me

I'm far gone
No more using me you won't hurt me
I can't let that slide
No more using me you won't hurt all my pride

That's means if I want to leave
You would want me
Every single night baby

I am your only man
Every night Every morning
Right by my side
See'mon and call me

Why you won't come back
You tell me you busy baby
If its like that

Won't you let me know
Won't you let me know baby
See'mon. You can be real with me

If I can get real with you
All I want is the real baby
All you gotta do is call out my name

You know I 'll be there for you
You keep me running

Don't have to think about it

No one can ever take my place,
I'm coming back to make this claim,
I talk it cos I tote big things,
And never will I fall off

I work like I'm broke as hell,
But still got tucked away eight mil,
Could quit if I wanna right now,
But I won't cos I love it, yes I love it.

You could never take my place
I'm here to stay 'cause my voice shakes
Ya speakers like bass does,
Coupe in the driveway,house and boat
??? in the stash, but I might look
Broke to the untrained eye, one may try
Hard to plead the case like son not fly,
Hoping that I fall off and don't come back,
But I married the game when I made one stack,
So you can get used to my face cos I ain't leaving
I ain't going nowhere tonight, stop breathin'
Even when I'm gone, and my songs on replay
Still like I'm here cos I live through the DJ
Cos this is the game I love, and I here to leave

Thought he was gone but hes back and I'm with 'em

But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Sometimes I be wakin' up at high noon
Sayin', ""Why me Lord?"" folks thinkin' I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin', but when they sleepin'
I be concealed up in my room, knowin' that it could happen
I'm just tryin' to maintin', because the future is untold
Till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin' after my P
So many phony niggas lovin' to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggas comin' after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin'?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin' for bruisin'
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin' his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin' with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin', I ain't scared to go
But yet my heart is steady pumpin' for somethin'
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin'
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin'
Bodies start jumpin', wreckin' my brain not to try and understand
But withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin'
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
Even though I'm not hopin' to go
I wish someone would open the do
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a Land Cruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a light pole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion
I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin' too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
And the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin' but steady fallin'
Right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin' Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggas wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin' us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin' shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renault's get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin' closer
Paranoid like a crack fiend when the gat seen
Scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
So now my sight is gettin' dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin'
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin' weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
But wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin' close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin', but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Said that you don't got what it takes 

Listen
What's mines is mines and yours is yours 
You were violated when you walked through the door 
Can't nobody see Ginuwine and the Fam' 
Stepped up in the business and we changed all your plans 
Entertained our people, gave 100 damn percent 
Never dream how much that all of us would get bent 

To all of those who want it won't you just quit it 
You ain't seen a thing until you all have come wit it 
No need to trick nigga, take your pick 
'cause on this CD every song's a hit 
My whole damn crew, can't a soul get wit 
So don't even hate 'cause you can't touch it

I'm a get respect one way or the other 
Even if I take it, I'ma make you want to 
Go get your crew but they can't help you 
Now it's you and I, and you know you're through 
I'm gonna nod who ever think they can 
Get wit Ginuwine and Timbaland 
Step to the plate ya take your swing 
Now it's my turn watch me do my thing

Ginuwine,"I ran into some girls who knew you today
They tried to tell me some things
But I know there's always two sides to a story

I don't give a damn about what others say
They just can't see you gettin' close to me
I don't give a damn about what happened before me
There's always two sides to a story

I don't give a damn about what others say
They just don't want you gettin' close to me (No, no, no)
I don't really care about what happened before me
There's always two sides to a story (First verse)

I don't understand why it's happening
And I'm tryin' to ignore the things I hear
People saying things all up in my ear
And I'm wondering is it the truth I fear

You don't need to explain, 'cause baby, I don't care
Whatever happened then was then, then was then
All that really matters, girl, that it's you and me
Whatever was then is gone, we can't change it now

How you used to carry on back then with them
And they tried to tell me things like you ain't changed one bit
But they ain't there to see the things I see

You don't need to explain, I just want you to know
It starts from now and not back then, then was then
All that really matters, girl, that it's you and me
Whatever was did, it's gone, it's history

My pager rings, I pick it up 
and you tellin me that your girl peeped me
In my Range Rover
Rollin down the ave pumpin out my new hits
I think to myself it's cool, so I keep reading 
And it's you sayin that she saw me cheatin
Now I'm all confused baby
Then I get a grip it's just a little thing that I'm dealin with
Why she hatin on me? I don't really know what this is all about 
But I'm finding out
Then my mind wanders 
Start thinking back at the party 
When she was all up in my face
And up on me
And grabbing on my arm and telling me things like how she was the bomb
Now for me it's clearer, that instead of you 
You don't see the truth but she
wants me near her

[Chorus]

Now don't believe a thing your girl say
She wants to have what you have all
it is is jealousy baby put your trust in me
She really wants to ride my pony
But you're the one I'm giving it 
you're the one I'm living with
Giving all my stuff and shit
So why you want to doubt our love
Don't let her break our world
Before you question me you need to check your girl
She done dished out more then she can take 
And her ass can't handle it
But you're my woman and we're one 
And I'm not having it
But it's alright, yes it's ok
I'm sure you believe in me and I'm sure you can see the truth in me baby

And all over me kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be I don't want this to happen to me

What did he do to you does he know he blew it
Or is it just that you wanna get even
baby if that's not it please tell me the reason
I just don't wanna get caught up in drama

Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothas on lockdown on their cots feel it

Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood

We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'

Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

Let's do this, listen

Saw her in the club
As she was about the finest thing I had ever seen
I was so addicted cause she was like a drug
And I was a fiend
I wanted to walk over
Imagining her body was calling me
I had to get with it and make it quick
I had to hit cause baby girl was a dream
I wanted to say

1 - How would you like it if I...
Touched a little
Felt a little
Grabbed a little
Could you handle if I...
Licked a little
Taste a little
Ate a little

Repeat 1

Yo second verse
Kept staring at her hoping that she would see
And maybe call me over
I was gifted but my confidence wouldn't let me
So I sat back and thought things over
(What I get?)
Got a bottle of the Cris (Oh)
Got a bottle of the Mo (Oh)
Now I'm looking like a Don Juan
So I know she gotta notice me
Over all the others
Cause they be singing all the same songs

Repeat 1 (2x)

Finally walked over to her
Told her she was the finest woman I had ever seen
She told me why'd I take so long
Cause all night she was already peepin' me
She said she likes a man who knows what he wants
Never fronts and ain't scared to ask
She was down for whatever
So I took her to the floor, got together
And I tapped that ass, yeah

He doesn't want for you
Nor is he down for you

Come get with a man, and let the boy go

[Chorus]

You'll never want for nothing
You'll never take a fall
You'll have just what you want
Prada, Gucci, and all
I'm offering everything to you
Things are what they seem
This is not a hoax
And no this ain't a dream baby
You need affection baby
You need protection baby
You need the love that I know you ain't been gettin' baby
Take a hold of my hand
Let me lead you there
You need to be free
You shouldn't have a care

[Chorus]

Now either you want some rocks or a hard place
You lookin' for daddy but searchin' all in the wrong place
Tell him this ain't no dog race or cat fight
Just pull it together and get his act right
Mack right, while I'm bendin' curves in his 'Lac right
What was he thinkin' in thinkin'
He must be out his mind
Gotta be prankin' and stankin'
Crooked and out of life
I'll take you shoppin' and knockin'
Rockin' the proper fit
These women jockin'
And me I talkin' the Prada shit
You pour some Ginuwine, I'll pour some Night Train
I'ma turn these lights out
We can do our night thing
He got a V4 and I got a [Repeat: x5]
He got his ex-girl, I'm about to X by
So if you with it, admit it
And let me hit it, hit it
Until you feel it
'Cause I don't stop, get it, get it
You need a new coach
Let's start a new game
You on the right track, but you on the wrong train

Ginuwine,"Yes, I've been through a lot of things and
I lost my mom and I lost my dad and the pain
never goes away and there are only two reasons that I cry

[Chorus]
Two reasons I cry
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone
And I'm all alone, I'm so all alone
There are two reasons I cry
Cause my momma's gone and my daddy's gone
And my heart is torn, I'm so all alone
There are two reasons I cry
Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's gone
There are two

Daddy I miss you, it's hard to cope with my life
Didn't want to go on without you daddy (Still at night I cry)
I still can't understand why did you have to leave me
Why couldn't I just have seen all your pain, now I blame myself
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, cause when your parents
Are gone it's hard to believe
That is part of life, that you must go on 
They would want you to still be strong

[Chorus]

Momma when you left, felt like my soul had gone
I still remember the day, had no words to say my heart was gone
(Still at night I cry)
You were the reason I lived, you gave me life that was pure
Always kept me so sure of everything, I miss you so
I looked down on you and no one ever knew I almost took my life
So I could be with you, I miss you so, one could never know
And I am lost and I'm feelin' so alone

[Chorus]",Two Reasons I Cry,2001
Ginuwine,"[Chorus]
Why did you go, why did you leave
Why did you take your love from me
What did I do, what did I say,
Why did you take your love away
Why did you go, why did you leave,
Why did you take your love from me
Something I said, something I've done,
Why did you take your love away

I've been single, been lonely, and hating every second of it baby
I can't sleep right, one mo' night, cause I miss the lovin' from my lady
I would give up almost anything to get you back into my life
Baby I'm sorry for whatever I've done and I want you to be my wife

[Chorus]

What's the problem, can we talk baby, I thought our love was real and true
You can tell me, I'm all ears girl, There's nothing we can't get through
Whatever the problem is we'll work it out, don't break up a happy home
Life is nothing without love to share and I don't want to be alone

[Chorus]

The memories are too much to bear
I'm so in love with you and I'm about to lose my mind
Don't know what I've done to make you leave me you baby
But I'll be true to you if you come back to me
You, you, you, you

Why not me
Is it that I'm too ghetto for you
Why not me
Girl there's nothing I won't cop for you
Why not me
I'm here to give you all your dreams
I'm dedicated
No time to wasting
I'll fulfill your every need

It ain't a thang
I'm far from a lame
Girl its all to the good
You're by yourself I'm all alone
And we're both from the hood
Your playing hard to get now
That's probably why your by yourself now
But I caught your eye when you walked by
And you persist to try to entertain
All of them things that you probably just heard
None of its true and that's my word
Baby don't believe a thing you hear now
The haters are always on my back now
But you feel me and this I know
So won't you just let go
Tell me why

[Chorus:]

I'd like to think I'm a good guy so tell me why not me
Can't blame you though if all your ex-boyfriends did you shady
But don't take that out on me girl
Oops I got to take it back its your world
Baby I'm just that guy ill show you why
If you just give me one try
I'm telling you I don't get down like that
Can't play the role
Or play myself
I just got to get in that's for sure
Got a little money
I spit game to the honeys
But you're all a nigga needs
I won't give you chicken feed

[Chorus:]

You should tell me something something
Can't imagine me just wanting
Put your cards out on the table
Baby I'm willing and able
Picture that me dippin' on ya
What the use if I'm up on ya
I'm the one you searched so long for
Give me one chance and you'll want no more

You were that special one (I knew you were that special one)
I'm so in love, so deep in love (When I first laid eyes on you, babe)

You make my life complete (You make my life complete, darlin')
You are so sweet, no one competes (No one competes, baby)
Glad you came into my life (No one, no one)
You blind me with your love (No one), with you I have no sight (Come on)

Without you right here having my back

I really don't know just where I'd be at

Been a whole day now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas, Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad

But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
Cause mommy I've done been around the world, seened a lot of places
Been around your girl believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin' Sean bless it

But as long as we're here then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that a last forever

Put, stress to rest girl stop the games
Name the spot, mommy I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to St.Tropez?
Or seened a brotha play a Mandalay?
Girl I wanna just, look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', do I believe in?
Love you till the day I stop breathin', I love you girl

Stop playin' girl, back that ass up and
Spend that cash dog, drink the Henny and
Freak that girl like you tryna have a baby 'cause

Everybody's out to fuck tonight
The fine women, they out to fuck tonight
My niggas, they down to fuck tonight
Ladies, fellas, the won't stop players

Came through the door, seen it before
Hands touchin' the ceiling, booty streakin' the floor
You ever felt good to the point you so sure that
All the attention in the club is yours
Got your hair done up, shades Christian Dior
Leave us, trade a little happy on your Vickey draws
Gettin' your dance on hard, who could wish for more
And your crew's all but know it's a horse
Got the Don all warm and it ain't the Hen'
Feelin' like the Don woman, you could wrestle her chin
Shorty, come a little closer while the record spin
I wanna freak a little longer, can they play it again

[Repeat 1]

Yo, got my mind on my money, money on my mind
And to let you know, you just as good as gold
It's like we got our own little private party goin' on
And the scene just changed into shores of San Juan
It's so intimate, we so into it
Such a tender thing, but fuck I'm innocent
Grindin' so hard you gotta know what I'm thinkin'
Laughin' 'cause I'mma kidnap you for the weekend
Now we at the pad about to crack a case
Playin' the couch like Caesar's, she feedin' me grapes
Not for nuttin' hon, the sex is great
But you know you got to go, I got checks to chase... next

If you're wit' it grab your friends, follow Joe and me
'cause it's on, it's on
Went in and got the Cris' and a pound of weed
It's on, it's on

Now mami, let's get serious, 'cause by the looks of it
It seems your sexuality is just a little curious
You got a friend, we could gather then split
If not, I got a girl for every girl I get
There's a drop in the lot and it whip so fast
We hit the swiss hotel before you finish your glass
And you know you wanna be where the cake is at
Where the pockets just like calories, extra fat
Mami, your body like Malery on Natural Born Killer
She like, they got money but ya'll are more realer
She wanna roll wit' us, pretty much to crit' us
No beatin' around the bush, just beatin' it 'till you bit us

If you cheated on him,

Tell me if you were in my shoes 
What would you do or think of me would you trust me
But your feeding me 
all this rap about 
how its different but its not mentioned what you're doing is wicked 
Now I'm having second thoughts about 
you and me 'cause this is not how I want it or it should be

You say you want my trust and told me you were leavin'
How am I to know that you won't do it to me
Your tellin' me its different but what the hell is different

And what goes around 
comes back around to you five times harder and I'm pretty sure 
that he's thinking, that you're totally his 
but you're here in my rimmed up drop top with me all hugged up 
And all over me kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be I don't want this to happen to me

we move on, we grow, we learn, and then that's it let it go
Well, you gonna be a better man for me?

Girl I know all the things that I did to you
It's hard to let go cause it hurts
What if I am the one that you want and
You love
We've gotta try hard to make this work
Girl at times when I thought it was done you would call and gone forever
Out the door
My life was gone and out in the cold
And them things I won't do no more

[Chorus]
I know it's getting you
But don't give up on me
I want to be a bedda man
Don't live in the past we gotta move ahead

I'm trying to be a bedda man
If this is what you really want
Then act like this is what you want
Try and make it work
Don't give up on us
Cause I am a bedda man

You forgave all the things that I did to you
So why you always bringing up the past
I know what I did was wrong and so
Cold
But doing that won't make us last
Listen
Now's the time for us both to move on look ahead
And base everything
On right now
Cause if we don't move on and start all over
We might as well end it all now

[Chorus]

Why you pushing me testing me Baby
Why you pushing me testing me Baby
Why you trying me dogging me Baby
You can trust
In me promise you Baby
I love you can't you see Baby
Please don't give up on me Baby
I am a different man Baby

Love has changed this man Baby
Why you dogging me Baby

The big ring, the small hand
A big cake, a bridesmaid, a best man
One day, we gon' have all that

[Ginuwine]
Girl I know we just met tonight
And this may seem like a lie
But, I'm not the player type
Guess what? Normally you wouldn't find me
Under the crowd of lights, in search of a love in life
But you shakin' that stuff right
I think I should make you my wife

[Chorus: x2]

[Ginuwine]
You probably think I'm tryin' crush tonight
'cause I got a look of lust, like crust in my eye
No matter what I say, keep it tight
Keep it away from me like Superman and kryptonite
You see I'm not thinkin' short term, I've learned
Givin' everybody turns, can I like a back burn
Oh, you got this lover want to beg to earn, oh baby

I know it sounds boo, I ain't even known you two

Ain't life funny, don't nothin' move but that money
Oh boy, honeys, lookin' like Playboy bunnies
They whole swagger, that be the type that I go after
That get more attention 'cause they ass is more fatter
And every day gotta have a, but I ain't trynna make her unconfy
Or cramp her style like a monthly
How many women want a man, with big plans
Big feet and big hands, y'all understand
Why big daddy wear the big pants, I'm big boned
And if this symbolizes my life, I live long
My funny valentine, won't you be mine

I Was ready to change the game
You forfeited my love and still livin' the same
I felt like I was just wanted for the fame
It's a bit silly to think I would look again
'cause you have lost this nigga and a damn good friend
I thought you stick around but you couldn't stay
I was looking forward to those better things
I guess it's just the problems that the chedda brings
Just the problems that chedda brings

Thought I finally found my soul sista
Convinced I had it all, fell in love quicker
Been going through it all this time
And now I'm so sick of, your games
I'm so sick of your games
Girl, you're fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Must be out your mind or on some strong liquor
How could I stay with ya you right after neighborhood's been with ya I can't
You've already had your chance spending, all my Benjamin's

She was a San Francisco gold digga
And she knew how to put a hole in a nigga pocket for the cold figgas
Chain you up and whip you take your Polaroid pictures
Oops, blackmail when she get annoyed with ya
Oh, she the type to do her thing
Type to lock you down, for half of the estate
From around the way
So fellas beware of the fuckin' game
She'll ruin your name and empty all the savings just the same

Jose had this biddy testing her game
Usin' her black gold
That's what I guess she gets out my pockets
Chains like a lasso
It's past dough she's after my G's
Plus my reality
I max though payin her rent and now she mad at me
Is that so
Sayin' well Jose you bout to blow
Doin' songs wit Ginuwine, Sole, and little mo
I'm' like
What you talkin'
I don't know G and he don't know me
And you been talkin' sideways a little often
That's why when my thing softens
I start to loose interest
A gold digga with a fetish for riches
So bear witness
She the difference 'tween women and chickens skeazas and sistas

And it kills me, just to know you're sad. 
You're all I need, you're more than just a friend to me. 
You're everything, cause you're my betta half.

There just ain't a thing that I won't do for you. 
You are my light, my inner soul. 
Without you here I'll lose my life and all there is. 
Without your love I'll lose control. 
How can I explain, words just can't describe, 
got to tell you though, can't think about my pride. 
You are meant for me you are a gift from God. 
You're the seed of my soul. 
You're my young when I'm old.

Ain't nobody else gone love me like you love me

You put up with the hard times
You put up with the sad times

Drinkin' a glass of gin with no ice
And even though I sipped it slow, it would burn like a volcano
That's when you came sat down and said hi
And you didn't even recognize who I was but I didn't mind,
Cause I didn't feel like signing autographs
You saw me as a normal guy and you treated me oh so nice
You just wanted to know why I looked sad

I'm sad cause I hurt a soul tie
And when she left my soul died
Thought we'd be together for life 
(thought we'd be together for life)
I lost her because of my damn pride, 
I'm a man that can't cry, but look at me now, 
With my face in the ground and a glaze in my eye.

I was so tough, til she called my bluff, packed up all her stuff 
And left me here with a glaze in my eye.
My whole life I was taught, a man don't show his heart
But that's a foolish thought cause now I got a glaze in my eye.

And it's harder to hide, my runny nose and my throat is dry
But I'm still tryin' not to let it show
I'll just blame it on the alcohol, cause it makes me think I'm strong, 
But that's some bull and we both know (we both know)
I can't believe I told some waitress, all of my personal business
And I ain't really believe you'd understand, but you did understand
You said everyone has issues, then you passed me a tissue
And told me that cryin' is what shows that I'm a real man

Shorty, say what's your price 
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I spent
Pay me back when you shake it again

The don, all the time, with all the shine
You small time, I ball with mine
Links, minks, Bentley, it's all with mine
My jams bump out to the borderline
UK hot with it, blew spots with it
Every continent love when I spit it
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothas on lockdown on their cots feel it
It's real in the field the Last Mohican
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood
Legit' now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge
I make hits now, money I flip now
Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now
I lit up my neck, pinkie, and wrist now
So girls everywhere, this is how we get down

[Chorus]

Play to win, girls in the club moving
I get ?em real hot, my songs seduce 'em
I flow, I'm so mysterious
Nas, and Nasty's the alias
Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

[Chorus]

I put the shackles on your feet (You owe me)
I think you owe me some (You owe me)
The shackles on your feet (You owe Nas)
I think you owe me some (You owe Ginuwine)
(You owe Timbaland, you owe me)

Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion

Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something
(You owe me something, oh yeah)
I said shorty, say what's your price
(You owe Nas)
Just to back it up

What you got for me is no shock to me 
Can't believe that you're my property 
The sound of you clappin' on top of me
The feeling of hitting the lottery 
Or passing go twice in monopoly 
But they don't compare to what you got for me 
The taste of the puddin' is so chocolaty 
I'm so conceited so obscene 
And still got my sneakers and my chain all leanin' 
And when I hit it right it start gleamin'

Chop it a little bit

Come blow my mind 
Its cold out here please let me come inside 
Oh so warm at night

You can go ahead and talk greasy 
Tell me that you never had it this deeply 
I'm a whisper slick you respond sweetly 
Extra freaky I trick and you treat me
I'll give you take but don't hesitate 
When you feel it go and throw it right back 
Just let me hold ya by ya shoulders 
Then you can take it like that 
I knew you was a champ girl got your leg 
On the dresser kickin' the lamp girl 
Run the shower lets go in the bathroom girl 
Cause the temperature is hotter than high noon girl 
Crack that door let the steam flow 
Ain't nobody here but me and you let it go 
You never it this good you already know 
Give me all you got girl really though 

[Chorus]

You're the sexiest woman I've ever known 
My mind is blown 
You're simple beautiful how you do it to me 
You're showin' me things id never do 
Whole 'nother side of you 
Just keep what you do it feels like oh we

You can go ahead and hit a wild climax 
Ain't no way I'm bout to let you relax let me see if
You can hold me on ya back 
Let me see ya body wine to the track

Swear to gud I?m about to blow
I?m coming in y?all going out the door
You can hate you can doubt the flow
But tell the whole globe it?s about to snow
Broads, cars, record deals and cheddar
I ain?t involved if it ain?t a mil or better
You feel the pressure? I know you do
Roadsters, Rovers, I overdue
I do it how you suppose to do
Get rich before rap no loans recouped,
I?m what a cold a flow little promo do
Stones looking like a million little photo shoots
Maybe that?s why all the models stop
Same time the jaws and the pradas drop, 
They feel the pressure like bottle tops
Right before the bottle pop
Owww!

[Verse 2: Belly]
It?s Belly boy get the name right
I paint life you can ask what my game like
Get introduced in the daylight
Seduce and knock boots in the same night
Girls kill for a him, 
That?s me the new day filmore slim, 
I have you sweating till you feel more slim
You wanna feel less them and feel more him (I knowww)
I have to win that?s right whole life full of acronyms
DD on her chest, CP on my chest
AC on the seats, TV in the deck
SLR couple GTs and a S

It?s be do you feel the pressure yet?
I?m MJ with three seconds left
Yesss!

Appena entri l'accoglienza è tipo questa qua
Ale ale oh oh, ale ale oh oh.

Wow, andiamo nella suite,
Con cinque stelle addosso, baby, come J&J.
Sei troppo zozza bitch, sei la più zozza bitch,
Sei cosa zozza che ti fotto vestito da Ris.
Vuoi fare cin-cin? Sennò, facciamo il bis,
Ti fai toccare quando voglio touchscreen.
Hai curve tipo drift, trema il palazzo.
Ma quale miss? Al massimo, mi succhi il cazzo.
Schiaffoni forti a mano aperta, sul sedere,
Che per due settimane non ti riuscirai a sedere.
La musica di fondo e il rumore delle cerniere,
Sono come Zalando urli di piacere.
Non mi capisci? Do you speak English?
Ti faccio un fist-in così forte che il braccio sparisce.
Sii ragionevole, ti vengo addosso,
Tanto poi facciamo la costatazione amichevole.

Di dove sei, di dove sei?
Secondo me, di Brazzers
Ale ale oh oh, ale ale oh oh.

Non dir minchiate, non sei una modella,
Sei brava a scopare. Hai fatto la bidella?
Finita l'ora, suona la campanella.
Sei rosa con le macchie bianche mortadella.
Infilo la mia testa nel tuo big boot, zia.
Ci rimango dentro per almento due minuti, zia.
Tu muovilo, muovilo, muovilo finché non sudi, zia.
Sono tipo una sarta, ti riempio tutti I buchi, zia.
Ti insegno come toccare le palle come un mister,
Facciam più posizioni di quando si gioca a Twister.
Fammi un chinotto, non mi piace il ginger.
Il mio punto debole è la figa tallone da sgrille.
Ti chiamano Gesù, perché riesci,
A moltiplicare senza trucchi tanti pesci.
E se c'è il tipo, me ne fotto.
Io ti ho sottovalutata, tu mi hai valutato sotto.

A dire il vero non lo so,
Se io qua sto bene
Assieme a sti problemi,
Oppure un giorno me ne andrò.
E ora mi chiedi come sto,
Scusami se ti ho deluso un po',
Capisco se vai via
È solo colpa mia
E di questi momenti no.

Come sto? Sto come sempre
Perchè non vedo
Il futuro dentro
Una palla di vetro,
Ho deluso me stesso
Prima di te
Dici che non so amare perchè
Sono troppo concreto,
Se mi guardi negli occhi
Vedi un vicolo cieco
Dono forma e dubbi di amleto,
Io non sono facile,
Tu nemmeno,
Ma se lo fossimo ci annoieremmo.
Se vai via capisco le tue ragioni,
Sono le conseguenze delle mie azioni,
E non sempre c'è il tempo per rimediare,
E non è una lezione,
Ti ripeto per imparare.
Ho avuto tanto dalla sorte
Ed ho gettato tutto via,
La mia vita è un'emorragia,
Vorrei che fossi tu a fermarla,
A salvarmi, a cambiarmi, a calmarmi.

E ora mi chiedi come sto
A dire il vero non lo so,
Se io qua sto bene
Assieme a sti problemi,
Oppure un giorno me ne andrò.
E ora mi chiedi come sto,
Scusami se ti ho deluso un po',
Capisco se vai via
È solo colpa mia
E di questi momenti no.

Come stai? la solita domanda a casa mia,
io sto bene, la solita bugia.
Come vuoi che sia cresciuto,
A casa tu chiedevi aiuto ai tuoi,
Io lo chiedevo a Google.
Tu non sai quanto fa male
Quando dalla finestra vedi I mei vicini
Che stannno cenando,
Loro a tavola, in quattro,
Con un sorriso a testa,
Mentre io sono da solo
A guardarli dalla finestra.
E quando faccio il letto
Trovo sempre I suoi capelli rossi,
Sparsi qua la tra le lenzuola,
Vorrei poterli unire,
Sentire ancora dire,
Se li preferisco lisci, ricci o mossi.
Ma dopo ci ho pensato,
E ora quando penso al mio passato
Chiudo gli occhi e una voce mi dice
Che il peggio è passato.
Ora guardo avanti,
Ma stavolta io non cambio pagina,
Cambio proprio libro,
Punto e a capo.

E ora mi chiedi come sto
A dire il vero non lo so,
Se io qua sto bene
Assieme a sti problemi,
Oppure un giorno me ne andrò.

Non mi guardavo allo specchio,
Per capire se in fondo questo,
Ero proprio io.
E solo adesso so che,
Dovrei pensare più spesso,
A stare più con me stesso.

Gionata non è quello che pensi,
Gionata tu non lo hai conosciuto ed è meglio per certi versi.
Gionata non è quello che vedi ai concerti,
Gionata non è quello che ascolti nei pezzi.
Sono cambiato perchè m'han cambiato sappilo, sappiatelo,
Anche il diavolo prima era un angelo,
Me ne sbatto ho sempre avuto un motivo valido,
Fare lo stronzo con chi è stronzo ha un suo fascino.
Gionata rivuole gli anni dove non sorrideva se usciva con una nuova,
Ma se usciva il sole, ma oggi piove,
E lui si gode il temporale,
Tanto anche se è bel tempo i ricordi fan male uguale.
Gionata è contento soltanto per GionnyScandal ma,
A Gionata in fondo cosa gli cambia,
Avere pieno il conto in banca,
Se dentro resti vuoto,
Come se ci fosse sempre qualcosa che manca.

Era da tanto che,
Non mi guardavo allo specchio,
Per capire se in fondo questo,
Ero proprio io.
E solo adesso so che,
Dovrei pensare più spesso,
A stare più con me stesso.

Io non lo faccio apposta ad esser sempre giù, sai anche tu,
Che le carezze sui graffi si sentono di più.
Quante volte ho chiesto scusa dalla rabbia,
E all'esame di coscienza avevo i bigliettini in tasca.
Ti rendi conto che ti manca vivere,
Quando attacchi i post-it sul frigo per ricordati di sorridere,
Perché la vita in fondo è come il mare,
Non gliene frega se non sai nuotare!

Gionata darebbe il suo successo,
Anche adesso,
Per riavere indietro tutto ciò che ha perso.
Firmerebbe assegni,
Non importa il prezzo,
Oltre al buongiorno dai suoi fans vorrebbe quello del suo vecchio,
Papà mi chiedo spesso,
Se sai qualche mio pezzo,
Chissà se in paradiso c'è il wifi,
Ma presto,
Verrò li in paradiso a fare un live, promesso.
Ti voglio in prima fila insieme a mamma, vi aspetto!

Quando vuoi volare
Ma ti hanno spezzato le ali e non vuoi
Provare a ricominciare
Ma forse è normale
Perché hai cancellato quel poco di noi

Chissà se mi starai ascoltando
Chissà dove sei
Chissà se lui ti ama davvero
Io non direi
Dimmi dov'è il nostro futuro
Se il giorno prima era un ti amo
E il giorno dopo un altro vaffanculo
Non ti chiedevo tanto
Non dovevi fare altro che ascoltarmi
E fidarti l'ultima volta soltato
Ma non l'hai fatto
E sai che penso da un paio di sere?
Che avremmo fatto invidia al mondo noi due insieme
Vorrei scriverti un messaggio di due parole
Ma se le scrivo il mio iphone mi da un errore
Non dare colpa al mio iphone ma al mio dolore
Perché a volte il dolore cambia le persone
E dopotutto ti volevo ringraziare
Perché è solo grazie a te se adesso non so più amare
E la vuoi sapere un'altra cosa?
Amare e soffrire sono la stessa cosa

Eppure fa male
Quando vuoi volare
Ma ti hanno spezzato le ali e non vuoi

Perchè hai cancellato quel poco di noi

Soffro di philofobia per colpa tua
E il dottore dice che non c'è una cura
E che non devo aver paura
Se le relazioni fossero così importanti
Anche Dio ne avrebbe una
E se vuoi proviamo a uscire
Poi vediamo se va meglio
Ma I tuoi baci fanno troppo male
Lasciano uno sfregio
Sai mantenerlo un segreto?
L'amore è una malattia baby e senza si sta meglio
Se ora vieni e mi baci
È chiaro che non sorrido
Se ora dici che cambi io è chiaro che non mi fido
Ci ho messo anni e mesi e alla fine l'ho capito
Il verbo restare non è sempre un verbo all'infinito
E si capisce troppo bene che sei finta
Tutte le tue bugie le hai nascoste dietro al tuo fondo tinta
E se era amore a prima vista
Ci tocca prendere appuntamento da un oculista

Eppure fa male
Quando vuoi volare
Ma ti hanno spezzato le ali e non vuoi
Provare a ricominciare
Ma forse è normale
Perchè hai cancellato quel poco di noi

Eppure quanto fa male
Quando vuoi volare
Ma ti hanno spezzato le ali e non vuoi

Non devo aver paura di ricominciare
Vado avanti e non ci penso più
Ho ancora tanto tempo per incontrare
Quella che volevo fossi tu
È solo la paura di soffrire che mi spacca il cuore
Ma tutto passa prima o poi

E' dal 27 settembre del 91
Che mi faccio il culo
Che vi faccio il culo
Fra grazie a nessuno
Grazie a me e a mia madre
Fin quando c'è potuta stare
Grazie a mio padre
Per gli schiaffi che mi è riuscito a dare
Sono cresciuto solo
Fra dentro un oratorio
Assieme a un gameboy color
Con su Pokemon Oro
Ora sti ragazzini fra in giro
Son tutti loro
Che se eravate miei figli
A calci in culo fino al matrimonio
Mai avuto il vostro aiuto
Mai avuto qualche mano
Né dai miei parenti
Né da quelli che io consolavo
Il capobranco di me stesso
Come um husky siberano
Non avevo il piatto pronto
A 12 anni cucinavo
A quelli che sanno chi sono
Va un grazie sincero
E per quelli che parlan per niente ho trovato un rimedio
Mi tatuo il simbolo dell'infinito sopra il dito medio
Così vi mando a fan-culo per sempre e mi tolgo il pensiero!

È stato meglio,da un lato
Perchè se provi a dirmi addio io sono abituato
E a tutti quelli che mi hanno ferito un miliardo di volte
grazie perchè ora sono più forte
Avrei dovuto andare a scuola
Ma saltavo le lezioni
Mamma voleva che studiassi
E non pensassi alle canzoni
Scusa se non ti ho ascoltata spero un giorno mi perdoni
Oltre alla musica nessuno mi ha dato soddisfazioni
La mia ex ragazza in giro di me chissà che racconta
Certe stanno zitte solo se le metti il cash in borsa
Certe stanno zitte solo
Se le metti con te in mostra
Certe stanno zitte solo
Se le metti il cazzo in bocca
E forse l'unico difetto mio che non sopporto è solo
Che soffro da sempre di sindrome d'abbandono
Ora non piango più da un pezzo
E se mi mancherai sappi che troverò un motivo per sorridere lo stesso!

ha paura di incontrarti, fatti due domande
Ti senti cosi' grande, fammi capire
Se dici di amarla che senso ha farla soffrire?
Di notte prima che dorme dovresti scaldarla
solo con un abbraccio forte, non con le botte
E se tu avessi una famiglia, pensa se dovesse
accadere la stessa cosa con tua figlia

Al passato e a ciò che è stato non pensarci mai

Che sei bella anche così, vestita di lividi.

Chiusa a chiave
Dentro un incubo dal quale tu pensi non ci si possa più svegliare
Ma adesso fai la cosa giusta, vallo a denunciare
Non ci credo che anche oggi sei caduta dalle scale
Tu non hai perso, è lui che ha perso te
Il tuo sorriso resta la vittoria più grande che c'è
In 'sto periodo rifletto su una cosa
sembra che amare davvero una donna ormai sia fuori moda
Non posso cambiare lui perché è nato già bastardo
Ma posso cambiare te e darti forza per farlo
Oltre a darti qualche abbraccio, coraggio
il segreto è tornare quella che eri prima di incontrarlo
Per lui eri sola a mezzanotte, adesso non ti ha più
E si deve accontentare solo di quell'abat-jour

Le mie parole sono belle perchè hanno il tuo sapore
Vorrei scrivere il mio nome sulla luna perchè,
Ogni notte prima di dormire guarderesti me
E se ancora tu mi piaci
È colpa dei tuoi baci
Siamo bravi a litigare e a lasciarci non siam capaci
Qua passano le ore,
Non abbiamo più l'amore
Scopiamo solamente per non sentirci soli
E anche se lo so che ogni cosa ha una sua fine
Vivo insieme alla paura che questo potrà finire
Tanto troverai di meglio di come lo riesci a dire
A far passare tutto questo non bastano due aspirine.
E' troppo tempo che ci siamo persi ormai
Non ho più neanche il coraggio di chiederti come stai
Quindi se vorrai
Il mio numero ce l'hai
Aspetto un tuo messaggio anche se so che non lo manderai

E chi se ne frega se litigo con te
Ogni due per tre
Chi se ne frega
A me bastava noi
Tu quante cose vuoi
Io non ho niente
E vorrei darti tutto quanto
Sono bravo solo a far canzoni
Eppure Dio dice che ho ragione
Eppure Dio dice che ho ragione
Quando dico come te una su un milione

Forse in matematica non ero molto bravo
Ma con te ho imparato che il doppio di sei è siamo
Quando mi hai detto se ci tieni inizia a dimostrarlo
Io ti ho chiesto scusa,ho pianto e non ho risolto un cazzo
Come fai a darmi la colpa
Se ogni volta
Mentre cerco di chiarire tu esci e sbatti la porta
Le chiavi del mio cuore le avevo già date via
Ma per fortuna in casa mia ho tenuto quelle di scorta

E adesso non sorrido più nemmeno quando sto con gli altri
Quando mi chiedon come sto rispondo che mi manchi
Gli amici mi ripetono di non pensarci e basta
Che ne troverò un'altra e tutto passa ma è una frase fatta
Vorrei sposarti sulla luna mentre splende
E farti partorire tra le stelle più belle
E quando mi chiedevi hai tutto cosa vuoi di più
Se ti ricordi io ti ho sempre risposto soltanto tu

A me bastava noi

Sono bravo solo a far canzoni eppure dio dice

Che ho ragione quando dico come te una su un milione

Il cuore mi fa un male atroce
Dimmi qualcosa fai veloce
La mia canzone preferita è la tua voce
E questo amore quanto nuoce

I saw through the lies and read the alibi signs
So I left my home I'm really on my own at last
Left the trodden path and separated from the past.

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Quella di Tom Dooley, quella di Davy Crocket

Il Cerutti, Cerutti Gino

Dicevan che era un mago (era un mago)

Una sera, in una strada scura
""Occhio, c'e' una lambretta""
Fingendo di non aver paura
Il Cerutti monta in fretta

Ma che rogna nera quella sera
Qualcuno vede e chiama
Veloce arriva la pantera
E lo vede, la madama

Il suo nome era Cerutti Gino
Ma lo chiamavan Drago
Gli amici al bar del Giambellino
Dicevan che era un mago (era un mago)

Ora è triste e un poco manomesso
Si trova al terzo raggio
È lì che attende il suo processo
Forse vien fuori a Maggio

Ma il giudice è stato buono
Gli ha fatto un lungo fervorino
È uscito col condono

Probabilmente non avrò bisogno 
Di assassinare in segreto mio padre 
Né di far l'amore con mia madre in sogno

Quando sarò capace di amare 
Con la mia donna non avrò nemmeno 
La prepotenza e la fragilità 
Di un uomo bambino

Quando sarò capace di amare 
Vorrò una donna che ci sia davvero 
Che non affolli la mia esistenza 
Ma non mi stia lontana neanche col pensiero

Vorrò una donna che se io accarezzo 
Una poltrona un libro o una rosa 
Lei avrebbe voglia di essere solo 
Quella cosa

Quando sarò capace di amare 
Vorrò una donna che non cambi mai 
Ma dalle grandi alle piccole cose 
Tutto avrà un senso perché esiste lei

Potrò guardare dentro al suo cuore 
E avvicinarmi al suo mistero 
Non come quando io ragiono 
Ma come quando respiro

Quando sarò capace di amare 
Farò l'amore come mi viene 
Senza la smania di dimostrare 
Senza chiedere mai se siamo stati bene

E nel silenzio delle notti
Con gli occhi stanchi e l'animo gioioso
Percepire che anche il sonno è vita
E non riposo

Quando sarò capace di amare 
Mi piacerebbe un amore
Che non avesse 
Alcun appuntamento col dovere

Un amore senza sensi di colpa 
Senza alcun rimorso 
Egoista e naturale 
Come un fiume che fa il suo corso

Senza cattive o buone azioni
Senza altre strane deviazioni
Che se anche il fiume le potesse avere 
Andrebbe sempre al mare

Quando hai gli occhi chiusi
Lo so e anche tu lo sai
La vita ci ha delusi

Il nostro orizzonte
È sempre più sfumato
E il tempo vola e preme 
Su di noi

Ogni notte ti perdo
E mi si ferma il cuore
Ogni giorno ti trovo
Ma sei un’altra amore

Giorgio Gaber,"Oggi al primo contatto di fronte a una donna c’è un po’ di pausa 
Credo che sia per il fatto che è ormai è un animale di un’altra natura 
Io sarei il sesso più forte 
E dovrei farle la corte 
Ma non ci vuol mica tanto 
Per rendersi conto che fa tutto lei 

Che paura 
Che paura 
Specialmente le donne di ora 

Oggi ogni donna evoluta affronta le cose con grande entusiasmo 
Sembra che guardi alla vita credendo più che altro al suo pragmatismo 
Quando con tono civile 
Parlo di un mondo ideale 
Lei si addormenta all’istante 
Ne sente già tante che non ne può più 

Che paura 
Che paura 
Specialmente le donne di ora 
Che paura 
Che paura 
Specialmente le donne di ora 

Forse per come va il mondo 
Questo non è un buon momento 
Sono affranto 
Ogni tanto vorrei intervenire 
Ma purtroppo non ho le idee chiare 
Sono un uomo che guarda le cose con tante pretese e poca energia 
E’ anche logico che in una coppia normale ognuno sostenga la propria ragione 
Che anche nel gioco sessuale sia sempre in agguato la competizione 
Forse per noi va un po’ male 
In questo assetto sociale 
Forse per farci valere 
Dovremmo abitare parecchio più a sud 

Che paura 
Che paura 
Specialmente le donne di ora 

Basta guardare la storia per dire che le donne sono state un po’ oppresse 
Forse è una mia sensazione ma sembra che ora sian meno dimesse 
Certo hanno poco potere 
E questo è ingiusto e volgare 
Ma quando un giorno lo avranno 
Cosa faranno, Dio solo lo sa 

Che paura 
Che paura 
Specialmente le donne di ora 

Forse per come va il mondo 
Siamo vicini al collasso 
Son depresso 
Vorrei tanto inventarmi una vita 
Che non sia così stanca e avvilita 
Ma al momento non sono sicuro 
E se penso un po’ al futuro mi sento un po’ giù
Mentre invece le donne che sembra più fragili fissamente sono più dotate 
Spesso la vita è un po’ dura ma in genere loro c’han troppa salute 
Io non mi sento di dire 
Che ci faranno sparire 
Certo che da un po’ di tempo le vedove allegre sono sempre di più 

Che paura 
Che paura 
Specialmente le donne di ora 
Che paura 
Che paura 
Sono stato imprudente 
Non dico più niente 
Da tanta paura che ho",Le Donne di ora,2018

Giorgio Gaslini,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Giorgio Gaslini,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Giorgio Gaslini,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1996
Giorgio Gomelsky,"Les mains tendues
Tu réclames ta liberté
A ton père qui ne peut pas
Et ne veut pas comprendre

Il voudrait te voir derrière son établi
Un marteau en main toute ta vie
Samedi soir la sortie est obligatoire
Et s'arrête au cinéma

Et dans les froids moments de l'incertitude
Il y a au plus profond de ta solitude
Derrière les murs de l'incompréhension

Un espoir rempli de passion
Tu prendras l'avenir comme il te viendra
Si tu veux il sera pour toi

Et dans les rues mouillées aux couleurs de l'ennui
Et ce chien qui hurle au silence de la nuit
Ton cœur trop serré a envie d'exploser

A la face d'un monde résigné
Tes yeux aveuglés par l'enfance trompée
S'ouvriront sur la vérité

Ta génération en veut à la terre entière
Le long des routes il ne trouve que la misère
Mais tes doigts sont en or et sur ta guitare

Tu joueras pour sortir du noir
Devant les lumières de la célébrité
Tu pourras faire briller le nom

Que ton père t'a donné
Ouais, que ton père t'a donné

Giorgio Li Calzi,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1994

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

And watch out for that innocent expression

Then the woman is wild
So wild

And she burns through the night at the speed of light
She's on fire
With the heat of the beat right beneath her feet
She's on fire
And the name of the game is to fuel her flame
She's on fire, fire, fire, fire, fire

And so the dance of danger's your decision
But understand she's not quite like her vision

Giorgio Moroder,"Father said to me we gotta have your life run night
Off you got to school where you can learn the rules there right
Be just like your dad lad
Follow in the same tradition
Never go astray and stay an honest lovin' son.

Son of my father
Molded I was folded I was preform-packed
Son of my father
Commanded I was branded in a plastic vac'
Surrounded and confounded by statistic facts.

Tried to keep me in but jumped out of my skin in time
I saw through the lies and read the alibi signs
So I left my home I'm really on my own at last
Left the trodden path and separated from the past.

Son of my father
Changing rearranging into someone new
Son of my father
Collecting and selecting independent views
Knowing and I'm showing that a change is due.

It's legendary in the hood how I got my cash
I'm legendady in the hood so I got the mag

Thank God man I had the block
Ya'll hear me though
You young fucks got the game all wrong
This is my life man this ain't no song
You ain't livin' your rhymes out, you live at your mom's house
In that tight-ass room, pullin' the cars out
And the mirror pointin' at your reflection, killing yourself
You American Pie, stop feeling yourself
Nigga, you just a worker, go deal yourself
Stop being a server, get a meal yourself
Where your heart at, all that yick-yack, ain't nobody scared of your gats
We got bigger ones
How many niggas done shot at me shivering

Suddenly a stirring finally recurring where I let it fall
Following the wanderings of a dream a dream that keeps my soul alive
Believing in an open sky believing in a love

Dancing with a stranger careless of the danger there within his smile
While the dew was forming breathing in the morning like a sleeping child
If the memory of the light should fade horizons reaching cold and blue
Until your heart is free to fly then I will keep the sun for you
Until you touch the open sky then I will keep the sun for you
Until we never say goodby then I will keep the sun for you",The Chase [DJ Werner Mix],1993

Only a fool would let you out of their sight
I feel so grateful for this four-on-the-floor
You took a hold of me like never before

Oh, back and forth
You're loving me, play like tug-of-war
You wave the white flag, but I want more
Back and forth, I want more, I want more

I think it's funny, you made me put down my pride
To tell the truth to you, I'll never lie
It's just so funny how things change after time
If it's with you, I'll smile the rest of my life

Sweet undertow
And we burn, and we burn
And we burn to the ground
Every bridge, every road, that we've found
We've no way home

The only question,
Can there be harmony without a lesson?
Without losing control?

We can't stop until our minds are free
There, we're hanging by a thread of hope
Don't let go, my sisters and my brothers weep
Don't have to read the signs to see
That the blood on the leaves you sat on
Don't let go

There's a cage with no key
Like a stranger who's locked in a dream
With no way out

I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee

And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in

It is always nice to see you
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
I'm pretending not to see them
Instead, I pour the milk

Everybody's welcome
Come on, come on in
Sit yourself down
The funnies never end
Love is the drug
That makes you want to drink
Till the morning after, oh

There's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking

Let's wander out yonder o'er the hills
By a babbling brook
Where we'll find a nook
To build our own love nest, o'er the hills
Darling of my heart,  Never more to part
 
Ramona, I hear the mission bells above
Ramona, they're ringing out our song of love
I press you, caress you, and bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember the rambling rose you wear in your hair
Ramona, when day is done you'll hear my call
Ramona, we'll meet beside the water fall
I dread the dawn when I awake to find you gone
Ramona I need you my own",Ramona,1992
Giovanni,"Aquarius, was born the night
The shining stars, needed brighter shining light

It came along, like a blast from out of sight

When I was weak, you came along
Enlightened me, covered the sun
You seduced me, I can never ever run

'Cause I, can only lose
When I'm, Aquarius
You're the power that I need
To make it all succeed, can hear me call?

Aquarius, is the stardust
It kills the faith, and the only one I trust
It calls your name, and you listen
It steals your soul, and your hunger and your lust

For life, and being free (it's killing me, it's killing me)
It's dragging you, it's killing me (it's killing me, it's killing me)
You seduced me, I can never ever run

'Cause I, can only lose
When I'm, Aquarius
You're the power that I need
To make it all succeed, can you hear me call? Can you hear me call?

I wish the stars would turn you in, and leave me standing in the wind
I wish the devil gave you up, and all the snow would melt and stop

This is it, I can't run away
You're controlling my life, and I can hear me say

'Cause I, can only lose
When I'm, Aquarius

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

The minute you let her under your skin

For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Rimani",Più tempo,2016
Giovanni Caccamo,"Resta con me, come fossimo sospesi
In quest’ultimo respiro prima di cambiare il corso delle cose
Resta con me anche senza dire niente
Anche senza dire quello che vorrei sentirti dire ancora 
Come vorrei che questa luce illuminasse I miei tormenti e le maree
Come vorrei che queste foto appese mi parlassero di te
Amarti non è certo una follia 

Senti come è cambiato il vento
Senti questo momento è per noi
Rimango senza fiato, legato a questo prato di stelle
Senti come sono vicino pur essendo lontano da te
La notte ci sorride, la luna è sempre quella
Se le guardi da quaggiù
Anche se qui manchi tu

Resta con me
Osserviamoci in silenzio
Non lasciamo spazio a tutti quei fantasmi respiriamo ancora 
Come vorrei che questa luce illuminasse I miei tormenti e le maree
Come vorrei che queste mani nude mi sfiorassero per sempre, inerme
Amore, amore mio resta con me

Senti come è cambiato il vento
Senti questo momento è per noi
Rimango senza fiato, legato a questo prato di stelle
Senti come sono vicino pur essendo lontano da te

Anche se qui manchi
Anche se qui manchi",Resta con me,2016
Giovanni Caccamo,"Non saprò contare i giorni
A questa fine
Accetterò di non averti addosso mai
Passerà l’inverno e nuove prospettive
Si dissolveranno, pioveranno in noi
E respirare tra le stelle
È il mio destino
Senza chiedere un motivo aspetterò
Soli in due da troppo tempo
A non parlare
Tre invisibili risposte annegherò
Camminare aiuta ad essere sicuri
Ma non ci fermeranno
Crederanno in noi

Parole inutili
Sei qualcosa da rifare
Sei la forza che non ho
Sei l'mmagine
Qualcosa poi tutt'al più ritornerà
Vorrei sentirti dentro
Saprò portarti via da me
Così velocemente
Mi perdo nella notte, complice

Di ogni giorno quando muore

Domani il buio sparirà
Portami lontano e poi danziamo
Sulle note di una notte
Che senza motivo svanirà
Se perso un temporale
Farò a pezzi il mio dolore
Certo che qualcosa cambierà
Solitario aspetto il giorno
Immaginando un tuo ritorno
Che silenziosamente arriverà

Che metà

Giovanni Caccamo,"Sotto le coperte
Mille storie chiuse
In un involucro di sabbia
Piove sulle nostre idee
Piove su di me
Piangerei per te
Ripenso a quanto è inutile
Ostinarsi a dialogare
Non sentiamo che le cose
Hanno bisogno di restare un po'
Solo un po' in silenzio
Stringimi piano a bassa voce
Non ho voglia di parlare
Sento che per comunicare
Ho voglia di restare un po' da solo
Senza quel mondo che mi lega
Mi trattiene e non da pace
Mi rivesto nel profumo
Di una strada calpestata
Cerco I fiori dell'inverno
In un'estate che ha bruciato tutto
Tutto intorno a me
Resto inutile
Ma se mi guardassi da lontano
Potresti dirmi cosa vedi
Allontanare I tuoi segreti
Ed aiutarmi a vivere da fuori
Considerando che non ho forza per amare
Ma solo per poterti dire
""non parlare, ascolta I suoni
E le espressioni del silenzio
Del silenzio insieme a me
Insieme a me""",Silenzio,2016

Giovanni Caccamo,"Ci sono posti eh non vivrò mai 
Ci sono cose che non so spiegare 
Oltre le stelle rimane un addio 
Amato figlio mio 
Parto sognano un futuro per te 

In questo viaggio che porta il tuo nome 
La mia speranza la dedico al mare 

Le tue mani verso me 
Mi fan segno di partire 
Le mie lacrime per te 
Sorridono 
Ti cercano 

La lontananza è soltanto un’idea 
Non c’è confine all’immaginazione 
Ti sento crescere dentro di me 
Vicino al mio cuore 

Le tue mani verso me 
Mi fan segno di partire 
Le mie lacrime per te

Vedrai che domani ritornerò

Giovanni Caccamo,"Non ho bisogno di tutto
Di tutto questo rumore
Di spiagge affollate
Di mani sudate
Illusioni e vittorire di giornate sprecate
A contare le auto passare in paese
Nei pomeriggi d'estate
No non ho bisogno di tutto
Di tutto questo dolore 
Di sacchi pieni di stelle
Di lacrime amare e non poter più giocare
Di parlare del meteo
Del telegiornale
Di vacanze 
E di me che non so più sperare
Io che non so più sorridere

Avremo bocche per poterci parlare
Per poterci insultare
Per capire e blaterare
Per fare l'amore
Per poterci sfiorare
Per poterci incontrare e salutare
Per mangiare e poter fare l'amore
Per farci perdonare anche il più grave degli errori

Del fumo e del vino
Dello sballo continuo
Di buttare un panino e non averti vicino

Della fine del mese e di me

Qualcosa di strano, qualcosa di eterno
Mi tiene la mano
E tutte le pagine di questa vita

In un mondo senza nebbia, in un mondo senza rabbia 
Chiusi dentro di noi, insieme io e te per sempre

Senza volere niente, a parte questo nostro naufragare e non cercare niente 
Più niente a parte noi 
E non capire niente, a parte che l’amore può salvare e non volere niente

Giovanni Caccamo,"È passato lentamente il tempo di lasciarsi andare 
Serve prendere coraggio ancora e tentare di ricominciare 
Due ricordi possono ferire o farci stare bene, bene un bene d'amare 
È finito piano sotto i tetti il pensiero per te 
Nessun segreto ne una strategia 
Nel mio volerti accanto 
I racconti a volta non per forza fanno una morale 
Ma un male d'amore 
Se potessi averti qui 
Non avrei più paura 
Di queste piccole incertezze 
Dei miei difetti di natura 
Ma sono qui da solo 
Che mi perdo nel ricordo di te 
Un ricordo che riflette il tuo volto e mi parla di te 
Conquistiamo l'inutilità di stare un po' in silenzio 
Le parole dette sottovoce durano nel tempo 
E sciolgono l'inverno 
I momenti che buttiamo al vento 
Sono una bestemmia 
In questo mondo che grida

Se potessi averti qui 
Non avrei più paura 
Di queste piccole incertezze 
Dei miei difetti di natura 
Ma sono qui da solo 
Che mi perdo nel ricordo di te 
Un ricordo che riflette il tuo volto e mi parla 
Di quante vibrazioni 
Ci attraversano costantemente 
Quante strade chiuse suggeriscono una soluzione 
Quante notti insonni 
Ho preso a schiaffi questa vita 
E il mio male d'amore 
il mio male d'amore 
È il mio bene per te 
È il mio bene per te 
Quante notti senza tempo

Puoi fidarti di me

Puoi fidarti di me

Né di sentirti un uomo piccolo piccolo così

E sai se mi hai capito d'ora in poi mi userai

Quasi figlie di un miracolo 
Come questa melodia 
Che canterò

Ma l’amore ha fatto crescere 
Questi fiori e questa casa 
Insieme a te 
Non ci sarà mai per noi 
Un’altra stanza vuota

Giovanni Caccamo,"Se partissimo domani 
Quante cose ci sarebbero da fare 
Banalmente farei spazio in questa stanza 
Tra le cose da portare 
Non potrei sicuramente tralasciare 

I momenti in cui mi osservi respirare 
L’odore di te al mio fianco 
Che riuscirei a distinguere nel sonno 
Tra le cose da portare 
Tra le cose da portare 
Porterei sicuramente un po’ di te 

Se partissimo domani 
Ci sarebbero le stelle a farci strada 
Questa luna ferma ad illuminare il mare 
Ci penserò più spesso 
Per quanto sembri complicato adesso 
Il passato è ancora vivo al tempo stesso 
Viviamo così in eterno 
Senza dare spazio a buchi neri e fantasia 
Tra le cose da portare 

Se partissimo domani 
Porterei un sorriso al tuo risveglio 
Un’abitudine un’identità 
Saremo parte dell’universo 
Di questo viaggio in eterno 

Ma forse non è tempo per andare 
Non ho più voglia di partire

Viviamo adesso e non scappiamo più

Perderemmo solamente un po’ di noi",Se partissimo domani,2018
Giovanni Hidalgo,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

I got no more tears in me left to flow
When I did my baby wrong
She left me lonely for so long
Now I'm out here all alone
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home

[Chorus: x 2]
Lord, won't you please...bring my baby home
Lord won't you please bring my baby home

It go one for the treble
Two for the bass
Used to mess with this girl
Way back in the day

She was from the pj's
And she went both ways
Yeah, the girl was a freak
I used to call her monique

And before I even speak
About knockin' the boots
I say her name been changed to avoid lawsuits
So now we gettin' down to the nitty of the gritty

She brought her friend around
And damn she was pretty
Betty was twisted
She said her number was listed

They grabbed my love two fisted
Hugged it and kissed it
They say one in the hand
Is worth two in the bush

But when shove came to push
Yo, I had my own theories
World series of love
It's two on one

'Til I got caught with the smokin' gun
His wife came home
And she bursted in
Now I'm lookin' for my heart

Like I'm made from tin
The road that I travel
Ain't got yellow bricks
My old woman jinxed

That all men are pricks
And she flipped the script
She's puttin' lip to lip
And every time I think about it I just lose my grip

'cause I've been up
And I've been down
And I've been fast
And I've been slow
And I've been square
And I've been round
And I've been high
And I've been low
And I've been cool
And I've been calm
And I've been kind
And I've been crass

I held the whole world right in my palm
I tried to spread it around
But it sure went fast

[Chorus]

Seven years sure have flown by
I got no more tears and they are left to cry
When I did my sugar bad
I lost the best thing I ever had
And now I'm out here on my own
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home

[Chorus: x 2]

Bring my baby home...",7 Years,1998

And all of y'all wearin' the same name brands
I hear everybody jackin' these played out jams
I won't reach for no gun, punk, I use my hands
I rock mikes and roll bikes, I cross foreign lands
I made my bones out in zones where twilight be
And every time I touch the mike it's Fright Night Part Three
For every emcee that wannaa test and try
In your custom made wears thinkin' you too fly
Make it up in gold chains what you're lackin' for brains
It's time to call your ma, duke, scoop up your remains
And finally lay to rest all the shit you stressed
Of boastin' and braggin' about the toes you taggin'
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door
While every rapper that's simmed is pimped like a whore
You see the talk is eighteen, three quarters past four
When your doctor slaps my ass, hear the lion roar
The record sales soared and the world got toured
You say what happened to my band, I say I just got bored
Now they call me Whitey Ford, and I praise the Lord
Find me breakin' up your crews, catch me singin' the blues
Strummin' and pickin' like I'm BB King
It's Abdul Rakim, now watch me do my thing

CHORUS
Down, down, you go
Down, down, so low
Down, down, till you hit the floor
Keep fallin' down, till you can't get down no more

You go point blank range with the scope he's knockin'
The Psycho might change but there ain't no stoppin'
The mmon's on the rise when the sun start droppin'
And y'all need to quit the bullshit that you be poppin'
'Cause I've been hip hoppin' since BDP
(???), it's Abdul Rakim
And when referring to me you must respect the name
Make a quick double take and double check your game
'Cause you about to get dissed, I'm checkin' my list
When I check it over twice it's like rollin' dice
I hit four, five, six, I'm all up in your mix
I rock good from Hollywood to the city of bricks
And all these fake cats scream they're keepin' it real
While you're makin' your deal we'll be breakin' the seal
You be breakin' your vows like people worshippin' cows
And then I hit ya with the who's, what's, where's and how's
Like Vinny Barbarino, Matt Pachino
I'm with my man Rino with the Brooklyn Lordz
Crashin' the boards with my soul in a hole
I take it back to the future from the days of old
I'm too cold to hold, too hot not to burn ya
Don't stick your nose in businessthat don't concern ya
Might have to trip and flip like I've Turner
You too old for schoolin', boy, when I'm gonna learn ya

CHORUS",Get Down,1998
Giovanni Maradi,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2004

But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well

Hey!
Ya sé que a ti te gusta presumir
Decir a los amigos que sin ti
Ya no puedo vivir

Hey!
No creas que te haces un favor
Cuando hablas a la gente de mi amor
Y te burlas de mí

Hey!
Que hay veces que es mejor querer así
Que ser querido y no poder sentir
Lo que siento por ti

Ya ves
Tú nunca me has querido ya lo ves
Que nunca he sido tuyo ya lo sé
Fue sólo por orgullo ese querer

Ya ves
De que te vale ahora presumir
Ahora que no estoy ya junto a ti
Que les dirás de mi

Hey!
Recuerdo que ganabas siempre tú
Que hacías de ese triunfo una virtud
Yo era sombra y tú luz

Hey!
No sé si tú también recordarás
Que siempre que intentaba hacer la paz
Yo era un río en tu mar

Ya ves
Tú nunca me has querido ya lo ves
Que nunca he sido tuyo ya lo sé
Fue sólo por orgullo ese querer

Ya ves
De que te vale ahora presumir
Ahora que no estoy ya junto a ti
Que les dirás de mí

Hey!
Ahora que ya todo terminó
Que como siempre soy el perdedor
Cuando pienses en mí

Hey!
No creas que te guardo algún rencor
Es siempre más feliz quien más amó
Y ese siempre fui yo

Ya ves
Tú nunca me has querido ya lo ves
Que nunca he sido tuyo ya lo sé
Fue sólo por orgullo ese querer

Ya ves
Tú nunca me has querido ya lo ves
Que nunca he sido tuyo ya lo sé

Un lugar donde nadie ha podido llegar
Donde el viento es amigo, la brisa un suspiro
Que abraza tu cuerpo, pequeña, al pasar

Quiero que tú me acompañes, mujer
Que mi canto amanezca dormido en tu piel
Y decirte al oído, sin miedo al olvido
Mis versos queridos, mis versos de ayer

Quiero perderme en tu cuerpo y anclar
En tu puerto mi barca vacía de amor
Escribir en la arena mi llanto y me pena
Dejar que las olas borren mi dolor

Quiero que tú me acompañes, mujer
Que compartas conmigo tu vida y después
Cuando el viento del otoño acaricie tu sien
Estar juntos y unidos iguales que ayer

Quiero enseñarte un camino en el mar
Un lugar donde nadie ha podido llegar
Donde el viento es amigo, la brisa un suspiro
Que abraza tu cuerpo, pequeña, al pasar

Quiero que tu me acompañes, mujer
Que mi canto amanezca dormido en tu piel

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

And there was even postage due

And then it had to be with you

Giovanni Ríos,"Cuando se acaba el amor
La vida pasa de largo
No tienes nada qué decir
Y te alimentas de pasado

Cuando se acaba el amor
Da lo mismo día o noche
Duermes a ráfagas y vas
Ciego, perdido, sin control
Y cuesta abajo

Te obsesiona recordar
Cosas inútiles
Y te apetecería odiar
Caminas solo como un loco
Siempre alerta, sin poder llorar

Y el futuro es como un tren
Que nunca para en la estación
Donde tú estás, tienes un tempano
De hielo, en el sitio del corazón

Cuando se acaba el amor
Hasta lo dulce sabe amargo
Echas de menos el ardor
Mojado de su cuerpo, desnudo

Cuando se acaba el amor
La casa se te cae encima
Buscas culpables
Y te vuelves tan violento
Como fuego y gasolina

Y te imaginas que ella está
Con otro ahora
Mientras tú fumas en el bar
Quieres ponerla contra el muro
Desnudarla y verla volar

Cuando se acaba el amor
Eres igual que un perro hambriento
Que vende el alma si le dan
Migajas de calor
Y un poco de aliento

Cuando se acaba el amor
Hasta lo dulce sabe amargo
Echas de menos el sabor
Mojado de su cuerpo, desnudo

Cuando se acaba el amor
La casa se te cae encima
Buscas culpables
Y te vuelves tan violento
Como fuego y gasolina

Now it's India, India, I get into ya, styles I got plenty 'a
I'm bout it bout it, you know my ones stay crowded
Fuck around and doubt it, and get that ass louded
The future me, 2003, ultra magnetic, this MC... (MCs, MCs, MCs freeze)
I'm not afraid of you niggas, I'm ready for the masses
I keep it tight like spandex do asses
Palmer's cocoa butter for the ashes, while Chanel laces up my lashes
Uh oh no, stop! It don't get hot because I locked it
Got it, give me 6 million like you gave Tupac it
Hot forever 'coz that's how I plotted

verse 2 (G. Salah)
I'm that are rated nigga from the films with mistique
With taste from the hamptoms but still street
Don't sleep I reach the ghetto to elite
Blessed with the vocals gifted with the feet
Pretty nigga, pearly white teethe
I can't for now 'coz my mind says from Asia
I'm unreachable, fuck a portable and pager
Made nigga, no time for posin', leavin' niggas like Moses
Front and get swollen The black italian G. Salah the chosen
I beat you down with love get you stuck frozen
'Coz I talk shit like caches, and I backs it
Can you match this my magic
Catcy like habits, digest and swallow

Belle Venezuela, rockin' Argentina
Hot like heaters, swift like cheeters
>From where I stand grass remains greener
(Let me tell you 'bout a girl, maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Brooklyn, and her shit is always cookin')
See I be flowin' yes constantly
That's why the cabbage that I stack is deep winter green
And the way that I be hittin', unlike any other sister, I get into your

I see ya poking outcha jeans girl you acting bad
Oh, do that again with you nasty ass

Now shorty got her at the wood shack, throwing her back

Catch me somewhere outta town signing autographs
Still working street corners, straight serving them blacks
Them thirty-two fifth it for four and a half

In the situation, no dentition, smelling good

Watch you say the grade is,
Burn like acid reflux, somebone'll order up the Pheffer chickens
While I order up a smoked duck (Thank You)

Rocked up, work on the block,
We keep it, chopped up in the spot, in the pot
Where we keep it, stocked up from the Frosty Flakes
To the chickens in the cake
If I drop it on the tool, it must be weight
Went with two and a quarter, came back with eight

Like it hot in the kitchen nigga, oven on bake

Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold

Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top
All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changing girlls everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I

Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
Eyes stay low from the cheifin' (cheifin')

I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say

Smile for me daddy
(What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill
(Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill

What it do baby
Its the ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from thirty pointers, VVS
The furniture my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But its what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

Smile for me daddy

Let me see ya grill

Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box

It's what it do, in the Lou'
Ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks
And the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em
On the top, on the bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold

Gipsy Kings,"Why does the gay little dicky bird sing?
What put the ""zing"" in a butterfly's wing?
What's the reason for the smile of a troubadour?
Why does a breeze have a barrel of fun?

It's all because they're free
And stringless, the same as me

I've got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret
Or make me frown

I had strings but now I'm free
There are no strings on me

Hi-o the merri-o
I'm as happy as can be
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me

I've got no strings so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
How I love my liberty

Cuando bailas tú
Meneando tu cintura
Como nadie lo haces tú

Es la reina de las moras
Y tengo el corazón parao
Si te veo por la noche
Yo me pongo enamorao

Llamando llega la noche
Y me pongo a soñar
A tus ojos y tu cara
Yo no quiero despertar

Y cuando llegará el alba
Solito solo estaré
Esperaba yo la noche

Gipsy Kings,"Saturday night and you`re still hangin` around
Tired of livin` in your one-horse town
Like to find a little hole in the ground
For a while

So you go to the village in your tie-dye jeans
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It`s just like some pornographic magazine
And you smile

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you`ll be smilin`

Your sister`s gone out. She`s on a date
You just sit at home and masturbate
The phone is gonna ring soon but you just can`t wait
For that call

So you stand on the corner in you New English clothes
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
But still your finger`s gonna pick your nose
After all

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push `n` you`ll be smilin`
La da da, Oh yeah, yeah

So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ah but there`s no place to go anyway
And what for...
You`ve got everything, but nothing`s cool
They`ve just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won`t be going back to school
Anymore...

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push `n` you`ll be smilin`
La da da, Oh yeah, yeah

So you play your albums and you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
Oh, but still you`re aching for the things you have not got
What went wrong...
And if you can`t understand why your world is so dead
And why you`ve got to keep in style and feed your head
Well, you`re twenty-one and still your mother makes your bed
And that`s too long...

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push `n` you`ll be smilin`
Yeah, Captain Jack will get you by tonight

Limpia el camino de paja

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed, I could breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Da, da, da

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
Now, I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
Now, I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
Make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway, breakaway, breakaway

Ever been accused of murder on Music Row

Girl Authority,"[Chorus:]
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up ev'rybody and sing

Ev'ryone can see we're together
As we walk on by
(Fly!) and we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie
(All!) all of the people around us they say
Can they be that close
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of the world's delights
(High!) high hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight
(We!) no we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong
This is our family jewel

Girl in a Coma,"There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes.
A kind of pale jewel
Open and closed
Within your eyes.
I'll place the sky
Within your eyes.

There's such a fooled heart
Beatin' so fast
In search of new dreams.
A love that will last
Within your heart.
I'll place the moon
Within your heart.

As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you.
Every thrill is gone.
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for you
As the world falls down.

I'm falling.
I'm falling
I'm falling in love.

I'll paint you mornings of gold.
I'll spin you Valentine evenings.
Though we're strangers 'til now,
We're choosing the path
Between the stars.
I'll leave my love
Between the stars.

As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you.
Every thrill is gone.
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for you
As the world falls down.

I'm falling.
I'm falling
I'm falling in love.
As the world falls down.

Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to fall
I'm falling in love
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to fall
I'm falling in love

Girl in a Coma,"Radio, live transmission.
Radio, live transmission.

Listen to the silence, let it ring on.
Eyes, dark grey lenses frightened of the sun.
We would have a fine time living in the night,
Left to blind destruction,
Waiting for our sight.

And we would go on as though nothing was wrong.
And hide from these days we remained all alone.
Staying in the same place, just staying out the time.
Touching from a distance,
Further all the time.

Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.

Well I could call out when the going gets tough.
The things that we've learnt are no longer enough.
No language, just sound, that's all we need know, to synchronise
Love to the beat of the show.
And we could dance.

Girl in a Coma,"I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you.

As you are about to sing
Mother's smiling as you cry
And then she says ""oh you, you live a dream""

Left turn, oh and a right there

Two, three, go

Striking the faces the pictures
You say ""oh I remember""
But then I don't cause I smile

Girl in a Coma,"There's something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I had got to beware

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
What's going down

What a field-day for the heat
A thousand people in the streets
Singing songs and they carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
What's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
You step out of line, the man come and take you away

We better stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Stop, now, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Now stop, now, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

My blood's not sweet enough for you
Reel me in hook line and sinker

Where's the strength in blowing it all to the wind

For all the sweat and tears

Nothing's gonna break us down
