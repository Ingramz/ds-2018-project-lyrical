Drake,"I'm at a, stage in my life where,
Where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything

Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor 'cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that Ace, bought a case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me

Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

And you know what I need from you when I get home
You better not be on the phone
Talking up a storm like you usually do
Talking up your friends like you usually do
Telling them I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time we been

Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor 'cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that Ace, bought a case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me

Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come buy the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely wanna
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting your makeup and your outfit but

Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

You doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
Doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You know
How we let it get like this I don't know
But that nigga can't save your soul, nah
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Haven't a nigga heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself
Ungrateful, ungrateful
Your momma be ashamed of you
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful
I'm too good for you, too good for you
You should go back to a perfect match for you, unstable
Doing me dirty (Dirty, dirty)
You're making me nervous
I haven't even heard from you
You look drained, you look exhausted
Girl them late nights ain't good for you
Really starting to show on you
Don't hit me up when it's good for you
Ungrateful",Diamonds Dancing,2015
Drake,"My dope in the bushes

I know how to cook it
My bitch good looking

My dope in the bushes, I know how to cook it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I did the digital dash
I fuck your bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I send that dope to your momma though
Out in the streets like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'mma kid of my word
A hustler the first to the first

These bitches be naggin the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed her my racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack on muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a six trey
Chevy, Mercedes I keep 'em comin'
Fuck all these bitches I keep em' comin'
I pull up right now I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You don't come around here 'cause it's dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, that's a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and that's confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that cock trip
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got big with my bag with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she lash on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom, we did it
I see how they countin' this out
Bet they ain't never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin, I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I bought up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga do you really mean it
When I was sleepin' on the floor you shoulda seen how they treat me
I pour the Actavis and pop pills so I can fight the demons

I did the digital dash
I fuck your bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I send that dope to your momma though
Out in the streets like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'mma kid of my word
A hustler the first to the first

These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
if you get hit you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again
I don’t let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again and again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I’m Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might could fit you in on a Wednesday
I’m not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that’s making triple
what I’m making, what an entrance
That's when you know it's a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil' Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas
that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I

I did the digital dash

Draped in all designer, draped in all designer

I got all exotic bitches you gon' think I'm racist
I just called a gang of bitches out of immigration
You gon' think we printing money cause the way we make it
I got all these fucking whips and ain't got no payments

Pink slips sitting in the dash fuck with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really

Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
I dropped a few whoopty whoops in my cup

Whole time I was ready
They was like ""hold up wait a minute"" I was like ""nah nigga let's get it""
This that OVO Halloween gang, you know how I'm rocking already
If you come here trying to take some there's a lot more where that came from
And it really ain't no thing, I got Summer P in this thing
I just drop the jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings
Ya, ya up and away
Y'all should have seen this shit coming in May
We doing 300 records a day
Who really think they can get in the way
Nah, nah, niggas is bitter they hurting
Look at the business mergers
Throwed back when I'm swerving
Big body my Suburban
Everything I do on purpose
I'm blowing up like I'm urgent
And she was acting like a virgin
I gave it to her then I curved her

Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel

That way you could be prepared, maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay

Always saw you for what you could have been
Ever since you met me like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like a Bentley I
Always saw you for what you could have been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now were meeting out end

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You're so predictable, I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm goin' through?
You can't even figure out what's going on with you 
You judged me before you met me, yeah, it figures
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing 'cause I'm living right
When I needed you you couldn't give me any advice
You always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving tomorrow like I'm working minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment

I'm noddin' off on a Xan niggas
Get pissed off, start airing it
Get a head start, I ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has beens
I don't features from nan them
I don't want features or nothing
You can't even get on my guest list
They wan't me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
The Activis high takin' don't matter
We sitting right on the court side
I know the players on both sides
I'm cashing out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bow tie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the poor guys
Black tint, low profile
Celebrating everyday
'Cause I'm really really fresh at the coke house
Counting up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out

I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You tried to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearing it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it

They got to go, they got to go
They gotta die out eventually

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently

Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell 'em if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?

Sacrificing things

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
""It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait""
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's twenty below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at twenty years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it

I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you

Drake,"One of them ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza 'cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, runnin' to store for Century's
And bring 'em back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin' at they first week numbers like ""what are those""
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender love and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with depression
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinium like wrappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to St Maarten
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about they bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sowed together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to back peddle
Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs, arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements

Always hug the row, fuck a Opp

I gave 'em back a clean plate
Same niggas preein', 'cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin' always duckin' my release date
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, “Are we straight?“
Two-faced nigga back around with the three face, damn
Ol' triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face
Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face
Y'all fucking hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up and scaring us
Y'all niggas is arrogant
Y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassing
Tell your big homie I'm all for going there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank Of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, east side, all that for my area

You know hun
I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone
That I'm hearing in your voice these days
I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from
And you have reason to question your anxieties
And how disillusioned you feel
As well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust
But that attitude will just hold you back in this life
And you're going to continue to feel alienated
Give some thought to this because I'm confident in you
And I know that you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals
Much more quickly without this confrontation
That I'm hearing in your tone these days

Ducked a lot spiteful moves

More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealy the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but she never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can’t describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Waking up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quite nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days
I leave for like three months and six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inbox have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge watching
Went from Club Palazzo in the 'Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showing up to a club unless we doing bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuing this
Distractions will do you in the truest sense
Especially people that wanna lecture me 
And frame it like they just want the best for me 
Or they check for me
Whatever splits it up 
So there's more for them and less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7 am in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always trying to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like taking my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
I swear I told you I'm in this bitch for entirety
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshiping
Done talk now, 'cause there{s other shit that's concerning me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Taking summer off 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me

Too late for condolences when it's over with

Why is my struggle different than others'?

As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet

All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah

Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wylie's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us
But like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solana show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence

Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it’s not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn’t
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it’s all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I’m talkin' to like it’s all-ages
I’ve seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it’s expected
Tell ‘em I don’t wanna link like a broken necklace

Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like Billie Jean but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time
And all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothing like the new times
Now it's rough times
I'm out here on front lines
Just trying to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breaking my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell them I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
Fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry about whose house you live at
Or who loves you more, or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Now, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now
Realize I got to think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that we all now got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some, uh, Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growing so fast
That they don't even really fit
But man, you know, I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hunnid more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cutting each other down

God willing, I got a good feeling
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this

I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underage
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain

What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time

Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?

Why'd it have to hurt so bad

She knows the world, is deceiving
Everything is wastin' her time

Drake Bell,"Wake up

It's time to get your things together

And drive away

Breathe out

You feel today it treats you better

That's what they say


Another day

Gone without a sound

But it's okay

If you turn around

And feel the memories bringin' you down



And in the end

Are you stronger

Do you no longer

Need to recover

And where have you been

Since it's been over

Over my shoulder

Under my skin

Will you ever return again...


Wake up

The monsters in your head have left you

all to your self

It's alright the

fuggly little things around you of how it felt


Another day

No one tells you what it means

what's in your way

poison in your dreams

the darkest place that you've ever been


And in the end

Are you stronger

Do you no longer

Need to recover

And where have you been

Since it's been over

Over my shoulder

Under my skin

Will you ever return again...


[ guitar lick ]


And in the end

Are you stronger

Do you no longer

Need to recover

And where have you been

Since it's been over

Over my shoulder

Under my skin

Will you ever return again...

Can I make love to you tonight 
Sweetheart 
I will do you right 
I can make you feel so good 
I'm in the mood to make love tonight",Intro,2005
Drake Bell,"She stares at the moon 
Her ribbons out of tune 
Memories of the past 
At the bottom of her glass 
And resting on her cheek 
The imprint of his ring 
A symbol of the weak 
Commissioned by the king 
Did he tie you down? 
Did you make a sound? 

[Chorus]
She falls to her knees 
Screaming God please 
Make something of me 
Cause I never wanted anything like what I wanna be right now 
An angel again 
An angel again somehow 

She remembers his old boots 
And the shotgun that he shoots 
And all she could take 
Lies at the bottom of a lake 
So lift your cig and drag 
As you figure out a plan 
To hide it all away 
How could she ever love this man 
Did you weigh him down? 
Did he make a sound? 

[Chorus]

And when you carry weight in your life (life) 
And all the plans you make in your life (life) 
The original decision was right 

[Chorus]

Did he tie you down? 
Did you make a sound? 
Did he weigh you down? 
Did he make a sound?

Drala,"Your letter came yesterday
Your, flying home for Christmas
Could you stop to see me smile

I sat down to remember
All the pain we shared
But I drifted to times not so hard

Oh I see you in the corner of
Life's grand ballroom
And I tremble to see you again

Let's all go home again
Find where we have been
Time is never understood
I see you holding me
Please don't let me be
Tonight just may be our last

The bell rings to tell me
You're here now
And I wonder if your eyes glow and sparkle in the night

And I can't believe you look this way
Like a doll in satin
On a birthday afternoon

Hold me tightly
Like never before
You've come to say your alive

Let's all go home again
Find where we have been
Time is never understood
I see you holding me
Please don't let me be
Tonight just may be our last

The sun arrives
You wake and peek outside
Touch my hand and walk right away
I hear you close the door
I don't feel joy anymore
And my heart is racing to who knows where

And I say it's our last night
And clutch my soul so tight
But I'll let go to have you again

Let's all go home again
Find where we have been
Time is never understood
I see you holding me
Please don't let me be
Tonight just may be our last

Now, this song is dedicated to the one with the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef with you-know-who
Fuck it, he just let em kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had our niggas sitting on top their roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush

I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)

Why wasn't they able to control this?

And fat shout, to all the rappers that helped out

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Y'all might know him as George Bush
But where I'm from, 
Lost city of New Orleans, we call him this

(Georgia)

Now
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard the explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965, I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson but now
But it's president (Georgia) Bush

[Repeat: x2]
We from a town where (Georgia)
Everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby I'm still praying which ya
Everybody crying but (Georgia)
Ain't nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush

Now
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the white house hating, trying to wash away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cause if a nigga still moving then he holding it down
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tch-es
I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yea!

We from a town where (Georgia)
Everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby I'm still praying which ya
Everybody crying but (Georgia)
Ain't nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush

(oh yea, you thought we was done? Naw)

YEA!

Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich
Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist YES
Yep, I'm a motherfucking trip
I'ma trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit
Nine hundred to a grand, get you twenty eight grams
If you talking 'bout bricks, I'm the interstate man
And the women say damn, them niggas don't say a damn thing
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed-spring
Walking a thin line, gotta defend mine
And wit no pen I'm sorta like a bomb BOOM
Young toon, yea that's what my people call me
Fifty thousand for the cross, trying to keep the reaper off me
I drink a lot of syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walking
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yea
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be the target
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game no arguing (arguing)

And I don't even write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin
Lil Wayne dot com bitch log in
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga balling
Mike Jordan, pardon my swaggy
Even my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said fuck it bought two houses in Miami
I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me
Any rapper wan get at me, tell ya label contact me
Half four hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of miss cita
My dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Notta sip seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving, couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfucking ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still living
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hos
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos
Price sizing for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve
If anybody else want it, sixty thousand a verse

Drama,"I Mr. Thanksgiving
Its for the money this time

Howdy do motherfuckers its Weezy Baby,
Niggas bitchin' and I gotta toke the cannon.
Listen close I got duct tape and rope,
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'bannons.
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy,
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me.
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin',
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach.
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit,
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet.
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg,
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um.
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it,
Bet that baby.
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes.
Get back get back boy this a set back,
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap.
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone,
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones.
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on,
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on.
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush,
And when it comes to that paper I stack books.
You heard what I said,
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head.
Life ain't cheap,
You're better off dead.
If you can't pay the fee,
Shout out my nigga fee.
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key,
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see.
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea.
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man,
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again.

[Chorus]
Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for ya,
Nigga talk to the (cannon)
Have a few words with the (cannon)
Tell it to my mother fuckin' (cannon)
Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for ya,
Nigga talk to the (cannon)
Have a few words with the (cannon)
Tell it to my mother fuckin' (cannon)

Ayo
I make it hard for rap niggas I'm peer pressure,
Matter fact I'm motivation to rap better.
I show niggas how to act how to dress better,
I stay fresh more fitted caps than bat catchers.
I'm the crack 
The smack 
The gun 
The rule 
The gat 
The strap 
The gun 
The tool 
The motherfuckin' (cannon).
Other words I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill,
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill,
The deal is sealed.
Niggas ain't real as Will cause I'm a (cannon).
And I handle well pedal like Cannondale.
And I got the fifty cal mag its a hand-held.
I'm tellin' you niggas I pop put a shell in you niggas,
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas.
I got whores in the cannon camcorder bendin' over
Blowin' game by the quarter weed over in the Rover nigga

From Philly to where I'm landin I'm a cannon.
And I'm on that Philly fire shit,
Then I come fully equipped.
You try me get bodied keep the shawty in the whip.
If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him.
Sing a long da da da di I'm free got the butters 
Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada.
Homie know I'm inside of your house,
Tie up your brother.
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you.
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'.
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will.
Roll over ya squad like I'm a one punch card.
You chumps, you best call General Motors.
I will, take control of your soldiers.
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken.

Niggas knowin'.. now they hoin'.. to me for offers
I can't holla.. don't have no powder.. until tomorrow

But I got a.. couple of dollars.. that you can borrow
Nigga, go
You're 'round my door.. you're drawin' heat
You can go.. but on this porch you destroyin' me

Have your bitch next to me in a Corvette
Or ridin' on tha back of my motorbike
Around tha second line stun'n with tha loud pipes (vroom vroom)

Been in the game since Brand Nubian was spittin', reign of the tec'
I done spit lyrics for DJ Jam Master Jay and Kid Capri
Now it's DJ Drama, now you all on the dick lil' mama?
Where the fuck was you at when a nigga was on the block? (where you at?)
When the nigga was drivin' dirty Nike's with no knot (where you at?)
Before the Billboard number one spot
It was so hard to get a bitch to get down and suck on a cock
Before rockin' the Bentley and I got so popular
Thuggin' with the G.D.'s you wouldn't see me even with binoculars
Steady actin' like you ain't been ran through
Never gave a nigga no pussy now you sweatin' and talkin' 'bout you a fan too
Before the Vin houses and the trucks and Impalas
Tell me where was you at when the nigga needed a couple of dollars
I remember her off the block, now I can't fuck with lil' mama

Low like a turtle, my queen mad fertile
Run a marathon, same time, jumpin' hurdles
Put a broad on a plane, brick in her girdle
Why I'm still here, got my life in gear
Fuckin' a rich white bitch like Britney Spears
Runnin' in her hard like a car hit a deer
Live life no fear, boxed in like a square
Two Coronas with lime, sip my beer
My vision's so clear from the front to the rear
That's why I'm reclined in a La-Z-Boy chair
Can't see me like I'm air, but I'm there

It's a blessin' to be still in the game
Considerin' where I came from the music changed
Some would continue to hang
I'm, right where I oughta be
Whatever obstacle in the way, won't let it bother me
Grindin' since the early teens in my dirty jeans
Now I'm on the scene fulfillin' my worldly dreams
So get yours, I'll get mine in due time
We'll be able to survive some lunatic rhymes
But nowadays you gotta find different ways
To keep your pockets on fat, who got it? Where it's at?
Shit, you gotta go get it
The road you gotta hit it, the show money's splitted
Yeah, and if everybody wit it we can make somethin' happen
With the push of these buttons and some cut-cuttin' and scratchin'

He said, the court room or the casket,
I'm like dude, either way you need cash and a nice suit,
The street lights where I found my strength
Be with four rich men, and you bound to be the fifth

Tryna get outta these street lights, so I won't have to live this street life,

No more, no more 
No more, no more no

Just gotta learn to deal with problems,
If you're young and from slum with no father,
Got killed when you was little, still got mama,
She try to tell him go to school, but why bother
When gettin' paid is the only way to solve 'em
Seems the stars get farther and farther
Out of my reach, out of these streets,
Will they ever make it big

I'd give up everything just to have him here,
After this storm and rain I have no fear,
Gotta keep holdin on, hold my head up strong,
I know it won't be long until we'll be together again, foreal

I'm livin' for the moment
If I could turn back the days
Sure, you could turn this back
Hey, I was born with the hustle, never been a sucker
Daddy wasn't in the crib, dat made me tougher
Momma struggled with the bills, dat made me stuff up
Powder in a sack, which made me dumber
Now I'm standin' on the corner, bag full of Marijuana, Crack
Pistol my pocket for anybody who disrespect
In the trap chillin' where robbers and killers, kick it at
My arms up in the feds for ten, they say I'm goin' in
Ha, bet dat I'm a stretch that, backish to this rappers
Show these niggas what I'm best at
Get a lil' check, flip it and invest that
Years later, oh now you see what my heads at
Like meals chasers, we be everywhere the bread at
You keep on hatin', you'll be layin' where the dead at
You rappers suckers, you can tell them that I said that
If nothin' else but the hustle, you gon respect that

You know, make it rain when you can make it thunderstorm""
I'm like, ""Why?
The world needs sun
The hood needs funds
There's a war going on and half the battle is guns""
How dare I throw it on the floor
When people are poor
So I write like Edgar Allen to restore, got a cord
Umbilical attached to a place that can't afford
No landscaping, or window draping
This old lady told me
If I ain't got nothin' good, say nothing
That's why I don't talk much
I swear it don't cost much, to pay attention to me
I tell like it is, and I tell it how it could be
The hood be
Requesting my services, oh don't get nervous it's
Step yo game up time, these ain't them same old rhymes
Designed to have you dancin' in some club
Niggas ride to me

Exfoliating with hey pom poms
Yellin' go 3000!

Sit down, heard you need some plumbing
Done in
I'm in
A swell mood
A rather swole mood
Until she told me that she told dude
That she'll be back, she's going to the store
I didn't know she had a boyfriend, so the door
I pointed her to
I said, ""Call me when y'all break up
I don't fuck nobody bitch
And never own a Jacob, know what time it is""
Nigga just tryin' to live
Like a nigga supposed to live
If I still drink that malt liquor
I pour the beer
On the ground for niggas not around
I started off starvin'

Cupcake her, I didn't bother
She's a follower, a hell of a swallower
Not a leader
Got her 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th string
I didn't need her
I didn't mean to treat her
Like she was the main feature
Presentation, heard ya's a traitor
To the situation, more like a hassle
Because she had no keys to the castle

Taking shots to the neck

Takes everything you've got.
Taking a break from all your worries,
Sure would help alot.

Wouldn't you like to get away?

All those nights when you've got no lights,
The check is in the mail;
And your little angel
Hung the cat up by its tail;
And your third fiance didn't show;

Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came;
You want to be where you can see,
Our troubles are all the same; 
You want to be where everybody knows your name.

Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead; 
The morning's looking bright; 
And your shrink ran off to Europe, 
And didn't even write; 
And your husband wants to be a girl; 

Be glad there's one place in the world 
Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came; 
You want to go where people know, 
People are all the same; 
You want to go where everybody knows your name. 

Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came; 
Where everybody knows your name,

Niggaz try to jack you and loose my coop is by the kennel wheels
Mother fucker wanna take my style
'Cause niggaz out here know I'm only fuckin' with the bonnet grills

And the haters wanna see me fall
How can I let y'all niggaz play me
Shited on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin' 8 Ball & MJG

Twista bitch and I from the shy
With my Memphis connect and I ain't going' lie
We be specializing in and up coming with dope shit
And pulling up in cool whips that's fly
Still drink, still blow, then I creep through the hood real slow
While I bump kamikaze shit, while I scream look at my grill hoe

Wood grain, wheel grippin', Cinderella sippin'
I like my jewelry golden like a piece of fried chicken

Money players is demon like I'm willy beamin'
Like a bitch that practice suckin' dick and drinkin' semen
She sceamin', dreamin', wishin' she can be my number one
Forever young, mama I just wanna' to have some fun

Don't try to ever take my cash from me
You mine as well, jump of a cliff you fuckin' crash dummy
Like that's my last money
This for my niggaz who be bussin' back to perpetrators
We don't discriminate, we'll hurt now hurt you later

But I ain't worried, I smoke one on you fuckin' haters
And I'm hiddin' gators on the refrigerator

And I got nineteen more stashed.
Two hundred and eight G's at eight hundred times nineteen more, 
Come out to 5-4-7 comma 2-0-0
That's 547 G's and two hundred
Forty seven G's you can ball 200 get blunted
The other 500 G's invest it in keys

Verse 1:
First the Fat Boyz break up
Now everyday I wake up
Somebody done call it quits
Shit I thought Bobby and Witney stay together forever if they made it that long
I guess the drugs weren?t that strong
And now its Russell and Kamora even Jordan and Wanita
And to top it off Brad left Jen for Angelina
What the hell is going on in this World?
This just can?t be!
If Will and Jada can do it then why can?t we?
Hillary is still with Bill Clinton,
How did they do it
He got his dick sucked and the whole damn world knew it! 
Now Paul McCartney losing half of his life
All because he got divorced from his wife
Somebody said its cheaper to keep her 
But not in K-Fed's case (nope!)
Cause Britney even had to pay for K-Fed's case (Cha-Ching!)
Nick and Jessica, Trina and Wayne
And if you broke up wit your girl
I know you feelin da pain because?

Diamond with Crime Mob
Lauren hill with the Fugees
Remy with Terror Squad
Lil? Kill ?em back with C?s
Snoop with Mo-Dray
Dray With Mo-Big Boys
CD?s with Mo-Plays
Drives with no press
Salt with no pepper
Even the Eagles broke up and got the fuck back together
Selling millions of copies
And getting mad cash
And Raz be said Chris Stoke was getting that ass
I don?t even understand it
What the hell went wrong?
Maybe folks will wise up and take heed to this song because

The first Wu-Tang broke up
Now Oldie be is gone
Now I?m hearing Cameron don?t talk to Jim Jones
Who saw that S*** coming

We ride like Desperado on the spokes goldened out
Keep cheese in the pockets
And keep our distance from cop blockers
AK on the front seat for any drama I may meet
My pager off killing hos, providing them Bs and Vogues
Clientelle getting bigger while calculating money figures
More realer than Rockafeller, more cheese than Donald Trump
Niggas - they hear me, they want to kill me like JFK
Why?  'Cause I ride tight, on out of sight
It might be the hos, or could it be that I ride on Vogues?

Want to rush me, then bust me, then leave me fucked in the game

I never use the phone at home cause it might be tapped
And that's the first mistake to get a nigga ass wrapped
Door kicked in house tossed up but that's just how they do it
want to catch a nigga slipping and try to put it to em

Takes everything you've got.
Taking a break from all your worries,
Sure would help alot.

Wouldn't you like to get away?

All those nights when you've got no lights,
The check is in the mail;
And your little angel
Hung the cat up by its tail;
And your third fiance didn't show;

Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came;
You want to be where you can see,
Our troubles are all the same; 
You want to be where everybody knows your name.

Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead; 
The morning's looking bright; 
And your shrink ran off to Europe, 
And didn't even write; 
And your husband wants to be a girl; 

Be glad there's one place in the world 
Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came; 
You want to go where people know,

I ain't mad at ya at all (damn)
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up rahrah?

Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin' outlaw
That's right nigga, hahaha, housin' these hoes, you feel me?
Aight, kno'what I'm sayin'?
You got to do that shit, keepin' it real nigga or what?
Keepin' it real!
How old are you nigga?
I'm eleven

'Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
Preoccupied with homicide, tryin' to survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require may be closed casket
Who can you blame? it's insane what we dare do
Witness an evil that these men do, bitches in, too
In fact they be the reasons niggas get to bleedin'
Pull the fuckin' fire when I leave em, you shoulda seen em
Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of
And snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin' motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a

Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (they came in to sin)
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (dear God, I wonder could you save me?)

Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Excercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? heaven or hell? freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? and if we fail?
High speeds, and thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? uh
Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive 
By making motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryin' to hover over niggas til we drop
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a lie
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May god forgive me, I was high, label me a

Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (they came in to sin)
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (dear god, I wonder could you save me?)

Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggas lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggas bodies put to rest
So I just.. swallow my beck's and holla, ""fuck em!""
And if I'm next.. just let a nigga step with somethin'
I ain't fearin' nohtin'

Young and thuggin, prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggas can't get the best of me
(Hold me down) definitely no need for askin'
(Now he mad) top speed (smokin' weed) blasted (biotch!)

'Cause when I bust em they gonna shiver, the killers cry
Soldiers got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?
Talkin' bout prayin' they need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggas sprayin' up my block, tryin' to take my wealth

Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (they came in to sin)
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (dear god, I wonder could you save me?)

Punk police, niggas run the streets
Ha ha, it ain't nothin' but music
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin real strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
But all I see is motherfuckers actin less than g's
Stop bein' a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
'Cause you know these streets is real deal
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket

Thug's Passion, baby
Y'all know what time it is
This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, you know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols, alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this Thug Passion, baby

I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier
I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent
Tripping over dead presidents
They got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business
Trying to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinking
Drinking over a felony
And hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out
But they ain't feeling me
A motherfucking fool, about
My fucking cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine
Thugging, hugging plenty of G's
And laughing while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watching
Just keep it plain
And I'mma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can pinkle with the rain twinkling
Diamonds and things go blinking
Enough to hold me, til I'm old and wrinkling
And these adversaries
They gonna have to be worrying
'Cause I'mma be illing, fulfilling my passion
Til I'm burying my Thug Passion

Now what if me
Turn this Hennessey into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly
Switch and how it supposed to be and dirty money
Can't be evil 'cause it's filling up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twisting riches but there is only one way to make more
So I'm standing on the corner
Trying to hustle in the snow and my bigger bro
Couldn't know, but buy a .44, blasting at playa haters wanting more
With a Thug Passion

Putting down mashin'
Control by this Thug's Passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blasting
I'm asking what happened
To the niggas who kept it real
Like they claim to
That's when I bang, do, see thang true
Travelling this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can easily stated
It's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
To be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit

Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

Creep with me
Through that immortal flow
Thug Passion got you trembling, like Death on the Row
Make your move
So I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowing up the scene
Like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a dub to get you flowing
And let that loc see smoke
Feeling the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
Oh whoa

They say money don't make the man
But damn, I'm making money
Observing you motherfuckers
'Cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshitting
Licking them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Sipping on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winking at me
She smiles, a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlasting
""How does it feel?"" what I'm asking
While I'm rubbing on that ass
""Why you laughing?""
See, I'm digging as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious
Baby, get a grip
When I be doing this
It's so physical
My attraction driven by alcohol
Beware of my reaction
Baby I'm born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said, so
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blasting, bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

And I am much happier this way

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because number on was the girl friend from Paris
The things that they did - ah - they didn't have to ask us
And then the Welshman from India, who came here to stay 

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things she did in the streets
In the alleys and bars, no she couldn't be beat
That miserable rotten slut couldn't turn anyone away

I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
But my heart is overflowin' anyway
I'm just a tired man, no words to say
But since she lost her daughter
It's her eyes that fill with water

Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be da target
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game no arguing
And I don't ever write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin
Lil Wayne dot com bitch log in
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga balling
Mike Jordan, pardon my swaggie
But my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said fuck it bought two houses in Miami
I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me
Any rapper wan get at me, tell ya label contact me
Dats a hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of miss cita
Mom dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even
There's a 305 diamond I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Notta sim seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving, couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that muthafuckin ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still living
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mommy I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos
Price sizing for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve
If anybody else want it, sixty thousand a verse yea",Outro,2007

In everyone there's a sense of purpose
That's right so Babylon don't you try to control us

Africans who we are, every nigga is a star
Well, the top is where I'm headin far
Pretty chicks and fancy cars, and a nigga into Mars
Drink champagne, dem yam too much caviar

Drown them fools and now we make dem bizarres
Stole the cookie from the jar but you never took him far
Well, him and Killah Priest gon' never spar

We live in poverty due to prophecy from our ancestors
We all transgressors, uh Moses let us
Now cops arrest us, until the jake, job bless us
Left false scriptures to protect us

Rightful ears, the Solomon's sceptors
True Isrealians, Rastafarians
We handle beef like vegetarians, we very sinned
My players sip Dacari's, we live the life of Judas Maccabee

Black fatigues with our hair raggety!
We all Supastars even without +CREAM+ and cars

Know why? Street tycoon up before high noon
Followed by the spot, zoom lens, ghetto peepers singin my tune
They say I'ma die soon, livin without time, sketchin my outline
(It's a hitman!) Too late to make a speedy recovery

Lovely, with shots that done smmothered me and covered me
Choppers above of me, what a startling discovery
Our own brother be the one with the killer instinct
Just because I'm a so-called star

[Chorus]

Well, I just wanna be myself, I don't need nobody else
Working for long life, and good health
No what's about the wealth, see that's the way I felt
I'm okay, confide in God, will help

Tried to put me on the shelf 'cause I'm so excellent
Damn you nowhere with no persistence
You don't want no selfish thing, don't have no confidence
Well, you don't have to be a star to be yourself

And my golden rainbow dawns
In the proceeding moments just revolve, I lose myself""

Is this a dream or reality, how do we tell the difference
Every day seemed like Christmas, now it's Halloween
Galleries with blank canvas, gallivant ran
Through the valley for a Salary that grants me
Successful in this majestic culture
Survive if you're high like the nest of a vulture
Pauly Poltergeist, a voltage of lighting
Not scared to strike twice like assaultings from bikies
I'm hiking with a viking mind state
Hunt to feed his family, the life of a primate
I'm just a tired ape, lie awake late
No sleep when ya life's fate decided on a break
Is this a nightmare? Pinch my hand and breathe
Feel like I'm getting lynched by my girl's family
I gotta dream and it might seem thin
But I couldn't breathe without it, it's my Siamese twin

I sleep no more, dream with eyes open
No more pills and no more potion
No more being woken up
By the explosion when the commotion errupts
I sleep no more, dream with eyes open
No more pills and no more potion
No more being woken up
By the man dumping his shit, unloading his truck
I sleep no more

Absence of occupation isn't rest
[?] a mind vacant is another mind of distress
[?] no rest for the wicked, yeah we could just kick it
Or we could fucken stick it to the man
Is this life, I'm watching bum's rifle threw rubbish
Malnourished, another vicious growl from their stomachs
How rubbish, another vicious row with the government
Rummage through our cans and the council ain't loving it
Nothing under this sun done change
Monday to Sunday, life's mundane
In one day Mundine took down Green
In one day a stingray took our Steve
Proven even our hero's are human
Proven some come dumber than Sam Newman
Ya loose, ya win, loose again
Is this life the booze or hallucinogen
So I move with the wind like willow
But sin like bellow, my head hits the pillow
And I'm gone, out for the count like Drak
Bounce and I'm out like that, do ya feel me
Yeah is this a dream
Jump from a bridge, will I hit the street or wake up
It just seems
That I'm wasting my time praying for something greater
Yeah is this a dream
Will I be the man that I wanted to be as a kid
It's not how it seems
Don't wanna be remembered as another man that lived

I sleep no more, dream with eyes open
No more pills and no more potion
No more being woken up
By the explosion when the commotion errupts
I sleep no more, dream with eyes open
No more pills and no more potion
No more being woken up
By the man dumping his shit, unloading his truck
I sleep no more

Rest is excellent but bordom is his brother
Death his cousin, age is his mother
Cover your eyes, go to sleep sweet heart
But when you wake you might find the grim reaper
Standing at the end of your bed demanding to be fed
Your soul sucked from that hole in ya head
Not even Ned Kelly's armour could save ya
The arm of the saviour lay ya to rest, so save ya breath
To say your prayers even Satan says
Realities a very sad state of affairs
So beware of the screaming hyenas
And only sleep seperates the dreams from the dreamers

I sleep no more, dream with eyes open
No more pills and no more potion
No more being woken up

Was a comedy camera hired up in on this nightmare
Nah I wish it was a nightmare
Then a least I'd be asleep in my bed
My eyes bright red, feel like death by bed
Weighed down cause my heads like lead
Like ned kelly belly up, nothing stops me getting up
From weed paraphernalia or taking valium, I tried it
Every herbal remedy diet, from reading to writing
Nothing makes me tired

The only one awake playing the waiting game
I'm facing the sun in an hour

Every beat in my head starts to paralyze
Fahrenheit rising, feeding the parasites
Like a satellite analyze the world cause I'm up again
Antagonize by every gust of wind
Must have been a comatose in my last life
Now I lie awake like puffin on a glass pipe

Can only scream like a werewolf howling
Hope I'm powered by moonlight soon might

Too right yeah sucks to me friend

Deep breathing I plead for a little sleep
I pass fatigue now I questioning my beliefs
I can't believe it

Drapht,"Let’s take it back to 1982 just quickly
I came into this world, and my Ma thought
Ima name this little boy Paul
Plain old boring old Paul
And I always thought
If I had a different name, would my life be different?
Like

Imagine if I had a name like Jimmy Recard
Evolved from the joke of a com’
The king of the cards
King of the castle
King of the barstool
Liked by all known but he thinks he’s an arsehole
Pass the parcel to Jimmy
Everybody pass quicker then getting off with a glass of kill Kenny
If anything, Jimmy’s a man of the millennium
No two men can better him, not even
Lenny and Carl
I put a penny in the jar
Coz I swear he's rare as seeing henny in yah mini bar
Face at the cinema
Like Andy Garcia
But compared to Jimmy, Andy’s so last year!
Brassieres, are thrown at his feet
Ladies love him ‘cos he’s got a little dimple in his cheek
(Bleurgh, yeah yeah yeah) Making me sick to my stomach
And there’s nothing you can do
You gotta love him (You gotta love him!)
It's

J.R., Jimmy Recard!
Raise your glass for the king of the bar
It’s J.R., Jimmy Recard!
Women swinging their bras, ladies swinging their bra
For J.R., Jimmy Recard!
All my people singing hoorah hoorah
For J.R., come and get down with J.R.

He was always in the right place at the right time
Had a lifeline
Wiser than 95% of the sci-fi
Four doors and his collar popped down like they should be
Living off laughter like Lano and Woodley
And it could be ‘cos he had the world in his palm
Every week a different girl on his arm
His mum a doctor, dad a rockstar
Concoct a little something, nine months, who popped out?

J.R., Jimmy Recard!
Raise your glass for the king of the bar
It’s J.R., Jimmy Recard!

For J.R., come and get down with J.R.

The J, the I, the M, the M, the Y, the J, the I, the M
It’s Jimmy! It’s Jimmy!
The J, Jimmy, no matter what
The I, Jimmy, no matter what
The M, Jimmy, no matter what
It’s Jimmy!

Yeah, check
It’s like everything he touches
Turns to gold, it’s amazing
Destiny on his side like Jay-Z pushing up daisies
A breath of fresh air, the best there is
Like getting in the electric chair and live
Untouchable
He never perish
Reason my life is full
He was the fairest of them all
Like mirror mirror on the wall
Like Wirrpanda on the ball
Mum comes up with Paul
When there’s names like Jimmy
Any plan or gimmick
Every man will mimic
Jimmy
Open up my doors in the chimney
That’s why he’s always fucking swimming in his winnings
The names ringing in your ears man isn’t it?
Living in jealousy like a prisoner to visitors
He was oblivious
A sunshine day and night
Would my luck change if I was given a name like

Walked every day
Every night
Never found the light

Finally see you making tracks
Make one wrong move bruz
See you taken back to square one

That you switched your position until you go and check the dice
And the second time over isn't easier
No one will believe in you
And all your friends are leaving you
And growing up
Moving on
Know enough when you were wrong
People might remember to call you and ask you how your goin'
And no one gives that theres no existing love for you
Maybe you'll believe in yourself
And you'll start loving too
Knowing this is the key to the treasure chest

The last place you look that you'll never guess

Seem to turn to stone

Cutting quicker than Darth Vadar did to his own son
Run with hunger like goldilocks holding the rock
And me and rap we rap together like Holden and Brock, what?

Vinyl forces out all the memories you swallowed in
Riders of the storm given life to Jim Morrison

A common law bumping Mortar Graphic Tomahawk
If a graffers bombing or running from an under cover's Commodore

Drapht,"Rest in peace to the innocent children who were shot in the back
Running from the military, Junta hot on their tracks
For the love that why their uncle packs a bomb in their bags
What the fuck, you'd do the same with no options in hand
So stop with the wack raps you illiterate stale
Horse shit, you just a piss in the gale force winds
Battling me like I have to start busting for you
I'm like a suspect package, I got nothing to prove
Fuck it, I'll serve you straight from the kitchen
And kill your fly shit like Norman Bates with a pigeon
Listen. I'm deaf and blind to your fallacy war
Like a land mine child victim all bandaged and sore
Damage and break you down until your spirit is vanquished
Like traditional ownership does to indigenous factions
It's more than just black and white, like racism
Cause the face of hate appears when you face the mirror
This more than people starving to eat
Cause food for thought is running short in this marketed scene
It's hard to believe when you feel like smashing the mirror
But Charlie Chimp will pick you up like an angry gorilla

Yeah I'm back in that pattern
I sit up late with a spliff and wait for the magic to happen
Just for rapping wack you're catchin a slappin
I'll put you under pressure like a pilot with cracks in his cabin
Have another shot, see if you can take this spot
I'm a play strategically and take everything you got
Ciecmate! Game over, now you know the deal
Here with my bro's and we're pro's in our chosen fields
Standing tall like a wall to wall, public letter blockbuster
Got a lust for life, plus a lot of love for those I trust with my life
I'm a live my life like I like on any given night and anything else isn't right
Time's ticking by, time's making changes, time's turning friends into strangers
I'm trying to find what the aim is, but time's limited
I've gotta make payments and for everyone, everyday it's the same shit
Big brother wants us all to put it in a statement
But it's built on lies like the Bush administration
The media be feeding ya and we just believe it huh?
Behind the curtain men are getting greedier
We need to peel the curtain back and hurt em bad
And then spread the wealth around to all those who've been getting held down
Can I get some help now? Or can I get a hell yeah?
I'm saying this for everybody's welfare

""Now, may these MC's rest in peace""
""Rest in peace""
[Big Daddy Kane:] ""may these MC's rest in peace
Because when I come to town, the population decrease""

Rest in peace, two thousand and six shit changes quickly
Def to all man so I'm trained in lip read
Pick me like a gypsy picking a pocket
Depict me like David Hicks holding that rocket
A mix breed of Scottish and a modern day Australia's
Home but Mundine treats us like an alien, no
Man fuck that
Singing Waltzing Matilda with my rucksack
Cut back on the ego, leave rap to the albino
Rip you quicker than teeth wrapped around a T-bone
See know evil speech insightful
Solid gold heat like Hussein's rifle
I'm spiteful, only loyal if it's like that
Starve man's best friend, he's gonna bite back
What, it's just the way that it is
Dig your grave like letting Michael J. play with your kids
I can't live in this world full of rock heads
Finding a good one like finding the Loch Ness
Monster, and not Kody Scott
But down for my team and known what I got
When it's my shot, take it never look back
Or ever make it, dedicated to my fate a known gladiator
Yeah your favourite, I run with wind
Pauly Poltergeist and the Brothers Grimm, yeah you know me

Rest in peace bottom feeders, the scourge of the earth
Proof God doesn't need us, from fetus to birth
First. my mums didn't plan me, so meet plan b
The worker bee, Ron Burgendy where the pants be
Quite a big deal, 90 something kilo
Aim for the best but got Shaq at the free throw
Overweight. Shit I can't hold a job but I can hold a steak
Wash it down with a bunch of brown bottles
Plutonic made it for snake charmers
The bass bang harder than face planting in chain armour
Heavy metal, hammers banging the hang over

So hot but can watch the rain washing away the weight
It's sort of like watching teh way Heather Graeme skates
If you're saving yourself for the marriage, not a good idea to come here
A day in the sun and one beer
Girls running around in their underwear
Wear what you wanna, whenever
Never a bouncer to tell you to wear that collar, or leather shoes
And I never, do and never will ever

Won't change just to wait up in a long arse line

Drapht,"Check it out ah, ya, ya
From the moment we met, I was breathless
And not asbestos breathless either,
Always, when you least expect it,
Stumble across Rapunzel a Libra,
Couldn't leave, I had to meet her,
Greet the girl of my dreams with a kiss on the hand,
What up? Little magnificent missing a man,
Ran away, like kids to a van (Yeah!)
So gorgeous, walking on water,
Sort of like Erin McNaught, but little shorter,
Wore a Pandora, bought her a charm,
Wasn't short of thought ??? bit of Paul on her arm,
Calling for calm, we fought, made Iraq
And the border of Jordan a walk in the park,
Jaws of a shark, too hard to break it off,
Fall apart, so I would say:

[Chorus]
Rapunzel, gotta let your hair down,
Girl, gotta let your hair down,
I'm tired of fighting,
We ain't going nowhere now

Gotta let your hair down,
Girl, gotta let your hair down,
Why we trying?
We ain't going nowhere now

And even she could see,
Her love was like a demolition derby,
I was Herbie, the love-bug, swerving,
Cause I work on the road,
She was like Russell the Crow,
A jerk with her phone!
Know that I don't wanna fight ???
Another night, chewing off my ear, like Mike,
Another night ruined, I knew it,
Knew you would do it,
Scream when I'm out, like Hewitt,
You were the one, you were the one that ran away,
Like underlay, underlay,
Then break it off, but come running back,
Like baby, I want you back, but don't call me that,
Now baby, baby,
Baby, don't call me baby-baby,
I said, baby-baby, don't call me baby,
Baby-baby

[Chorus]

Na, I'm just sick of you saying my friends are above you,
You knew, when you were with me,
But you were lost in watching Sex and the City,
And what did you give me?
Your lips moving, but nothing coming out, like Britney!
And, what, did you lose it?
No, trust: every movement watched, like Truman,
Only human, I ain't a saint, but don't cheat when I'm in the game,
And still you know, you know no, you know you don't know me,
Die from the photos I got, like Dodi,
My own Naomi Campbell, I try to help, she fly off the handle:
No more candles, no more dinner, no more, I'm fat
I could look a little thinner,
Where's my Cinderella, my little Bella?
Hard, but I had to tell her, so I'd say, yeah, so I'd say,
I keep tellin' her, I keep tellin' her:

[Chorus]",Rapunzel,2011
Drapht,"See, it all started with my dad
If he rated anything I always hated it
With one catch the beauty of life
He played Grandmaster Flash and Furious Five
It was the message
And I guess that meant more than anything I was given
From him, maybe the rhythm within
Or given my similar sisters
Living for the resistance, we listen to systems pumping out
Jump around, to Rage Against The Machine
Fuck the police by NWA, we played the Grave Diggers
To Nirvana's Smelling Like Teen Spirit
And they sing it with every little bit of last breath that is in them
Yes and they listen, yes and they love it,
Yes and they live it, yes they

Singing along, they singing along
A new day, a new dawn
A place to forget about the world you're on and get the whole crowd
Singing along, they singing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along
Just let the whole crowd sing it

It all started as a young'n, hanging around at Hunter's flat
Once where the warriors and monsters rapped
I sat back taking it in - destined to win it
Had all of SBX as my next of kin
It was a blessing that manifested from being a guest on Done DL
That and the help from the Hydey
In '99 I had an I.D
Only 17 but saying I was 19
Hide when the cops would rock in
Nothing could stop me watching I wouldn't give in
Cause from the beginning I was living for the sound
When you walk into the room and the whole crowd singing along

Singing along, they singing along
A new day, a new dawn
A place to forget about the world you're on and get the whole crowd
Singing along, they singing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along
Just let the whole crowd sing it

Well, well look what we got here
We here to lock ears like ruggedous rottweilers
And well then why would I stop here
The day I stopped hearing the haters it got clearer
And I feared as a bearded Ned Kelly
If I would stop selling could never just stop telling em my story
Pauly walked up in here with nothing
Enough to never trust another loving Jimmy Loughnan
Cause I got these friends that will stick around
If it ever ended were there in the beginning
And then these friends in the crowd I'm surrounded by,
Together we all sing it

Singing along, they singing along
A new day, a new dawn
A place to forget about the world you're on and get the whole crowd
Singing along, they singing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along just let the whole crowd sing it",Sing It (the Lufe of Riley),2011
Drapht,"I stormed off the set
Lit a cigarette
Headed straight for my trailer

I sent Celeste to get coffee
I only drink the best

And then she went and slammed the door to her tailer
Her her slayin’, blamin’ her agent, sayin’

“One more minute working under these conditions
And there’s going to be a death.”

What a bitch!

She’s sayin’ leading lady was a hack
Not one of them can act
Everyone’s a jackass
And they’re running around backwards
So what do you call that?

I’m the only reason they bankrolled the film
Have you seen my receipts?
I’m a big deal
A big deal, for real

Pelling her face back
Revealing the savage
A dragon disguised as an actress

Feeding off the drama
You want drama?

I’m your man

Had a few breakdowns
Feeling kind of bad
Til they paid me a half a mil
Just to talk about rehab

A little complicated
Yes I’m medicated
Heavily medicated

Insane in the brain from being famous
And then she walks around saying
They want to get in her jeans

I put out a lot

See, see what I mean
It’s like
All the guys want to be me
Okay
All the girls want to do me
VIPs wish they knew me
So go ahead and sue me
Oh fucking hell

I’ve got a top lawyer and an ego made of armour
I’ll see you in court

It’ll make great drama
You want drama?
I’m your man

I met a holy man
A metaphysics teacher
He was deeper than Choprah
Biger than Oprah

As I was feeling generous,
I gave him some advice
I said
“No-one ever got a thing by trying to be nice.”
Really?

I said, “What about karma?”
I said, “Huh?”
Well, I said, “What about karma?”
I said, “Huh?”
I said, “What about-“
I said, “I heard you the first time.”
shit
I said, “What about karma, dharma, Dalai Lama, Hare Rama, Obama or Gandhi…”

All of the game cards, time that we was spending
Remembering when I couldn't live without you
Sometimes I sit back and think about you
(But this part of my mind), keeps me believin in you
People ask, what the fuck I be seein in you
Maybe it's, you're the only one for me
The only one I can see me with happily
(Ever after, one to share the laughter, with me always)
I can't lie, I be, thinking of you
Obsessed like Calvin Klein over the things you do
Through, the good and bad, who would've known, feelin with change
I guess I know now nothin stays the same
(All I really want is to be happy)
Just like everyone else I want happiness
Just like everyone else I need happiness

Back in the day I would've killed for ya, jocked ya
But now I feel for ya like Shocker

I made up my mind for the last time
I made up my mind not to waste time on a one-time thing
Love and hate creates a bind between two
Makes ya do things you didn't meant to, like say ya didn't when I say

If that, bitch trip, fuck that, she get her shit cracked)
I ain't with that
I keeps 'em gift wrapped, give 'em a hit that
Hits that, star-69 and it makes 'em want to get back
That's, how I do, as I turn
Then, I was a fool, but now I've learned, it's a thin line
