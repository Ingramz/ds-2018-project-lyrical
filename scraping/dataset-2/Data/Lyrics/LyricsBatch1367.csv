Busta Rhymes,"One, two, one, two
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two

Yo, it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down
Yes, I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound
It go one, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two

And it's the Phife Dawg and I do the same
And when it comes to rippin' mics, aiyyo, it ain't no games
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two

Aiyyo, you know it's Busta Rhymes, every time
Oh yes, I'm comin' wicked with the new design
I'm sayin' one, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two
One, wa, wa, one, one, two, one, two

MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body and the health make me wiser

The tantalizing wordplay, yeah, that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come with better compositions
I write and recite to make good position

In this rap game here, we engineer
Stabbin' up the jam, yeah, son, shit's clear
And I be kickin' rhymes in my own damn way
Beatin' niggaz to the punch like Sugar Ray

Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to see Seventy Three and see Seventy Fo'
Do a little somethin' when I'm out on tour

Comin' through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flappin' shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last

Let the good times roll 'cause we in control
Take you out on your high, less you payin' a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Take you out on your high, less you payin' a toll

Question
Why is that MC's be wack
And major labels wanna sound like crap?
Aiyyo, funk dat

Word to life, I'm comin' rugged
'cause once you add the hip to the hop, kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks renuse it

Put down the mic kid 'cause you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap?
The name is Phife Dawg and I got nuff style
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild

So bust what I'm swingin', what I'm swingin' when I swing
I rap when I rap 'cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland, now he's Sleepless in Seattle

Rude bwoy official comin' with the ill grammar
Comin' back on kids like Joey Montana
We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty
Mad play on WKRP in Cincinnati

So Lord, send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man
An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself
'cause all deez bitin' MC's, lawd dem somethin' else
See, I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt

Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer, rippin' parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about feelin' what with lead
Never mind dat mon here come de dread

We comin' far, far, far
Busta Rhymes is comin' far, far, far
Ya know ya hear me Star
Bet your bottom dollah

Right after this jam about one million, one two niggaz go follow
Whether it be today or tomorrow
Niggaz be collaboratin' sickening
You beat them like they father

Oh, shit, check out what I saying
Ah hah, ah hah, oh, ah hah, ah, hah
You know my niggaz don't be playing
Once upon a mah, hah, hacking time

I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowin' up the spot
Just to represent the Nations

Three dimensions, tri-clops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Mama so mama saa mamma ma kosah
Go back to the country to go check my grand mama

Eeeyah, bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings, delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings, watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings

But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race
Sit, dog sit
Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit

Busta Rhymes,"Go!
Go! what be going on over here?
Coming through top speed you better stand clear
Oh! you better beware or step somewhere
We 'bout to blast outta here excitement!
Yes I hope you know we come through
To cause chaos like Darth Vader
Turn on your radar
On the downhill racing I'm holding my head
The situation that we parel on the torset
I am reptar hear me roar!
I am reptar the king of dinosaurs!
Oh ya but sure I done but dirty
Still racing downhill like we doing a buck thrity
Ha! oh my name is herby (herby)
The race car going inside the demolition derby (derby)
Reptar you must be really losing a screw
Because I think we losing control so what we gonna do?
Tell me what we gonna do
Check it!
 
[Chorus: x2]
What are we doing and where we gonna go! 
So fast its gonna blow dry your ass hole!
Get out the fast dreamer says your moving to slow!
On your marks, get set, ready, go!
 
I told panic
We don't get no static from downhill
Crazy rides running through 50 traffic
Ha! made it dramatic
Plus I'm not really had it with situations like these
I better make it a habit
I am reptar the perfect children's toy!
For every girl every boy
I know they overly joyed
So fast I hear the wind whistling
Faster than a missile then
Ha is you listening?
No
In a minute we'll be soon to be arriving
Strive to put an end to all this reckless drinving
I don't mean to bore you but
I am reptar and I will destroy you!
Just like an image
Before we end up diminished
I hope that we can slow the pace down before the ride finish
Reptar you must be really losing a screw
Because I think we losing control so what we gonna do?
 
[Chorus]

Hold it!
Where we going?
What's happening here?
Where we going?
What's going on reptar?

What's going on reptar?
I'm losing control here!
What happening?
Everybody put on your seat belts

We need to angle this situation the right way
So that we can handle the situation the right way
What does it take?
Wonder what will happen if we press this button
Press the stop reptar
He started shooting fire
How many things are there around for us to destroy?
Maybe fire isn't the best idea for a children's toy
Reptar I think you really losing a screw
Cause we losing control again so what we gonna do?
Check it!

My stank butt make you wonder who shitted
Whoa there kitty
Got a fitty from the city got a minute now I'm chillin (Talk to me now)
No time you silly
Fakin me like you Milli Vanilli

Sweat all night 'till it smell like must
So Busta what's to discust?
I don't know but boy what's up (Throw it up, throw it up girl)
Boy you pretty

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, I'm a get it and give it to all why'all
Hopin' you niggas is ready for another free fall
Overall niggas need to get up off the wall
If they want to brawl Missy give me a call
Yo, not at all everytime I raid the rift
Before we bust yo' ass better plead the 5th
Shut your mouth you niggas talk to much in my house
Me and Missy lets get this money that's what I'm talkin about
Then you come nigga want to be down
Shootin' your load I hope you know we got the rebound
Real quick break fool know we blow your mind
Off the hook nigga fix your telephone line
When we come through tell me what you gonna do
Give me my money quick so then I can thank you
Word is born you knowin' I only get better
Everytime supafly dangerous elements get together

She's Mrs. Supafly
He's Mr. Dangerous

And one of us gonna have to duck

How this beat, rumble under my feet (Under my feet, yeah)
Go ahead, you cute
If you cute then I get cute too
Go ahead Missy I got many so many men I got plenty (What what)
I ain't kindin, dance alone why don't you come dance wit me
When I bumped this one the left they go deaf
Bust yo ear drums until none left (Till none left)
Whoa there Busta, they don't like us, they don't love us well fuck em

Yo Miss Supafly let me hit me and Missy we gonna get all up in it

A nigga blow the spot up make you ask who did it
Contact everytime I touch a track
Freak out wiggle your funny bone and bounce back yo
Nigga see me in the back (Who dat?)
You don't know my name I'm knowin motherfucker (True dat)
You wack you better improve your shit
When I bounce on beats lyrics might abuse your shit
Make music so I can lose your mind
So hide when I finish make you want to press for wine
Nigga see the DJ cuttin' it up 
Bringin' it back rippin' the track you know we fuckin it up

For real though who really got sent 
Flown on the edge got the ledge hangin' out of the window
Bird chest niggas with you (wondrous fearaf?)
Fuck around you'll be (hemp's meat) inside of a meal sack
Puny little bucks better hit the Jake
But that doesn't mean nothing to the heart within
You cramped up you and your team I'm amped up
And you asses can't dib me bead 
My shine what the fuck is on your mind?
Little weakling rappers better hit the grind
Other brothers ain't motivated they can't do it
Not only did I penetrate it I ran through it
My music comes on and we march at the dance
Inside of your mind or inside of my pants?
Musical intention that we have is vast
You sick? Drink a NyQuil well I'm dead on your ass
Oh well then here comes the gelatin
Tips on some sugars but you yap on your selling friends 
Now your party is completely blown
Real name is Kamal I'm in completely zone
It's rap time for you that means nap time
Preaching from my joint what the fuck I'ma clap mine
Singing songs of 6 pence it's intense 
Surprise your ass at the end like the sixth sense
Heavy hitters knocking shit out the park
You couldn't even really play tell me why did you start
Spitting sharp blades laced with bleach
You wanna play around kid I'm not a walk at the beach
A stroll in the park or your fucking playground
Put on your headphones tell me how grenades sound
Put on your walkmase and go underneath the town

Coming with the brand new quickly we pan to
The young black man with intentions to ban you
Seems that people need an aid today
So many fade away so many fiend to stay
I really rhyme 'cause I feel I should say things
While the fraudulent act raps just so they cop rings
Or maybe because when they was young
They was fronted on and left alone to have they own fun
Now they've all grown up to be assholes
I'm giving you the rope will you tie up the lassos
You swing dangling from peach trees
While I sip my Daiquiris in the south west breeze
Writing so exciting the pen it keeps
Dripping out gems that's converted to hems and then
People be humming it from now to they next to kin
My family is starving You know they want me to win
Me forfeit nigga please get off it
Send a check in my name to my office
Mutombo in the lane yo I toss it

Babylon, you throne gone down""

And I hear the angel with the seven seals say
""Babylon throne gone down, gone down
Babylon throne gone down""

I say fly away home to Zion (fly away home)
I say fly away home to Zion (fly away home)
One bright morning when my work is over

Busta Rhymes,"[Chorus]
Flipmode the imperial
You know you love it when you hear us on the radio
Go cop the joint and play the shit up in your stereo
Or in the streets up in your Jeeps, or in the disco
And if you want the fly shit, my nigga, here we go
You know it's Digga lookin' pretty in the video
With Bus-a-Bus up in the cut, but you don't hear me though
Just when you think we done we hit y'all, we got plenty mo'
Blow!

[Rah Digga]
It be's the little mama, lip gloss and eyeliner
The only shit poppin' like White Castle or the Donna
Rah Digga make the joints that the DJs blast
Ghetto diva in the Source with the three page ad
Watch as the hood rat messiah climb swiftly
Labels scared to death to let their artist bomb with me
'Cause you can send your thuggest MC and watch me son 'em
The ruggedest bitch don't even rhyme about gunnin'
Got joints circulating like them old karate flicks
Buncha Rah Digga shirts on some big body chicks
Throw my shit in your hoopty or your luxury trucks
And make the quickest turn around like 'dro for twenty bucks
And I'll still be the greatest if this rap shit fail me
Back to jackin' bootleg flicks from out the deli
Livin' off the interest
Sippin' on Tequila with my logo on the side of fuckin' eighteen-wheelers

Ay, yo, yo, yo
Raze and dazzle niggas like y'all
Spread niggas like you and dismantle niggas like y'all
I got the thing that'll majorly handle niggas like y'all
Fight y'all; bust a semi and cancel niggas like y'all
I know some joke niggas who love to hassle niggas like y'all
Talk, and fix, and simply dance on niggas like y'all
Trample niggas like y'all
Make examples outta niggas like y'all
Grit their teeth and cock the hammer up inside the dance hall
Thugs - here's another sample for niggas like y'all
Or for the ones who pass and light a Roman candle for niggas like y'all
Fight for niggas like y'all
Grab the mic from motherfuckers like y'all
Blow the spot in the night for all my niggas like y'all
My get high niggas; I blaze for niggas like y'all
Stink the spot up with 'dro; now spray the fuckin' Lysol
You know we be the ultimate
We fuckin' with some other shit
And when we hit y'all
Yes, we sit and watch y'all niggas ride the dick

Head shots so mother fuckers can't regroup, can't recoup
I'll be damned if you get more points than me
Sell more joints than me
Steal your faith, take a puff, inhale my name
Smoke on it, shit, choke on it

Hot mother fucker down to the skit nigga
Game over playa, and nigga ya scored low
Hit me later young, and I'm at the award show
Bank account ten digits and it's all ""O's""
I floss the most shit, fuck the most hoes
Come on, you can even ask Don Juan
It's official now, they all rock Sean John
Might have to change my name to strong arm
You came to get money man?
That shit been long gone, come on

Have much to do with nigga since Nicolas Bond
Poppin' and choppin' until the day that I'm gone
Shyne poor, cuz your dream come from one bottle
Prominent premier, premium bravo
Watch him explain ain't nothin' but blood thug crime though
Shots in the spinal, from my rivals 
Cross the t's and dot the i's and
Pay the judge, drop the top we'll mess around
Shit, it's the kid rapper's feelin'
You cowards don't know? I'd rather be racketeerin' somewhere 
Bustin' shots in the atmosphere and
Not caring, fuckin' the proscecutor at my hearin'
Money laundering, honies wondering
Who me?  I reply casually
Come what God would be if He was a straight G
Tonight too tight out of a big ditch we ride

Yo yo yo, it's your hide
Grab the rope and yell rawhide
Front line is pussy, call off sides
I'm focus but my hand is cross-eyed
I left my gun home, here borrow mine
Pop the nine like a judge ""All rise""
This gun'll knock plants off tall guys
We value-packs, y'all small fries
Yo, I'm from the projects
Yo, but on the floor tied
Don't matter, we'll take up all size
Truly yours doc, then PPP hide, my name is 
Since five, I talk jive
In church dressed in cordoroy ties
Now I'm grown up and been married four times
Besides, I'm just a sight for soar eyes
Brick city, known pop the door wide
Stolen Bonneville in New York High

Reversin' the plot
Last come, first one to rot, first in the glot
If I miss, circlin' the block, servin' the pot
And I be the person to watch
If your girl missin' the rock, purse and a watch 
Hot as it gets, from Hell came outta you debts
Buy the cassette, rewind it to death
Alota y'all sweat it, you try to forget
How I rock shit from N.Y. to Tibet
You got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt
You lost when you nodded your neck
Through the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect
Take the voice that you try to project, check
Darin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz
I'm why you smell herb in the crib
Man I'm out for doubtful, shit I spit a mouthful
Indo out-do, intro to outro

I'm the hottest thing spittin' so go warn your clique
Them niggas y'all look up to is on my dick
Sauce motherfuckin' born to hit
I get so far up in your ass, think I was on some shit
Look, you against me is really nothin' to see
Who, when, where, what it's gon' be
I don't give a fuck if it's he or she
I'm the virgin of hip hop
Nobody fuckin' with me
I know your type, you a ride dick nigga
Cry sick nigga, lied quick nigga
Out of turn speakin', first one leakin'

Why I come through and tell 'em to blow dick
These nigga's the nicest?  No, go fish
Sauce, you da best motherfucker, no shit

You're treated and competed, walk away from it undefeated
Observe it from over there, ok 
Ain't It obvious we overheated
You talkin' that slick shit 
But I jus' know that you meant me 
But evidently, you don't know
I get your ass gone permanently
It ain't complex
I'll just bang holes or you're ablin' to ask who next
Do a drive-by on your project, take the traps
Come on and get some of our gun craps
I'll straighten out the nigga now
When I snap, make your chest cavity collapse
When I glide the entire map
With the frequent four alarm fire, rap straight up
Put weight down, fuck around, you ate up
And nigga when I eat, I mean I lick the whole plate up
Look in my eyes, I'm not scared
Sucka, you heard what I said
If you don't wanna get dead
No it ain't no cure, ice cold in the low, the go-rilla
The mo' scrilla the more real-la, I live to rule

Don't hold me back, you bet
How many nigga's think they fuckin' with mines
A nigga God blessed with such an undeniable shine
I hope you know there's nothin' fresher
The manifester apply the pressure
Tie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester
Now fix your fuckin' face up
Empty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw
Everybody hit the fuckin' floor
Only the real mother fuckers belong
I hope nigga's don't end the party before we finish the song
(Bitch nigga)
You be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past
When I used to pull spine outcho ass
Live nigga's go stack money, continue to bill shit
Long as I'm in this fucker I'm determined to kill shit
Zap nigga's like cellular flips and swell up your lips
Fuck with so much dick in their ass it's shrinkin' her hen house

Salute the legacy of these throroughly recognized niggas",Reverse,1999

Throw ya hands in the sky (Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!)
Queens is in the back sipping 'gnac, y'all wassup?
Girls, rub on your titties (Yeah)
Yeah fuck it I said it rub on ya titties
New York City gritty committee, pity the fool that act shitty
In the midst of the calm, the witty

Yo shut the fuck up!
Luck said shut the fuck up!
Bitches in the back, like crack get it cut up
I speak on behalf of them broads you call stuck up
Act like a man and get cocked, smacked or fucked up
Pull the truck up, Luck you know the name
Ass out in the bleachers stay shittin' on the game
I suppose what you're spittin' is flames, cowards
Knew your crew was vaginal, I could smell the dooch powder
Summer's Eve, I drop degrees chill
Come four by four, lose one like Dru Hill
Stay fly 'til you air sick, now that's ill
Two choices, either squeeze or peel, now that's real

What the fuck's goin' on here, just a minute now, hold up
Sinister wit hit the time I diminish him finish him, roll up
When I'm, in a, cinematography state of mind
My rap trip, rip, flip, clip, say the rhyme
Shit, I spectacular run hit spit bitches vernacular
Miraculous rhyme flow, back track to the Immaculate
Binaca blast nigga that's fast, son I'll out-box ya
Ladies rub the ta-ta's, bras, titties and knockers on the floor
Owww! Fellas pull ya cock out
On the verge to splurge verbs for third round knock out
Uh I bust a rhyme that dust frustrated rappers
Dust crush competition, lights out like the Clapper
The mic ripper, whip a nigga like a slave
Separate him from him from his fam, he don't know how to behave
Now, drag his ass, bag dun for his loot
Figure me to give a nigger-y twenty-one gun salute
That's seven shots for 2pac
Seven for Biggie Smalls
Seven for Freaky Tah up in your neighborhood malls
How's that, fat action packed rap remain tame
Pharoahe fuckin' Monch, ain't a damn thing changed

Yo yo get the fuck up!
Funk Doctor Spock said get the fuck up!
I got a bitch named Nina and I tuck her
I leave a nigga hangin' like ya mom's muffler
Snuff her, then my boys follow up
Respect like The Fonz, you see the collar up
I spit out a bullet, load the barrel up
I kamikaze ya town off a Arab bus
Karat cut, yeah mami pull over
I bend ya pussy like for years I knew yoga
I'm too smoked up, I can't remember me
Off Hennesy, that's why I carry Mini-Me
I need fifty feet when my performance starts
I push a armored car wit enormous hearts
Nineteen inches, I'm not on the charts
Doc turnin' dark off a warning shot
Drive off and pop, six in ya hood

Yea-yeah my nigga, one rhyme and you fold over

Yo yo get the fuck up!
Yo yeah I said it, get the fuck up!
Walk through Shaolin after dark, you get stuck up
Seek and destroy, baddest boy when I'm puffed up
Ya know my name, and Pharoahe Monch, why we came what?
We off the chain, plus we plottin' on the game, what?
Know ya role, by the way tuck ya gold
And you and your mic can ease on down the road
Assholes are like opinions, everybody got to have one
Shootin' in the sky tryin' to blast sun
Zero to sixty in a second, pull a fast one
Fifty cent flashin' they hate us with a passion
Mashin', still fresh in three-day old fashion
Your plaid, I'm stripes, together we be clashin'
Here's a Tunnel banger
Wu-Tang death penalty, the gas chamber
This gon' hurt me more than it hurts you
Slap ya like the doctor the day your momma birthed you
Just so you can feel me
The same way I'mma feel this world when it kill me
Even if time stands still, I'mma still be
Underground and filthy, gotta have our Way like the Milky
Innocent until I'm proven guilty
Never got caught in the game of tag
Momma never kept a boyfriend with kids this bad
No justice, raider ruckus
Underground 'til we under ground
But y'all first motherfuckers

My thugs, throw up ya set
And shorties rub on ya breasts
Get the fuck up, outta that dress, I palm tits
You herbs get flipped like jeeps on mountain cliffs
I'll rip through your chest, hollow-point talent tips
Double-S, double the threat, double your bet
Double up on that cash if you decide to invest
You sound like Big, you sound like Jay, you sound like D
And I bet, when I go plat, you'll sound like me
Shabaam Sahdeeq, injure your fleet into delete
Y'all crabs are weak, frail like a fiend's physique
I stay on the street, stay on the beat, stay with the heat
Stay stickin' fools like you for the rocks that gleam
So toss that link, dummy, shoulda insured that link
Straight to Canal I'll praise that link, then pawn that link
You froze up, Sahdeeq says shut the fuck up
Punk niggas get gun-butt up and tied up

Busta Rhymes is like Hacksaw Jim Duggan, been thuggin'
Lovin' the way we flood jewels for nothin'
Lay it over, another ambush we take over
Yo we don't only get money, we cut the coke and cook the shake over
You better guard your head right, especially if it's late at night
Or find your picture of your autoposy up on the web site
Yo if you ever violate my space
Fuck a fat lip, I'll leave you with a fuckin' fat face
Nigga, Busta Rhymes the handsome, I'll hold you for ransom and some
Like the ghost of a haunted house, I'll forever live in a mansion
Bitches, snitches comin' out and you know who's showin' it
Like when British civil servants pass secrets to the Soviets
Y'all niggas is seemless blends of seemless friends
Live on about the souls on a bunch of seamless ends
Collosal, me and my nigga Pharoahe Moncho
The head honcho, gettin' this money like Leonardo (Do-Do-Do-Do)
Enough substance in the roughness
Now watch it come around in an amazing large abundance
Now let me clear the smoke screen you blow fiend
Live nigga shit that'll rebuild your whole self-esteem
Pledge allegiance to the flag of united live niggas of America
Let us control and own the fuckin' area
Wildin' in your whip until you crash the whole truck up
And if you know what's good for you nigga you better get the fuck up!",Simon Says [Remix],1999

I be pulsating dominating, up above
Run-D.M.C. style, stop and show love
E-Dub, I can't fall off, it's no way, I'm down low
I stay in the cut with O.J.
The fact is, some things got to change
with eight or more rappers that sound the same
With the, same game, like they all in the same gang
and claim the same fame
Suicide victims, quick to jump off and scream I
have to die, I'm living a lie
Fake MC's no heart, get torn apart
Messing with us? In ninety-nine, get smart
I be the last one you wanna play with
Rap committees call me, just to okay shit
Focus on me, I grab the mic and drop gems
on a ill rhyme, more flashier than rims
Step in in tan Timb's, a pocket full of ends with a
couple of friends and a couple of hens
Never boring, keep shit rocking til morning
with the bird, until the hawks start hawking
Bounce with me, me and my man keep things hitting
Hop in the Benz 2000 Benz with the CD skipping

[Parrish Smith]
Yo, they took our music and our beat and tried to make it street
Then got in the magazine and tried to sound all sweet
When it came to EPMD no one said a word
So I called up Erick Sermon and said, ""This shit's absurd!""
Now we flip the bird, back-breaking MC's down like herbs
Redlining, bending my chrome rims up on curbs
So can you make a bill and chill and survive in the rap field?
Flip deals, and cock back burners when the caps peel?
I don't think so, then come next the car repo
No mo' contract, just strictly handyman in Home Depot
So don't front for me or the E, cause you know our steez
EPMD, blazing shit, Def 2G's
Cause we make tape and break MC's who wannabees
and gonna-beez, burn em down to third degrees

Make sure they krytonite caps

And if you try to shoot me down clown I won't die
I cremate

I hate, let's exterminate
Wait for a second E, time to debate
As we take our Fisherman hat off, there's no time to max
on the crab MC, who's all on the bozack
who knows that, 2000 Benz to shows that

Listen up everybody the bottom line
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just living like a hooker, the harlett sounds
Now when I say the harlett, you know I mean the hot
Heat in the equator, the brothers in the pot
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip
Draftin of the poets, I'm the number seven pick
Licks, licks, licks boy on your backside

Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

1 for the treble, 2 for the bass
You know the style Tip, now watch me rip this
I like my beats harder than two day old shit
Steady eating booty MC's like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would want to get with me
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC
Now the formula is this, me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
The answer, big up is how I be
Brothers find it's hard to do, but never me
Some brothers try to dis Malik
You see'm catchin me
Don't worry about them booty MCs, my shit be hittin
Training gladiator, anti-hesitator

Beat you in the same place till the blues start blacking

CEO niggas stay general managing
Flipmode throwing those heavy bundles we carrying
Yo analyze my many live niggas cramming it
We throw a three pointer, while y'all niggas throwing javelins

Sweating your whole shit, feel your clothes damping
Dancing in a line of four wheel drives we lamping
The [unknown] arms length up in the draw paneling
Or unraveling the truth on how niggas remain champions
Ha, ha, ha

Huddle wit my niggas plan for tomorrow go into isolation
And analyze how many niggas gon lose
Tryin to squeeze they foot up in a pair of great man shoes
And analyze how we was needed to live
Carry out my dooney give the most thanks and be appreciative
Pass this to all my seeds after me
Represent and fight to be that everything my seeds want me to be

It's like a group of happy children
Yo, it's such a feelin'
To see all of my live nigga's carry on now
Oh see how I be gettin' so passionate
I get a thrill even when I bust my gun off by accident
The God bless glory, success story
Whiteboy Billy put a stash up in my armrest for me
The way I fucks it up, it's like a fuck-fest for me
I get on last and demolish everything before me
We run shit and that's a fact now, you're whack now
And ain't no fuckin' turnin' back now, so relentless
I won't even let you niggas finish a fuckin' sentence
Call for my people like a school attendance
And then I strike with a fuckin' vengeance
Finger on my trigger
Figure I'll blast every last one of you bitch niggas

The one world alliance
Flipmode the most reliant for the thorough guidance
On how to get most of this money like a secret science
Only the live nigga's allowed, there's nothin' you can do
Frontin' with your crew while you talkin' to corny bitches too
Nevertheless, address the cheddar for the treasure chest
And bless the spot before the thugs protest, one time
I hope y'all know just what the motherfuck you dealin' with
With so much platinum for the street, you thought I was a silversmith
We phat now, so look at how we brought it back now
And made it possible for street niggas to hold a stack now
And become the wealthiest, healthiest
And bring the fire that will reach about 1000 degrees celsius
Hold on, banker's money better roll on, or sing a broke folk song
My nigga's so long he paid with a big brim hat, just like a lampshade
And bounce, wildin' in the truck, the joints my nigga Ramp made
We be them new millennium prime time niggas
Walk a fine line, niggas sippin fine wine niggas
Now, if you cross the line and fuck around them blind niggas 
With so much pressure it's like we did the illest crime, nigga
What? You know I'm like a loco man, noble man
Turned global man, rippin' bi-coastal like a postal man
And when we come, you know we came to get it
And what you need to do is bounce if you ain't fuckin' with it

So (Get out)

Holding a navy blue uzi
Krush Grooving waves off the atlas
Cooling, that's how we make movies
Basketball gun brawlers, bounce
Black down 'bill-a-head banks, Malibu colorful shanks
That's the way we live, Staten Island kid
Old dog in it, the thug vaccine wit no pork in it
Vivid imagination paper chasing
Dufflebag swollen, we holding

Tied his broken arm to his Hush Puppies
Wrapped around trauma, everything realer than fuck
Tajuana left my nigga niece live comma
Three young Italians, suited down personal style
I'm in valour white designing on the 'dallions
Felt like some crackers was in back of me
Spit on the clerk, pass the Harry Winston set
Ghost backing me
Bust a shot, motored

A hail storm, ice raining, mind containing
Info, nigga what you in for? Complaining
Sick bars deep in this language
Did I tell you how my day's spent?
Speaking through the face of Ronald Regan
Iceberg History, calligraphy
Colidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flaring gunmen
Hate to see me coming like gray skies on day of judgment
Makes you wonder where the love went
Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards
Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in
We duck in the safe, check what I'm hugging
Rocks the size of some shit, out in the congo
My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you

Hey yo we do great study on fossils and stones like archeologists
Gem-ologists, collect the most priceless ices anonymous

Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick
Princess cuts, invisible settings
Planning the world's greatest diamond heist playin a tune by Otis Redding
Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites
Time to throw on a skully and tying a rag tight
Throwing light went off and in the basket
Grabbed the necklace from off the satin pillow while the glass casket
Ice lay across the crushed burgandy velvet
Up in the diamond slide-tray
Gun in your face, slide it right away

We got them niggas drunk and talking foolish see
You know the way we straight manipulated the shit
We swindle them niggas for all their precious things before we skated and shit

All the niggas that held it down with me through the whole shit
From the beginning of the fort, to the now current day of the fort
From the beginning and the birth of this whole shit

Every time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas
1, 2
All the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas

Now, this how the shit all started
Was like doctors of ? I was being conceived kinda retarded
Like, and while my moms was conceiving this beautiful baby
Doctors was the this woman's stress out of this Jamaican lady
Pops beef and straight carrying on
Nobody realizing how the god was now being born
Hey yo, yo, 1, 2
While they was wildin and shit
They couldn't even find my pulse, sonogram on the frisk
So, they tried a natural birth, but had to stop production
Baby stuck all up in the womb, another malfunction
1, 2
And now the doctors discover
They had to cut this lady's gut, and see-section me out of my mother
Pop duke could only sit and ask why
Looked up in the sky and begged for mercy from the most high
C'mon, now, 1, 2
See now the day would feel blessed
Watching the birth of a precious baby life manifest
See how that bugged me out

[Chorus]

That shit, that type shit be bugging me out cause
Ya know niggas, nigga look back
To them days when you know shit is kinda ill like ya know what I mean?
Nigga, niggas like fall out, you know what I mean?
Motherfuckers is, niggas live long enough to look back and shit and
Laugh and shit, ya know what I mean?

Young and learning shit that started is thick
Started inquiring a lot, started using my dick
Like I knew it all but I wasn't really knowing and shit
Bugging when my pubic hairs started growing and shit
Now hold up, a young nigga now a couple years pass
Searching desperate to experience my first piece of ass
Now, getting into mischief and caught my first arrest
Started smoking weed and started totin on them cigarettes
Eyes bloodshot like I was staring at a high beam
Nigga only twelve so why he looking like he nineteen?
1, 2
The fast life baby, young with an old soul
From the past life baby
A young nigga wanted things and wanted money quick
Ambitious on the Amtrak, wit a quarter brick
My nigga, 1, 2
It got hot in the streets
My nigga campaign the cops who started walking the beat, my nigga
Trouble causing too much problems just me and my brother
Made mommy a grandma and shacked up with my baby mother
Now it a seed, I was always ready to clap shit
Struggling, so then I start fucking 'round with this rap shit
Moved to Long Island and got up with a few niggas
Believing we could show the world we was the Leaders Of the New niggas
A crew of niggas that was hot like an infirmary
Blazing til they started acting like bitches internally
So now, Flipmode is how we own it fo' sho
Tried to fuck with niggas but I couldn't do it no more
Fo rilla, 1, 2
And then I got with some niggas
Always wit it to multiply the gross and double the figgas
And then I, hit with bombs and hold a stack in my palms
Whipping Bentleys, floss icy shit and take care of moms
Give the local little old man a job as my chauffeur
Hold it down for all my niggas til the movement is over
It's kinda beautiful

[Chorus: Repeats]

Yeah, ya know what I mean?
How we have acquired so much
Where we can look back and, and actually laugh and lavish
In the, in the, in the moment
As we prime in life
Look at how we, we struggled all this way and went through the bullshit
Motherfucking, little obstacles
Situations they try to set up for niggas to fucking fall off
And lose they hard earned shit, ya know what I mean?
I holds it down for my niggas though
Give my last to my niggas
All the niggas that was wit me through the whole shit

Down shift, throw it in the fifth gear with my foot on the clutch
Speed balling, like we all in a rush
While we switch a couple of lanes
Flick my little hazard light on
Better pull over and get on the lawn
Yo, move the barricade, and let my niggas park on the block
Make a grand entry up in the spot
You know we only here to take all of the food out the pot
It's only right cause niggas know we be taking they slack

And leave you with stitches

All praise due, we comin through real hard
Niggaz raisin they right hand, salutin da God
Yo, like a burnin sensation of Henny on the first sip
Hot shit my nigga; let me spit a verse quick
Work shit inward, until my niggaz hurt shit
and plot elaborate schemes for monies niggaz worship
Beautiful like the pleasure of when I burst my first clip
at a nigga who sold me a brick that wasn't WORTH shit
Yo, we BOMB shit, fire alarm shit
with my bitches who take packages under they armpit
Now, we remain the +Imperial+ live niggaz
who consistantly blackout and rep for them wild niggaz
Yo, you incompatible, snatch yo' collateral
Gun blunt you, and rep for every thug capital
Diagonal vision, niggaz seein shit on slant
Plant beatings on niggaz and celebrate a war chant
Diabolic how we manifest raw logic
Chronological time, we bring niggaz the raw project
Hold fort and represent as the grand wizard
Street chronicle illustrate the bakin of a bad blizzard
I got a spot for ya, 
with live niggaz who murder sloppier
than ALL of the Trenchcoat Mafia yo
Cause when you hear the sweet music playin
It's like theme music for murder scenes
like the Colorado slayin - cause I don't give a fuck
Speedin like we racin on the Aqueduct
Black tinted-out, government truck
Curbside on niggaz, leanin just a little bit
Trunk ?? with smoke, my bitch'll take a little hit
Fake niggaz could be the BEST actors
My bullets whiz so fast you feel the WINDSHIELD factors
In the wrong place you get your WIG peeled backwards
Get an ounce of the 'dro and STEAM a pack of Blackwoods

Thug niggaz let me see y'all, yeah
Hah, before we slap niggas silly with something
And put you out your misery and your suffering
Uh-oh!  Yeah, and just for fronting, 
You got me busting two nines 
With one hand tied together or something
Ain't no mistaking we taking your trap
In case you niggas didn't know, 
You fucking with the gladiators of rap
On some John Reno shit in Professional, 
How we accurate and precise when we bust
And every move is intentional
Violate and I will get at yo' ass
And if I can't catch you track star 
We'll start throwing shit at yo' ass
Wait a minute nigga, hold up second, 
See youse a bitch and while we bust yo' ass 
Yo' fagot peoples ain't even checking
Yo y'all need to send the coroner, shit
Leave you looking out a place 
Like youse a tourist on some foreigner shit  
I be that nigga and I love to experiment 
With specific high-explosives 
Just to take y'all niggaz out of this element, now!

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Cause we got new shit for y'all
(All my niggas in the spots,
 y'all know we tear the shit down and how we hold it nigga)
And we come to take shit over y'all

Fuck around and get yo' leg broke 
And beat all in yo' face with ya foot
We here to stay, fuck paying a visit
I only fuck with certain LIVE niggas
Like my niggas Tash and Xzibit
Ever since I vowed to keep the shit raw
I stay hitting niggas with shit 
That'll leave they fucking face on the floor
Every time niggaz know when we black
Smack a nigga so fucking hard
He'll fall and probably spin on his back
Funny how niggas'll always shit talk
The very next day they will notice the difference
In the way they bitch walk
My street niggas need to come for the ride
Cause when we step up in the place
You funny niggas need to slide to the side
I love to watch these funny niggas diminish
And while we slowly murder them niggas
They praying on the moment we finish
I take you back to the very beginning
And beat you in yo' head from birth
And watch you grow loving the shit we be bringing
Street niggas keep they mind on they dream
Focus the most on getting they paper
And be thoroughly repping they team
You know we quick to mash it down for ? hours
Quick to leave some of these niggas shook
Running with the rest of them cowards
And leave the rest of niggas ready to dumb
And rep the street until we all die
Could give a fuck wherever you from, now!

And churches right across the streets from alla that
Yeah,

On the corner, it ain't the right thing to do
But niggas is put in the motherfucking, living conditions

Busta Rhymes,"[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, it all began like, bust it
My nigga City bout to bounce on a trip
We met some niggas with a lot of things they want em to flip
I told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip
Travel safe, you know that I'ma hold it down on the strip
Good looking, word to mother son I give you my wit
But when I get back, I'ma bounce straight to your crib
On the strength, son slid until you to the Greyhound
Wit a burner in the knapsack, headed straight outta town
Now, three days pass I'm still on the strip
Doing hand to hand with twelve collapsible, stashable clips
With little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like a project
When police come we stick the clips in any metal object
Throwing a nigga on the walls and try to search me down
I laugh knowin that my stash'll never be found
Well anyway, on the third day, son came straight to the strip
Wit a new floss and shiny shoes on the whip
My nigga hit me with the latest, greatest
He told me get inside the whip so I can know just what the up to date is
He said he fuckin wit some Guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is
What kind of dough they get, and how they handle they biz
How they connect with Jamaican niggas who speak American
And how they chains swung a medallion iced out pelicans
And how they stay wit four pounders
And speak American to try to blend in
Like they ain't obvious out of towners
Okay, I've never heard of workers getting five G's pay
For trips that last for only 2-3 day
How these Guyanese niggas be eating pasta but they love zucchini
Rocking valor tennis suits by Sergio Tecchini
Them type of cats that call you because you can't call 'em
Rocking baseball fitters with wild animal skins on 'em
How they rock silks and tailor made pants
And get a matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance
Washrags hangin from every one of our back pockets
From every fine wine to champagne them niggas'll straight cop it
And set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential
Rock laced whips while the workers'll floss the latest rentals
How they fuck with arrogant bitches who act pussy
And love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy
After all of that I wanted ones
The way my nigga was talking so next trip I went to bounce with son
So now we out of town with Guyanese cats
Up in they gates bubbling packages and laying with gats
Shit was slow until the main fiend was offed
Just like a thief in the night
And spread the word that we was back with the white

[Intermission]
""Hey yo why don't you tell that crackhead to close the fuckin door
And shut the fuck up""
""Yeah man and clean the motherfucking spot up, smell like""
""Break the fucking breakdown in the working city, yo go get the plates
And the gym star""
""Yo light that up, lemme hit that, gimme a light, yeah man cut that""
""Fuck this shit""

[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, see how we blowing pa
The lookout niggas holding fort like they was watchtowers
Bugging on how we went through, a half a brick every couple of hours
So on and so on, shit is good and we eating
First nigga to short a package will catch the most brutal beating
The whole town, see we now own it
Carrying on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments
We stacking cheddar now and shit is all clear
And we was growing as working niggas wit aspiring ideas
We love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit
But in the grand scheme these niggas'll love to have they own shit
Now these niggas was really ready to swell up
We decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop
Off in to the wilderness of the wicked Husid
We set up shops and watched the games begin
So now we balling like a motherfucker, money was sick
Gas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin the dick
Fucking everything from the local McDonald's bitches with the biggest ass
To attorney bitches that'll beat a charge fast
We used to taking niggas' custies and leave they set up on tilt
And watch 'em angrily scheme on the shit that we built
Ain't it funny how shit transpire in fact
Not too long after our ride we took the winner's stash, house was at
Some niggas tried to run a jook with things in they palm
Not a problem so immediately reach for the john
Right away the gun buist! straight lifted a nigga
How we moved his organs with kickback, shifted a nigga
Wild shots fire, everybody scatter like rats
Leavingg nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats
Now we got this fagot nigga blood on our hands
But fuck it, determined to fulfill the best of these plans
Shit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall
My son said he shot, but he wasn't bleeding at all
Word, I started bugging when my nigga said he feel cold
Then I looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole
So as we continue to radically blaze the fifth
Flame the iron, not giving a fuck, y'all niggas want to rip?
Well we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook
One nigga slid and think he got off the hook
Now let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied
Was one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party
He was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes
Stupid motherfucker tried to front, we had to leak his brain
Suddenly my nigga fell to the floor
And said his legs feel like them shits ain't got no feelings no more
More the actin up the more the shit I felt in my gut
The shit was all over as soon as the director said CUT!

That's a wrap, good acting motherfuckers, good acting
That's the shit I'm talking about
Y'all ready to watch the playback?
Fuck around, that shit'll be a box office smash motherfuckers",A Trip Out of Town,2000

Uhh! busta rhymes
What?! Uhh, dmx nigga
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh

I see ghosts clearly; even though, most don't hear me
They still want to get near me - fear me, so I'm leary
Kinda eerie what I'm feelin' - from the floor, to the ceilin'
Straight through the roof, want the truth?
I kinda miss robbin' and stealin'
Cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin' when I starved
I was ugly, so I robbed, no one loved me, shit was hard
Went to god once in a while when it got a little too hectic
He was the only one I knew that I respected (why?)
Didn't know why, didn't know what I was livin' was a lie
If I ain't shit then, why should I try
See, plenty niggaz die, over dumb shit, up in the hood
Real good heart, but up to no good
Thought I did what I could, but I guess it, wasn't enough
The devil told me it would happen but I kept callin his bluff
When it rains it pours now, my pains are yours
As yours are what's mine, define, revolvin' doors (nigga!)

[Chorus]
(why?) all my niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Cause we crazy with it, quick to blaze you with it
From in my soul to every word that I curse
With all the agony expressed in this verse;
Let me ask my niggaz (why?)
My niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Because we gods nigga (and) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet
And keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggaz (why?)

They say the good die young, in the hood where I'm from
I only got one question to that - why the fuck am I here?
I look to the air, I ask god, ""love me please,""
But in reality, only people that hug me is thieves
Same niggaz that send shots through my rugby sleeves
They want to, slug me and leave, I'm thinkin' it must be me
Please shed light, the hood's dark
I did my dirt but got a good heart
Shouldn't that count for somethin?
I was told I'd amount to nothin, most of my childhood
Liked by folks it was stuntin' my growth
Separated me from the shit I was wantin' the most
Felt myself comin' close to pumpin' them o's
Lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker
Tryin' to, erase my ghostes, chase the smokers
Got demons on both shoulders, 
Tryin' to chauffeur my life through the streets
In other words nigga my will was weak
Please feel what I speak, 
This ain't your average ordinary jargon
Weak rap niggaz be talkin'
This shit is deep, from the mind of Busta, 'X and me
To all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, til we meet niggaz

[Chorus]

I must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never
See you too could get it through your Fubu sweater
Like a nigga when he walk in the dark, trespassin'
On a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park
I live and die for all the shit I believe
And rep for everything I stand for 
With every single breath I breathe
Like the intake from cigarette smoke, it's like you inhale
The demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke
If the shit was all over tomorrow, I'd leave a treasure
For my kids with a legacy for my children to follow
You know it's funny how the good die first
Get the peppin' in your steppin' faggot nigga
Cause you could die worse
Hold on, you know I cut off my arm, in the name of reppin
Real niggaz in the midst of droppin' this bomb
Allah blessin' me to rep for the better, and carry on
Somethin' great and keep a nigga name livin' forever!

[Pos]
It's the one and only effect, that you catch from a cassette
Straight wig out the world and girls we straight dig out ya back
 
with letters spellin' out my name
All over your marquee, cause the spark is me
Currently we can be seen across your screen
Stayin' wide-eyed 'cause you niggaz tryin' to scheme

Welcome to the spot - I'm slaying with it
Chop it up and fit it inside your quart of rice
You speak ghetto falsetto on the mic device
Tryin' to give me third degree, you just a third of me

Couldn't be the shit if you were a turd of me
A man tight with my funds, crush like Ricky D
who quoted Vance Wright - no one can serve us!
My squad advance heights quite superb

Just kick off your shoes - jump on the jock
It's been a long time comin' this you NEED to cop!

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
It goes one (one) two (two) three (three) four (four)
Bounce so much I ricochet up off the floor (floor)
So raw shit the most raw you ever saw
Quarter after four, niggaz quick to bust the back door

Baby - open your blouse while I joust another nigga's spouse
Quick Jamaican dick style all in they house
I practice to be the all access, you see the fact is
my mouth dirty, so follow while I display the slackness

Yo, you see my slang talk straight from the slums
When I was young, moms put soap on my tongue, and yo-yo
Forever we gettin' this CHEDDAR with the quickness
While I cast the spell on these bitches, you can be my eyewitness

Short fuse, nowadays Langston Hughes
We gettin' money with whoever - even the Jews
The way we finagle and gain it must be all in my shoes
Fuck a nigga up with De La like (?) can amuse

[Chorus]",I.C. Y'all,2000

As a shorty playing in the front yard of the crib
Fell down, and I bumped my head
Somebody helped me up and asked me if I bumped my head
I said ""Yeah""
So then they said ""Oh so that mean we gon, you gon switch it on em'?""
I said ""Yeah, Flipmode, Flipmode is the greatest""
Knowing as a shorty, I was always told
That if I ain't gon' be part of the greatest
I gotta be the greatest myself

C'mon c'mon, Yeah, c'mon
Yeah nigga what, what a surprise
Get ya sumn', make a nigga close both of your eyes
All my niggas gettin' money capitalize
Die little small guy, we on the rise
Everything a nigga touch platinumize
Fully equipped, you know we come wit' all the supplies
Got a big gun, and I'ma show you the size
You fuck wit' any of my Flipmode family ties
Me and my niggaz be comin' through stalkin' you out
Killin' off any and everything you talkin' about
See you in the club, now we walkin' you out
Shoulda' thought twice 'fo you went and opened your mouth
Yo, anyway we stay keepin it movin'
Fuckin' with the wrong nigga, hope you know what you doin'
Now blame me, all the same niggas is lame
It's not a game, makin' names still splittin' your frames!

Y'all niggas had enough?
Gimme some more
Y'all niggas want the wild shit?
Gimme some more
Yo Spliff where the weed at?

Everybody spread love
Gimme some more
If you want it let me hear you say
Gimme some more

Flash with a rash gimme my cash flickin my ash
Runnin' with my money son go out with a blast
Do what you want, a nigga's cuttin' the corner
You fuckin' up, oh to go ahead and meet the reporter
Yo, she tellin' news on how you switch to a bitch
Little fake funny style, nigga chill with a snitch
So now I pass and trait over your blood and to ask you
Make a little room for me and all my niggas to pass through
Cartier, Sidney Poitier, hooray shit
What with all my niggas from around the way shit
When I come through you niggas know I do my thing
Bring more shit that generate money, chi-ching
Arrest you lyrically flow and caress you
Bless you, then a nigga come to your rescue
While you assume a nigga blossom and bloom
I'm comin' soon hit you with a boom gimme some room!

Yo, live nigga shit know what I mean

Hope you niggas know we comin' through full steam

Never should you ever try to fuck wit' my cream

Everytime we be rippin' it be blowing it down
Blowing you off fuckin' wit' the hottest niggas around
Like it's when me and my people run through your town
Holdin' it down takin' a while and then gimme my crown

Cause one night in the club gets your life on crutches

Flyin' in the 5 with the top back on it 
Stop that shorty, I know you love me
Probably sample one of my beats then owe me money

Ugh, hallelujah
Kids hear this come on
While I'm lacing and tryna prepare this
For why'all, oh well I got a story to tell
About a dude I met once, miserable as hell
How grouchy he was
And how slouchy he was
And when he talked, you'd smell his breath
And how lousy it was
And if you daydreamed, he'd give you pinch
Now let me tell you about Mr. Grinch
Every holiday season while we was young, growing up
Everything be cool when Mr. Grinch show up
Always plottin' and schemin' to ruin everybody's holiday season
And never had a justifiable reason

[Jim Carrey]
Yo b I had my reason
They call me The Grinch
I tried to live the given
But it was making me winch
I see happy kids whitless
""Merry Christmas"" they shouted
I stole the gifts
And there was nothing anyone could do about it

And he'll show you some gratitude

Word to mother

[Jim Carrey]
Yes, it's my favorite day
You let me take all your gifts
And just yell my name!!

After that I'll be on my way
Just to return and successfully ruin your day

Okay for the record
What the hell made you like that?
So grouchy and grimy
How everything about you is whack
Ay yo I know you all can tell
From all the talk from his mouth
You better set some big traps
Around the gifts in your house
State of the art surveillance
Just to give it a boost
You sleep with one eye open
With a couple wild dogs running loose, now
He's definitely not the dude you can trust
He be bouncing with all your goods
And leave you biting the dust

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel

Grinch come around safe guard your things
You better safe guard your money
Safe guard your bling
You gotta safe guard your crib
Safe guard your g's
You gotta safe guard the stash and the car keys
You gotta listen up to what we talking about
Yeah it was better when the Grinch was never coming around her
Time after time again
Never mind he already took the liqour out your Heineken
He already quick to try again
To steal the gifts another way
And give you all a different style again
Why you stackin' and you trying to swell
You best believe Mr. Grinch schemin, dude stay coneiving ass
Ay yo he stay schemin' when you thinkin' he not
Looking over your shoulder
Peepin' everything you got

Relax duke you need to chill

Niggas play hard and shit, if you know what's best for you
Y'all niggas better safeguard your shit

Fuck with street geniuses and bowlegged chicks who walk with a gap
Street niggas now the corporate boss
Still go to y'all resteraunt for steamed fish and Irish moss
And y-yo, the way we do it and you see how my shit bomb
Your whole show wack and I'mma cancel your sitcom
Fuck a nigga broad 'til she tired and real calm
You ain't knowin my name tattoed on your bitch arm
The way we blow shit is a shame
Casually bust my gun and celebrate bustin' a cork on the champagne
Wrote you with a whole new approach that lead a whole team of niggas
Y'all should know I only ball like a coach, now

Check out the light fixture, freak lines like white bitches
Let the mic lines, hang that slang is ridiculous
Emperor of warlords, big gun only fuck with sawed-offs
That's my specialty, more to bust
Shot out my bed parrot keep it gangster, Lord
I analyze your work those that got merked were not established
Texture look classy, arm baby 2000 raspberry

Soon to own steakhouses, glowin' like makeover thousand
Them them niggas, robbin from Pinkhouse's
Show and prove, knockin off cab drivers
God, sodomize money, ring two hundred thousand
See the color of the carved out Wu emblem
Baby, it's all designers, tailor-made Wu gooses
Limousine, automatic new uzi's in 'em yo
Relax, cousin just cruise through, jewels with him

Move up the block, giant box blast my song
Non-stop strictly hip-hop, march on
Doo-rag hang long, metal tape is high-bias
Graphics, captured with the colorful, iris
I zoom in, while the listeners tune in
Some assumin' they paid dues and joined the union
Lost nigga couldn't rumble in this wild jungle
Quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble
Divine Master, threw on the track that made 'em bleed
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed
This powerful magnet, that left 'em stagnant
Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments
Un-filled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise
Starlight scope, with the night vision device
Splendid marksman, that'll shoot the one off the dice

Why you got your ass on your shoulders
Now, tryin' to spit at a bitch
I lead inside
Why you got your ass on your shoulders

[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah bitch put on an outfit, dazzle ya hair
Come in the club fit to take you home and frazzle the hair
Bitch understand I must have got a handle in here
Why you open up ya ass and let me travel in there
Create a scandal in there
Don't talk, let me pull it out to add another angle in there
Let me ride the back of yo ass like a camel in there
Pussy hot like she lit a fuckin' candle in there
Remember I was tryin' to get my drink in the slot
And you was same girl actin' all stinkin' the spot
It was funny how I thought I wasted breath on the broad
A friend couldn't find her cause shorty left with the God
And then I took her back to the crib, you can figure it out
I'm diggin' it out with the dick in her mouth
Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out
And swingin' about until I start kickin' em' out
Because ya

I'm sayin' she fuck a nigga like she want the God to lay in a hearse
Makin' me curse, hope you relate to my verse
And what be makin' it worse
That they be the same bitches frontin' like they wasn't with it at first
Actin' too good for niggas with your ass on your shoulders
But now you'll be fuckin' a nigga till he fall in a coma
I remember how you acted in the front of ya friends
As I remember now you give me head in front of my Benz
So now I'm smackin' it up, while you backin' it up
With a car load of bitches now I'm packin' it up
Now ya whole crew comin' and we whackin' em' up
Let me beat the pussy till I start blackin' it up
Got bitches diggin' in my back scratchin' it up
Got em' screamin' shatterin' glass crackin' it up

Sayin' in ya crib gettin' ya shit right sprayin' yourself
With perfume that mean the dude start playin' yourself
Ya too fly to let ya friends know ya lovin' a nigga
So instead ya front like you ain't really fuckin' a nigga
But still I really love to sit on my dough
And there's nothin' I love when ya keep ya shit on the low

Yo me and my niggas and my clique be getting mad cream
Balling the club, now I'm drunk having a bad dream
This motherfucker tried to greet me with wealth
I never knew that I would see that day that I would meet the devil himself
This nigga was eagerly waiting to prove it
Astonishingly, already dancing to his own burial music
Well anyway, he plottin' to do it to me
In a certain kind of way, and started off directly popping shit to me
While he spoke a couple of fires would spark
While he sat in the shadow talking his shit we watch the sky getting dark (he said)

[Devil]
Where it hurts
I'll leave you in a straight up leaking in the back of a church
Let a ghosting crib and haunt you like a ghost in your home
Leaving you old and crippet like them ruins in Rome
Watch your body shrivel up and turn your asses to smoke
Fuck your flesh don't get yo blood sucked, the blood of ya foes
I be that nigga that'll torture your spouse
And leave a thousand body bags like truth.com in front of your house

[Busta]
Got me bugging on a whole another level
Tell me how the fuck a nigga really end up having beef with the devil
Shit bomb the whole effect the nigga had on my dreaming
Body reacting mentally, going to war with the demon
Seem like the typical storm
So embellished in the dream a nigga felt it in the physical form
The dream got my nose runny and shit
Eyes watery, shorty watching my body twitch funny and shit
Giving shorty sleeping with me the creeps
She bugging off how a nigga just sweating and breathing so hard in his sleep
Determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin
Absolutely focused on killing the demon within
So now we fight in the name of my brethren
And every blow connect during the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven,
Ain't hell a deep breath of fresh air
The devil's presence blows a cold draft leaving a scent of death in the air
While my mind was reassembling now
Simultaneous wifey watching a nigga body trembling now
Couldn't conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead
Stabbing a nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head
Yo its funny how the devils'll test us
But if fully select, niggas bless with something some'll raggle with impressions
Til I'm dead I'm always battling through
You can't believe you cut my main vein that all my blood be traveling through
Somebody gotta die, settle the score
Because it's me or this nigga, I'm fighting to the death, I'm ready for WAR",Bad Dreams,2001

While we continuously stay sculpturing bombs
Love unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggaz I'ma die trying for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear crying for y'all
Back to the foundation, taking you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginning and a brand new hunger
Starving to where my skin was suffocating my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decorating my crib
Touch the love I got like you holding my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real
Flipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware
Too late for turning back my nigga cause we taking it there

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Genesis, Genesis, Genesis
And leave!

And leave a mark until it's deep in the floor
Y'all niggas fucked up never should've let let me get my feet in the door
And then I step through, fuck wiping my feet at the door 
I be the deacon I'm beating niggas and speaking the raw
Strictly raw shit is what niggas be seeking me for
Testing my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step, for sure
Rep and make you want to accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like something that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doing it, these motherfuckers probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feeling of people like the coming of Jesus
While a lot of other niggas don't be telling you nothing
That be the same bullshit that's always pushing my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearing smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggaz like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life
Ahead of you son!
A whole new thing starting for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world farting for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggas trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggas from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggas to my live niggas everywhere
Too late for turning back, we taking it there

The freak bitches try to hit me with math
Brushing off wack niggas while them same bitches giving me ass, yo

Yeah.. wife in law, my bitch for the triflin whore
Type of bitch to make a nigga get the right things for
Bitch sexy, and beautiful, and gangsta, and golden
Love to fuck a nigga till the pussy dry and swollen
My lil' bitch had a figure like a wine glass
Slim bitch stackin like a muhfucker with a fine ass
Word to mother; bitch nasty like me
Love to fuck a nigga in places where people could see
The bitch send a chill like cold freezin a nigga
The way she holdin and bitin and suckin and squeezin a nigga
Down and dirty bitch never dick teasin a nigga
Got her own paper and focused on pleasin a nigga
She ain't out for gettin a nigga or fuckin my life
She only wanna fuck a nigga while he fuckin his wife
There was nuttin she couldn't achieve
In the mornin bitch was across the street waitin for wifey to leave
Called me on the cell while the wife was runnin a bath
She can't wait for me to fuck her, till I cum in her ass
Just a long-time chick I used to fuck from the past
She love to out-fuck a nigga, see how long I could last
It be nice the way she always let me dig in her rib
The bitch fuck a nigga like she wanna move in my crib
Bitch I always knew ya ass was a star
In the daytime, whippin the droptop, givin me head in my car

[Chorus - Jaheim]
When a woman needs love, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that you don't
Cuz she will fool around, just like you do
Ohh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that she won't

C'mere bitch and place ya pussy right where it belong
And put me in the mood to fuck just like a Jodeci song
I love the little freaky shit you be approachin me on
Dick all in ya mouth, you know what type of shit I be on
The way the pussy lock feel like we about to be stuck
All outside busy, givin me the balcony fuck
Hold on get up off of me quick
Bitch grab the X.O. and suck the Hennessey up off of my dick
So quick, so fast, bitch'll come out her skirt
Fuck a nigga till it hurt, while the wifey at work
The bitch'll even call her girl so I can fuck with her friend
And fall asleep to wake up and start fuckin again
Straigh nasty little bitch no horsin around
The bitch even want me to fuck her when she walkin around
Hold up, it's kinda ill how we be workin the caper
She ain't only good for pussy, she be givin me paper
Wife-in-law, my bitch be always keepin it raw
Always slidin out before the wifey walk in the door
They way she fuck me on straight for the night
Wifey still ain't make it home, I wonder if she workin late for tonight
Wifey actin funny style but I ain't fuckin with that
She ain't call the crib so I wonder where wifey was at
Hmmm.. shit kinda had me buggin before
But now I laugh because wifey had a husband-in-law

Off into my walked dawn missions, why?
'cause the brothers that I knew with the rise drove by
Only nice in the days looking down the road
Seeing beautiful girls with the car load
Yeah yeah yeah they are screaming,
Wish I had a little ride on my own,
But since I don't there is my sobb story
My missions will continue as I keep on stalking
Stamina was dying from the constant walking
Right before the moment I began to car to my man Ridle
Who had a some moving on
I thought he wouldn't know that's my dying
Where are the others nammy you beat and kept driven
Now in my heart they do a big hole
'cause my little, little, little toes
Started jumping on my end soul
It was frigity burn and then I said wait, I got pride
It's time to get my own ride
I came up with the scheme and got paid
I had no other choice but go at knowledge of tray
When I got my transport, I got kind of steam G up
'cause I got cherry pet further
Now I'm feeling good 'cause I'm off my feet,
Man the little squalid dogs running up in the street
And they saying:
My name is Sharina, my name is Busta
My name is Tonia, my name is Busta
My name is Dianna, my is Busta
And what do you take me for the little loco push over
No shame in my game 'cause that's how I got this

And now I am the man fielding all the glory

Figure out vehicle-brother, to give me a ride
""sorry, Charlie"" was a coming reply
I didn't forget about the girl in the sidekick
The rubber don't system in the swallow kid
See drive by with the posse, ooh ah, ooh ah, ooh ah
Hey Charlie Brown, where you go?
Well I have to purchase to get
Smoke from the rubber word up to my neck
Girls wear goochie and their friends way fendy
Wall ally a walker to get fairly
Just a beep beep an occasional way
The table's turn, now she got play
Lunchtime Marty and Deon
Jonhy Guills, Diego story, and Dacon
Sitting and waiting for about to biggy these
I stack by the Crackerjacks just through delieve
Stress it's a mess I decided to work
But it's hard to work when your boss is a jerk
I sweat floors and drive to get mine

Chorus 
Repeat

Now I remember Rod when he first got his sobb
Didn't have a job and his car was a mob more brothers
He never knew from jack and when his car win flact 
They wouldn't inject
And when his car was in the shop they wouldn't stop buy
They've say ""hi"" on the reply but back came Rob
To the same old game
""hee-hee yo, what's up to y'all, want to hang?""
""yeah sure"" they said on the quick fast
""by the way anybody got money for gass?""
""nah, not me""
""I don't, don't ask""
""I got it, come on""
""watch out, we gonna crash!""
Roll away now Rob just walking like me

Ans some say MV I say all empty
And now he just walking my sobb story

Now motherfucking case closed
The shit blow your speaker, keep turning your base low
Spaz out because I motherfucking say so
Before I blow this bitch like we down in Waco
Thick in cock diesel, that's the way we roll
Big truck shit, even my bitch whipping the Range Rov'
We 'bout to skyrocket and the way we go
The way the bitches looking love the way we blow
Check it, we light shit up like Broadway yo
The crack-head rappers better just say no
Before I turn stupid and back the heat slow
Lay and wait for niggas in the back street yo
Weak flow, take your shit like I'm coming to Repo
Create a crowd scene and stack a bunch of people
We busting through the doors, shooting through your peephole
The shoot that never miss is like shooting a free throw

Fifty keys with large proportions
Caught a few niggas on money extortions
Niggas snitch, F.B.I. is hawkin
Call Johnny Cochran, yo this nigga is walking
Shit, we got to close down the club
Me and my cousin Bust, we like Crockett and Tubbs
Pushing Lambo's, big chains and dubs
Lead the Flipmode security with snubs
Upping club levels, hundred G's and up
And if them ducks rollin Bust I'm beatin it up
The streets ain't safe, yo we heatin it up
The party's on smash, now we tweakin it up
The bitches want this dick so they eatin it up

We like a pack of dogs that come to take a nigga food

C'mon, yea, check it 

I said my solo jump off, been booming since nine-six 
My solo jump off, been booming since nine-six 
Hitting tripping the circuit breaker, flicking the light switch 
The kid like is he known for giving you wild hits 
I keep my name on the way on top of the now list 
Banging on every level, dropping the now shit 
It's like the feeling after watching a couple of flick 
And once you hear the kid, you'll be knowing the sound sick 
Spaz in the club, watching the crowd flip 
That's when I knew the crown was up for whoever the crown fit 
Nowadays while I go bag me a fine bitch 
Bitch watching my pocket, seeing we wild rich 
Shorty hoping we smelling nothing like foul fish 
While you swinging ass at the devil, claiming you righteous 
A lot of haters I'm knowing you like this 
While you floss unnecessarily, sipping on wild Crist' 

[Chorus] 
I say ladies, my Mercedes
Hold fo' in the back, two if you fat 
Feel it all in your gut, your neck and your back 
When you step up in the club I know you know how to act 
Hey soldiers, get your floss on 
Va-let in the lot, park the Yukon 
Shorty shaking her waist, and ripping her thong 
Now all my people are mugging and singing the song, I'm saying
Shit still booming in two-thousand and three 
My shit still booming in two-thousand and three 
And we don't give a fuck about who you claiming to be 
My jewels blind bitches where they ain't able to see 
These fools try to talk just a little much to a G 
They say the wrong shit, they head just might end upside of a tree 
Clear my thoughts just a little, pass me a cup of tea 
Taking different constant boats, from the land to the sea 
I got my paper see, I ain't doing nothing for free 
Unless it's for the hood, it might cost you a small fee 
Niggaz all in the street, while I'm whipping the V 
Clever from New York to Chicago back to the D 
Check it, take it back like when I was flipping a key 
Boning chicks, holding titties like they was Pamela Lee 
You know I mastered the art and got it down to a tee 
And keep it going add enough spice, we holding the recipe 
Big paper we making, all of my crew agree 
Stack more and bust up a bottle of Hennessy 
In case you niggas ain't even knowing my pedigree 
Invested in resorts for the niggas who go and ski 
If you ain't know the streets is belonging to me 
I get my people from the hood and then take 'em all on a shopping spree
While you niggas is busy copping the pleas 
We busy blowing fronting like you ain't knowing my stee'

A-yo, inside the ghetto or in a sunny meadow
I'mma make you move whether woman or fellow
Yo, I got the medals in the warfield of respect
Like an ill porno make ya body get wet
Just a ghetto child trying to live a straight and narrow
Hoping that my shit will pierce your dome like an arrow
I'm sure it will, especially if it's God's will

All you negative feelings standing on two feet
While I make the hotties move to the hip-hop beat
You know it's realer killer, realer than you can imagine
Using every source of pain in my range to make it happen
If I make it happen, that means I'm making motion
And I'm doing my thing causing an ill commotion
Everybody do the hop, make it smooth like lotion
I lay up in the piece on a incognotion

You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Now everybody here, you do the hop
You going up to cop, Uptown for a brick, don't stop
You gotta come back and do the hop

If it ain't Das EFX then they sounding like Meth
You might as well do Megadeth
Y'all punk MCs better save your freaking breath
You's a corny motherfucker
You must be high smoking dust with Chris Tucker
Y'all faggot asses don't want this
I pull more peeps than the peeps at the premier of Pocohantas

And all you honies out there, word is bond, you know my status
So come and pull your panties down
This ain't the Barnum Bailey show, I don't get down with the clowns
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends
But don't bring your ass by and you ain't got no ends
Word is bond it don't stop
Just ease your mind, come along and do the hop

You gotta do the hop, you move to the beat, you don't stop
Come on everybody, do the hop
Even if you cop, you gotta come back and do the hop
You move to the beat, you don't stop
You smoking jub rocks, you gotta just stop and do the hop
Then you come back and do the hop
You know we don't stop, we on the ghetto prize on the top

I'ma stand as a man never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And that ill shit about it

To talk the truth to you
Listen, I'm never home

Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigga-ma-ro

Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me

We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from Lucy's and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older

And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

I will climb a mountain high
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world you never leave me
Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy

Has determined, that the sounds you about to hear
Can be devastating, to your ear, to your mind
To your body, to your soul!

[Chorus]
You better, pack up your bags, better get out of town
'Cause when the God come you know he gon' be putting it down
Everything we do be blowing, better get on the ground
It ain't safe no more, it ain't safe no more (nigga)
He keeps it wicked by creating the sound
That make the people want to spaz 'til they give him the crown
Fuck around you'll turn up missing just to never be found
It ain't safe no more, it ain't safe no more (nigga)

Bodies'll turn up missing, I promise you need to listen
Abolish the need for bitching, I polish and shine and glisten
Demolishing while I'm whistling, astonished while you're witnessed
Hardest to smash another artist son, regardless if it is

A nigga who think he the greatest son I'll lock him in the fridge
And hang him from both of his ankles when we drop him from the bridge
Blocking your paper really stopping that dude from getting his
Popping the safe and splurging, having the crew up in the crib

Block 'til these niggas having 'em rocking gargle with a bib
Shitting and farting, spitting and vomiting all in the crib
Falling into shock from the bullets we shot up in they ribs
Hot up the block and blew up the spot and got up out the mix

Tried it a couple stops and spotted the Squad up in they whips
Plotted and then I signed on the dotted line and made a wish
Return us even the hardest making you garbage niggas sit
The smartest now you a target only the heartless niggas win

[Chorus]

You can't believe can you, I'm calling my dog Nathaniel
And balling with all my mans you'll be blowing and all will hand you
Accordingly or disorderly bullets are sure to bang you
Considerably my 9 milli hit you at any angle

Shooting, shooting, shooting, high, low, vertical or horizontal
And if you were making plans I do think you gon' have to cancel
Sorry I had to ask you, save it I have to blast you
Taking a chance to laugh from you making the masses gas you

So now you thinking that you tough and that we can't get at you
Change up your mind and leave you stiffer than a massive statue
Tired of talking need to use all your precautionary measures
Washing off the blood hauling the water force of steady weather

You can handle it or you can't, it be only getting better
Like a candle, we burn your chandles and make you feel the pressure
Cocking it back, articulating the flow just like a lecture
Break it down and rebuilding the flow, now peep the architecture

[Chorus]

It ain't safe., in the current state, of our democracy
Terrorism, motherfuckers bombing New York, shit is crazy
It ain't safe no more!

The most unsafe thing, is that, niggas ain't seeing, the God coming

It's Flipmode baby, yea, come on
We bout to cause a riot nigga

[Busta Rhymes]
Got a lot of niggas rollin' with ya holla
Cause you know we ripped it hotter than them other niggaz
Spot a nigga getting dollars not another nigga
can do it the way that we cocked and shot another nigga
Think he deserved the way he was boppin with a cherry copper
glitter blood fella send a cop to get 'em
It's funny the way the iron just to drop you quicker
Why I hit y'all with the fire, think I got a winner
Stacking a crib with a chick that make a proper dinner
Black in the range with tint, and chrome aqua spinnin'
Parked right next to the Benz with a soap opera and the TV
up in the dash co-starring a opera singer
That be the type of bullshit I be on and stay hot
I stop whippin' a Bentley to whip a Mercedes Maeboch
And keep runnin' around the street like my name was Mel Patch nigga
Come through your hood and take your whole block, come on
And while we give it to ya

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
While with me (Come on)
My niggas stack money to the sky with me (Come on)
My niggas in the place need to riot with me (Come on)
And set the whole fire with me (Come on)
All of my ladies in the beauty salon look bomb put yo shit on
And wait up in the line for me (Come on)
You come all in the party lookin' fine for me (Come on)
Holdin 'Gnac spill a little red wine for me

Let's cause a riot
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo (Come on)

It's bout to get a little bit better, start to get a little cheddar
Pack a big Beretta
Check a nigga resume doin' a alphabet-ah
Go order and brandish the metal hid into ya leather
No matter or whether or not you wearin' a vest
So you got your hand on the cannon I got a bigger plan for ya
Call up my mans for ya, now watch you vanish
Makin' you family ask for ya
You think you family pay a couple of grand for ya?
Like you afraid to hold a mac, like you were made to hold a gat
We made a hole and quickly dug out all the sand for ya
The heat'll be makin' you put it on the glass shorty
Wiggle somethin' and get to showin' a little ass for me (Bling!)
Now lets get on and open smokin' and blast for thee
Niggas will really want it and fill the capacity
You muthafuckin' know it has to be
The way we touch it y'all niggas knowing exactly who the master be
And while we give it to ya

Busta Rhymes,"[Chorus]
Now this is the tale of a murderer who comes from the caucus cliffs
(busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
He robbed and stole and killed for greed and packed us on slave ships
(busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
He took us off to stolen lands it seemed like hell for sure
(busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
With the crack and the guns, death and disease they called for you and your
(busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
No whips no brew no weed to smoke not a single luxury
If not for the bloodshed that it cost the struggle would be lost
(busta) say it again
The struggle would be lost
(busta) say it again
The struggle would be lost
(busta) say it again
The struggle would be lost
(busta) say it again
The struggle would be lost
(busta) say it again
The struggle would be lost

[Verse 1]
The struggle will be lost
If you continue to do the shit you be doin' with disloyalty nigga
Now that explains why in each ward you avoiding me nigga
Knowing now it takes nothing to be destroying a nigga
Conditioned with a mind to shit on your brother
Flossing with jewelry and whips just like a dick and still live with your mother
Copping shit that superceded your salary 
Where is your loyalty to your own blood and taking care of your family
Funny how you sit and drink what you drink
Thinking the foulest shit and not even knowing why you think how you think
Must be the reason why we aren't aware
Because the devil know how guilty and filthy he is in all his affairs
Fucking with my mind when I was a youngster
Cause he know if we knew the truth we'd make his ass run from amongst us
That's why we thinking that it's better to ball 
While the devil be sitting and watching plotting how to murder us all
Now this

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Hey yo
That's why I'm hustling harder
Now I'm in a huddle seeing the struggle in my mother and father
That's why my persona will come with such a karma to be getting this paper
Cause I ain't with the slavery labor 
A lot of niggas in the hood probly relate to me greater 
Than those that believe when they die they going to meet the creator that's crazy
How we become slaves 
To mental death and power that comes with becoming even more of a dumber ass
The devil robbing you blind 
Concealing the truth from niggas while we be struggling they murder the mind
The wickedness sneak on you quicker when they creep from behind 
Continue to speak the truth ?til it weaken your spine
Now check it
The jewel I give you be the beat the beat for the time
You can't see it like you living on a street for the blind
Young whitty hustler niggas that stick with the grind
Fly cuisine food poisoned cause you eatin' the swine
I stay struggling and doin' for delf
Then I dig in my body deeper and do a little knowledge of self
They wonder why they catch a nigga on the weed sell
Better be careful what you saying on them e-mails
Now listen
They got your mind in a prison 
You can do whatever you want but focus if you desire to listen
As I say it I hope you feelin' the wrath
Create a hammer to make a man that a beat you in the head with the math 
Now this

Listen, I am the sun, I am the sea
I am the land, I am the tree

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Roll out the red carpet baby the god has come
No matter who you are or where you from
Check it I stay be repin the street and reppin the slum
And while you co-starrin' this movie I star is the one, listen
You never imagined that I would become one of the most incredible
Until when ever I'm done
Notice the god like meet you from when I was young
Blessed with such a maculess flow and a venomous tongue
How we keep you holla until you collapse on the lung
With the biggest followin' the nigga slacking a nun
Able to move a mountain of niggas having then sprung
Just check out my women but how be having then strung ass though
Like how the coke be having them numb
Run up in the spot like I was holding and clappin' the gun
Now I'm lose for y'all I'm bringing the proof to y'all
Balling and specking the truth to y'all

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
The chorus is singin' the words that I fill in my gut
That's why I always step with a bop and walk with a strut
And I always rep for the block and we all for the bucks
And we always step in the spot and be all for the cut
Vallet block two parkin' spots all for the turck
Bounce to the world when I be tired and be gone for the month
And it's all for the slut flowin' like a force of the water
Keepin' it running so were the niggas be at
Well they seeing me commin'
Summers people keep it clapin' women just give me they lovin'
They way the streets be fillin' the kid they really be buggin'
Like I'm there dearly beloved my soldiers really be thuggin
Or how I really be slugging' the ball out the ball park
Keep them whilin' then ten minutes later then it's sawed off
Create a small spark then down to the levels to make the walls stark
Testin' the God I think he be needin' them all off

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes]
Listen
I keeps the hustle up in my vain
Cause it's all in my blood
Fell my pain
Fell my love
Fellin' niggas struggle till the other one

[Chorus: x3]

Getin' to struttin' like the G.O.D.
Listen

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I'm sayin' we comin' through when I'm blockin' the light
Niggas think they rockin' the crowd but ain't rockin' it right
Make the people shout to the sound and rock for the night
Cause I stay in the struggle ready rock for the fight
I stay whipin' the truck and leanin' and rock what I like
And quadruple my money more than the block of the white
We sayin' we bout ? stopin' your rooms
How I be rockin' the diamonds like I'm dropin them jewels

Hey yo yo yo yo
It was the first shine on the day of my birth I entered the earth blind,
Funerabole to everything I would first find,
Condition of beating nigga's having the wurst mind,
Becoming weak like we scavengers of the wurst kind,
From having nothing to plot and making the earth mine, making the earth mine,
That's kinda big aspirations for a nigga that's just kinda got on his first grind,
But it's alright cause I'm blowing hold on my first shine,
Kinda gas quicker than spas ready to burst mine,
And though it seems like obstacles come at the wurst time,
Going from being successful to committing the wurst crime,
So quick like a bitch massaging ya whole dick and busting up,
And it's over sabotaging ya own shit,
We always good when we get it and then abuse and regret it,
Cause it's quick as we get it we fucking lose it,
That's what my mother used to tell me.

[Chorus]

Seeing a flash that could take it from you like hocus-spocus,
So count your blessings and baby I hope you stay in focus,
Wide awake like I'm drinking cappuccino mucus,
Taking on more stress and get to be come and smoke us,
Hhhee, like the shit that the setup straight provoc us,
And fall ripped them to the shit till it's light full and choke it,
A promise you find truth when you done digging it out,
Stop the shiffering nigga I think I'd just figured it out,
You see we thug visicily and mentally soft keep lies to yourself,
So that your worth and value is lost,
Sometime the feeling of the city is wrong,
Why we appriciet them all nnow tupac & biggie is gone,
Somehow I'm seeing it clear I would have rather this value,
Them so much as both of these nigga's is here yeah,
We always good when we get it and then abuse and regret it,
Cause it's quick as we get it we fucking lose it, listen

[Chorus]

Yo that's what my mother used to always tell me,
Extend your hand for the worry and blessing if they need you,
Never take life fore granted and bite the hand that feeds you,
Be causios how you treath people and how the people feel you,
Respect niggas or else the karmarus is coming to kill you,
You got it good baby just get your shit together,
Before you lose it and it's over and gone forever,
Dressed for the stormy weather feel the songs,
For everyone is personal like I was just writing myself a letter,
A lot of niggas is wilding and calling a name with disrespect,
Cashing and blighting and trowing salt in the game I'm saying,
I'm dealing with logic I hope you ain't thinking I'm rude,
Lets stop ruin the greatest thing that's been given us food,
Cloth and a shelter when its cold whe be staying warm,
Imaging if they just take the music and rap was gone,
We always good when we get it and then abuse it,
I wont let it cause precious and I ain't ready to lose it, listen",Till It's Gone,2002

Keep the shit that make them sniffing, make them open their nose
Got them fucked up stuck just like they striking a pose

From keeping niggas whiling while they driving smacking the pole

Hating niggas blab holding me back

Must be holding a strap
Because how we coming through you know its a wrap
Moving a crew of gorilla dudes you know when to clap
I blow some shit from of of the earth or the face of the map
Yo, so take that
Once we give it to you ain't no faking or jack
It's funny how you find your face in a trap
Little bitch nigga fronting like he ready to scrap
You better off acting pussy trying to give me your dat
Staying focused overfilling a dream
The way we spark up this bitter fire the flame probably killing your team

Fuck it, so now we hover helicopters, turn this shit up
And you and your peoples ain't hearing me proper
I'm saying

[Chorus]",Turn Me Up Some,2002
Busta Rhymes,"Aiyyo Mega' gimme some of that barefoot jungle shit
and let me shake a leg nigga! (Megahertz)

Let's give it to 'em
Yo, let's give it to 'em
Yo, let's give it to 'em
Busta Bust, let's give it to 'em
Flipmode, let's give it to 'em

[Verse One]
Ever felt the fire burn like this (burn like this)
You shocked that I've returned like this
Stern like shit'll make you firm like this
see'mon, while we make the bitches yearn like this
Pearl white shit'll make the world hype quick
and earl like knowing I'm boning your girl like this
Act sweet (boy) nigga we pack heat so (back boy)
Stack money like a Backstreet Boy
Track sheet, never whack, bitches hitting in my back seat
Love my flick up in the Black Beat boy
So move your black feet boy, make bitches bounce to this
Don't let me have to let the mac speak boy
Track meet boy, hundred meter dash, straight to the trash
You corny rhyming on them whack beats boy (c'mon)
And you know we rock on and on
And make the bitches want to bounce, all night long and
And to my getting money niggas keep balling (c'mon)
You know we bout to take it to the next morning

[Chorus: x2]
Get your big ass on the floor!
You know we goin' do it to ya (alright)
You know we goin' do it to ya (alright)
You know we doin' do it to ya (alright) nigga 

Get your big ass on the floor, see'mon!
[Verse Two]
The Range Ro' and everything you see is paid fo' nigga, see'mon
Change flow and then we lay low
Chase mo' money, fuck I want to waste dough fo'
Stack peso, big money know my small money
probably bigger than your whack payroll
Money get your hands off of me, dance all night
Break bitches hot and sweaty take your tight pants off for me
So horny, shorty pull your plans off on me
Whyling out, while shorty ditching her mans off for me
So simple, there go the champagne glass
When your pour, make sure the whole entire thing full
Sinful! Still shorty putting the something on me
Brushing on me, whyling and feeling and touching on me
What you play fo'?  When I hop up in my two do'
Great sex and do it, say no mo' 
Make those, know nigga we got heat big
Block sheets and shit and stay up on the hot street though 
Get high shit  fly bitches running the flo'
Hollering and screaming this my shit! 
Count that in the amounts that amount to the ceiling
I know you love the way we bounce back nigga
Gimme my ounce back nigga, Flipmode back in the spot
You can run and go announce that nigga, see'mon

[Chorus]
Get your big ass on the floor
You know we going",We Goin' to Do It to Ya,2002
Busta Rhymes,"[Chorus]
Branded, scorned is the one who ran
What do you do when your branded? And you know you're a man.
Wherever you go, for the rest of your life
You must prove, you're a man

See now I'm back wit the force, read about the kid
From the front to the back of The Source
You see me back on the course
Scream on every beat until my voice get crackled and horse
Front seat niggas never sit in the back wit a boss
Fuck the fact that it cost, the price tag of the Porsche
Will cost ya life, have ya mother feel an immaculate loss
But of course, come and speak to the best
And watch me spit a jewel sharper to carve the meat of your flesh
You looking weak in the chest, you see the street is a test
Women on the stoop smoking holding a seed to they breast
You see the street is a mess
Struggling holding a couple pounds of weed then the rest
Now I proceed to the rest of my niggas keeping it fresh, 
Though we must stay on the grind I supersceded the stress, 
We always seem to finesse from the East to the West,
You Know we w-w-we keep the teflon from the street to the vest
Kill that nigga slow like how you get defeated in chess
Got you under pressure, hairline receded effects
Hot air niggas I only feel the heat from your breath, 
Rap niggas beef in they album probably needed the press
And as a man I never found the slightest need to impress
Another man because I'm proud and I believe that I'm blessed
But yo I always found the need to address these weaker niggas
That speak to the street always keeping the people abreast 
Now you've been branded

[Chorus]

Higher science and I'm changing the crime in, 
Watch my son 'cause you'd be fucking wit the child of a Giant
I'm in a place stuck between being loving and violent, [voice switch]
Becoming more of a threat when I move subtle and silent, 
Then set it off to be the only one to quiet the riot
My destiny's the only thing between the sky and the pilot, 
Relate, it's like busting a 3-8
Be late, I be taking most of the brick leaving a pile outta shape
I never quit watching these niggas try to hide they mistake, 
Taking a shit watching they body floating by in the lake
Make it quick you weak niggas better try to escape,
And create the quickest way to reach the fire escape. 
Snitch niggas always quick to go and lie on a tape, 
But it's o-k 'cause Super Hero niggas die wit a cape, 
It's so great to watch them finally break, stand aside from the fake
Street niggas gotta slide for the take
Being broke and not being able to buy me a steak
Stacking my paper so see now I can buy an estate, 
So I rely on the love and I reply to the hate
So much pain in the struggle my whole body'll ache, come on,
From the gates, so awake that was the plan of my fate
Now I'm straight, got me my own knife and fork on my plate
Want to scorch a debate, wait, do me a favor nigga just remember
The date, cause you been

[Chorus]",What Do You Do When You're Branded,2002
Busta Rhymes,"feat. Meka
The Surgeon General.. of the Flipmode Squad..
has determined.. that the sounds you about to hear..
can be devestatin'... to your ear.. to your mind..
to your body.. to your soul!

[Chorus]
You better, pack up your bags, better get out of town
'Cause when the God come you know he gon' be puttin it down
Everything we do be blowin, better get on the ground
It ain't safe no more, it ain't safe no more (n****)
He keeps it wicked by creatin the sound
That make the people want to spaz 'til they give him the crown
F*** around you'll turn up missin just to never be found
It ain't safe no more, it ain't safe no more (n****)

Bodies will turn up missin', I promise you need to listen
Abolish the need for b****in, I polish and shine and glisten
Demolishin' while I'm whistlin', astonished while you're witnessed
Hardest to smash another artist son, regardless if it is

A n**** who think he the greatest son I'll lock him in the fridge
And hang him from both of his ankles when we drop him from the bridge
Blockin' your paper really stoppin' that dude from gettin' his
Poppin' the safe and splurgin', havin' the crew up in the crib

Block 'til these n****z havin' 'em rockin' gargle with a bib
S***tin and fartin', spittin' and vomitin' all in the crib
Fallin' into shock from the bullets we shot up in they ribs
Hot up the block and blew up the spot and got up out the mix

Tried it a couple stops and spotted the Squad up in they whips
Plotted and then I signed on the dotted line and made a wish
Return us even the hardest makin' you garbage n****z sit
The smartest now you a target only the heartless n****z win

[Chorus]

You can't believe can you, I'm callin' my dog Nathaniel
And ballin' with all my mans you'll be blowin' and all will hand you
Accordingly or disorderly bullets are sure to bang you
Considerably my 9 milli hit you at any angle

Shootin', shootin', shootin' - high, low, verticle or horizontal
And if you were makin' plans I do think you goin' have to cancel
Sorry I had to ask you, save it I have to blast you
Takin a chance to laugh from you makin' the ma**es gas you

So now you thinkin' that you tough and that we can't get at you
Change up your mind and leave you stiffer than a massive statue
Tired of talkin' need to use all your precautionary measures
Washin' off the blood haulin' the water force of steady weather

You can handle it or you can't, it be only gettin' better
Like a candle, we burn your chandles and make you feel the pressure
C***in it back, articulatin' the flow just like a lecture
Break it down and rebuildin' the flow, now peep the architecture

[Chorus]

It ain't safe.. in the current state.. of our democracy
Terrorism.. motherf***ers bombin' New York.. s*** is crazy
It ain't safe no more!
All these rappin' n****s goin' at other rappin' n****z heads
S*** is crazy! But most importantly..
The most unsafe thing.. is that.. n****z ain't seein, the God comin

Snort whatever you snort, we comin' up court
You know we never comin' up short
So fuck what you thought

We high profile for this shit, I smile for this shit
I stack dough and make all my people just wil' for this shit
Hold it now, we rollin' it down, we holdin' it down
Thick money, foldin' it down in a hole in the ground
Stash more loot than before, a brute from before
Tell the truth and get used to leavin' you boots at the door

We four, five, sixin' it up, we fixin' it up
We keep the bitches strippin' the way we be mixin' it up
Come out from wherever you are, whoever you are
Incredible performance, their so unforgettable star
They'll never find the get because I threw the barreta too far

Rap nigga puttin' out rock-n-roll tracks
Anything with wheels, playa I drove that
Y'all, six, Swizz and Busta back

I be hearin' that I'm drugged out
Because I be bangin' them beats like I'm drugged out
I threw gerdems on the bus, threw the dubs out
One, niggas gettin' robbed when the clubs out
Dog, and it gets ugly, and the hood loves me
And your chick know me, plus your man owes me

That clown don't pay
They straight killin' homie
Y'all don't gotta like me, screw y'all, blow me

I put my foot in your ass just like a kung-fu flick
Bust my tool quick hittin' with the force of a mule kick
Spit fly shit as if I was baggin' a new chick
Instead of bitin' mines, it be best you bite on the chew stick
Funny how niggas be tryin' to do shit
When I rock a light bling all my pinky gleam in the blue shit

Bitches lovin' the way we always pass through shit
The way we rep the gutter and bring you the brand new shit
Double back, y'all niggas don't really want to trouble that
Brass knuckle beat you stupid, with a belt buckle rap
Couple cracks, some weed, back when we used to muscle that
And take a niggas shit like we like we fightin' to get our hustle back

Used to be the shit, now you writin' your suicidal rap
Frontin' like your the champ, fightin' to get your title back
Remind me that, this could even cause a homicidal act
And if you blamin' the music then watch me write the title track
The way that we kill and make you wanna cop that
Fuckin' with corny niggas you need to stop that shit

Come on, please just let a nigga pop that shit
All in they trunk, you know you want to rock that
Stay reppin' the struggle, busy pullin' my man's up
Shit we givin' y'all niggas might even swell y'all glands up
Stop, all of my niggas, all of my bitches stand up
And rep whatever you reppin' and put your fuckin' hands up

Yeah, Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
I came in the game, profane no image
I came in the game, with a name
I was given from a mayn who ain't give a fuck about his child-ren
I proclaim the name though, never in vain no
Watch the change grow, a young nigga who didn't gain from fame
Copped the Range Ro', now they want my brains on the main road
They don't understand what I came for
How I came fo', with a million sold
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold
Gettin money like Ross Perot
I'm often told, a coffin's the routes I go
Oh that's the road you on, oh no
I'm down for the rifle, tone the fo fo
Don't ever try to send a nigga home, no no
I know you wanna catch me at Sunoco
Show me that your loco put holes in my photo
NOPE!, HOPE!, hold toast, no jokes, send slugs through your Polo
Just cause our thug roll solo
And po' zone grown folk, be a cold negro
Be-low, your grieved up people
Be-lieve that the boy see no evil

Put your people on if y´all know how to keep a secret
When I get money you know I like to keep it
How I get money others are tryin' to peep it

Flip mode, will be winners you want to form a team wit
The big money figures, the ones to plot the scheme wit
The brothers who be used to gettin' money frequent
The ones I would always measure up my triple beams wit

Until they start takin' my people to the precinct
That´s all back in the day yo, that ain't nuttin' recent
'Cause nowadays we see women we like to speak wit
Eat wit, lay ´em down and sleep wit

Type of women make a brother want to keep it
Shorty be so exotic she lookin' decent
Lotta corny niggaz be offerin' whack free shit
I can´t hold the heat no more yo, I gotta release it

What y´all gonna do? Don´t you know we always comin' through, me and my crew
Lemme here you say ""fire it up"" (FIRE IT UP), say ""fire it up"" (FIRE IT UP)

To all my dogs that stay bloody, well around in the five hundred, all day
Lemme here you say ""fire it up"" (FIRE IT UP), say ""fire it up"" (FIRE IT UP)
C´mon

Now every time that I meet a sucka who´s fronted, it´s aight
Gettin' money and everybody want it
Smoke a big blunt, get myself all fucked up
Fall on the floor, gotta call my X-500

Iceburg-5 - where you at??
""No need for alarm, right now I´m cruisin' to the sound of my enhanced CD-ROM""
Hurry up five, yo you know it´s about to get thick
I see this cat away behind my back about to do a stick
""Tell me where you at, I will be there in 10 seconds flat, you know I got your back
I´ll be there just in time to counteract""
Sometimes I might even forget crew, my X-5 bulletproof, I turbo boost
And blast right through in the ceiling and in the roof

Comin' through, hittin' you, and knockin' other suckas tooth´s
Full speed ahead like we runnin a toll booth
Produce more flavor that very fine juice
Call a truce, on me and my people and let loose

All my ladies in the place to be, gettin' money while they next to me, lemme
see, Lemme here you say ""fire it up"" (FIRE IT UP), say ""fire it up"" (FIRE IT
UP)

All my people just wave your hands, gettin' money all across the land, one time
Lemme here you say ""fire it up"" (FIRE IT UP), say ""fire it up"" (FIRE IT UP)

Release the heat, we lettin' loose to the extreme
Me and the Iceburg X-5, bounce from the scene
Recline my seat, rock to the beat
Lyrical artist, microphone scarred up in the heat

Blowin' up the spot that we hittin', know what I mean?
Got you hopin' we keepin' you people up like caffeine
Fly guillotine, seeing everything on my little computer screen
From here to Philippines

Keep it movin', we never run out of gasoline
Gas me, your arson, but lookin' kerosene
Me and my five be runnin' the mission you never seen
Hot shit, makin' ya suckas forever fein

Busta Rhymes,"One two, one two
One one, one two one two
Yo it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down
Yes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound
It go
One one, one two one two

And it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same
And when it comes to ripping mics hey yo it ain't no games
One one, one two one two

Hey yo you know it's Busta Rhymes, ev-ery time
Oh yes, I'm coming wicked with the new design
I'm saying
One one, one two one two

MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body, and the health make me wiser
The tantalizing wordplay yeah that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come, with better, compositions
I write and recite to make good position
In this, rap game here, we engineer
Stabbing up the jam yeah son shit's clear
And I be kicking rhymes in my own damn way
Beating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray
Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to C-Seventy-Three, and C-Seventy-Fo'
Do a little something when I'm out on tour
Coming through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flapping shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last
Let the good times roll, cause we in control
Take you out on your high less you paying a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times toll
Take you out on your high less you paying a toll

Question Why is that, MC's be wack
And major labels wanna sound like crap, hey yo Funk that!
Word to life I'm coming rugged
Cuz once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks Refuse it
Put down the mic kid, cuz you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
The name is Phife Dawg, and I got nuff styles
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swinging what I'm swingin when I swing
I rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle
Rude boy official coming with the ill grammar
Coming back on kids, like Joey Montana
We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty
Mad play, on WKRP in Cincinnati
So lord send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man
An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself
Cause all deez biting MC's, lawd them something else
See I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer ripping parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about feelin what with lead
NEVER MIND DAT MON HERE COME DE DREAD

We coming far far far
Busta Rhymes is coming far far far
Ya know ya hear me Star! Bet your bottom dollah
Right after this jam about one million one two niggaz go follow
Whether it be to-day or to-morrow
Niggas be collaborating sickening you beat them like they father
Oh shit check out what I saying
You know my niggas don't be playing
Once upon a hacking time
I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowing up the spot Just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops,
Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama
Bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings!! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings
But before I be face to face
With my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race

Hey fellas
I think you might want to s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Hey ladies
Put your petroleum jelly on your face
Yo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets
That you knock they ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
Get 'em!

[Nas]
Sitting up drunk, shuffling thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losing focus what a nigga still hustling for
My seed is straight, the fam is settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey touring, my life get boring
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's calling, but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, leaving behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two 9's
Next to me in the Phantom, who lying?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Gotta, try to stay away from creeps
With they bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where feds be laying from a dreadful slaying
Body viewing's at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dude just Mar-salis than Branford
Thinking you're too rich, they want to gun ya
Kidnap ya cause of they hunger, but you fucking with hunters
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit

[Chorus Busta Rhymes: x2]
Fight, fists, dance, sucker
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch yo', big, ass, momma

[Nas]
To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitching shit, all up in your body language
Mean mugging your bitch, cause she leans over
To look closer told you y'all sloppy gangsters saying
""Nas is this and Nas is that""
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foaming at the mouth, losing breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Cause the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, fo' to the stomach
Call more security cause I come off
Anywhere you at you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude that kick it to me
We possess, the recipes for death, cause jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say, ""That's the way you kill a man, avoid the shooting""
Hey

[Chorus]

You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waiting on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
You want to come cut my throat, you want to get rid of me
But before I let it happen them guns gon' start clapping
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns gon' start clapping
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe

Be in hell with Dazel and George just for the hell of it
And I ain't yellow kid, flows hot as kettle get
Now if you ain't fuckin' with that, you must be celibate
Spaz! Just a little, got a sack lookin' fizzle
Little hash in the middle, where it at? In the middle, yup
Mommy if you got a fat ass, make it jiggle, yup
Put it in my next video shot by Little X

And pick up and pack your shit up, homey, it's time to move
While I'm singin', ma, do you let relieve you of all of your
Figure seating sketching, never believe in your niggaz (come on!)
Go head and babble you can watch me patiently waiting
Aimin', attackin', instead I'mma let one of my bitches slap you
I ain't watch you when your niggaz'll try
To feel a wrath of the un-rudely waking of a sleeping giant
(Very defiant), once I give you the pressure
And then I apply it and then your breathing is stop and totally quiet (sss...Oh)
Captain of this ship, so call me the pilot
I leave you and your crew to collide with me
Die, stomp on a nigga, just like a herd of a thousand cattle

So when you hear somethin, make sure you hear it right

He don't like me, hit him and wild wifey was wit em
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of satan
They say my killin's too blatant
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin
Duct tapin, your fam destiny
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me

Parked in quick to spark kids who start shit

So the spring break hoes, home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckers
I'll sick rottweiler's on you fuckers, cops followin to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lotta zeros
When it comes to paper I blow the soul outta hero
I'ma break 'fore I lay on the floor buried
besides, every rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, I'm smokin by the big screen
And changin the channel looks like I'm playin the game boy

The hook is real tight, but I'm a keep it real, dog, it puzzles me""
No rules in this music industry (y'all know!)
If it feel good and make ya move your feel (y'all know!)
And if the bass is bumpin' in your jeep (y'all know!)
That it's the piper and I'm comin' with the heat
Thoia thoing make you wanna club hop, make you wanna drop top
Make you get like beyonce' and do the booty hop
Thoia thoing inspired by juice and hypnotic
It's like a virus and the whole world's got it

Here's baby and kelly, come relax wit' us, shorty!
When we drop, it's platinum plus, shorty!
Whoa! you see the rocks with the rays
I mess up your eye's like blunt of that haze
Knee high boots. right wheel side coop
Custom macy's with the fall back roof
Flyin' dutch, livin' tone wit' stiletto shoes (stiletto shoes!)
Iced up, jigga watch more jigga boots
Million's on the chedda, pause just to take a trip
G4 in the clouds, now we makin' hits
The bird landed in Japan, hopped in a 6
Steerin' wheel, wood grain in your foreign lifts
Keesha to Italy, Stacy to France and
Tonya to Paris, her bod is the baddest and
We stopped in Jamaca, spent a hundred grand
Got a hundred model chicks that I flew from Japan (i had her singin')

I had her singin' thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing (hey, yo Kells!)
Thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing (Baby!)
She had me singin' thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing 
(you know bus-a-bus gon' get his ass up and talk to shorty right over there real quick)
Thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing (hey, yo ma, let me holla at you)

Shorty, I love how you drop it, the way you get down and
Pop it, lock it, and cock it again and again, you better
Stop it, girl, see how you wiggle your c***ch, you know you should
Watch it, girl, and once we step in the spot you know I gotcha (ACHOO!!!)
Yea, your little gucci cologne be havin' me problems with sneezin'
Baby, it's nothin' do your thing, I ain't gon'
Stop you, girl, all in your miny skirt, really squirted and
Show me somethin' baby once I give you what really hurts
You won't owe me nothin' (c'mon!) lookin' and watchin' and seein' the way your
Jeans be cuttin' all up in your a**, rockin' and switchin'
When you be struttin' (shake it fast!)
I know your willin' and able and ready to (take it glass)
Sittin' on top of your a** like a table now (make it last)
Performin' until the water drip down to your navel (take it past!) your level
But if the label will even, stable, now shake your ass to (THE JOINT! THE JOINT!)
Baby, do your thing, and shake your (DA DOINK! DA DOINK)

I had her singin' thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing (yeah)
Thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing
She had me singin' thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing
Thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing

We make a lot of noise when (whoa)
We go through the club (whoa)
All of the ladies in the house (whoa)
Come show ya boy some love (whoa)
Last call for alcohol (whoa)
Now we're closin' down the bar (whoa)

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
This be the shit to go for broke on
'Til we own ships that carry big freight and niggaz harbor coke on
Now let me get my fuckin smoke on
I'll have your mother recitin my shit like she singin the fuckin boat song
Now watch the story unfold nigga
Bullets smackin your face and your chest just like a fuckin drumroll nigga
You ain't know me and my crew, we lockin it up
And rubberband stackin dough in Timberland shoebox nigga, and stockin it up
Too many of my niggaz at the door of the club
that be always gun cockin it up
We put together niggaz like the dick to these bitches
Givin it to 'em in the worst way for actin too {?} bridges
Crackin it down, backin it down
How we give it to niggaz, you know we only smackin it down
Before I bring it to a closure nigga
You think we finished cause my lil' 16 bars is over nigga?

Swear to only bring you hot shit, everyday

[Verse Two: Rah Digga]
Keep the five for ya, the ruggedest chick
Spread shit like Tom Sawyer, bitch Will Smith
Be I the Fresh Princess, rulin shit run things
Your efforts is senseless, Hariett Thus
Ridin rare breed, fuck buyin a jar
I smoke the engineer weed motherfucker
Bitch got stuck in Wells Fargo, Brick City hooligan
Squattin at the car show - couldn't be a girly girl
if I tried; crazy slave to the live
But I'm still fly, love four by fours
Cause they ride like a toy, steady jumpin the curb
Pedestrians like ""oh boy"" I can sing, rap DJ
Work the instant replay
""Even though I'm slurrin my voice"" like I was Freeway
Get it right 'cause-o, I keep the rhymes runnin
Kind of terror FBI don't even see comin, motherfuckers

[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Rampage]
Ashes is ashes and dust to dust
why'all see the low Ro', why'all ain't fuckin with us
Rampage nigga, I'm a sick man
Chop you in your face, cut off both of your hands
Wrap your body up, put it in a sedan
Drop yo' ass in a river, this is how I deliver
Got the maggots just eatin your liver, untold mystery
Your name is Swany River, you not a legend
Youse one dead nigga, six feet under
Never comin back, one year later
This is real facts (yeah) tell the feds
just to back up off me
Keep eatin donuts and drinkin that coffee
They say they know my M.O. from Philly to Milwaukee
Got my house tapped with the walkie talkies, shit

My lawyer's good, so get the FUCK out my face

And they say a closed mouth don't get fed
So I don't mind asking for head
You heard what I said, we need to make our way to the bed
And you can start using yo head
You like to fuck, have yo legs open all in da butt
Do it up slappin ass 'cause the sex gets rough
Switch positions and ready to get down to business
So you can see what you've been missin'
You might had some but you never had none like this

Wet fat hoe's they don't spill shit
I keep a hoe hot when I'm puttin' in work
want to skeet skeet you get your feelin's hurt
'Cause I'll beat dat cat with a dog
And knock da walls of a broad til she scrawl
Like (OOOOOH!)

But it depends on the swing of the baseball bat
Fuck a bitch on da counter make the
Plates fall Back
On the floor she ain't screamin she a nut so they crack

She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
The kind of girl, you'd walk the whole world for
Put her on your back and just carry
Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core

When she's around nothing else matters
Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield
Sooner or later someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you

Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you, girl

Oh oh oh

She's the kind of girl, you wanna marry
Scientists say that she's the second sunshine
And now my life is sweeter than berries
I guess if we have sex our love will turn to wine

When she's around nothing else matters
Even if the sky was at a stand still
If I turn my back then someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you

Picture my life and my intention to ball
Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all
Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?

She changed your life and your frame of mind
Sorry I hope what I'm saying is fine
We fuss but we take it one day at a time
If there's a fire you know that she'll lay in the line

I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth
Open my mind and words come out
You're eclectic, you're creative
You the picture girl, I just painted

I got it, you name it, it's all paid for
Big castle on the sea shore
With the Willy Wonka decor
How this sound, Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard, P

Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, ooh

Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, ooh

Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you

Busta Rhymes,"Yo, all my bitches that make money
Throw ya motherfuckin' hands in the air
'Cause it's all about the money
Money rules the world
I take over all pussy with money

All cars get tooken over 'cause of money, baby
All businesses, baby, it's all about the money
To all my niggaz that bustin' shots for money, right now
Bust shots, bust shots for the money, now

Where's your money?
Where's your money?
Where's your money?
Throw ya motherfuckin' hands in the air
Where's your money?

The Brooklyn borough king, your bitch to me is everything
Sent me to Jersey, trapped off the parascene
Or Penelope Pit stop
You can't duplicate the picture or record this hip hop

My owl's are tryna crust up the ziplock
Dime pieces in high heels and flip flops
Real playas with the Zenty's wristwatch
Outside of clubs is backed up in gridlock

Three bouncers the size of sasquatch
Plus whips that will make your eyes pop
Hot burns that burn faster than matches
Dirt is only out to catch Vicks

be-boys on the back on some rap shit
Fake industry heads sweatin' in the guest list
I'm on the spot with a bottle of fresh Cris
Lay up on the table, arm around the best chick
It's all about the money

Hey, I'm O.D.B., let me know where's your money
Next time you see me, let me know where's your money
Baby, I just got home, let me know where's your money
We got to feed these kids, baby, let me know where's your money

In a fly tailor made shit, cookin' a blunt
Got the Phantom parked crooked out in the front
Rowin', gun totin', Sonny Chiba niggaz we large
Caymen Island style, suckin' on Cohiba cigars

The way we stack cake, you know I know it's makin' you sick
Watch dough with diplomats from other countries and shit
Now let me show you why we walk with a swagger
Money over flowin', spendin' like it don't even matter

Money do a lotta shit, money make me more bread
But money take a nigga life, put a price on they head
Think you nicer than the dreads, snitches fight with the Feds
Keep it cool, while I put all of the hype on the bed

Bitch, ever since my cake got a little bigger
Fuck with JP Morgan, Merryl Lynch and them niggaz
Fuck it, call it what you wanna call it, nigga, we sinners
Throw my money at ten thousand dollar tables for dinners

Now it's a Busta Bus, now, nigga, let me know where's your money
Every time you see me, let me know where's your money
You can give me all your money, let me know where's your money
When it's the first of the month, nigga
Let me know where's your money

For the carat D class next to my middle finger
When I see my own reflection, diamond frost the mirror
Diamonds as cold as ice, frost bite like winter
Floss fitters, three quarter four length chinchillas

You wish you knew the way, the kid'll quiet dough is a mystery
Niggaz bread stack longer than American History
Now peep the way we runnin' through y'all, it's funny
Fuck around get you murked with my 'Woo-Hah' money

Lay you down in the dirt, let me school y'all dummies
Hit the town with the work like crack heads, they love me
Shit to call my cake disrespectful, bitch, holla
A lot of acres with a pet alligator named Dollar

Bust it, y'all niggaz know that I'm the most, so just stop it
I cop cribs and stash cake and keepin' money in wallets
Niggaz money smaller than a bar of Whatchamacallits
Money hungry like Sudan, when my paper stay brolic, listen

Hey, I'm O.D.B., let me know where's your money
It's a Busta Bust now, nigga, let me know where's your money
Next time you see me, let me know where's your money

For walking around wit the kind of ass that'll kill ya now
Don't worry bout it I got money to bill ya

Headboard bang, bump the side of ya head
Watch how ya ass spread spill all off the side of the bed now, hmm

But fuck em! cause now we vibing and talking and shit

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Move girl like your ass on fire - like your ass on fire

Move girl I'll light your ass on fire - Bitch I'll light that ass on fire
Move girl I'll light your ass on fire

[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
Bust it, baby I know you probably really
Need a table cloth to cover your ass
Digging in your pocket while you rubbing yo ass
Shit so big just put the club in yo ass
Prep the H2 park it right infront of yo ass
I see your little gap between your cunt and yo ass
And make you jump inside the whip and smoke a blunt wit yo ass
I'm saying hmm, the shit'll spread like a rash
The way they ass wiggles see I got the shit on a smash now listen
I light the L smell a wiff of the hash
And bag all the bitches, now watch you see me zip in a flash
I'm saying hmm, now I'm a put you on blast
Just like a tint window when you put your shit on the glass
Bust right through the window then it sit on the dash
And have a nigga driving wreckless till you making him crash
(Hah, c'mon) we making money and shit
Now pop your muffin while we be watching you shaking your shit

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Welcome to hot in Hazyville
It make you want to dance till you break your heels
I know you love the way the God make your feel
Now watch me get deeper than a Navy Seal (Navy Seal?)
It got a crazy feel, shit feel like you in a danger field
Hypnotize, stuck it in her, daze for real
That's exactly why we call this one Hazyville (Hazyville)

[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
Baby, just shake ya ass till you spread on the floor
I noticed that your ass too big for your draws
You need a - a chiropractor just to marry yo ass
To tell the truth you need a tractor just to carry yo ass
Fo reala, you motherfuckers probably think that I'm playing
All bitches love to talk and all that other shit I be saying
And going hmm, see how you putting it down
I love the way you shake it throw it around!

C'mon nigga, let's take ya ass to your crib, man, 
You're tired, nigga, and put your drink down, nigga, we got to go, nigga

One more shot

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank
Like (la la la)
Now I'm sittin' in this goddamn cage
Reminiscin' about my day
With your blood all over my Slate
As the devil sings (la la la)

[The Game]
Dre, I ain't mean to turn my back on you
But I'm a man, and sometimes a man do, what he gotta do
Remember, I'm from Compton too
I saw you and Eazy in 'em, so I started wearin' khaki suits
I was 12 smokin' chronic, in '92
I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you
I made a choice, now its be Crip or be Piru
Whatever I was, I was bangin' 'Gin & Juice'
Never knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop
Now I gotta keep it gangster, cause its in my roots
So I owe you my life, when I betrayed you
I tried to think of what the fuck Eminem might do
If every nigga hated him, for the 'Black Bitch' track
And niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after T-Boz got slapped
When Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I never said 'Thank You', and I took for granted
You let me in your house, and made me a part of your family
Now I'm eatin' with you, Eve, and Busta Rhymes
I wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed
And even though sometimes I run loose
You still my homeboy Doc, I'd take a bullet for you
I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef
But you told me it was OK to say ""Fuck The Police""
Now its my turn to carry the torch
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source
Remember when we got drunk, to do ""Start From Scratch""?
I told you you was like a father to me I meant that
Sittin' here lookin' at my platinum plaques
Thinkin' what the fuck am I without a Doctor Dre track
When Doc say its a rap - its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
See when the world is on your shoulder and the stress grows bigger
The fire in 'em, made it difficult to talk to the nigga
Most of the time I let 'em know I don't agree wit' what he do
But he a hard-head Dre thats why I'm talkin' to you
See when I first met my nigga son was layin' in the cut
Tight, reserve, homie was quiet and kept his mouth shut
Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut
I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck
And as the time went on, now he was workin' with the finest
I saw the pressure started to build, so I gave 'em additional guidance
You gave him something that can make or break a nigga you should face it
So big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it
With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction
The only problem was our little nigga wouldn't listen
But when Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

You see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young
Tryin' to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin' down my do'
Wonderin' where my next blessing is comin' from

My momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice
Hard living gave him hard hands and callous
As a youngin', peep how much they loved each other's space
His hard hands rubbin' against the pretty skin of my mother's face
Dig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie
So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
On the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs
Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed
Got older, developed ways of grippin' the steel
Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin'
Blendin' in with city folk, down in Flat-bush Brooklyn
Feel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it
Homey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin' I been through it
In other words I

Got a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights, plottin' to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious
To visit other cities, out of town kick was serious
Guyanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on
Wreck is all for the good, gettin' into shit
Like we innocent, actin' older than should
Walk around broke in the hood, watchin' all the rich niggas
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas
Thinkin' 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin'
To hell with just gettin' by and economizin'
It's kinda hard bein' humble in the belly of struggle
Doin' things that probably get you in trouble
That's why we stay up on the block, gettin' money while we keepin' it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin' the faith
Mom and pop be worryin' for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin' look and see just what I become
A scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin'
Across the line until somebody tryin' to cap me, oh shit 

I been through the storm
Through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real

While I'm in the process of slowly getting rid of ya
I'm back over bitches, and then I throw 'em in my video
Yeah, yeah, the God of the block
Ya know me killer had you spreading the spot wet and ""Twist It"" like Olivia
Oh shit, flow so sick in the committee
We know you a slouch duke, we don't even consider ya
Boss nigga, see or hear me in ya area
The more niggas, the murders, the more the money, the more the merrier
Smash shit 'til everything become mass hysteria
Hungry for street shit, see I be takin care of ya check nigga
Fuck all the talk, homey I'm daring ya

When we in the spot ya know that we sure to shine (to shine)

Check it my nigga, most of you motherfucking amateur
I muster the nigga quick and damage any challenger
But now ya know, ""Oh a nigga flow so spectacular""
Break niggas down and handle you motherfucking characters
Captain of this shit but most of you niggas is passengers
I'm taking it back to the hood, like '87 Maximas
Yeah, yeah ya know who the truth, no need for asking the, same question again
To get the same answer bruh, fasten ya seatbelt
Bitches fuck wit the bachelor
Wit' money like a thousand coke deals from here to Panama
Strike like a brightness, a light, I'm here to dazzle ya
Whole hood from the boroughs, to the niggas up in Attica
Soldiers in the streets, the Middle East, way down to Canada
When it comes to the block, ya know I'm the ambassador
Follow nobody's footsteps, but said it like a scavenger
Wanna talk money bitch!? Then holla at my manager
The way y'all niggas is trash, my crew'll get to blasting ya
Twelve shot clip, hollow tips, quick to plaster ya
All over the cement, spread ya like I'm mashing

Now I'm subtle, once I pick up my metal
Put my foot on the pedal, riding through every ghetto
Analyze the shit I'm seeing when I sip Amaretto
A lot of bitches on the strip, strutting in they stilettos
Then they wave and say hello, when my Lambo' is yellow
Everything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello
See the niggas on the corner and I never forget it
And I never regret because I see how you get it
Now because of you niggas, I'm a hustler nigga
'Gnac guzzler nigga, rip your jugular nigga
In the night I become the type to love when it's dark
Cause when I pull up and park, is when I'm making my mark
See the fact's that I'm trying to strive and capitalize in
Start to maximize and b-build a enterprise
And while I'm stocking this bread, keep ah-stocking the lead
And leave a permanent dot, on the top of your head

I'll Will, Flip-mode!
I'm the enigma, there is none harder, smarter
Martyr, Godfather, my interest, your departure
Pardon Dre this beat is a monster, catchy
Like sleeping under open windows that's drafty
Then waking up my throat scratchy, that's how I spit it nasty
They short, a few inches North of a dwarf
My flow's Murcielago, ghosting them narcos
Toast in the ways of the original Pablos
Still a pyramid architect, mix liquors like a chemist
Killer lyricist, poetical tyrant
Sneaker store terrorist, Mt. Everest I climbed it
Heat is drawn, no creeping on me whenever I'm bent
My mind spray, my nine spray
And freak styles like 3000 Andre
To keep piling, keep pushing them drops

Now I'm hot, and we running the block
Watch me run in your spot, fiends coming in flocks
Add a little cut to the coke when I'm cooking the pot
Drugs, bitch! I got what you want come and get what I got
Now I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop
I love to fold up a knot, love toting the glock
Helps me feel safer when niggas try to scheme on my plot
Try to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot
See I will leave you to rot, only defending my stock
Niggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop
My hot shit, bust a cannon have you run in your socks
See we live on the edge, bang shit with a sledgehammer
Split up your head, kill a snitch for the feds
Let's go, for the streets I'm always spitting a gospel
Get Nas holding a barrel size of elephant nostril

So what it do, don't test see I'ma blaze to the end
I'm coming through, so confess you niggas know who the kid

Smokin the block up, y'all witness the zoo gamblers
We ain't taking no shorts, its just the early 80's
That made me, now I sit paid and then maybe

Under the mattress and I clack like a slave key
Wash your squad up, I roll double refuse to rock

When we O.T. cut it with baking soda, acquire now

Hanging from our back pockets miraculous money nigga

Phenomenal property, drug money, scram wrap em
A hundred EX, golden like a hundred graham crackers
Sidewinding niggas tryna infiltrate blindside
A nigga hit you wit the eight, three in the club
Dumbing out, drunk in fronta the airbrush
Backdrop ones out, five dollars for bitches wit the guns out
Juggle for a couple days close shop thinking,
To you the bubble until the strip is hotter than a microwave
Don't stop, travel all my spare time and keep niggas wit us
To push shit like George Jefferson Airline
No fro niggaz better go chill, 'fore this gun
Goes up your nose like coke sniffing up your nose dude

And eating Fruit Loops its all for the loot boo

Caught me in the mix wit some rich soldiers, that reaction
Is a key action, black sent forty doja's up
We hunt 'em like big plans, my big mans and them
Slick as the shit breaks from outtas you, rip dip, then quakes them

Ask 'em for the chemistry temperature now I'm cooking the coke up

Miss can I get a second to speak and quietly mention
That I am so into who you are, can I get your attention
My observations of you creates conversations for you
And if you got a little time, I got the patience for you
Okay? Good, you giving me the time to talk?
While I figure it out and sort what I'm trying to say, let's walk
Just trying to keep it gutter, respectfully I won't stutter
Don't you agree, we look better when we walk with each other?
I've seen you many times, yes I've encountered many dimes
I'm feeling something special with us, it's just one of the many signs
I think that we have to look forward to our go-through
Any war with you regardless what it is I'm trying to score with you
Sometimes I think and wonder especially through rain and thunder
If I'd ever find the one to ride when I'm on top or under
Until we reach the end, ma with love as I be your friend
Oh, here you can take my number, I hope we can speak again

No matter how mister, no doubt I'll die with ya
Until the end of life, lay down on the ground with ya

And when together I hope we never fall apart you know

I'd like to learn from ya, but I'm 'bout to turn from ya
It's been about a week and I ain't even heard from ya
Is it something at all or did I just bump in and fall
And even though you did I see how you was reluctant to call
But it's nothing to crawl before we walk (oh) listen
And it's nothing to stall before we talk, look
To tell the truth I'm happy I found you and that I can be around you
And thus I'm digging you, I ain't just trying to pound you
I'm only trying to crown you and wife you and wedding gown you
Regardless what I'm with, shorty seem like she always down to
just spend a little time and then click, you know that kind of chemistry
The recipe to then SIP, and a little bit of wine

Until the love is empty I credit the one who sent me
The most beautifullest woman and she riding with me

(I'll do it all) I'll do it all with ya, go through any door with ya
It doesn't matter I will, go against the law with ya
Just know you live through me, your love is all I need

Your dedication and commitment got me going crazy
Your love so real to me, and that's all that I, can see

Cause you mean so much to me

Cause you do so much for me
No matter how they try they can't deceive us, nothing can come between us
Cause you mean so much to me

Listen, trust me and I will trust you, I ain't into trying to fuss boo
Deeper than any lust, I'm only trying to mind fuck you
That's probably why and maybe I can nickname you my baby
Now that you made me a man you're officially now my lady
Despite the stormy weather I cherish your love forever
And nourish everything we have 'til we grow old together
I'll never trick you, mislead or try to be shaky with you
I only wanna make all the rest of my babies with you

""If you ain't from the ghetto, don't come to the fuckin' ghetto"" 
But I'mma let one of our most immaculate tour guides take us all through the ghetto, 
My nigga' Rick James

When I was a young boy, growin' up in the ghetto
Hanging out on corners, singin' with the fellas
Lookin' for the cute chicks, tryin' to find me
Lookin' for some trouble, or anyone who'll give me some
I was young and crazy (in the ghetto)
Didn't know what my life would be (in the ghetto)
I was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto)
Something had a spell on me (in the ghetto)

While we search for the answers we be smokin' them cancer sticks
Police provokin' motherfuckers, we dancin'
And we be dodgin' them bullets they be poppin' off at us, shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood 'til somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry, hey nigga we playin' for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See nigggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle 'til we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doin' crime
I see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me
Gotta love it

Hustle hard, try to get money quick (in the ghetto)
That's where I got my name from
I learned to get money and I all got my name from (in the ghetto)
That's where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustlin' as hard as you could (in the ghetto)
Until your cake stackin' shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (in the ghetto)
With them burn out cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And they pis sin elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (in the ghetto)
That's where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Ain't nothin' like a hood nigga, I don't care
You survivin' in the ghetto, you can make it anywhere

You'll always find a good hick to hold a brick for they dude
Behind the bullshit, me and my clique on the move
We honor the code of the street and live by the rules (in the ghetto)
Is where, all of the hood's at
Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and rugrats and some of the most powerful people, I love that

Despite I talk about it, I ain't making fun of them niggas
I give thanks cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggas
Can't imagine how difficult it is, I know you suspect
That shit around you is looking dumb, it's getting hard to accept it
Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile
Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while
Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
Continue fronting, like it's nothing while you live in denial
While all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
You overexert the little you have left to save face
You trying to hide your expression from looking worried
On what to do when your career is buried

Promoters ain't paying and booking you for shows no more
You ain't whipping the range, you ain't whipping a rolls no more
Reality starts to settle in, you're sweating every wake up
You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to jacob
You run around and you front like you're still on fire
But nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
You're only lying to yourself cause it's evident in the proof
As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
You're still holding on to them days when everything was about you
But niggas don't even remember you enough to just shout you
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
People see you and it's bugged that you mean nothing
You doing shit and front to prove to people you mean something
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't getting in
Forgetting you a man first, chasing the fame
Got to remember, morals and principles, repping your name proper
But most niggas don't, and they whole life hurried
What do you do when your career is buried

[Chorus]

Okay
I told you we was gonna get more acquainted
At a time when you least expect it nigga
I'm here to lay you to rest once and for all 
You've been dead a long time but you refuse to accept that shit
But it's okay 
Nigga shut the fuck up and get in the box nigga! (wait! please!)
It was custom built for all niggas like you
You just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up
(stop! bitch!) see you in the afterlife nigga (wait! help!!!)
Whever the fuck that is!! (somebody help!!)
(i can't breathe, nigga!)
(open this shit nigga!)
(open this shit!!)
(open this shit!!)
(somebody help!! hey!!)
(open this shit motherfucker what you doin)

I'm just playing wit y'all niggas, I'm just playing wit y'all niggas
I'm just playing wit y'all niggas, I'm just playing wit y'all niggas!

They told me to! [echoes]

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raw)
They so cold, I know, that they're out to get me
And all those people I call my friends, let it go
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
'Cause you see how this money can change your friends' faith

[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah! See I done came a long way and now I got me a chauffeur
Keep my enemies close, keep my friends even closer
Motherfuckers that I grew around, thought I could rock wit 'em
Watch my cake so hard, they burn a hole in my pocket
I see 'em coming from afar because I been through so much shit
They plot a lot, hard or not, they see my dough come quick
Invested in my niggas, took the realtor route
Gambled on the wrong niggas, had to filter 'em out
Type of dudes that see my mother and they greet her respectful
behind her back and see her son and try to give me a quick full
It's cool though, I fucks wit 'em even though I ain't wit it
That's why the gats be in the house whenever niggas come visit
Serve 'em drinks and welcome all to the law
For let ya drunk friend to show his true side until ya forced to cut him off
I seen it one too many times, they disbelieved and they speechless
Sometimes having certain friends can end up being a weakness
See now my dogs turn to wolves and try to front me and surround me
Come up out they sheepskin and act all different around me

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Listen! Sometimes I smoke a cigarette and then I think and I choke on
how niggas steal this funny style and I was struggling broke
Even though it don't surprise me, shit it's still kinda funny
When I ain't have, a nigga still would come and try to take from me
Instead of cutting my losses, being smart and just end shit
niggas was trying to be loyal, just to maintain a friendship
In the wrong situation, plus there's always a sequel
I'm with the wrong motherfuckers, plus they 'pose to be people's
As I get more money, days get colder
I learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder
So then I start the heart-on-my-heart as I walk like a soldier
Moving so militant, you think I had a chip on my shoulder
Living by morals and principles mainly
Having heavy thoughts to a kill a brother every time a fucker betrayed me
But now I'm winning with the strength of the nation
I promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit they'll be facing
I'm Aftermath now, shit's getting worse
Now when those same ""friends"" see me goin hard that shit be making 'em hurt

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Instead they getting together with me so we both can get rich
When I'm outta town, these niggas busy trying to fuck with my bitch
Same niggas spend they money 'til the shit'll diminish
I hit 'em off and turn around and come right back when it finish
I said I'm tired of these niggas, that'll owe me so much shit
that they can't pay me back for, fuck all the dumb shit
Sometime we can't forgive whatever balances off
'Specially when niggas cross the line that niggas never should cross
Realized and thus I state the same shit, get the Range
The more money niggas get, shit around you will change
Even though niggas'll flip and say, ""He the one changed""
Fuck you, the dude'll just'll justify, taking his shit from you
The more money I get, I get more dangerous stupid
'Cause I been broke before, and I refuse to go back to it
And while I sweep these niggas up under the rug with a broom
If I never see these ""friends"" again, that shit'll be too soon
Shit is real like every wind in my breath
And that's on everything I love, blood of my blood! Flesh of my flesh!",They're out to Get Me,2006

Busta Rhymes,"Yeah
It's funny how the game change, right?
Shit feel all different
Y'all niggas complaining left and right about how the game feel all fucked up
Niggas only been talking like that since we been sitting out the game
I think the game need us kamal, let's talk to them niggas
Huh!

So many nights were spent pondering
Wondering how we gon' come again
My golden rule is not to focus on the fame game
In retrospect, the game ain't the same man
They heart and soul is divided
They ramshack the music, no control up inside it
Now, look at this, it's all stretched out and nasty
But, letting money pass me
I doubt that, and niggas from the bottom now
Pumping hard, wind sleet hail rain or snow
So, you got to get your gate right
No matter what, you got to treat your weight right
On the block if you focused on greed then
Nine out of ten times you be bleeding

These niggas sound trash, straight fouling the game up
Need to change up (change up) sound so trash
When I see 'em feel like breaking they frame up
Dupont registry, talking 'bout somebody else cars
Motherfuckers better step up your bars
Instead of frontin in the game like niggas really are stars
Like we ain't seein through the bullshit, we know who you are
I'm like a blessing to the game when your shit sound dated
I force niggas to improve, you should be happy I made it
Here to rep the game fully, change my style like the weather
Giving you niggas new shit to make the game feel better
I'm saying, I cook in the kitchen and we make the thoughts connect
You forced to humble yourself, give me my big respect
You hurting the game when your shit sound off ya know
A legend in this shit that's why I move like a boss ya know
You better be tight, 'cause you can get tossed fo' sho'

Then drop the bomb shit to step up the pressure, ya know? (huh)

That's why you ain't selling no records, check the soundscan

Its for the money this time

Howdy do motherfuckers its Weezy Baby,
Niggas bitchin' and I gotta toke the cannon.
Listen close I got duct tape and rope,
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'bannons.
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy,
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me.
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin',
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach.
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit,
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet.
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg,
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um.
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it,
Bet that baby.
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes.
Get back get back boy this a set back,
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap.
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone,
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones.
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on,
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on.
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush,
And when it comes to that paper I stack books.
You heard what I said,
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head.
Life ain't cheap,
You're better off dead.
If you can't pay the fee,
Shout out my nigga fee.
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key,
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see.
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea.
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man,
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again.

I make it hard for rap niggas I'm peer pressure,
Matter fact I'm motivation to rap better.
I show niggas how to act how to dress better,
I stay fresh more fitted caps than bat catchers.
I'm the crack 
The smack 
The gun 
The rule 
The gat 
The strap 
The gun 
The tool 
The motherfuckin' (cannon).
Other words I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill,
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill,
The deal is sealed.
Niggas ain't real as Will cause I'm a (cannon).
And I handle well pedal like Cannondale.
And I got the fifty cal mag its a hand-held.
I'm tellin' you niggas I pop put a shell in you niggas,
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas.
I got whores in the cannon camcorder bendin' over
Blowin' game by the quarter weed over in the Rover nigga

From Philly to where I'm landin I'm a cannon.
And I'm on that Philly fire shit,
Then I come fully equipped.
You try me get bodied keep the shawty in the whip.
If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him.
Sing a long da da da di I'm free got the butters 
Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada.
Homie know I'm inside of your house,
Tie up your brother.
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you.
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'.
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will.
Roll over ya squad like I'm a one punch card.
You chumps, you best call General Motors.
I will, take control of your soldiers.
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken.

Now they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plently dough man
Icy Audemar, Hendy gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bentley door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told you he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coupe's up take the new Lame for a sec

Right now with a squeezer and a coozie
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the uzi

She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast

I mark with death, hard to kill like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto

The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross

That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dying
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors

Now there ain't no way that you can kill a beast dead
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread
I got oil well money, in the desert playing golf
Go chase short stack sheiki with a Louis scarf

Chest cold diamonds make a nigga wanna cough
In Dubai 20 million on a villa loft
And then I step up in the club then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic

So much cake even the money look weird too

Domestic bread and a broad

Back with the most venomous rap
It be the godfather of the club banger let me hear you clap
You can applause and from the very beginnin'
You can give me a standin' ovation while I'm bangin' your face in

With another banger I call it the cliffhanger
Watch me mangle and strangle this whole rap shit
(Come on)
You could see the way I make 'em mad sick
From down bottom the way I got 'em give me my cash quick
(Come on)

Log on you better grab onto somethin'
Because I'm 'bout to shake shit again and make 'em black bitch
(Come on)
Now you hear the shots ring off from bitches takin' everything off
Each other got 'em whylin' runnin' for cover

The King Kong, Big Foot gully with a scully
Bully of rap still ugly with the money runnin' the trap
Now they givin' me dap, as far as I'm concerned in this mu'fucker

Hands in the ceilin', you know we only come to rattle the bulidin'
And break it on down just a little once again
Knowin' we holdin' the bank so let me keep the dice rollin'
And keep it traditional the way I keep my money fallin'

While you slackin' on yo' mackin', Duke, we always keep it goin'
Right to the left, do it to death, now watch me
Come through with a chisel that make the game sizzle
And I, pull out the skillet, prepare for the cookin'

How I'm whylin' niggas wonderin' when I'm gonna bring the hook in
Thugs ice grillin' every time they get to lookin'
Got 'em whylin' overseas all the way back to go Brooklyn
Now they ready to spaz 'cause we bring the best to them

Shit that shut it down on the regular
That's with the fly 80s' nigga that was whippin' in a Cressida
Fresher than, most of these niggas, killin' the rest of the
Fellas that was thinkin' that they as rushin' in and bustin' in
But the way we was doin', we was musclin' their hustlin'

You don't really want it my dude
I'm sayin' most my niggas is rude
And when we come we eat a nigga food
Back to the fact in the matter at hand
For me to come in control this whole shit, was only part of the plan

The other part of the plan is for you to understand
That nothin' could fuck with the kid, let me say it again
The Broad Back be, Busta Bus back to put out the trash
And just for the record, we got it on smash, now

How the fuck they even got the audacity
The fire marshall come and try to talk about capacity
Every time I'm in the spot, I hope you know it has to be
Extremely packed to shut it down, you'll probably cause a tragedy
Don't you know that when I'm in the place I change the mood again

I be whylin' wit raunchy bitches and a bunch of hooligans
Now don't get it fucked up just because I flaunt it
Niggas think that they can test me, bring it if you really want it
See I be the type to always beat you to the punch faster
I keep a smile on my face, but carry the Bushmaster

You already know I said it word to mother
Shit is so hot you niggas think it's cold in up the summer
Shh, calm the noise down let's get a little quiet
'Cause the neighbors call the police they know we cause riots

And they know that we'll have them thinkin' they dancin' with the devil
When they play the music turn the volume to the highest level
You got it right
Let's keep the bomb goin' like we lit a stick of dynamite

Bow you know you need to follow whenever you hear the God spit
(Aww shit)
You see me nigga back in the cockpit
Out to gettin' this money I give you all a stock tip
Perspire by a nigga till you see the sweat drop drip

From Kentucky
To fuck with me
Look what you done to me
Was number one to me!
After you shower
You and your gold medal flour
Then you rub on with hot oil for half an hour
You in your hot tub, I'm looking at you salivating
Dry you off, I got your paper towel waiting
Lay you down cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot
Then I flock
To the bed then, ""Plop""

It's like you're walking out a tanning saloon
When I pull you out the oven, from baking I got you on my mind
Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing, how you sparkle when I glaze you swine
Hey, my pretty hand hot, it's so feminine
The way you submitting
And how you gave me power
To massaging me to shower
You with lemon water
Marinate you with season you dipping you in chowder
Baby
It's like you at the spa
The way you gently
Lay in the pan
While you enjoying you butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling
On your skin
Despite the funny fragrance
Still I lick my finger frequent
In any event
I'm reflecting on all the signs saying that I got I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you taste made it hard to resist when I put my mouth on you
But that's another issue
But it FLIES up in my stomach when I laid EYES on you
Was it infection manifesting?
Confused over the feeling impatiently eating you
Intestinal worm chewing on the walls of my intestine
I'ma eat you until there's nothing left
Til my very last breath
You gon be a nigga death
Despite your good appearance
Cooking swine as a chef
You gon be a nigga death
Who cares if the swine
Is mixed with rat, cat, and dog combined?
Yes, I eat the shit to death

Ain't that some shit?
I'ma eat some shit
Until what I'm eating kills me!

And I choose to do that
Why?
Cause that's just what niggas do",Fried Chicken,2008

Wait a minute,  came to go get it,  ranger fitted
Whenever it come to paper,  better know I'm major with it
Make it rain a major blizzard,  leather alligator lizard
I Talledega race any challenger name a digit
Even if on the slightest you take a smidget 
Or dare touch my revenue I slice you with the razor quit it
Icey till I make it frigid,  (burr), 
The laws of physics says it's getting cold,  my money taller than a hall of midgets
I get up all up in it
Kickin' down the door (Who is it!?)

After cleanin' bank accounts you questioned if 
I gave a shit if not I tell the truth so you could tell em that the player did

It's OK I say a prayer it's the mayor bitch slayer 
Givin' you another layer of the data tritick

Better have my bread nigga I ain't playin'

Mark every word,  spoken reddish so your pussy

And if you short my cake I'm off side of your head

Critical it's pitiful I'm cynical
How I deliver lyricals and take these other niggas paper
Topsy-tervy controversy I'm so thirsty go no mercy
For some of these bitches,  I collect my money now and later
Keep it movin' with the clique,  while making bitches hit the strip
Cake up everyday I wake I rate the way my money flip
I want it's mine,  borderline,  call it crime,  all the shine I'm takin it
Ain't no mistakin' it nigga what's yours is mine
No need to second guess it check I'm the gloss 
And grind the gritty and the floss, the profit and the loss all intertwined
Because I profit from your losses
You don't want it,  you should get it
In the hood with you money,  I extended my line of credit
The medic,  doctor rhymes that put you on a dihharettic shrinkin' up a nigga pockets
Simple niggas style pathetic

Busta Rhymes,"Gym Class Heroes
Cool and Dre (this is)
You silly for this one
It's Travie (why you doin' this to me)

I started rappin' back in the class
Scribbling tracks
In hopes that one of my jokes
Would have the pretty young things laughin'
The chubby little bastard
With a nack for little debbies snacks
But what I lacked in looks
I made up for it in passion
No advance and plus we make it happen
Your conscience more obnoxious
Then that laughy Taffy snappin'
Goodbye yesterdays rags
Hello high fashion
Hands before you's a man
That built a castle with sand
With no regards for tidal-waves
And finally established
Til the water comes in gallon drums
And wipes away my palace
But now I'm sittin' lovely off
In wonderland with Alice
With purple people passin' me
At the caterpillar's chalice
Ha ha, you probably thinking
I'm wrong right?
Like I should quit
Writing these songs right?
Tell you what do it better
I just might
Take it back to 86
You wanna lick, sike!

Don't let the TV mislead you
Me and you dude we are not equal
Fuck you this is for my people
Fuck you this is for my people
Don't try to hide like I can't see you
Your parents must've been trans
And so see through
Fuck you this is for my people
Fuck you this is for my people

[Chorus: x4]
Put up your peace sign, put your index down

Before I utter words
And before I start to begin
Let me make sure you clear
I'm about securing the wind
I puzzle up my words
While I piece another concoction
Cause I'm stubborn with the thought
That failure was never an option
I grinds like a carpenter
Until my caleceous's bleed
With the passion from my heart
To the many mouths that I feed
That's why I look at most of you
Stupid I know it's odd
Because you can't really do
Nothin' to me unless you GOD
But bein' that none of you ain't him
You can't fuck with me
Now watch me erase them
Now trust me see I'm so determined
I'm walkin' through the heap of gauntlets
While the fire is burnin''
Or how the tires
Turning on the rim of the V
I laugh and shake it off
The shit they be doin' to me
Wit all the yappin' and talking
And so and so think
That you can ever stop the kid
Oh no

So if you get in my way you know yer done son
You best believe what I say you better run son
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
You better kneel down
And pray cause where I come from
We goin' hard everyday that's how the fights won
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones

[Chorus: x4]
Put up the peace sign, put the index down

Look mom no hands
Yer little boys a man
Everything you said is finally settin' in
Trainin' wheels fell off and I kept peddling
Now I'm ridin' wheelies on this industry
Say the word I'll ghost-ride
This bitch instantly
Good lookin' pop on the strength that you givin' me
Wasn't for you Gym Class would be history
I'm on my upstate shit
I Was Brooklyn broke but now I'm upstate rich
Gettin' brains from two dames with French accents
Now I mess with local chicks
I get em upstate shit
You prob thinking I'm wrong right?
Like I should quit writtin' these songs right?
Tell you what do it better I just might
Take it back to 86 you want a lick, sike!

Now it's a lot of yall that can't stand me
Cause my resemblance to prince is uncanny
But fuck you this is for my family
Fuck you this is for my family
Upstate new york to Miami
Up late recording in my jammies
I do it for my family
Fuck you this is for my family

As for securing the win, better believe I'm so notorious

We use to live on the strip and even though we're a higher level tramping now

And it seemed like nothing we could do would ever get us respected 
At best we were stressed and the worst they probably said we're pathetic 
Had all the pieces to that puzzle just no way to connect it 
And I was fighting through every rhyme tightening up every line

But now I live what I dream you see we finally did it 
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you did it

When I make you sweat
Ready now get set 'cause you get no rest

I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed

Let me talk to you, when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give ?
And though I'm blessed, I still gotta handle of things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you, and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to, and vent your frustration
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need 'em the most, are they really ever there?
See, every thing be all good when we be havin' fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it
Look at hear, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view, and being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you

[Chorus]

Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something that we allow that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walking with me going through the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate it you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out
But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out
I got a clearer view, I thank God that you're here for me and I'm here for you

I, look in your eye, and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life's changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catchin' planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of ? trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you

Just tell 'em they're number one (El Captain partner)
You're a champion (yeah, the Ali of my day, you know me)
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over!

Just tell 'em they're number one (it's over for who, numero uno partner)
You're a champion (ha ha ha, let's go bust!)

Now, there's, nothin' you can do to stop a nigga from within
With the hunger of a lion I secure another win (hey!)
So passionate, you might even misinterpret it as arrogant
I'm goin' in (hey!)
I'ma make the world feel my pain
While I'm showin' you my muscle and I hustle through the game
And even though they leave us in the hood like we ain't shit
We ain't got nothin but everything to gain
Look, even if a muh'fucker try to pop me
I'm so blessed, do anything that you could do to stop me (stop me)
Now I'm climbin up the ladder and I'm jumpin at the top
You might wanna call me,  rocky
See there's more of us, ugly
You don't really wanna war with us, trust me
So glorious, that we from the bottom
Still we victorious, hug me

[Chorus]
I see it in your eyes, it ain't hard to tell
They're watchin' you (can't nobody ever stop what I'm doin')
They just tellin' you lies, they want you to fail
They're plottin' on you (and they can never stop my movement!)
So, don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over

Hey, see the websites lyin', tryin' to block my shine
Don't you know you never will stop my grind?
In a drop-top flyin' like I don't got time
Got e'rybody surprised that I won't drop dimes
What's on yo' mind? best get me off it
At least quit lyin if you must keep talkin'
Go on with the nonsense, best keep walkin'
Boy how you sue us, send the lawyers to the office
A lot of y'all got sprung like that shawty
Couple months off, I'll be right back shawty
With a brand new swag and a brand new forty
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it
Nation-wide news, nigga yeah you saw it
Shawty need a bodyguard for his bodyguard, don't he?
Tip fallin' off sound kinda odd, don't it?
Y'all hate to see me ball? take it up with god homie

[Chorus]

Any situation where you might get fed up
Gotta stay focused, homie keep your head up
It don't really matter what the next one is doin'
Homie gotta handle your business and then you better step up
Live to the fullest for the dream you're pursuin'
Ain't nothin' in the work gon' really stop what you're doin' (ohh!)
Go hard no matter what they be sayin'
Nigga don't quit cause you know we gotta keep it movin' (ohh!)
Take a look and see yourself in me
Cause it's all about we (we)
Me and you securin' a win together
So we could be the best that we could ever be (ohh!)

We shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars

We 'bout to do it real big like outta this world and we takin' it far
Shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us

Now don't you think this shit's outrageous?
At this point if you don't see I'm one of the greatest
I play the long time up in the league with the majors
In every history book they add a couple more pages

Like about the way I take 'em through stages
On different levels, peep the way it read on the gauges
Regardless I'ma love 'em, I don't care how they hate us
No matter how they try, see they could never replace us

Like mommy always said beware of the dangers
Embrace genuine love, be careful of strangers
'Cause when you are the best they try to weaken and change us
They don't recognize at first but always do when you're famous

Like I live my life bold and courageous
And invest my time and always calculatin' my wages
And let me lead the march, they'll probably start to parade us
Because you know that I'm comin' to save us

As we go way beyond sky's the limit and you know who we are

Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us

I spread my wings takin' off properly
I laugh at muh'fuckers that'll think they can top me
I laugh harder 'cause somebody said that they dropped me
When I'm flyin' through the sky, now how the hell they gon' stop me

Like most of the time it's good to be patient
Now I'm back with the crack, sorry for keepin' you waitin'
Prepare the food right for the street and season the steak
And grab a champagne glass and put it up, we celebratin'

Like and tell me who you tryin' to race with
If you ain't notice nigga I be ridin' a spaceship
I'm light years ahead and way beyond all the fake shit
I gotta stay away from trash because I probably'll break shit

Like I know it's kinda hard to believe this
The way I always come back and return with the heat, bitch
This shit ain't a secret, son, it's hard to defeat this
Risin' out the ashes, flyin' like a Phoenix

As we go way beyond sky's the limit and you know who we are
We shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars

We 'bout to do it real big like outta this world and we takin' it far
Shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us

See now you see I'm back in the zone, be
And it feels good to be home with Sylvia Rhone see
Back to smash on the planet, niggaz know I'm the only one
To be back with the authentic to smash all the phonies

Like we mostly do the thing that you can't teach
And then send 'em a rhyme into that bullshit you can't reach
Then I give you shit that make the hood wanna bang in the street
And state my word is bond, I live out what I speak nigga

As we go way beyond sky's the limit and you know who we are
We shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars

It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you 
Someone you know that knows you, and gives you motivation 
Someone that you can go to, and vent your frustration 
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere 
When you need 'em the most, are they really ever there? 
See , every thing be all good when we be havin' fun 
The difference is really needing a friend than having one 
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems 
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it 
Look at hear, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya 
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value 
I got a clearer view, and being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you 

I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through 
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed 
I made a decision, that everything will be alright 
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed 

Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin' 
Even though we probably link up every now and then 
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend 
Something that we allow that I don't even have to mention 
Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question 
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me 
And some hate to see the s*** I've been going through lately 
See you was here, when it started to haywire 
You're still here, walkin with me going through the fire 
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too 
On everything that I believe and I appreciate it you 
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name 
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same 
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out 
But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out 
I got a clearer view, I thank God that you're here for me and I'm here for you 

I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through 
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed 
I made a decision, that everything will be alright 
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed 

I, look in your eye, and I see the pain in it 
Life's a game, maybe the game did it 
I know I changed, they say the fame did it 
Life's changed, maybe the game did it 
Two friends, now in two different places 
And the mister catchin' planes, and you catching cases 
Friendship, we never based it on position 
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision 
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us 
I would come to town and never get up, with you 
Around then, things weren't so simple 
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through 
Outside chatter, messing with our mental 
On the chase of ? trust, you can't forget to 
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to 
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you 

I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through 
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed 
I made a decision, that everything will be alright 
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed

Welcome everybody, you are ""live in the den""
With big tigger hangin' out today with one of my friends

What up, okay if you ain't know it be one of the best of all time
Busta bust for short, for some better know me bust' rhymes
(What's good?) maintainin' (same here, just smashin')
(How the fam?) they all good my nigga, thanks for askin'
You and yours?

We all blessed, things ain't too bad
Still dealin' with last year's sudden loss of my dad
(Man, my condolences) thanks dawg, let's begin
Ain't seen you in a sec, busta what you been up to since then?

Stayin' healthy and keepin' it movin' while I just be showin'
These other niggas how to do it while I'm constantly growin'
I've been learnin' a lot, and still earnin' a lot of money crazy
Doin' my thing and securin' a win for all my babies

Aight, well it's clear in this new year you've been busy
But how you been dealin' with the drama of the loss of your man izzy?

It's been one of the most traumatic times and I'll never forget it
I'm survivin', thus bein' a punchin' bag for those affected
It's somethin' that I accepted, it was hard to understand
The way things happen, but in the end I guess it's god's plan

Word, heard you beefin' with five-oh, couple cases on rotation
And on top of that, bust' rhymes is now on probation?

Yeah, and I thank judge Stevens and we was happy to see
That he ain't send me up north 'cause I got a family to feed

Changed your image up last year, cut the dreads down low
And also, gave the appearance of some major muscles
Now on the low streets been talkin' like it usually do
Busta bust, help us out, the public needs to know

Just for the record the reason a nigga cut off the dread
I had to shed, tired of carryin' weight on my head
Secondly, it's all good when niggaz talk, well they need to back it up
Only needles I use is when I tat-tat-tat it up

Uh, some people sayin' you changed, even your flipmode fam (uh-huh)
I heard the word's came safe from rah digga and baby sham (right)
Said you (passed the courvoisier) to pick up a gun
Said you more concerned about bein' hard than havin' fun

Yo, wow tig', I see you takin' it there, you got your arsenal, huh?
I think I know where you got that from, that vibe article bruh
The press'll turn your family against each other for 'fetti, to sell a book
Besides we all talked already and we good

Wow, that's what's up, be clear it's goin' down
And if you wanna holla' at bust call us up right now
Phone lines is open, what y'all, wanna discuss?
What's good caller, you ""live in the den"" with big tig' and bust
(Hey tig'!) what's good ma? (enjoyin' the show)
(But there's somethin' about busta I've been dyin' to know)
Well holla at him

Hey busta (what's good ma?)
I've been a fan since way back when you dropped ""woo-hah""
(Woo-hah!) yeah, that was my joint
Every album since then always been on point
(Thank you) videos and big shows is hardcore
So why you think your albums haven't sold more?

Well baby, the nature of the business is unstable
Especially when your project ain't properly promoted by your label
E'ry album I put out gold or platinum, just a second
Check the hardware on my walls is major, just for the record

Read about you in a book or two
Now tell me bust, please discuss, were they all lies or some of it true?

Well I read about you in a couple of books too son
But I don't even know, tell me which book you readin' from

Aight, next caller

Hey busta, heard about you on Miss Jones
(Why you bringin' up old shit? you need to leave that alone)
So I'm sayin', is it true what she said?
Did you jump right out from between her legs and start fryin' eggs?

I can't remember exactly but I used to ride to her hood
And pick her up all hours a night, thought the pussy was good
'Bout fifteen years ago, shit
I can't imagine she'd remember that a nigga made a mean egg sandwich

I seen a couple websites try to put you on blast (uh-huh)
With your relationship with homegirl with the real fat ass

Who? you talkin' 'bout deelishis? yeah her body is vicious
She like trouble; thus we only friends, y'all made us a couple

How do you deal with the gossip, rumors and lies
And feelin' like each and every move you make is analyzed?

Yo, it's all good, you see the blessing is a gift and a curse
To be in a position I am, shit could be worse

I know my time's runnin' short so let me get to this thought
I'm sure you wanna thank your fans for all of their support

Absolutely, see y'all are why I shine like the sun
Big up to all my peeps who been ridin' with me since day one
It's why I walk the streets with pride, you niggas know how I shit it
It's why I rep it thorough for all the fans who stay committed

Busta, now you've been gettin' it in since way back when
So what you say to critics sayin' you can't do it again?

See I ain't gotta say shit to 'em, I'm off to somethin' else
Nigga check my résumé, bitch it speak for itself
It's why I always do what I do, and I big up my chest
God put his hands on me, you could see that I'm blessed
And I'm grateful

Aight, it's time to go
But I thank y'all for tunin' on in to the ""live in the den"" show

And if you don't know, now you know
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Holla busta [both men ad libbing]

I said ""Yeah, Flipmode, Flipmode is the greatest""

Busta Rhymes,"This, could be something big! 

Don't change the station,
I've been impatiently waiting,
Pacin', welcome to the Danger Zone.
It's a war goin' on outside 
And my people gotta paint they faces on.
And what I gotta do, And what I gotta do
Is work and flip a dolla'.
Ain't got no trophies
But I got a shelf of empty liquor bottles.

Not an alcoholic but alcohol it,
Can ease the pain.
Drinkin' all my problems away
But still prayin' in Jesus' name.
Tryna' turn our voices up, 
And the government tones us down.
Now that gas is goin' up,
And the hood is goin' down.

So the hood is comin' fo' ya'
In the streets is hungry goons!
Comin' to a neighborhood near you,
Today or someday soon.
Betta' watch yo' back, watch yo' front, 
And watch yo' side to side.
Betta' grab yo' gat, light that blunt;
The streets gon' ride tonight.

And I'm just gon' ride it out,
Til my expiration date.
'Cause I go hard and the paint (?), 
They softer than paper plates.
Make way for the revolution,
And yes you should be scurred.
Cause one way or another
My people will be heard.

Show you what the soldiers see:
Embassy, Diplomacy,
Since seen (?) infantry,
Shootin' at the cobra fleet (?).
Deploy shots, similar to airbags, whereas,
This hairpin, trigga' split a hair in half.
Body bags, fish it (?) like Harland (?),
When I'm airin', tear a chair in half.

Watchin' Half Baked,
At the cabin by the Lake.
See the blue and white plates,
See the wood on the panel.
I may be Chanel Oat, Chilly O, Flannel Coat (??).
Warfare? Never fair,
Therefore, I need finer things:
Like grenades; tanks; a couple fighter planes.

I'm decorated in medals;
Stripes like a Zebra.
And by the way, you rappin' Nigga's,
I don't like you neitha'.
I mean, ""either,"" proper gramma', 
Pop a camera, man on that rap, DVD propaganda.
Yeah, Willie the Kid, I ain't one for the shenanigans,
Nigga' strike a pose, leave you froze, like a mannequin.

(During Kid's last verse) In these times,
The economy got nigga's thinkin'
The worst to make paper.
Cause somebody ain't accommodatin' nigga's
Enough for they slave labor.
That's when ya' get a Nigga' thinkin' about
Ya' know he gotta' come in to ya'.
It's when a nigga' throw a ski mask on, 
Run up in ya' house, and wanna' do dumb shit to ya'.

Rollin' the dices with a nigga' that be strugglin',
Tryna' make it through the crisis.
It might just make him wanna' act up a little bit
To print another new gas prices.
All this fuckery we got goin' on,
Indeed it needs to cease. 
How the hell is that ever, ever gonna happen
When the value of the dollar keeps decreasin'?

Easin' my hand in somebody's pocket 
(Fuck that!) I gotta' keep eatin.
Speakin' for everybody in the struggle like me,
We gotta get it even if we cheatin'!
Breathin' hard, my mind is blown,
Tryin' not to get evicted out my home.
But tryna' live when you know a nigga' broke 
Is like tryna' squeeze blood out a stone.

But I'm goin' through the drama with DJ Drama (What!?).
I do it for my kids and mama (Who!).
Leave it to Barack Obama (Yes!),
Change is right around the corna'.
You tryin' to keep our people sufferin', 
All I gotta say is if you don't ease up this pressure,
I promise somebody gonna' pay!

(Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness!
Pursuit, huh? 
See Each and every day we all get closer
To the real meanin'.
Me, myself? I always follow my own path
And now I come here to motivate!

And everyday, my pursuit.

We don't share food in the recession
Bite these niggas like you bite the microphone

Living legend inside of a Smith & Wesson sliding out
Of the barrel, I'm fire, don't try me cause I am hot
Police cars with they sirens come by when I'm rhyming
Saying they got a call that somebody 'round here done fired shots
Mac-11's in order, the flow is like water
Each quote's a quarter of blow, the chorus is followed by the dot
Goons, goblins and creatures and monsters are bouncing
And beat ya and stomp ya and eat ya, don't get swallowed by the block
I pay a shrink every week to basically tell me
""Lay here and speak to me"" just to say how psychotic I am not
I'm too fly with the viral and physical copies
Niggas sloppy, look up what you under, I'm what you tryna top
I'm scared and compared to no man, I'm like the big hand on Big Ben
I get in and I'm hitting my numbers 'round the clock
I'm 'bout to give it back to my nigga Bus-a-Bus
And have a seat, it's convenient I'm already copping a squat

Nowadays when niggas walk around
They start to look like hamburgers and frankfurters
Ayo, Royce Da 5'9"", feed on these mothafuckas, homie, come on

Take him, gut him and take out his organs and smorgasbord him
The more important he is I'm toe-tagging his beat
Turn him to chicken chowder, dip him in some sniffing powder
Season him with gasoline and throw his ass in the grease
Mention my name in a record, I'mma come get you lyrically
Individually I'mma take it back to the streets
Cannibalistic mentality, rappers hating
Decapitate him, rap 'bout what I naturally happen to be
Flow is superb and you heard us forget it, two verses
Two murders acquitted, personally it's a wrap, capiche?
Fingers snapping and tapping they feet
Clapping what happened the street, 'bout to happily bring it back to the D
Niggas claiming harder that all of this time
Niggas believe him until I see him and then slap him and see
I ain't having it, havoc is average to me
War's normal, only thing I'm having is having a feast

Royce Da 5'9"", you my dog and I'm your dog
Being that I already sic'ed you on these mothafuckas
It's your turn to sic me on they ass, let's go!

Every time that I marry the rhyme and the beat
I go hairy and grind in the street, then I'm fucking up everybody
Mobilizing shit like we gorillas and peeling your skin
Like we banana peelers, it's hazardous if you copy
Don't you know that I'm one of the coldest courageous
The boldest contagious, ain't no one can phase this thing that I do
Well, you know since I report the latest that niggas can't fuck with me
Cause I'm the greatest, my shit is sick like the flu
You see I'm animalistic, the cataclysmic events
That'll happen whenever I grab the mic and talk
Indeed them bag us specifically that I'm hickory dickory
Dock of this rizzy, the diddy bop in my walk
Now I'm the messenger to set the temperature nigga
Whenever the heat will be needed to hot the block up, I'm saying
I got the dillinger, Harry Kissinger with the ratchet
The fact is I'm back with the clack and the click, see I ain't playing

Why, oh why, oh why? Royce Da 5'9"", please tell me why!
Why the fuck these niggas gon' let us get together and do this shit to 'em
It's so fucking unfair, shit is so unfair!",Dinner Time,2009

Pick 'em out the panic, a little manic 'cause I gotta be
Frantic, I'ma jam it 'cause I'm an oddity
Down for the trackin' like I'm grabbin' at my binoculars

Yo, when it exposed, the flow be hold it, 'cause when that motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the rear
Better to get just near the mirror, ready to get near my heels
Gimme the knock and I'ma chop it, he came and it went tomorrow
But I'ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas

Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough

From Missouri to Canada, I be keepin' the stamina

Killa Kaz'll fuck anybody, Tech is calamitous

He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with' it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinkin' he can give it the Poe and toss it Picasso

Jewelry Jacqueline Onassis could appreciate
Weed to alleviate the pain
Eddie King, Richard Pryor pinky ring
Watch your conduct nigga
Throw parties for my niggas that’s living, you guessed it
Models y'all keep them if they anorexic
Love em but can’t trust them
Hate em but won’t bust them
Caking in savings, spending, wasting
It's like a custom
Tats are hieroglyphics
Lipstick on the collar

When did the rules change
Y’all living trendy on pennies
Meeting deadlines with ease, no game
You fire, I'm butane

Dump on creatures, holidays and preachers
Stainless steel watches, ostrich turtlenecks

Cayenne Porsche rap, how many horses live official
I run with generals who flash Uzis in interviews

Look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya neck bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied cowards and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate or like my nigga Drake say
""We ain't got time to respond to niggas""

I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood gang, five
It's that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fight
They actin' like they ain't gon' die until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroin, it's no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

They say I'm underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' ""there he goes again!""
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain't no fakin', ain't no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin'
Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (DAMN!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I'm out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with tha Carter IV",Outro,2011

Ashanti, we missed you baby
Busta, bus, karma music

But What about my pride
You're never satisfied
You made me feel like I wasn't worth being by your side
Out of sacrifice, all of my damn time
Giving you all mine
You see me dying inside

Trying to see
Trying to find
Trying to be
The woman you love
Tried everything
But it just don't seem like it's enough
Hey baby, tried to believe
But I'm tired of being tired
Trying to love
Trying to fight
And I'm running out of tries
You're just no good

But everything that I think
And all the love that we make
It never should took place
I gave you my heart,
You've been trading I know
I should have let you go
Cause I'm back where I was before, baby

But it just don't seem like it's enough

And I'm running out of tries
You're just no good

I know you're rapping to moves I'll be making, yes
They'll be gone to trivial tribulations, yes
It don't matter how difficult it'll get
I love you regardless the situation
I see you drew a line in the sand
You ain't gotta leave me home, I hand
Every time I get up and I think about that we're feeling, I say is damn
I know at times I really hurt your head
I've been, I've stressed you out
And really get you fed up
I will never ever gonna let up
Unless it makes you happy for me to shut up
But I ain't shutting up, because I really wanna give it to you
I can't replace a feeling when we get up with each other
And I ain't trying to lose you
Now what you expect me to do, let's take a of trip with you to Honolulu
Come on, maybe we can spend some time together
Tried to make a better girl, I choose you
But if you admit it that we really done
I respect it, and baby I'm a go
But once I walk out the door,
I ain't never coming back baby
Hell no

Trying to see
Trying to find
Trying to be

At the table with the family
Having dinner, Blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker
Then it gave a lil' flicker then
I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter
I said cool, cool
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now

It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you give to charity
Rarely do people, don't wanna even help at all
'Cause they wont bother buying, getting toys, getting dolls
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold

Sleep when I'm gone

They say sleep is the cousin of death, guess we related
Cause I'm the most slept on, and the most hated
Hated by niggas with no hustle
Starin' at me in the club like I won't bust you
In the face with the spades, life is a card game
And I'm playin' spades, gamblin' with y'all change
Fuckin' basketball wives, while you at away games
Really fuckin' basketball wives, ain't gotta say names

And only rest to rise again homie, I sleep when I'm gone
Look, a legend while I'm prime, and so current and they hate this
The streets classified me as another level of greatness
I don't fight for crowns at all, I let whack niggas bitch
And let 'em flip while they debate on who the king of this shit
Listen, see I don't waste time debatin' over those things
Because I'm God motherfucker, God create kings
Watch it, I'm hearin' that a lot of niggas mad through the grapevine
The piano soundin' beautiful and sad at the same time
The feelin' of a funeral, so study you niggas

Now there's no escaping the God, you better find a get away

Smoke comin' out the sunroof, blowin' on hasheesh
Can't stop now, cause I'm in too deep
One point five wide, every two weeks
Niggas wanna kill me, let the shells fall out
Life insurance in place, my kids gon' ball out
They kids gon' ball out, twenty years from now, pullin' cars out
You gon' think cocaine gettin' hauled out
Ass gettin' chipped in, crystal meth gettin' dipped in
All cause you let a nigga slip in
Aftermath, ""0"" five, G-Unit, ""0"" six
Everything else is gymnastics, watch the dough flip
Sittin' on the couch, smokin' up memories
Pourin' Jack Daniels, toast to my enemies

See the time and now a nigga climbing up another milli
Then we shining till a nigga blind them, up until it kills me
Forth and back and my dying is a nigga til it pulls up on the track
Then I'ma die sixty niggas til we pop off like we in the wild west
When I finished giving you the crack what?!
If you knew I'm in route to the crib just to park the Bugatti at the house
Sin big and one of my bitches really turn her out now
Still everyone know I gotta potty mouth now
Shit they got me doing it again
Back to bodying things and lots of screwing other women
You can never stop the shit that I'm doing
And the way that we moving
Get it popping, never stopping, kill em in the end now
And I'ma get em to the point when I got em all open, handling my business with em ha!
Trust me you don't wanna start cause you know its torture!
Every single minute til I finish with em
And I knock shit down
Every time I come and then I lock shit down
Til I come up place niggas better drop that crown
Ever here, 'fore I pop you clowns
And I go erase niggas!",Potty Mouth,2012

Bleeding in the streets as we're breathing the pollution
They're saying that we need a revolution
But their passion is reduced to all-caps on a computer
Hey, every sixteen I make a sick scene
Blood splattered all on you shirt like a Miskeen
Y'all niggas trippin' like mescaline and mixed greens
My flow cleaner than the Sistine, pristine
You going green like Al Gore with 'em
I make algorithms that got Malcolm in 'em
God's favorite, I'm sick as a doctor's patient
We live in a cold world, my job is to rock nations
My occupation? Elation, a celebration of rebels
Raise the levels and the decibels flagrant
It's too amazing how we be blazing, son
Our flowers is the loudest, they crowd around us
But cower in the shadows of the towers, boy

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off

Yo, I plaster the nation, causing evacuation
My manifestation got 'em patient from how I keeps it amazing
See, I'm the reason niggas need some training
While I'm inflicting the pain and making it suitable for any occasion
I'm very engaging soon as I'm awaken
Quickly back you up and bag your bitch
She's reminding me of Sanaa Lathan
Rely on the hating while I'm smiling and waiting
That's when I embrace 'em
If you try to front, you'll be highly mistaken
The mightiest making of a classic, alrighty, I'll face it
My psyche is ancient and I'm hiring, so try me, I'm patient
Sorry, I'm lying, face it, I'm back for the taking
I'm urgently giving niggas the courtesy of smashing their face in
(Damn, can you cut his mic off?)
See how we got 'em buggin'
Cause they can't believe what we have in the making
Shit so historic, got me goin' for it while I bang the nation
And do niggas greasier than a slab of bacon

Bitch, you still cooking this pork in this house?
Stop cooking that damn pork in this house
The hell going on in here?

Take a tour with it, bake the raw
Where the beats so savage
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floor
Make a call, all the rocket ships taking off
Jah, Wu, gun music playin' when we facing off

These rap niggas is bitches, nothing but suckers to me
Sacrifice myself for the music and let them suffer through me
Your weak product is nothing to me
I only feel effects when I fuck with Louis
Yep, I get buck in the studio like I'm Evil Dee
Pulling strings like the Muppet movie
Shining my light like Mos calling his mother Umi
Who's the hottest regardless of who's flaming?
We ain't talkin' 'bout the best until you mention my name
Who're you kidding? The truest spitting
I'll break you like a mirror so it's clearer
That we don't believe in superstition
These new additions need supervision
Thinking that they can spit it in the booth like me
What are you stupid? Listen
I've been official, it's been official, I'm too consistent
I make a claim cause I'm too official for euphemisms
Staying in the cut like a new incision
I'll put you on your ass like True Religion
So give it up for the truest living

Them holidays comin', so you know we quick to spray
Muscle is a must, the money in the can
Strapped every day, we still hustle in the sand

An amount that amounts to a mountain of money
Ride out with my dunny, fresh up out your mommy
Shout to the tummy - eat, sleep, shit on my toes
Bust a bitch in her nose cause they mouth so runny
Back to the money, Dada
Give a nigga bread like ""bless you"" (thank you) nada
I'm been on the block from the top tryna plot on a spot
Now I'm game with it - ta da!
Fuck around, I'll bang with the sawed-off
Fuck around, rob these niggas, do my thing like ""voila""

I've been dancing with the devil, he was always good to me
And I've been walking in the shadow of a friendly enemy

Shoulda known that you would bring me down

I swear I told you last time
You knew I wasn't good for you
But you swore you hit the jackpot
And you swore you struck gold
You were stepping on your toes
Always tripping over nothing
But nothing's on the floor
I swear the time it takes
To congregate and conversate
Just so things don't complicate
I just don't have the time of day
To try to pay attention to what your momma say
She just moving lips, moving lips
Talking 'bout stupid shit, stupid shit
And she don't know how to keep the man
But she can move them hips, move them hips

I've been dancing with the devil, he was always good to me
And I've been walking in the shadow of a friendly enemy
But now I'm fucking broken, living in the moment

And I love the way shorty get low
And the way she bending over and she touching on her toes
Momma see me looking at her then she wanna pose
I don't even know why shawty got on any clothes
And you really know already what I'm gonna drop
Hella money, mami wanna come up to the top
I walk a little closer then I do my Diddy bop
I love the way she moving and the way she make it pop
And I'm loving the way that you're making it bounce and you're moving it, doing it
See the way that you're breaking it down and the way that you got them all losing it
Get it, lit, shake it, shake it
Bounce, turn up, level, level
Do it nasty like you out here dancing with the devil

Hey, hey, hey
I knew you were trouble, trouble, trouble
Don't wanna look you in the fa-a-ace
I knew you were trouble, trouble, trouble

I wake up and chase my dreams
I won't regret when the sun sets
Cause I live my life like I'm a beast
I'm a mothafucking beast

Ayo back to make you run around the game like its a fire
I spit acid bitch like I got cyanide in my saliva
Watch me wet and heat shit up like I'm a washer and a dryer
While I beat you in your head until you tire
(I'm a motherfucking beast)
See the way we got my niggas is open
I'm doing it again [?]
Got a nigga wilding like he in a bull pen
Look at me wishing holiday hopin'
Go down with the menace and I stop and I won't finish
But I'll drop and I put skill in it, hotter than a skillet
Pinkie fuck them with the guard, the gun is at your head
Every single time you niggas see me, step beside the door
Killing everything with a thousand gorillas, my homi's so
I suggest you bow to let your chick eat my salami slow
Cry like a [?] niggas in the hood with that tsunami flow
Get back homie before you get snapped
Even got a bitch strapped in the club with a snub nose
While I make them black with a banging and then crack
Niggas in the head and back, everybody, 'til the club close
Haters I see you sitting over there
That's why you see me blacking everywhere

Homie welcome to the east side, where killers reside
We playing war games, please hide
Ain't no signs of peace, so fuck a peace sign we ride
Bust shots from a car seat
My nigga hang you 'til your neck is broke
Choke with you with a Stethoscope
That's how I kill a motherfucker in a heartbeat on a dark street
(I'm a motherfucking beast)
I'm a motherfucking beast right
Keep it three, Five, Seven, in a Levis
When the beam fries, house game could be used as the disguise
Look in these eyes, blast, then you gonna see when the heat fly
Yo, is it we dumb or is it the city we from
Got us killing each other over these bread crumbs
You fuck with me it's gonna be [?] Area 1-51
This murder rap is red rum
I done seen that nigga help you with a pistol
Pull a gunmen out the window of a rental situation, detrimental
Little kids are getting caught up in the middle, and they killed, it's accidental
That's why I'm keeping a pistol, matter of fact capture my enemy
Kidnap or slap him in the back of the Infinity
Bandanas to mask the identity, start scratching like Charles Manson
Or [?], fight back, attack me with energy, fight back will add to your injury
When I write raps you have to have a Bachelors in Chemistry
Or a Masters in Math to be in the actual vicinity
To pass me up mentally, to match my agility
From Aspen to Italy, I have the ability to send your ass to the trinity
Like death when it's after the Kennedy's

But they don't know how the IRS hung me
What do you do when they take all of your money
Get gram like gumby come back like a bungee
All of my grief it is making me unleash
On a bum all my opponents will cease
So I'm yelling to the north, and the south, and the west and the east
I'm motherfukin' beast
When you don't have nothing
Only have the way that you go its still mad tough
And the crowd stuff, the lab book, and notes with the bad luck
And the flash up with the cash stuffed up in the bag
And you gotta get it no matter what
Don't give that money to put enough in your gut
I gotta be the killer because I'ma stunt [?] leave us in the dust
The ruthless, killed my mother
Something really stupid, feel my brothers
And I'm beginning to treat my ill like others
With real life smothers, I feel like thuggers
So bang, try to my way up in the gang, with the pain I write this
I came to ice ya, a ring to nice ya
She hanging knifeless, I'm stranger, hey bitch I aim when I spit
For the winning I'm gonna increase
The pressure when I'm having no peace, feel me
Because I gotta eat, I won't let the demons release, kill me

I am that monster coming to get you to say the least

Used to be the only one, now I'm the big bro (I'm here too)
Know my daddy schizo, don't mess with his kids yo
Me and my brother tight (yeah), we like the Klitschkos
I love you daddy

Ten years later, I love you too sons
I do life in the box if they ever fuck with my two sons
You're my lil' man, I remember the first day you came out
Your lil' face, your big nose, your lil' feet, your lil' hands
You turned one, come in the room wobbly, lil' stance
And every time I walked in the house he used to do this lil' dance
On the cover of the album with them Chucks on
You cried for 6 hours, your mama in here going nuts on me
She said you had enough, I said we having fun
All babies cry when they're one, my career had just begun
And so did being a daddy
Car seat in my Escalade, you want me in the Caddy
Playing Like Father, Like Son, looking in the back seat
He don't look nothing like his mama if you ask me
On the first album Busta Rhymes did the hook
Now he can do it for himself, watch him and his uncle cook
Buss

I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you

I wanna thank my baby mamas Tiff and Eliska for everything
Y'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring
It ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you
Wasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you
And I know you remember that time when he was 5
All these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes
So I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about
Nothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate
Catching up with my son, cause ain't nothing more important
Than walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans
Helping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9
I asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time
So we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married
He still my best man, and that's forever
Anybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave
But I'm a father, and I'ma be everything he need and more

I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you

Every time I get in this booth
I'm reminded ten years ago I did it for you, had this vision for you 
And I know your daddy get in trouble sometimes
But I'ma stay up out this prison for you, I mean
You all my seed, lil' brother and both of your sisters
You all I need like Method and MJB
And I know I be wildin' sometimes, you told me (""Breathe daddy"") (1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4)
Furthermore, I'm try'na stay outta trouble just for my sons
Even though it feel weird leaving my house without a gun
I just gotta do it, cause they might grow up and do this shit
Just cause they father do it, fuck with my kids and six Bloods
Jumping out a Buick, understand Puff choking that man for Jus
I'ma do my stuff even if I land in fucking cuffs
For every nigga out here without a kid
Have one and that's gon be the best shit you ever did

I'm drawing back to the source, my immediate heritage
Who is gonna stop me?
What the main fucking question is

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Fuck what they say, way today

Pat 'em down, count the money, let 'em see the work (Yeah)
That's the definition of a major key alert
Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first (Nah)
Won't be the last, all we see is cash (Yeah)
Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (Liar)
So keep the movies in, stop actin' out
And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither
Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure
Was a crack monster, I had that hard fever
Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar
Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics
I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (Never)
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask it
You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic
Next thing is cremation or a casket
Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that
I need my name in the cocaine almanac (Jada)
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack
Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back
Either way I ain't never evil
Why you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em
My heart stops, but the words are forever breathing
You hatin' 'cause we the best, find a better reason

First thing first don't ever play yourself (Ever)
Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself (Never)
Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself (It's me)
Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself
See I'm showin' up a K off, gain a Rollie, a day off
Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs
Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (Swish)
Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff
See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit
Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets
I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit
You niggas got fat while everybody starved
My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off
When you're in the Benz, it piss everybody off
So I ain't stall, I do me, I ain't y'all
This New York nigga let 'em hang, giant balls
Odell Beckham, respect him, you can't check him (You can't)
Blindside hoes hit me when I don't expect 'em (Hey bighead)
Then I hit 'em with the curve from the major league
Gotta wait your turn, that's a major key

Mami yellin' I'm the greatest
Back to back with the slow cum
In the lane, I got her so strung, I don't even know her
Every night I meet a new wife
Now ask your wife what this dick like
Balmain Joe, every time you see, a nigga flee
Mr. Officer, I was only grabbin' ID
Mami only listen to Romeo
Wild cowboy, I be speakin' through the yayo
'Bout to let the cans go, woah
Fuck your bitch and let your mans know, so
Yeah, now it's the Don in the Don, couple laughs in the Uber
Only drivin' Uber 'cause I'm franchised in Cuba
This is big money talk and you tied to the sideline
Brian Scalabrine, niggas always tryna high five
Gotta stay away from day driftin', all sauce
Every day Vera Wang, nigga, cloth talk

Now I'm takin' over everything like that's my callin'
Wakin' up in pussy like beautiful Sunday mornin'
Now we swimmin' in the money like a line of dolphins
Prepare for the killin', now please line up all of the coffins (Closed casket nigga)
Think we playin'? Niggas think it's funny?
Pop you in your shit, brotha, now make room for the money (Move!)
If you don't make room, I'll beat a nigga past painful
Make a fool of yourself, I'll beat you past shameful
I get this bread and shine like an angel
One of the last with bars, you niggas better be grateful (Thank you so much)
I Diddy bop and drop on you niggas
I count bread and take it to the top on you niggas (Mountaintop)
Blah blah blah blah, you sound alike, my niggas
Blah, blah, but when I do it, I finesse, I got it locked, my niggas
I give you new brand shit, fuck you gon' do?
And know we love the boom bap, oh yeah we do this too
Yeah, fuck with the realer side, oh you against us, nigga?
You better run and hide, until I'm finished, nigga
Don't play yourself
Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket
Pray yourself, end in a basket
Hate yourself 'cause you ain't ask if you could possess you a heater
Or you could be you a leader for the people
Talk a lot, I've seen the truth like Sevyn Streeter
Don't you ever play yourself

I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out
I offered to help you shape up, I see that you'd rather flake out
Sellin' stories on them tracks that nobody can seem to make out
That's why I keep a good head and shoulders to keep all the flakes out
Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up
I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up
You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up
It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers
Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three
No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me
A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in
I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open
I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets
I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat
I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat
I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet
While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy
Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy
You gotta finish bigger than you start
Or fall victim to bent stories, you ain't even part of it all
Start from the bottom, oh please, or don't start at all
I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah
'Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, and saw
Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car
Your baby wanna get nailed in the Sprinter Lexus
Text back and told her, ""Please be hammered so you can sex us""
My arm strong, if Louisiana then tell her Texas
And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message
FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3
And two things you gotta be, uh, New Orleans
I'm an organ donor, I'm alive with no heart in me
So never say my name in vain, 'cause bitch there's no arteries

Take your pick, but you only get one shot
Advice from a schoolteacher to a young tot
Applyin' a sticker to his Spiderman lunchbox
When even role models tell us we're born to be felons
We're never gettin' into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon
And we gon' end up either robbin' somebody or killin'
It's not fair that's all they can tell us
That's why you hustle hella hard, never celebrate a holiday
That'll be the day I coulda finally hit the lottery
I refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away
Or chalk it up as just another one that got away
So I'm unapologetic, I'm on my calesthenics
If I have given it all I got I cannot regret it
My point of destination's different from where I was headed
'Cause I'ma shoot for the stars to get it, one shot

I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
Yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy and hungry

No, I'm not throwin' away my shot
Yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot

When opportunity knock, you don't send anyone to get it
Answer the door, welcome it, let it in or regret it
They said if you can't beat 'em you join 'em
I said, ""Forget it""
'Cause once you join 'em you're buildin' a ceilin' the way you're headed
Be American, express how you feel and take the credit
Don't settle for 87, go premium unleaded and
Take off, shake all the hate off, it's over
It's they loss, the payoff's their weight off your shoulders
Must admit, I'm feelin', I'm kind of um
Lighter as a writer with this fire and desire to go higher
Than a stealth fighter pilot with my eye on every prize
I surprise you guys, I'm a prize fighter

Setbacks and take steps back from pied pipers
Be leaders, believers in yourself and mean it

Rise up
If you livin' on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
When are folks like me and you gonna rise up?
Every city, every hood, we need to rise up
All my soldiers, what's good? We need to rise up
We ain't got no other choice, we need to rise up
Rise up!

Throughout my travels and journeys through life I've been searchin'
And been learnin' to be the type of person to display how determined I get
When I'm certain, inside I feel that fire that's burnin'
Like a knife that is turnin', I fight while I'm hurtin'
Sometimes they're right 'cause life is a burden
Like the pain from a bite that'll worsen
Tryna stifle the light that'll shine on me first and
Before I ride in a hearse and
My breathing stops and you'll never take my one shot I got 'fore I lie in the earth
And now I kill again on that Hamilton Hercules Mulligan
Readin' in Vanity Fair or the Huffington
Done with the sufferin', we in the guts again, family rushin' in
Wonder where Busta been, feelin' the hunger and feedin' the lust to win
See I've been patiently waitin' for this moment
To rise up again, that's the way I was molded
And as the last one standin' as the rest of them foldin'
Give me my one chance to grab the torch and properly hold it

I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
Ayy, yo I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot

On s'en fout de ton visage, montrez nous un peu de string

Et vous les gars faut être costauds, bien habillés faut être gosse-beau
Et si il parle sur ta sœur, sur ta mère
Sur ta femme, faut qu't'envoies ce type à l'hosto
Et si tu veux te taper plein d'filles, faut pousser la fonte

Et les parents sont contents, ils ne voient pas la pagaille
Ils s'occupent pas de leurs enfants, ils ont beaucoup de travail
Et les défilés filent s'imaginent à Philadelphie

Yo, nobody listen ‘cause ya know we didn’t wanna follow nobody
Don’t wanna discipline because of who is givin’ in
When they really busy giving themselves to telephones
It's the kinda day we livin' in
But I know the kinda wolrd that we fightin'
The kinda fire we lightin' and let me show you what you shoulda do
Show you how to focus and show you the truth about yourself
When you be on the phone, is the phone really using you?
Everybody wanna possess
Citizens they wanna post money and they wanna post
Even the footage of somebody who’s gettin' ready to die
You mothafuckas be doin' the most so you can brag and boast
So try to catch the ghost inside your camera phones and banana homes
I got the answer though, and the antidote
And this time I go to war, hope you planned to go
They say, “I’m glad you’re back!” I tell ‘em “cut the check
Now where your values at, and where your self-respect?”
I got a plan for that, but yo we get up and rap
And we are, we’re givin’ the truth you better watch your step, you better
You better know where you’re going, you better know when to leave
You better know how you’re going in every moment you breathe
You better prove what they’re showin'
Because we never fuck around you know we keepin' it growin' (you gotta)
And I hope you’ve been listenin'
Keep quiet ‘till you hear the birds whistlin’
Wherever you point because the way the common man think
In a common state of mind is a-cripplin'
And I’m here to re-position the conditionin'
Because it’s had a rippling effect and it’s sickenin'
God bless, get it right, everybody
And I hope you appreciate this kinda truth that you’re witnessin'
And envisionin'

You don't want no problem, you don't wanna mess with it
How I put it down I come around, niggas already be knowing already who be the best with it
How I step all up in the spot every time you see a nigga fresh step with a little fresh fitted
Bust every bottle in the building and I fuck shit up
I got 'em whilin' 'til a nigga tell he finished

And see her tell me she left shit in my telly

So it's making you march, wanna yell at me
When I react they call up Penelope's
Bitch ass, trick ass, sniff ass, ho

Go get a sick pass and a bitch badge 'cause you get mad, bro

Hollow tips in your belly, time to burn shit

Royal empress queen, damn, I so adore you
There's so many ways to describe this love I've been holdin' for you

For that original woman lovin', the nurture to God
The power of your presence speaks even when bein' silent
Universal alignment, I respect your refinement
The focus to blossom this love is my only assignment
I wanna provide and take care of you until we approachin' timing
And when you talk, your words remind me of beautiful speeches
Say to myself, I thank God for these beautiful creatures
Usually deep will be the feelin' every day we meet up
After we fuck, I'ma face you and kick my feet up
The way you hot inside is such a beautiful reminder
The type to make me comfortable puttin' my seed inside her
You're such a rider, love how you're such a fighter
And I wish that I could find a way to multiply her
I'll give it to her gentle, then I emulsify her
And when she asks to have it, I smash it and then we both retire
Put your hand up in the air, girl
Let me shine my light up on you earth while you in here, girl
Damn, you got me swingin', girl
What makes it hotter is mami and God's fan, girl

Suertes, me he enamorado de la luna mil veces o
Ninguna, he vivido cada sueño como si fuera
El primero

Entre los nombres y las dudas, me quedo con los
Besos, aquí sentado frente a mí

Mis lágrimas, quien me llena el
Vacío que hay dentro de mí, que me
Quema hasta morir

Maldita soledad, que me arrastra con sus manos en
La oscuridad, navegando un velero sin rumbo en
Esta inmensidad, maldita soledad

Los susurros de mi almohada, los recuerdos que me
Arañan, entre risas y caricias, y pasiones
Desmedidas, no me rendiré ni calmaré
Mi sed con miedo

Camino entre aguaceros, persiguiendo ilusiones
Para ser felíz, deshojando las flores que
Un día llenaron mi jardín

When it's turning upside down
When all I see is rain
When I think the night won't end

I just think of you
And I can see the sun again

Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now, baby
Whatever would I be without you

I'd be nowhere, I'd be nowhere
When the dreams I dream
All seem a million miles away
When I'm sure, I'll never win

When it's looking like
I've left my faith
I just look at you baby
And I got reason to believe again

Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now, baby
Whatever would I be without you

Without you to love me
I'd just be wasting time
And goin' out of my mind

Like a firefly without a light 
You were there like a slow torch burning 
I was a key that could use a little turning 

So tired that I couldn't even sleep 
So many secrets I couldn't keep 
Promised myself I wouldn't weep 
One more promise I couldn't keep

Wrong way on a one way track 
Seems like I should be getting somewhere 
Somehow I'm neither here no there

Make it somehow all seem worthwhile 
How on earth did I get so jaded 
Life's mystery seems so faded 

I can go where no one else can go 
I know what no one else knows 
Here I am just drownin' in the rain 
With a ticket for a runaway train 

Everything is cut and dry 
Day and night, earth and sky 
Somehow I just don't believe it

Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello

What goes on baby what goes on? (7X)

[El Da Sensai]
What goes on girl, you riff and you riff about
Brothers callin you a bitch, but tell me would you switch
Into shame, how one dame, can make a name for all
I guess it's like that when all the chips fall
It's critical stereotypical how they diss you
It ain't you that chill cause you know your status is true
Girls be trickin, on a mission listen what's it for?
All you get is people dissin callin you a whore
But I guess you don't stress it cause you just keep goin
Hoein and hoein thinkin you're sinkin kids for dough and
At the same time you whine how we call you this
Or that, it beez that way, givin me no play
Kickin facts and all that, diss em about the schisms
Who riff, when brothers call em hoe or a bitch
And if you think we're wrong, give me a gong, word is bond
And all I gotta ask is what goes on?

[Artifacts]
What goes on baby what goes on? (4X)

[Tame One]
I call em as I see em
Steamin on the scheamin as I kick this
Fitness with the quickness bout the gutter snipe type bitches
Flippin like switches and don't be knowin niggaz pedigree
You better be ready, I like +Sleepin With the Enemy+
My remedy is any G, fuck em and flee
I shoot the breeze at the skeeze, just because +The P is Free+
Don't try to play me baby yo, you must be crazy
Tryin to fade me with no clippers when I know you got some other niggaz
Just keep it real, word is bond we'll get along fine
I know that you're on mine, I peeped it for a long time
High saditty bitties, that's out for the price tag
? get bagged, and be the victim of a right jab
So if you walk like a bitch, talk like a bitch, it's on
But what goes on?

What goes on baby what goes on? (4X)

[El Da Sensai]
You in a relationship? Aight, well cool, we can do this
We start with a kiss and go right down the list
Analyze this, check it how we always spend time
Hittin all spots, bend it up every time
I give you what you want, even more if you ask
Just a small task, any spell you cast
But on the down low, you're hittin that bro, doin the same thing
Skeezin, but what's the reason for the treason?
That's why you're left all alone and you say we're wrong
Sing the song along, tell me what goes on?

[Girl]
This shit here, this is bullshit (hold up hold up hold up)
This is notty for a girl got gats too (I'm sayin)
All you hear now is bitch this bitch that
(cause y'all be actin like that)
What the fuck is goin on? (the fuck you want from me? yo)

[Tame One]
Don't catch offense when the gents call you names
If you ain't one, don't sweat it hon, it's just one of them thangs
In my slang, unless you catch a fit from hearin bitch
If the shoe fits, then wear it, I'm not dissin for the ?, get it
Not every girl's a bitch, yeah that's true
Like my Ma Dukes, but oh yes, the rest I seem to talk to
Are shady and not really the ladies they claim to be
It's crazy, everywhere I go, it seems the same to me
That's up until I'm gone
But on the way home I'm still thinkin, what goes on?

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night

Lose their taste for kissing?

Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2007
Butch Barbella,"Girl try to remember when we didn't have no shoes
We stuck together just me and you
It took a long time to get what we got today
Now you wanna give it all up for another guy

Baby, I'm tellin' you don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let it change your mind

It's gonna be hard for me baby
Feel my life all over 'cause baby you got the love that I really need
'Cause if you leave, leave me this way, baby
You know what? I may not live to see a brand new day

Oh baby, don't let, the green grass fool you
Don't let it change your mind
You know why, it may be greener on the other side, baby
But right in my arms is where you belong, ooh baby

Don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let it change your mind, oh baby
It may be greener on the other side, baby
But right in my arms is where you belong, baby

Don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let it change your mind
It may be greener on the other side, baby
In my arms is where you belong, yeah",Don't Let the Green Grass Fool You,2008
Butch Cassidy,"[Chorus]
Just another day 
Just another day 
Just another day
Just another day 

Wake up early in the mornin' man
Runnin' kinda' late I gotta' catch my plane 
Feelin' kinda' funny from the weed and things
Kinda' glad I woke up so I can't complain
I really need a break from this paper chase
But my girl ain't gonna' wait for the diamond ring 
My son ain't got to wait for no proper clothes
So I'm gone take a trip and do a couple of shows
So many different things be runnin' through my head
It's mandatory that I keep my family fed
On come the stompin' boots and I'm out there again
Seems like this crazy pace is never gonna' end.

[Chorus]

I'm on a mission man, I'm fired up 
They let me taste it man 
And now I'm hooked 
Ain't nobody standin' on the wall
I bust the way I bust because the feel it y'all
People got opinions all about me y'all 
Got a lot of girls so they call me dogg
Constantly around me is friends and foes
Say the wrong thing bet I bust your nose
I gotta' give give it up to niggaroes
Even thought at times we fuck the same hoes
All the other niggas I'ma let you know 
Ain't no player hatin' go for what you know 
And if you see a girl that I'd like to lay 
Feel free to send her my way

[Chorus]

If I call you baby would you swing my way tonight
I got somethin' for you that I'm sure you're gonna like. 
If I call you baby would you swing my way tonight
I got somethin' for you that I'm sure you're gonna like.

And we can do it all night 
I bet I hit it just right

Butch Cassidy,"I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man 
I'm just a man in love

When they asked me
Why I don't like love
Or why I don't have a lady
Maybe its because I know
As soon as I tell her
How I feel about her
As soon as I act like
I love her she's gone

I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (is why I don't have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love

I really was so into you
But you don't know what I'm going through
You say you really care for me
But in love there's no guarantee
So, I think I outta take my time
'cause love ain't no friend of mine you see

Don't let me get you too confused
You're the friend I don't want to lose
If I made a choice its you I choose
But my heart's a tad bit through
So, I try to get you off my mind
But a remedy I cannot find for you

I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (is why I don't have a lady)
I'm just a man
I'm just a man in love

I'm never gonna try to find
Another I'm just out for mine
I left so many far behind
But traces they'll never find
No, I can cover all my tracks (all my tracks)
Won't be nothing gettin' back to you

Now don't think that I'm being rude
Because I won't commit to you
And other women want to screw
What's a player supposed to do
So, I'll be slippin' on my hat
I won't be bringin' nothing back to you

I'm just a man (scared of love)
I'm just a man (that's why I don't have a lady)

Butch Cassidy,"I bang with the gang that don't need no intro
We run from East Long Beach to West South Central
Credentials, to kick flows and rip shows, 
dip 4's and pimp ho's while the indo blow
You know that west coast low mentality
Focused on reality but livin in a hole notha galaxy
We keep it straight hard but guard the spot
Bangas snatch chains in the parkin lot
Don't matta there still be fine ho's to gatha
Pick about the thickest bitch and I gots to hav ha
It's routine the coupe clean let's hit the sho
You know we all fuckin once they glimpse the po
Wit the satin in my hand pack the gat on my lap
Cuz it's hatin when your skaten and your pockets is fat
Don't act for a minute like your ass surprised
Just reconize the real way that gangsta's ride

If it ain't chronic don't blaze it up
And if it ain't a chevy don't raise it up
You know we keep it bangin don't fake the funk
So all the real niggaz stay gangsta'd up
We makein papa only suckas claim to touch
By stickin to the script and neva changin up
You know we keep it bangin don't fake the funk
Keep it real motherfucka stay gansta'd up

It's goin down motherfuckaz like dat
Sounds like Battlecat been upstairs wit Zapp
And the nockin don't stop
I hope nobody don't call the cops
It don't stop the beat'll make your pop block
Na betta yet cuz dis shit'll keep your glock cocked
You think I'm trippin fool I ain't bullshittin
You betta read up on dis shit to keep the latest non-fiction
Watch out for the friction
Dis West Coast on mine
And fuck anybody dssin nigga lissen
Dogg House style cuz I'm a gangsta crip
C-walkin holdin on the extra clip
Now you wanna be a frend
But you gunna make me unload and slap the other clip in reload
You wanna go toe to toe
Sit my pistol down on ground on the pound nigga hell no

I must stay gangsta'd up cuz it just lives in me
And when I seen enuff I guess dats when I'll free sumbody
Once said from willie c. nigga dont speek on me

I'm a Long Beach East Side mad ass lunatic
Gang bang slap a bitch nigga out to get a grip
On the grind gettin mine ask the homiez on the 9  2 o you know
We still own niggaz who talk bitch shit
Real niggaz feel dis let's get rich
Under the sun with the young 2 ones TLC's and all the DPG's
Down for whatever who eva wanna see me now
You lookin like me i guess you wanna be me now
It take a hole lot to be Snoop D-O-dub
You gotta put it down and always stay g'd up
All star shoes with the G apparel
If I fall in the club i mite bust a pair of Stacy Adams
You neva catch me lookin R&B

Blazin a ounce with the homie cat
Or Ruff Dogg cuz i luv puttin huslas on the map
I keep it gangsta for sho do lo
