Claire Moore,"You were once
My one companion
You were all
That mattered
You were once
A friend and father
Then my world
Was shattered

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Wishing you were
Somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed,
Somehow you would
Be here

Wishing I could
Hear your voice again
Knowing that I
Never would
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed
I could

Passing bells
And sculpted angels,
Cold and monumental,
Seem, for you,
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Knowing we must
Say goodbye
Try to forgive
Teach me to live
Give me the strength
To try

No more memories,
No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye.",Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,1995
Claire Moore,"No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.

Say you love me!
RAOUL
You know I do.

Anywhere you go, let me go to
Love me, that's all I ask of you.
(they kiss)

I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Wait for me Raoul!

Christine I love you!

Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!

And soon you'll be beside me!

You'll guard me and you'll guide me
(they hurry off and the phantom emerges from behind the statue)

I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing
Christine
Christine

Say you'll share with me one love,
One lifetime say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning

You will curse the day you did not do
All that the Phantom asked of you!

Claire Moore,"Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for
Its prey!

You have come here
In pursuit of
Your deepest urge,
In pursuit of 
That wish,
Which till now
Has been silent,
Silent...

I have brought you,
That our passions
May fuse and merge - 
In your mind
You've already
Succumbed to me,
Dropped all defences,
Completely succumbed to me -
Now you are here with me:
No second thoughts,
You've decided,
Decided...

Past the point
Of no return -
No backward glances:
The games we've played
Till now are at
An end...
Past all thought
Of ""if"" or ""when"" -
No use resisting:
Abandon thought
And let the dream
Descend...

What raging fire
Shall flood the soul?
Which rich desire
Unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction
Lies before
Us...?

Past the point
Of no return,
The final threshold - 
What warm,
Unspoken secrets
Will we learn?
Beyond the point
Of no return...

CHRISTINE
You have brought me
To that moment
Where words run dry,
To that moment
Where speech
Disappears
Into silence,
Silence...

I have come here,
Hardly knowing
The reason why...
In my mind,
I've already
Imagined our
Bodies entwining,
Defenceless and silent -
And now I am
Here with you:
No second thoughts,

I've decided,
Decided...

Past the point 
Of no return - 
No going back now:
Our passion-play
Has now, at last
Begun...
Past all thought
Of right or wrong -
One final question:
How long should we
Two wait, before
We're one...?

When will the blood
Begin to race,
The sleeping bud
Burst into bloom?
When will the flames,
At last consume
Us...?

Is crossed, so stand

Where in the world
Have you been hiding?
Really - you were perfect
I only wish
I knew your secret
Who is this new
Tutor?

Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here

Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside, hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius

Christine, Christine you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you

Angel of music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory

Who is this angel?
This

Angel of music, hide no longer
Secret and strange angel

He's with me even now

Claire Moore & Chorus,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",All Through the Night,1991
Claire Pelletier,"Était-ce femme ou bien rivière?
Était-ce la vie à la mort
Mêlée ainsi que l’âme au corps?
Laquelle chantait la première?
C’était la femme et la rivière
Et l’amour mêlé à la mort

Ils ont dit que c’était une fille
Moi, je dis que c’était la Manikoutai
L’oeil en feuille et la dent de coquille
Telle était la Manikoutai

C’était plus haut que la plaine
Il fallait pour aller là
La patience et l’aviron
Et connaissance de la chute
Du portage et du courant
Où et comment l’eau culbute
Les oreilles de charrue
Et l’eau morte et les cirés
Les corps morts et les écumes
Veille à gauche et veille à droite
À la pince et au ballant
Sans vouloir te commander
Tiens-toi bien pis laisse aller
Pas grande eau mais c’est assez
Pour te dire qu’à l’eau douce
On finit par dessaler
Et ça, c’était pour l’été

Ils diront que c’était une femme
Je dirai que c’était la Manikoutai
Le dos souple et la danse dans l’âme
Telle était la Manikoutai

Fatiguée de la semaine
En rapides et gros bouillons
Elle faisait son dimanche
En amont du quatrième
Vive encore et paresseuse
Avec du sable en dorure
Et les beaux cailloux tout ronds
À deux pas c’est une source
À trois pas c’est un brûlé
Le foin haut pis les framboises
Les bleuets pis les béris
Et le petit bois d’argent
Prends ton temps, prends pas ta course
C’est piquant pis déchirant
Pas si vite, assis-toi là
On va compter les cailloux

Ça, c’était pour le beau temps

Ils croyaient que c’était une fée
Moi, je dis que c’était la Manikoutai
De feu, d’or et d’automne attifée
Telle était la Manikoutai

Aux premiers jours de gelée
Elle a déjà le gros dos
Les manchons pis les manteaux
Et tout en blanc et beau et chaud
Elle a la race et la grâce
Elle est de chasse et de glace
Les renards et les visons
Les rats musqués, les castors
Le loup-cervier puis la loutre
Lui font dentelle de trace
Et quand la glace est trop mince
Pour la tenir enfermée
Elle saute la fenêtre
Elle est noire et douce-froide
Et c’est le froid qui la dompte
À la tombée de la nuit

Et c’est le temps de l’hiver

Ils croiront que c’était une amante
Moi, je dis que c’était la Manikoutai
Jeune et vieille et muette et parlante
Telle était la Manikoutai

C’était le temps du trappeur
Et le temps des compagnies
On partait le vingt d’octobre
On revenait vingt janvier
Quand un homme est à la chasse
Sa blonde a des cavaliers
Sont partis le même jour
Mais chacun de son côté
On a trouvé par les traces
Qu’une fois rendus aux pièges
Avaient chassé tous les deux
Jusqu’à ce trou dans la neige
Attention! la glace est mince
Tu la salueras pour moi
Non, viens pas, tiens-toi, j’arrive
Les chiens sont r’venus tout seuls

Ça, c’était pour le printemps

Ils ont dit que c’était la Julie
Moi, je dis que c’était la Manikoutai
Ils diront qu’avec l’âge on oublie
Telle était la Manikoutai",La  Manikoutai,2011

Claire Voyant,"Holding open time to rest awhile
I am playing in the darkness of warm July
Tryst between the scenes not happy,
As it seems you play with forgiveness
For wicked schemes

I know years ago
I know nowâ?¦
You seem like some devil
You play like some god

Clean before the stream to innocence you cling
The beauty in the crime is you don't feel; a thing

Scars we wore years ago hurt now
You seemed like some devil
And you prayed like you were god

These roses form a ring around your cell
In these ashes
We all fall down
Hold on to the divine we'll all fall down.

Stars I wished on years ago burnt out
You seemed like some devil
You played like some god

These roses form a ring around our selves in the ashes we all fall down
Hold on to the divine we'll all fall down.




",Mercy [Cut. Rate. Box],2001
Claire Voyant,"Lock of time hidden in my breath
Of things real and things I've dreamt
Holding hearts in balance it is like
Maybe we were once intertwined
Raising souls up to the moon as we

Rise again,
Maybe then we will meet
Only tides are racing through your mind
Make a wish and then goodbye
Charlatans in the ruse tonight
Where heat and light touch the sky
And the sun is rising slow there's more to write
Lock of time written in my heart
Why were we once torn apart
Only tides are racing through your mind and each
Time we meet it's bittersweet

Clambake 7,"Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

And beside a garden wall
When stars were bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale told his fairy tale
A paradise where roses bloom

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

Clambake Seven,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean 
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine

And my guns givin' Grammys

Gave me the juice, passed off diamonds
Hot in the winter, and cold when it's shinin'

I would never buy it if it wasn't mine
I don't need a gun, I just need the bullets

I closed my eyes
How could you be so cruel
Sweet vision of mine

And I keep dreaming of

Time burns away
Let the living creature lie
Midnight visions awfully die

On the green stubble-fields of autumn
I saw you, my sweetheart.
Nice were your feet in shoes
And wonderful your nimble gait.
Your hair the color of roses
And your ringlets tightly plaited
Alas that we're not married
Or on board ship sailing away

The boys around here are
Laughing and getting bold
And the people of the high straw?
Are making ? ? of my brown girl
If the king of spain would
Go abroad with his assembled men
I would flatten grass and rank grass
And I would be with my brown girl

Buying cows at the fair
If I were ? and my brown girl
Go and come first love
Until we go over to gaoth-bearra
Until we separate from each other
The tops of the branches and the swan
From the waves ?
That won't separate us
And it's only folly for you to put it ? ?

I wrote a letter
To my sweetheart and a sharp complaint
She sent it back to me
That her heart was inside me.
Compose the artsswannoble person ?
Finer than silk or bird feathers
Heavy is my sigh
When I think of being apart from her.

What I heard on Sunday
As conversation among the women
That she was going to be married
To a young man from the place.
Sweetheart take my advice
And this autumn stay as you are
And don't tell anyone, my love,
That you are my love.

Never looking back on years

I catch a vision of this place
Did we understand

Oh long dreaming, find my tears
I could love you, all the years
There are times like today
The wind will blow in a gentle way

With words and touch we promised much

Clannad,"He comes out of silence and opens the door
Waiting for someone to die
Deep in her heart she is hoping for
The long-lost one
How could she know when the promise was made?
So how can it end in this way?

Then four gray walls come tumbling down
And just because her skin was brown
No wonder she has grown so fast
Those four gray walls were meant to last

The friends there that she can count upon
Take orders, but always the spirit holds
Scenes of the never-ending trend
She waits for the hours and hours to pass
She looks to the hourglass

Then four gray walls come tumbling down
And just because her skin was brown
No wonder she has grown so fast
Those four gray walls were meant to last
Those four gray walls were meant to last

As the shadows come down
She sees him leaving
She can recall
Seems that this fire has lost its form
The form of the hourglass

The four gray walls came tumbling down
And just because her skin was brown
No wonder she has grown so fast
Those four gray walls were meant to last
Those four gray walls were meant to last

Those four gray walls
Four gray walls

Unless it disappears

English Translation From Jason Carns
Down by the beach, in the deep of night
The big world is sleeping and I am alone
The sea-birds are calling sorrowfully
Like poor souls in pain
Total purity and total abundance (?)
Bliss and calmness and beauty in the world
The murmur of the sea going into my ears
The soft song of the water flowing in the river.
Above on the headland* there is a blessed old cemetery
The place in which saints lived in times long ago
There are people within spending a while carefree
The will not walk round on the shore any more.
Loneliness strikes my spirits as I look at the cemetery
And I'm thinking about the people in there sleeping
Men and young women, old people and children
People of my people and friends of my heart.
The cocks are crowing and the stars are fading
The moon is setting and it's not long until day
Goodbye now blessed old cemetery
And to the people who walked with me down by the beach.
(Above...)* A rough translation. Couldn't find the word ""inseáin"", but think
It means something like this.

When the length of days are dawning

It feels right, in the light of understanding
There's always something bound to be a warning

When it's infinite it never meets

Explaining that the sky holds the wind
The sun rushes in
A child with a shotgun can shoot down honeybees that sting
Oh this boy could use a little sting
All right

Who will get me to a party
Who do I have yet to meet
You, you look a bit like coffee
And you taste a little like me
How can I keep from moving
Now I need a change of scenery
Just listen to me
I won't pretend to understand the movement of the wind
Or the waves in the ocean
Or how like the hours I change softly slowly
Plainly blindly oh me oh my",The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth,2005
Clap Your Hands Say Yeah,"Some songs see us sailing away
Navigating foreign borders, and climbing the waves
Someday your secret will be revealed
Am I the one you're thinking of when the sun goes down into the water?

We're struck by the still of the moon
Hanging up there in the sky as though a balloon
Anchored by an astronaut's patriot tune
We will buy the ship and fly to the land that would be rediscovered

We'll design a clever disguise
We'll retreat to the bottom of the sea
We were destined to live out our lives underwater, you and me

We'll escape beneath the violet sky
Clouds come and night falls
You seem different on my mind
Upon an endless trail of moonlight
You'll never realize that we have gone, we have gone right out of, out of sight

Hysterical
Calls for luck
Heal the weak
We should just grow up

And so I hid behind the dishes in the night

Clara Luciani,"J'observe ces hommes en costume
Noyés dans cette masse informe
Cette femme au visage dur qui passe en force
Elle pense fort à sa carrière, fonce
Malgré le harcèlement des hommes
Mais la seule chose qui la pousse
Quelque part, c'est le manque
Elle a besoin de plus qu'un anti-dépresseur assez puissant
Mais si elle laissait libre court à ses pulsions
En vrai ce qu'elle ferait, c'est qu'elle peindrait
Sur une fresque élevée, ses séquelles, elle sait ce qu'elle veut
C'est quelque-chose de presque élémentaire
Après, est-ce qu'elle est mentalement prête?
J'aimerais presque qu'elle m'enterre avant que le temps la prenne
Avant qu'elle devienne un vrai squelette
Et qu'on la perde au sens large, un vrai squelette
Que l'on exhibe en sciences nat' pendant l'aprem
Un sourire éternel qui traîne en elle
Comme si cette vie n'était qu'une triste blague
Alors il l'exhibe pour que l'on apprenne de force
Que le règne de l'homme se trouve dans la science
Et que la magie n'existe pas, mais on résistera

Dans ta tête ça tourne pas rond
Tes pensées sont des ellipses
Le système te permet de voler
Mais c'est pas des ailes, c'est des hélices
Contrôle-toi ou fais-toi contrôler
On peut être libre ou prisonnier de ses vices
Et si les enfants décident de prendre le relai
Les suivants subiront des années de sévices

Soudain la gare se vide et les regards s'évitent
Et c'est la guerre civile, elle est si vile, l'amour se perd si vite
La terre mère étouffe sous la saleté de ses fils
Face à ces idées qu'on subit, je sais, la cécité te séduit
Nombrils égo-centrés, très peu s'entraident
Triste ironie d'une société de services
Les gens dans le besoin passent après les apparences qu'on va bientôt devoir sauver
Que dire à ton voisin qu'a perdu ses grands-parents dans le ghetto de Varsovie
Alors t'as gueulé sans trêve et tu t'es plié en 4 sans trèfle
Tes neurones ont grillé, ton coeur est cendré
T'as jamais su plier quand t'as besoin d'rêve
Peu de sang frais, dur de te concentrer
Toute ton enfance dans des zones excentrées
Tu es jeune et ambitieux donc tu te sens prêt
Déjà tit-pe tu n'écoutais que le 113
T'as dit à ta mère: ""Je reviens, le temps presse""
Y'a que pour te faire monter que je descendrais
Un jour j'achèterai l'immeuble entier
Juste pour être sûr qu'on te laisse entrer

Aventurier de l'inconnu, avant tu riais de l'inconnu

Mais, avant tu riais de l'inconnu, avant tu riais de l'inconnu
Avant tu riais du temps qui passe, et puis le temps est passé 

Tu sens bien que t'es unique
Tu veux pas qu'on te double
L'homme est lâche comme un noeud
Et tu planes comme le doute
Les liens se font et se défont
Les humains s'offensent et se défoncent

Même du sommet des arbres, tout ça te dépasse
Tes sommes de pensées qu'le sommeil efface
Nous sommes des zombies, nous sommes des masques
Que des Hommes de face désormais néfastes
Des zones désolées, des hommes et des femmes
Tu te sens d'aucun des clans
Des sourires en coin, des clins d'oeils
Avant le deuil d'un amour en déclin
Fuir la nature immatérielle, c'est pas sûr qu'on puisse
Face à la lumière intérieure, c'est nos yeux qu'on plisse
Ils disent que l'amour rend aveugle mais il t'a redonné la vue
Il t'as fait muer quand ta rage était sourde, il a fait fredonner la rue
Il t'a fait retirer le collier de chien qui te servait d'écharpe
L'éducation t'a fait désapprendre des choses essentielles que tu savais déjà
Surtout n'oublie pas qu'avant tu riais mais l'amour te libère, l'as-tu oublié?
T'as rien dans l'univers et avant tu rayonnais
Libère ta lumière, ils voudront te raisonner, libère ta lumière

Mes épaules sont larges et mon corps est robuste, jeune encore 
Mes yeux s'attardent sur mes hanches
Sur mon ventre tendu puis fixent ma poitrine presque plate 
Sur mon sein gauche une cicatrice 
Parce qu'elle est encore violacée
Parce qu'on discerne les tissus 
Tout juste reconstitués de la chaire tiraillée 
Parce que sous le doigt son relief se détache encore gonflé
On devine que la blessure est récente 
Elle palpite comme un nerf 
Pourtant quand le doigt passe sur la plaie
Elle n’est déjà plus douloureuse 
On ne meurt pas d’amour 
Alors même que l’on se croit exsangue et sec comme un vieux fruit 
Alors même que l'on croit que toutes les forces nous ont quittées
On se remet de tout 
Le cœur se régénère comme la queue des lézards 
On est allongé sur le dos prêt à se laisser partir 
Quand soudain un soubresaut électrise les corps 
Le sang reprend son travail, revient battre contre les tempes
Irriguer les organes et le bas-ventre endormi 
On sursaute de se sentir vivant, vivant malgré tout 
On est surpris de reprendre des couleurs 
L'envie de vivre est irrésistible 
Se remettre de ce chagrin
Se remettre de cette douleur c'est pouvoir tout affronter

Valia mais que hoje em dia uma nota de milhão

Do lado gelado que o povo até se intimidou

Clara Nunes,"Quem já passou por essa vida e não viveu,
Pode ser mais mas sabe menos do que eu.
Porque a vida só se dá pra quem se deu, 
Pra quem amou, pra quem chorou, pra quem sofreu. 

Quem nunca curtiu uma paixão 
Nunca vai ter nada, não. 

Não há mal pior do que a descrença,
Mesmo o amor que não compensa 
É melhor que a solidão. 

Abre os teus braços, meu irmão, deixa cair.
Pra que somar se a gente pode dividir. 
Eu francamente já não quero nem saber 
De quem não vai porque tem medo de sofrer.

Ai de quem não rasga o coração,
Esse não vai ter perdão. 
Quem nunca curtiu uma paixão, 
Nunca vai ter nada, não.
",Como Dizia o Poeta,2008
Clara Nunes,"Tantas você fez que ela cansou 
Porque você, rapaz, 
Abusou da regra três 
Onde menos vale mais. 

Da primeira vez ela chorou 
Mas resolveu ficar.
É que os momentos felizes 
Tinham deixado raízes no seu penar. 
Depois perdeu a esperança 
Porque o perdão também cansa de perdoar.

Tem sempre o dia em que a casa cai,
Pois vai curtir seu deserto, vai. 
Mas deixe a lâmpada acesa 
Se algum dia a tristeza quiser entrar. 
E uma bebida por perto porque
Você pode estar certo que vai chorar.

Pega esse avião.

Pela duração (Pela omissão) 
Dessa temporada (Um tanto forçada)

Diz que vou levando.

If you were a window and I was the rain
I’d pour myself out and wash off the pain
I’d fall like a tear so your light could shine through

Arms in your bed under your skin

You end and where I begin

Street

The cobblestone midnight is where
We first meet

Til the lights flickered out, we
Dance with the moon

Then I’d just fade into you

In your heart in your head in your
Arms in your bed under your skin

Til there’s no way to know where
You end and where I begin

I wanna melt in I wanna soak through
I only wanna move when you move

I wanna breathe out when you
Breathe in then I wanna fade into you

The ground

And under your willow they laid me
Down

There’ll be no trace that one was
Once two

But I could never climb alone
I could start another day

And through all his wondrous childhood, He would honour and obey, Love and watch the lowly maiden, In whose gentle arms he lay: Christian children all must be, Mild, obedient, good as He. ---- 4.

I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1982
Clare Fischer,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru,1986
Clare Fischer,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1986
Clare Fischer,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1989
Clare Fischer,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

But I miss you most of all my darling

I could live without love
Now I must admit,

Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

That brings a day so gently
And bathes the leaves
Of memories
That fell so long ago

I still recall you
In all these early hours
Though I were there
Once more to share
A love lost long ago

Crassness of youth
Concluding only half of the truth
Exuding only one small percent
Of what I surely felt for you

And then one morning
That brought a day so gently
We set apart
Things of the heart
And lost love long ago",Morning,1966

The night that you told me those little white lies.
The stars seemed to know that you didn't mean those sighs,

I try, but there's no forgetting, when evening appears, 
I sigh, but there's no regretting, in spite of my tears.

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Clare Torry,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man,1981

Just a little way's with me.
An' as we walked,
Then we would talk
All about our wedding day.

In our home we'll happy be,
Down beside where the waters flow,
On the banks of the Ohio.""

I led her down the banks of sand,
I plunged her in
Where she would drown,
An' watched her as she floated down.

Thinkin', Lord, what a deed I've done;
I'd killed the girl
I love, you see,
Because she would not marry me.

He says, ""Young man,
Don't try to run.
You'll pay for this awful crime you've don.""

I would be the man.

My time is swiftly rolling on
When I must faint and die;
My body to the dust return
And there fergotten lie.
Let persecution rage around
And Antichrist appear;
My silent dust beneath the ground;
There's no disturbance there.

To call poor sinners to repent
And seek their Savior dear.
My brother preachers, boldly speak
And stand on Zion's wall.
Confirm the drunk, confirm the weak
And after sinners call.

My loving wife, my bosom friend,
The object of my love,
The time's been sweet l've spent with you,
My sweet and harmless dove,
My little children near my heart
My warm affections know.
From each the path will I attend.
O from them can I go?!

O God, a father to them be
And keep them from all harm,
That they may love and worship Thee
And dwell upon Thy charm.
How often you have looked fer me
And often seen me come.
But now I must depart from thee
And nevermore return.

My loving wife, don't grieve fer me,
Neither lament nor mourn;
Fer I will with my Jesus be
And dwell upon his charm.

And there forgotten lie.
Let persecutions rage around,
Let Antichrist appear;
Beneath the cold and silent ground
There's no disturbance there.

Through heats and cold I've toiled and went
And wandered in despair;
To call poor sinners to repent
And seek the Savior dear.

My brother preachers, boldly speak
And stand on Zion's wall.
Confirm the strong, revive the weak,
And after sinners call.

My little children, near my heart,
And nature seems to bind,
It grieves me sorely to depart
And leave you here behind.

Oh Lord, a father to them be
And keep them from all harm
That they may love and worship Thee
And dwell upon Thy charm.

My loving wife, my bosom friend,
The object of my love,
The time's been sweet I spent with thee,
My sweet, my harmless dove.

Though I must now depart from thee
Let this not grieve your heart,
For you will shortly come to me
Where we shall never part.



",Hicks' Farewell,1994
Clarence Ashley,"Just a mile west of the water tank
On a cold November day
In a cold and lonesome box car
A dyin hobo lay

His pal sat there before him
With a low and drooping head
Listening to the last words
His dying buddy said

Goodbye old pardner hobo
I hate to say goodbye
But I hear my train a comin
& I know shes getting nigh

Gonna tell that old conductor
Just when I'm gonna stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock

We rode the rocks together
We rambled all around
In every kind of weather
We slept out on the ground

Oh pardner don't you miss that train
That always makes a stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock

Would you tell my girl from Danville
That she need not worry a tall
I'm a goin to that country
Where I won't have to work at all

No I wll not have to work there
Or never change my socks
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rocks

I'm a goin to that better place
Where everything is right
Where handouts grow on bushes
And they sleep out every night

I won't have to wash my overhauls
Or never change my socks
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rocks",Rambling Hobo [#],1994
Clarence Ashley,"There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of a many poor boy
And me, oh God, for one

Then fill the glasses to the brim
Let the drinks go merrily around
And we'll drink to the health of a rounder poor boy
Who goes from town to town

The only thing that a rounder needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Now boys, don't believe what a girl tells you
Though her eyes be blue or brown
Unless she's on some scaffold high
Saying, ""Boys, I can't come down""

Go tell my youngest brother
Not to do the things I've done
But to shun that house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

I'm going back, back to New Orleans
For my race is nearly run
Gonna spend the rest of my wicked life
Beneath that Rising Sun

I met little Sadie and I shot her down
Went back home and I got in my bed
Forty four pistol under my head

Gents and the gamblers standing all round
Taking little Sadie to her burying ground

Then I begin to think what a deed I'd done
I grabbed my hat and away I run
Made a good run but a little too slow
They overtook me in Jericho

I was standing on the corner, reading the bill
When up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville
He said, young man, ain't your name Brown?
Remember the night you shot Sadie down?

I said, yes, sir, my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree
And first degree and the second degree
If you got any papers, won't you read 'em to me?

They took me downtown and dressed me in black
Put me on the train and started me back
They crammed me back in that Thomasville jail
And I had no money for to go my bail

Willie & laura mae jones
Were our neighbours a long time back
They lived right down the road from us
In a shack just like our shack
we worked in the fields together
And we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land
You dont have the time to think about another mans colour

The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time
The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine, yes it was
But that was another place and another time

Sit out on the front porch
In the evening when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing
And everybody would mess around
Daddyd bring out his guitar
And play on through the night
Every now and then ol willie would grin and say
Hey, you play all right
Made me feel so good

i remember willie would hitch the mules up
when sandy rolled around
We all would stop by willies house and say
Do yall need anything from town? 
Hed say no, but why dont yall stop on the way back home? 
And Ill get laura mae, yeah, to cook up some corn bone
And you know thats good

The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine, yes it was
But that was another place and another time
The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine, yes it was
But that was another place and another time

Oh, the years rolled past the land
And took back what theyd given
We all knew we had to move
If i was  gonna make a living

So we all moved off
And went about our separate ways
It sure was hard to say goodbye
To willie and laura mae (jones y'all), 

The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine, yes it was
But that was another place and another time
The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine, yes it was
But that was another place and another time

the years roll passed our door and we heard from them no more
til i saw willie down town the other day
i said y'all stop by tonight, we can sit down and eat a bite
we'd love to see your children and laura mae
he shook real stoic

Clarence Carter,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to make another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing,
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

I can still hear Papa, what he said
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you",Patches,1984

The lady's stacked and that's a fact,

She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sure enough to knock a man to his knees

I couldn't wait to make Patches my bride
Now I don't see how that ever can happen
My folks say No, and my heart breaks inside

And pretty Patches there watching the door
She dosn't know that I can't come to see her

Floating face down in that dirty old river

And time is just too important to be messin around
So understand not what I'm trying to say
But appreciate living life day to day

So how does it feel to be the only ones
Left out in the rain 'cause you're phony ones
Wake up and realize what you live is a dream
Ain't gonna be there for long even though it may seem
Like a never ending story
You in it for the money or the glory
Open up your ears or ignore me
All I'm tryin' to do is be the man I am and be the best in this world I can

If you feel it throw your hands up in the air
Time is running out, memories die
Keep movin' on
Gotta keep movin' on

You got to open your mind up and kick both your feet up
I'll hit you with a tale of how the five of us were meet up
We're just five guys who want to rise to the skies
No, we got a vision in our eyes
Now people want to step up and try to hold us back
They want to try to stop us getting freaky on this track
But this is how we kick it and this is how we swing
And this is how I hit you with the funk that I bring
Now you gotta select to connect not disrespect
And you gotta learn to keep your negativity in check
'cause everybody knows what goes around comes around
I'll put it down with my sound

Clarence Fountain,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

I turn a back over flip and I'll forget these feet of mine 
I got to keep on walkin' 
I got to walk on oh ho ho 
I, I, I, I, I'm so tired but I just can't lose my stride 
Walk on let me tell you ya'll I, I, I, I, I, I'm so tired 
But I just can't lose my stride 
Come on feet don't fail me now 
I got ten more miles to go 
I got nine, eight, seven, six, eight, six 
I got a five more miles to go 
Now over the hill just around the bend 
Huh although my feet are tired I can't lose my stride 
I got to get to my baby again

Clarence Treat,"Today while the blossoms still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries, I'll drink your sweet wine

A million tomorrows shall all pass away
Ere I forget all the joy that is mine today

I'll be a dandy and I'll be a rover
You'll know who I am by the song that I sing
I'll feast at your table, I'll sleep in your clover

Who cares what the morrow shall bring?

Today while the blossoms still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries, I'll drink your sweet wine

I can't be contented with yesterday's glory
I can't live on promises winter to spring (winter to spring)

Today is my moment and now is my story

I'll laugh and I'll cry and I'll sing

I'll taste your strawberries, I'll drink your sweet wine

Take a sad song and make it better

The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling,1980
Clarence White,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.

Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, honey, for my size

Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow

Up on the mountain just to see my honey
And I ain't coming back, lord, I ain't coming back

Clarence White,"Hallways and staircases everyday to climb 
To go up to my white walled room out on the end of time
Where I can be with my love for she is all that is mine 
And she'll always be there, my love don't care about time 

I laugh with her, cry with her, hold her close she is mine
The way she tells me of her love and never is she trying 
She don't have to be assured of many good things to find 
And she'll always be there, my love don't care about time

Her eyes are dark and deep with love, her hair hangs long and fine 
She walks with ease and all she sees is never wrong or right 
And with her arms around me tight I see her all in my mind

Organ grinder, play that melody

Clarence Williams,"A trifling man came home one night
And tiptoed to his door
To his despair, his little wifie was there
Waitin' to lay down the law

Said she, ""I'm through, I'm really sick of you
Get out, stay out, and be on your way""
Well he dropped down on his knees
Cried ""oh, please"",
But this is all she had to say:

Get up, get up, off your knees papa
You can't win me back that way
Turn in, turn in all your keys papa
You really goin' this time to stay

I discovered that you're the worst man in this town
Looks like you're fond of keepin' on going lower down
Get up, get up, off your knees papa
You can't win me back that way

Get right up off your knees papa
I'm tellin' you, you can't win me back that way
Turn in all your keys papa
'Cause I put you out this time to stay

You're so blamed crooked, here are blades
Looks like it's a hard matter for you to keep your head up straight
So get up off your knees papa
You can't win me back that way

Anyhow. Stand up when you're makin' your pleas
No use you wearin' out your knees
I heard someone say right next door
Look mighty strange down there on all fours

Stop it, down like that
What in the devil anyhow can you be drivin' at?
So get up and stay up off your knees papa
You can't win me back that way

Besides it looks suspicious 
And you can't win me back that way.",Get up off Your Knees,

My love gonna get you told
Pay attention to my warnin'
'Cause you've been actin', quite too bold
Everything you give me must suit me to a tee

I want every bit of it or none at all
'Cause I don't like it second hand
I want all your kisses or none at all
Give me lots of candy, honey, love is grand

Mama like lovin' both night and day
I don't like no two-time, that's why I say
I want every bit of it or none at all
'Cause I don't like it second hand
No I don't like it second hand

I want every bit of it or none at all
'Cause I don't like it second hand
I want all your kisses or none at all
Just put up plenty, honey, that's my command

When you start to makin' love, no-one knows
I want every bit of it or none at all
'Cause I don't like it second hand, no
I can't use it second hand
