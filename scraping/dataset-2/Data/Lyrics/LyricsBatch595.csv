Lil Chuckee,"Nothing make a man feel better than his lady
Cause girl I got you

I know I'm always gone and I'm hardly never home
Don't worry bout nothing (baby girl I got you)
When I touch back down I'm a buy you everything
You ain't gotta work for nothing (cause girl I got you)
Don't worry what your friends say
Cause they be hatin' anyway
They mad when I tell ya (baby girl I got you) ha
It's just me and you against the world
Baby girl I know you got my back (cause girl I got you)

As I was walking by
I seen you standing there with a smile
Lookin' shy caught my eye
Thought you wanna hang a while
I-15 on the beat and I ain't cruisin' highways
So baby let's get away
Save the troubles for another day ha
Jammin' Escapade in the lot
Wit' Escalade on the back
Ya homies wack I promise that
It ain't trickin' if you got it
Might as well spend a stack
I hit the mall and ball down
Call me young Steven Jackson
And I'm the one
And I won with no games played
Never have to work in our life day we got it made
Every day's a vacae M-I-ami like Dade
And we ain't ever clean up baby
Cause I got maids ha
Young money we so paid
And if you ever get hurt baby I'm ya band-aid ha
While I'm lookin' at you
Never worry bout nothing cause girl I got you

I know I'm always gone and I'm hardly never home
Don't worry bout nothing (baby girl I got you)
When I touch back down I'm a buy you everything
You ain't gotta work for nothing (cause girl I got you)
Don't worry what your friends say
Cause they be hatin' anyway
They mad when I tell ya (baby girl I got you) ha
It's just me and you against the world
Baby girl I know you got my back (cause girl I got you)

Shawty I'm here any time that you need me
Fa sheezy I'm here to make ya life, easy
They say to every good dude there's a good lady
And I have mine already
Ain't no need to keep lookin' ha
And when I'm on the road you go to my house
And walk my bulldog and help my moms out
And play with my sister you know I love that
That's why whatever you want I'm a cop that
I'm your Rashad, you my Nu-Nu
I'm ya Will Smith, baby you my Jada Poo
And when I'm in the studio you come chill wit' me
Play around with my hair
You keep me motivated
If we had a team
I'd be Reggie Bush you'd be Kim Kardashian
Your body so amazing
And when I'm not witcha
I'm on my iPod Bumpin' ""Forever My Lady"" I love ya

I know I'm always gone and I'm hardly never home
Don't worry bout nothing (baby girl I got you)
When I touch back down I'm a buy you everything
You ain't gotta work for nothing (cause girl I got you)
Don't worry what your friends say
Cause they be hatin' anyway
They mad when I tell ya (baby girl I got you) ha
It's just me and you against the world
Baby girl I know you got my back (cause girl I got you)

I know I'm always gone and I'm hardly never home

Lil Chuckee,"Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Than do it for the troops
It's young money salute
It's young money salute

Yeah, uh
So sick with the flow
Yeah your cowboys know that Lil Twist
Been a pro way before Romo or T.O
No wetting cowboys to a piston
A.I no Wallace your kids getting demolished
I'm booking on your suckers like I'm just leaving college
But smart, very smart, too smart for ya knowledge
Too smart once more, Wayne called me a genius
It's Y.M.E. nothing gets in between us

Tell Wayne I'm going in like somebody bout to bury me
In this rap game nobody could ever bury me
That's why you see me on stage rocking with young money
I told my team I got us man it's all on me
Like volume 2 BG I got my crew with me
Twist, Mack, Millz, Gudda and my baby Nicki
Everytime I'm on the track it's ransom
Can't find us anymore it's random
When Young Money come through you better salute us

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Than do it for the troops
It's young money salute
It's young money salute

Hey I solemnly swear if it ever go down
You ain't never gotta call me cause I'mma be there
Lets get to the point like elbows, my crew harder than shelltoes
Strapped like Velcro and this we running hell no
And truthfully, aiming for number one oh do we
You ask why I reply cause nobody remember 2 or 3
Cross Y.M. and the hem will make a movie
We all we can be, respect the army and salute we

Yeah, Young money army we marching
We coming forward no warning
We got these boys running like Forest
So salute me like a general
First place never last
Always on top and I'm a chief like a Seminole
Got the game in strangle hold no letting up
You can get the top, ya can pop like 7 Up
Knock knock let us up, young money applaud me
And we'll take the game out your hands like a joy stick

I'mma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn't given
Everything that I've given, I swear I'll never give in

Just look at what I've been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-d-d-do it cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowing kisses to the soldiers I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camouflage me,
'Cause young money is the Navy better yet the Army

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Than do it for the troops
It's young money salute
It's young money salute

Commander in chief
One hand on the World, one hand on the brief
I stand on the World, bitch I stand on the peak
Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now that's G
Don't ask me about shit but money
Fuckin' right my money long I got that 10ft money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sounds like 10 foots running
I meant feet, I'm in deep like wet pussy
I'm a purple heart proven war vet rookie
You can't even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don't step to me
Now don't step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the court building
Like ain't we God's children
I know at all times God's feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me
Salute or shoot!

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Than do it for the troops
It's young money salute
It's young money salute",YM Salute,2010
Lil Colonel,"Welcome ladies and gentlemen
This is Mark, oh-Who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah yeah yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game

And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god living like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fucking with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league
Cause we's be in the big league

And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well you should see me now, I'm eating Wheaties now
I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)

And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah I heard that)
(It's a great day though) 
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows,
Murphey Lee or something)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with
You know how we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)

Lil Coner,"The trigga gots no heart (the trigga a trigga)
The trigga gots no heart (the trigga a trigga)

I'm sick up in this game
I'll take no secondary shorts and
Slam dunk these riddles up in yo' chest like Jordan
Menace II Society mad man killer
Just call me the East Bay Gangsta
Neighborhood drug dealer
Quick to make decisions and I'm
Quick to get my blast on
Do a 187 with this bloody Jason mask on
Rollin' up out the cut deeper than Atlantis
Tore his chest apart left his heart on the canvas
Now I gots mo' mayo than the rest of the pushers
Rat a tat tat tat came my Tec from the bushes
I blast with no heart 'cause I'm heartless in nine-trey
A-K blast on that ass if in my way, gangsta
Slangin' 'Cola since the very very start
Much love for this game so the trigga gots no heart

Ain't no love trick
The trigga gots no heart
Ain't no love trick
The trigga gots no heart
(gunshot)

Release the trigga as I blast on a nigga
Nina put a cease on his Timex ticker
And uh playas he can't give me no love
'cause I'm stuck on the corna in the ghetto
Slangin' dub sacks
And I duck when they fly by
'cause Killa Cali' is the state for the drive-by
Caps peel from the gangstas in my hood
Ya better use that Nina
'cause that deuce-deuce ain't no good
And um I'm taking up a hobby
Maniac murderin' doin' massacre robbery
I'm twenty-two and I'm still slangin' dub sacks
I gives the fiend some love but ain't no love back
Much love in this game ain't no love gangsta
187 is a art 'cause the trigga gots no heart

Ain't no love trick
The trigga gots no heart
Ain't no love trick

Me shootin' him up me shootin' him up
If he no give my pay
Ain't no love trick

Me shootin' him up me shootin' him up
If he no give my pay
Ain't no love trick

The trigga gots no heart
And I'll be damned if I'm broke old
Pushin' on a shoppin' cart
They blast on a friend of me
Another sad case of a mistaken identity
12 O' clock and my 'hood's dubbin' pay back
I sat and watched them shoot my homey
Seen his face crack
Uzis spray like Raid on these cockroaches
A dropped bomb full of 187 soldiers
Doin' dirt 'cause we dirty when the trigga pull
Seventeen in his body left the boy full
Of hollow tips so I know he won't be comin' back
I let my hair platt and let my mail stack
But my sweet sweet Sunday had to turn tart
His posse came and they triggas had no heart

Kill 'em all man kill 'em all with me Glock Glock
Kill all man say kill all man say
Kill 'em all man kill 'em all with me Glock Glock

Lil Cuete,"[Chorus 2x]
I know you feel the same way to
And I know you feel the same as I do
So let's put all this bullshit aside
Spread them legs and let me inside

[Verse 1]
I'm cruising in a regal
With a desert eagle
I see this hyna jockin
Players know I'm stoppin'
I have to turn around
But first I look around, I
Have to watch my back
I don't know where this bitches boyfriends at
I pull up to her side and I tell her jump in
My rolas bumpin'
Notice something's on my mind
You're looking fine and you know it
You know your ass and titties look good
Because you show 'em, I want to hold 'em
Kiss 'em and come and you can suck it
I love it when a bitch trips in front of me
Girl don't be frontin' me
Let me see how bad you are
Let me see how far you can take it down your throat
Try not to choke
You don't need to swallow
But suck me ?till I'm hallow
And then call me up tomorrow
Oh, I'm sorry! Did I take it too far?
If you don't want to fuck, get the fuck up out my car

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I love the girls that flirt
Look at the little mini-skirt
That she's wearin'
I know she's lovin' it when I'm starin'
I got my eyes on her, her eyes on me
I guarantee later on we'll be fucking in between the sheets
I know you feel the same way to
Your boyfriend don't have to know what we do
As long as no finds out and goes out
And runs their mouth about me and you
We can do what we do
Whenever you want to
Call me on the phone
I'll show up alone
Ready to bone
Making you moan
I'll take off your clothes
And we're both getting ours
When we're bumpin my flows
Nobody knows like a big secret
And that's the way I want to keep it
Just between me and you, you and me
Will know what we do
So stop acting like you don't want to
I know you want to

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You know I'm not the type of guy
To sit around and watch you lie
Know that I'm the type of guy
I'll fuck you I ain't gon stick and die
I'll never waste no time
On a bitch that can't make up her mind
It's now or never so make your choice
I know you like my voice when you hear my tongue flip
Picture me doing it on your clit
Or picture me rubbing it with my dick
Any way you like I'll give it to you quick
Let me see your tits
Put your nipple to my lips
I'll kiss your whole body
When we're acting naughty
I love to see your body
On top of my body
Smoking on some yeska while we're drinking Bacardi
When your man gets you mad, call me up and we'll party
I know you feel the same way to
And I know you feel the same as I do
So let's put all this bullshit aside
Spread them legs and let me inside

[Chorus]

Ha-ha once again little Peter Cuete
Let's put all the bullshit aside mija
You got what I want
And I got what you want
So remember that
Put the bullshit aside
Let's get down to business
And I'm gone (echoes)",I Know,2002

Lil Cuete,"(Chorus)
I overcame rainy days in my life, 
Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,
Ima be alright, ima be okay

Verse 1
You tell me you love me and you can?t get enough 
But then you call me and you tell me that were breaking up
Look what you do to me
Seems like you?re out to ruin me
And every time you lie, you make a fool of me
Change your ways girl, you?ll probably lose me
It?s not a game girl, cause you'll be losing 
A good thing and you don?t have to explain 
But you have to take responsibility for the pain, you gave me
I thought you?ll always be my lady
You told me to hold on, and like a fool I keep on waiting
It?s alright though, I'll find someone new
And if that?s the way you want it, then the choice is on you
But just remember that I didn?t need you around
I kept you cause I love you not for you to put me down, I bet you see now
How a man can grow strong and if loving you was wrong 
Then I got to move on.

(Chorus)
I overcame rainy days in my life, 
Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,
Ima be alright, ima be okay

Verse 2
I guess it wasn?t really meant to be 
But I?m glad it happened now cause it would happen eventually
It?s sad to see it didn?t end how I wanted
It?s sad to see I wasn?t the one you wanted
I guess I got to start over and try
Start with someone new, like a girl that won?t lie and break my heart like you did
It?s a shame, nobody ever made me feel the way that you did
I?m caught up in the middle of a feeling that I don't want to get rid off
But you take yourself away from me
And I can?t understand cause you?re still unhappy
Even though I tried my best to make you happy
You say I don?t deserve you, you don?t deserve me
You?re the type of girl that would do something just to hurt me
And yeah I guess it?s true I don?t know much about you
But I do know one thing that I?ll do better without you

(Chorus)
I overcame rainy days in my life, 
Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,
Ima be alright, ima be okay

Verse 3
You see I learned my lesson and the outcome was true
Even though you love someone, doesn?t mean they love you
So before you give yourself to someone else 
Make sure they love you and nobody else
And this I tell you so you don?t get hurt
A lot of men do know what a women is worth 
He would give up all his covers and sleep out in the rain
He would help her through her problems and take away your pain
I know
Cause that?s the type of man I am, 
I?m the type of man that would take a lady by your hand
And show her, that I wanna get to know her
Tell her that she?s beautiful and that I wanna hold her
Eventually, it all be that way and I?ll walk up to her and ask her her name
My name is Cuete 
It?s nice to meet you
I was wondering if one day I could kick it with you

(Chorus)
I overcame rainy days in my life, 
Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,
Ima be alright, ima be okay",Rainy Days,2005
Lil Cuete,"Hey girl don't you know
Money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love.

I see you everyday but you never look at me
You're always looking good but you look unhappy
Tell me why you choose to live like this
If you were mine I'd never make you feel like this
You need a man not someone that's gonna hurt you
You need to let him go he doesn't deserve you
And when I say I'll make you happy it's true
Or you could stay with your man
And get your heart broken too
But here's my number call me up if you want
And when you feel lonely you could roll through my spot
See I ain't trippin' homies lost in my game
Nobody know's it til we say 'cause I'm ahead of the game
'Cause I'm a king what I need is a queen I could have a million dollars but it won't mean a thing
Now I ain't rich but I'll tell you one thing
I could give you more happiness then money can bring

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

I want to be you're only one
And you could be mine too
'Cause baby I'm going crazy
When I think about you
I get excited when I see you come through
Nobody else made me feel the way that you do
I need a woman not a girl
Not just someone to fuck
I don't mean no disrespect
But that's wassup
I see you smile when I talk like that
It seems like it's been a while since you smiled like that
But maybe we can kick it
You spend a little time
Sit down one-on-one
And let you know what's on my mind
I know a good thing when I see it
And I see it in you
So tell me what I gotta do to make you feel the same too
Because I'm a king what I need is a queen
I could have a million dollars
But it won't mean a thing
Now I ain't rich
But I can tell you one thing
I can give you more happiness
Then money can bring
And that's real

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

That's all I've got to give my heart and soul to you
Only way I wanna live sharing each moment with you
Take it fast take it slow girl you know it's real this time (so real)
Don't let true love pass you by baby

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

So real",Real Love,2006
Lil Cuete,"Hello
Hi daddy!
What are you doing?
Um will you come and pick me up righ' now?
Oh I can't pick you up right now
I'm busy I gotta go uh record a song right now
I'll pick you up after I get out of the studio OK?
Mm hm
I love you
I love you daddy
Aight I'm a go back to work right now OK?
Ok
I gotta go make that money for us
I love you
Be careful and behave alright.

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK

I remember when I'm gonna sing this
Fix this barely got money to put food in the kitchen
After working hard trying make ends meets
Best believe to any life next week
Lyrics
But no one gonna hold me down
And this I swear to myself
Nobody gonna get the best of me
Cause I need nobody's help
And that for sure
I hold my own thing and do my own thing
I ain't gonna stop til I'll top and
Drop and resting in peace
I know I gotta stay strong
So I don't breck and my kids say
Daddy gotta make that bank
And if I die before I wake
I pry the lord my sole to take
Cause never will I give 'em
Never will I fell them because

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK

No matter what I do I never seems to be enough
They try to hold me down
But I get back up
My mind stay tough
When the time get rough
So I gotta take a puff on this purple stuff
I can't sleep I still up in the late night
I'm thinking about my move for the day light
There no left so I get my pay right
One false move they send straight to the cage right
I still live the same up in the street gangs
I spend awhile everyday trying to maintain
I still try to get up on my feet
Still trying to fly away
Still trying to spread my wings
But no matter what I'm never gonna give up
I gotta stay up both water in my head up
Even thou time are rough and you fed up
We gotta do what it take to get up

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK

Waking up in the morning everyday
With the same thought
Is the pain and the rain ever gonna stop
Will I make it through the day without getting shot
Or will the way of the world get me caught
Up in the mix down were I can't move
Do what I do if someone walks in my shoes
I give it up to cause work nine to five
Keep on doing what you doing to survive your life
But what would you do if your sons was at home
Crying on the floor cause
He left alway alone wishing he could fly away
Every single night cause his dad is in prison and
His mom on the pipe
Will that be enough to get you back on your feet
Or knowing that he ain't got food to eat
We do what we gotta do to make it throug these hard time
I always on the grind I gotta get mine

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK",Take Me Away,2006

And through our good and bad times
I always stayed true

There's no man in this world that Loves you more
You had my heart from the start it was crazy
I remember when you said you be my lady
We fell in love and dats how we stayed
Cause we never let the jealous haters get in our way

Lets do the best we can and try to make it last
And learn from mistakes that we made in the past
Will take it slow girl not too fast
I'll give you anything baby girl just ask
You make me happy on my rainy days

You make my sun come out and take my clouds away
You're the only one for me that talks real

And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing a long like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiate in making this a non free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be
So think about it, take a minute let it breathe b
But think about it bro, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side, of just bacon and comparing it
To what the difference in a cheeseburger verse the bacon cheeseburger was in making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter, tryin' to tell me something different
Imma get on Yelp in a minute and review this piece of shit place like only a Kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud
Unless you, oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that?
I'm so embarrassed",$ave Dat Money,2015
Lil Dicky,"Yeah
Ay, can y'all turn my headphones down? Significantly?
Cool, that's good
It was super loud

First of all, this shit about me
I ain't made this shit for y'all, that's the damn thing
I've been waiting pretty long to get on some shit and rip it for Dicky
So just consider this my damn theme song, baby
I've been working hella hard, though
There's people telling me I'm 'bout to be a star, bro
But when I play 'em some of this, they like nobody want the pissed Lil Dicky
You the funny kid, that's where your car go
That metaphor about my lane, if your retardo
I'm bubbling like I'm in a soda, word to Fargo
I'm tryna get the fucking fame and it's a tricky little game you gotta play
Sometimes you gotta tell your heart ""No""
Here's the problem I've been having
I wanna make my favorite type of music
And the shit I like to bump is not the type I'm brewing
I be on that ""Fuck the world, you motherfuckers losing"" type of shit
Like all you haters, look at what the fuck I'm doing
All my favorite rappers not amusing
And I love my funny stuff, I hope it's not confusing
I'm just saying, when you doing something time consuming
Every now and then you wanna spaz
Why I didn't go with jazz, muhfucka
Get up in yo ass, muhfucka
Y'all are trash, you ain't even know the half
I could rattle off a lot of opposition to rap game
But honestly I'm not in the position for that plane
To carry any weight, I just gotta carry on and wait
'Til a motherfucker carry all the weight
Hypothetically, though, I prolly tell you that I'm better than you'll ever be bro
I prolly tell you it's objective, I'm more impressive
You pressing play, and form a perspective
I'm guessing more or less it won't be competitive
Y'all adorable, seditive kind of rappers, so deplorably editive
Nothing's worse than when a moron's repetitive
I don't get it, how is everyone the same dude?
The rookie walking on the court like ""Man, I can't lose""
They playing Dicky, everybody in the room be like ""That's some shit""
Playing yo bum ass, they be like ""That's some shit""
Y'all are bubbles with the rapping
Lil Dicky get it popping, you could say he bubble rapping
The irony in all of this is I've been funny rapping
Yet the youngin's snapping to the point where all of y'all are funny rapping
Congratulations, y'all can write a hook
At my graduation, they was saying I could write a book
If a Rotten Tomatoes site existed for us rappers
I would be a 97, y'all would hover 'round a 64
Little Dicky spit that Pixar
Hope you seeing why I really like to spit hard
Only problem is I'm rapping to rappers
To the people that be listening, that world doesn't matter
Wanna know what the advantage of the rapper who black is?
The N-word is his antagonist
Before you get all huff and puff about it, think about it, be analyst
The fact they always use it's no accident
For example, I could be like ""Go figure
I don't think I'm one to fuck with all you ho...""
Y'all can fill in the blank
But that don't make it so you don't gotta rap at a rapper
That applies to every detractor
But even if I had a word like it, the nerd never disturbed
It's absurd but I'm looking 'round and ain't nobody verse me
I don't think a motherfucker's ever tried to hurt me
Every one I see has been supportive on this journey
Like where my haters at? I'm thirsty
I just really wanna talk my shit, be like ""Y'all ain't shit""
But y'all ain't shit, like, y'all don't exist
I could talk about the people that are dicks but I feel like that's whack
That'll get old quick, Robin Williams in ""Jack""
Who the fuck is my antagonist?
Is it you? Is it you?
If it's you, let me tell you something
You ain't even got a clue 'bout the shit that's coming
You don't wanna be the dude in five years like
""The fuck, I dissed that
Shit was pretty clear, how the fuck I missed that?""
You know that I ain't fucking light, bruh
I just fucked around and did this overnight, bruh
I just fucked around and quit a fucking job where I was making triple digits then the comma got involved, dawg
This wasn't rapping or trapping
This was rapping or a big ol' fucking house with a family
Who the fuck is listening that's been making Dicky so angry?
Is it you? Is it you?
I'm just waiting on some nonbelievers
The writing isn't on the wall, it's coming out your speakers
Anybody disagree, I'm being so facetious, homie I mean it
Forget the website, I'm the only motherfucking rap genius
Where you doubters at, I'm tryna hear it
Maybe it's the motherfuckers never paying mind to lyrics
I would dumb it down for y'all to try make it more appealing
But the ones who hang on every word think I'm kinda peerless
But even with no attention, you can kinda tell this motherfucker killing this section
You can kinda tell this motherfucker still an erection
But getting harder by the minute, just admit it, it's sexy
The funny fact about this shit, 
I gotta rap about the fact I wanna rap about this shit to even rap about this shit
Nobody been sleeping on Dicky
It's only been a year and bitches been sleeping on Dicky
Nobody took over the game with they first tape
This motherfucker hasn't struggled since the first grade
Add it up, there's no excuse to go berserk, Dave
Can't debate this shit, you got to skip, you not on first take
So what the fuck am I mad for?
What's some other shit that I could actually spaz for?
Maybe it's the fact that I've been stuck in this lab for
A hundred fucking days straight cooking up raps or
The fact this shit been taking over every thing in life
I gotta make it so I made the call to leave it all behind
That's my girl, that's my world, that's beyond being busy
Now the only one that gets to David Burd is Lil Dicky

See, I told you this about me
Go on and look up in the mirror, see with LD
Who you hate, boy?
Only care about me, said I'm straight, boy
Maybe I'm the one that gotta hit when I wanna murder shit
Y'all probably thinking ""Who is David Burd?"" and shit
Y'all just wanna hear some LD

Lil Dicky,"And now a message from Hannibal Buress
Blaa, uh, sorry, sorry
And now a message from Hannibal Buress

Aye, mane, I'm fucking with this shit. It's good to listen to a professional rapper for once, but Lil Dicky is a horrible rap name. That's some weird shit; you got grown men having to call you Lil Dicky in the streets like ""Aye, what's up Lil Dicky. Bars man, you be spittin' bars"". That's real inconsiderate for you to make that your rap name and it's probably - Is that the worst rap name? I saw a dude named Hogman, The Intruder, no, I just made that up, but it's it's not the worst rap name I've heard at all, man

Here's some tips if you rappers wanna be more professional:
First of all, stop rappin' over your own vocals at your concert. Clear your goddamn instrumental and rap over it, I don't wanna hear you rappin' over your raps, muthafuckas. Also, stop have thirty five people on stage - who are these people?! Are you travelin' with these people or did you hire them locally? Did you pay for their travel? Get all of those muthafuckas off of the stage. It's confusing. I don't like it. You can't do that at other jobs. You can't be an accountant like ""Hey I'm about to do your taxes, here's my thirty friends just standin' around doing nothing while I do your taxes""; fuck outta here

Also, stop talkin' 'bout the same shit. I don't think you have a fresh take on havin' money. I'm tired of hearing about it, I don't, I don't think it's interesting. These muthafuckas need to mix it up. I think I've heard every perspective on havin' money or I used to have money and I oh I got money, I didn't have money, I got more money than you'll ever get, I never thought I would get this much money, I had money now I'm getting more money. Stop getting soo many chains. You don't need that many chains - you only need one chain. Or if you're 2 Chainz, you can have two chains, but not more than that",Hannibal Interlude,2015
Lil Dicky,"Drunk, faded
Browned out, looking all shady
Two months since I fucked a lady
Young man dick going crazy
Standard Saturday
I'm about to get a cab and masturbate
Then I see a hot girl I bet I could date
""Lemme get your cat girl, no Hathaway""
Thats what I thought not what I said to her
Instead I walk up to her like
""I know you heard of the kid
You heard what I did
You heard of my shit
The murderous spit""
She's like ""Naw
You're being weird
What are you talking about?""
I'm like ""Aw.""
Pulling out my phone like a boss
YouTube bout to get her off
But as I type the y-o-u
Some porno pop up
I'm like
""Hold up, how di-, that's not even me like, I don't jerk off mobily.""
Then her friends coming up and want to know if everything is okay
I'm like
""Naw this a rape, can't tell? Give me a break please, get the heck away.""
I turned to her
""Let me buy you a drink.""
She like ""Fine.""
Told the man two Patron
She like ""Lime.""
Said he tried twice the card got declined
I'm like
""Are, is this, could it be a machine issue?""
He was like ""Naw.""
I was like
""Obviously there's something wrong
I got dough like, I'm not broke, I got donuts with the same card like about an hour ago.""
He like ""Dude, I don't know.""
Now I'm looking at the girl she just wanna go
And I ain't talking bout with me, bro. I mean alone
I got one more chance to prove myself so I'm like-
""Look, I'm athletic, girl. I've gotten several rec-league MVP's
At my crib I've got some pizza. Plus a little bit of weed
In my room I've got a TV. Plus I recently did sheets
Girl, I even have a fridge that has the water on the door like with the crushed ice""

But I've been acting well behaved today, I smell okay

On the floor and I'm praying this bitch is horny
I go and give her a smooch
She kissing Dicky back, so I play with her boobs
Bad move, she don't like that
Bad mood, her boss being mean to her
Via email, she wanna write back
I'm like ""Right now?""
She like ""Yeah, what do I say, can you just help me?""
""Ok, whats the context?""
Then she like ""Well, he talks to Jane before coming to me.""
""Who's Jane again?"" I said
She like ""Wow, you should know that.""
""Ok, I guess I forgot.""
She like ""Dude, that's my other boss.""
""Ok, true, so shouldn't your first boss go to the other boss before you? Right?""
""But Jane isn't hands on!"" she yelled
""Ok, well I just don't understand the dynamic then, I don't work with these people.""
She started crying
""Wait stop, what the fuck is this?""
""Naw, you don't ever take my side!""
About an hour later til' I'm on her good side
We in bed, hands on her good thighs
I try to kiss, she like ""Good night.""
But I'm like-
""Look, I just turned off The Departed for a movie about a bee
I've been cutting back on farting, tweeting, arguing, and weed
Yesterday I wore a cardigan at dinner with your sweet, and supportive
And during the fourth quarter, of the Eagles!
Now reward it!""

Like I don't even think she knows who I am
Our kids moved away, we've been doing the same shit for days
Maybe months, who knows
Probably going to die soon
Pretty scared I ain't even going to lie to you
Think about it all day, on my last legs
But I'm going out with a bang
I got pills they invented back in '57
I took five, that's a bit excessive
I look high, take a look at my thighs and good god that's a little erection
It'll work though
Now I've gotta find the ho
I'm pretty much blind at this point, I don't know if I mentioned that yet
But I am
Made my way into the bedroom and there she is
I'm like
""Look, I don't know if you're aware that you've been throwing out my shoes

Oh good god, I'm nasty
Don't look around girl, I'm lookin at you

What's your name? where you from? who you with?
What's your policy on birth control? when were you last tested? girl I gotta know
If you gon let me hit it raw, you gotta go
That would be crazy irresponsible

You know I only get with a bitch I mentally respect
We ain't even gotta fuck unless you and me connect
Minimally I'd like to ejaculate somehow though
Girl, I don't think I'm being unreasonable unless you that naive
That you thought this was a friend thing
I hope you not a freak so don't moan and spool your body soak and wet
My bad, I know I sweat (profusely)
Also, I won't fuck from the side girl, I'd lose like half my dick
Are you good about the pill?
Cuz even if it's foreplay, I should know that shits for real girl I got hella pre-cum
Also, I'm wondering bout the way that you cum
Like is it external stimulation or penetration-based? fuck it
You know I enjoy that way
But you know damn well, I just want my bed
They gon say I fell, I got blown away
I'm a hopeless romantic, girl I'm being dramatic but it's just the truth

Wait hold up, I should slow down
Don't even know you enough to go down
But if you want it we should go now
And we gon find out if it's great or it's strange

Oh girl, I could get you 4 to 8 minutes
Won't force the issue
Bitch it's too crowded
So girl if you bad then just give me that signal
But make it a loud one, I'm awful at this, hoe on the low, you [fire?] cut the shit
Girl what you tryin to do?
I got candles, nonpareils, and three condoms in my room
The nonpareils might be old as shit
Like they've been in there for a while
But fact of the matter is I don't want this to be no blip
I'd prefer to fall in love or swear I'm on some crazy shit (crazy shit)
Like honestly, I need someone to save the kid (save the kid)

It could be you but first you gotta let me freak
Just lemme freak, just lemme freak again
Girl, what's wrong with you?

A daughter named bailey
That barely [?]
We gon eat so many goddamn meals
What's your name?
Girl, you better keep them dirty paws off my chicken lo mein

We'll talk the boundaries out together is all I'm sayin
And for the record girl I'll eat that pussy later
Like when I know you a little bit better
But for now it's just too intimate
Like it's too much
You don't even have to give me head either
Like I'm totally onboard with a hand job
Especially if there's like lube or some shit around
In a weird way, I actually prefer it to head
There's no guilt
No guilt at all
In fact, it feels just as good to me too if not better
I think it's a dick sensitivity issue
At the same time, there's no way you should complain about such a thing",Lemme Freak for Real Tho (Outro),2015

Lil Dicky,"Yeah, man, this is the softest thing I ever did
But it's about something pretty important to me

And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life

Fuck it, I don't even know what I could of done
Looking back thinking ""That's what I should of done""
Wanted you back
But when the fact is I always put you second to rap
I'm not mad that you wouldn't come
And even though I had to move, I ain't move on
Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong
But she knows what I'mma do with the new songs
And she know them pretty soon when your dude on
Running the rap game, with that lane
Always got to be up on that train, or that plane
Ain't nobody wanna feel that pain, or that strain
Wishing I ain't gotta get that fame
Or I'd claim you, know I'd give you my last name
But that blame on me
Chasing something, feeling dumb 'cause you all I need
Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free
But you know I'm never knowing when that's gonna be
And I'm sorry

It's the hardest road to follow (I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe

If I woke up and I called it quits ('cause I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this (I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby

And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life

When I'm being dumb and stupid
Who the fuck is gonna hit me with the motherfucking jerk face?
Who's gonna let me know to hit my mother on her birthday?
Who's gonna let me know when I be shopping if a shirt's gay?
And when I'm on the road I be missing that
Always looking at my phone, you would give me crap
Ever since I've been alone I've been thinking back
Listening to you auto-tune in my mic phone making us laugh
You know the past was a blast but it never could last
Pretty sad when your love got a separate path
Used to read when there's nothing to do
But it's funny
Doing nothing's never nothing when it's something with you
You know I wanna still talk, even text and call
Whenever something going on I be pressing ""Moll""
Up in the phone til I press the X
Stressed the next one'll best the ex
And you'll forget, but it's best
You the best to me girl, always bake me something
And when they ripped off, you replaced my buttons
But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband
'Cause even when I can't say ""Love you""
I love you

It's the hardest road to follow (I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow,
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe

If I woke up and I called it quits ('cause I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this (I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby

And that's you

Lil Dicky,"Oh well, I'm ignorant
But not to the fact that I'm ignorant, of course
I know that, I'm indifferent
I don't care to know what I don't
I don't care 'til I'm coming home
And my dad tell me some shit about when he my age, he was doing shit
Protesting about something that I forget currently
But that's not the point, the point is
To my pot, the boy is in the crowd devoid of giving a fuck
I would call his bluff but I've been thinking 'bout it
And shit, he ain't wrong, though
I don't vote but I think I did at prom, though
I don't know about a world if it's not home
I don't even know the first thing about what Obama do
I'm better off telling y'all what Lebron been doing
I don't even know what my mom been doing
I hit her up every Sunday
And we talk, but the call's going one way
In the dark, if it's not what I'm doing
Never been aware from the start, but I knew it
I don't even care how my tech work
If the shit work, put it there, turn it on, we can do it
Funny thing is I could look it all up today
And placate the debate within my brain waves
But the shows I watch all start at 8 so

Oh well
It's the season finale, so
Oh well
I kind of have to watch live, people are gonna tweet about it
Oh well
But I'm aware of all this stuff, I'll figure it out
Oh well

I do care when my phone's dying
Like, when that shit's red and I can't text
And I can't check what my fans said
I get mad stressed
Laying in the bed but I can't rest
Till my gram checked, wish I cared less
Leave it at the crib, I'm a damn mess
I should stop for a day, wanna try that shit
Drifting away, I wanna ride that ship
Dinner on the table but I'm unable to be tasteful
Underneath, I'mma like that pic
Watching the show on a phone, filming Coachella on phones
Hoping I capture the moment so I could post it
Don't live in the moment, hoping I'm still in control
But I'm praying I'm not alone
All the fans say I'm great at talking to 'em
They don't even understand I am not the man
I just can't go a day with being alone
When I'm with friends, though, why the fuck am I still on my phone?
Wishing I could look this shit up on Chrome
Wishing I could take a second to stop and reflect it
But someone just texted me

Oh well
It's actually like an important text
Oh well
I'm trying to solve, like, logistical issues
Oh well
It's time sensitive is what I'm trying to say
Oh well

I was gonna do a line, but I sneezed
I was gonna smoke, but I need weed
I just wanna roll up and then leave
But everyone keeps on talking to me
Like ""How's Mike Will? You know Rae Sremm?
I like ""No Type"" but I really hate them""
Like I asked for your opinion when I barely even know what day it is
I'm passed [?} loans and my rent
But I just bought new J's and shit
Going way fast on a one way road with the window down tryna wave at them
My mom says I should go back to classes
But I'm in the strip club and I'm tapping asses
And bitch look like Jacqueline Onassis
But she lies a lot and can't kick the habit
I've tried to stop giving passes to those who front it cause that's living backwards
And they give two cents when I ain't even ask them
Treat them like exams and I need to pass them
I twitching dutches, I don't do the backwards
But this gas station don't carry those
And I'm tryna smoke, man, how traffic
Here's a 20 and some change, man, you can have it like
No

Do you fuck to the war?
No, I don't fuck with the war
I'm like no, I don't fuck with the war
Just don't know how to react to the forces
I should have just thanked you of course -
Uh, why would you thank me?
Uh, I guess I assumed it would extend to the families but okay
While we on the topic
I been actually thinking about some shit
About the Army and Navy
What if tomorrow is the day
That the fucking aliens came
And invaded our nation?
Like, would we even be able to fuck with their shit?
Like do we have the type of weaponry to fuck with their ships?
So not at all, like would they just walk up in this motherfucker
Laughin' at us, and blastin' at us
And makin' everybody disintegrate and assimilate
Without a hint of intimidation?
Or could we do some shit to be making they heart race?
Granted I don't know the alien heart, but
You get what the fuck I'm sayin?
Like what the fuck would it be like?
Would they be like Earth go hard?
Or is it just another conquest?
Or would they be like damn earth go hard
They was harder than Simian
You ever talk to your brother about this uh type of stuff?
Then she like no
I'm like well what you think?
She like I don't concern myself with hypotheticals that couldn't be
I'm like girl what you mean?
She like I don't believe
In the war?
In aliens
Oh hold up
Hold up, wait
Girl what you sayin?
That all of the life in the universe happens to be where you stand?
I guess
What an enormous coincidence that shit would be
Do you see what I'm sayin'?
I can't hear what you're sayin'
Well the universe always expanding
There are infinite galaxies
Why would we be the anomaly?
She like that's no coincidence
I call that shit God
I'm like oh you're religious, bitch
You think it's all God
No, I know it's all God
No, I know that there might be a God
First off, nobody knows there's a God
Girl I think we should drop this
No, what's goin' on in your brain right now?

Brain uhh, brain on some other shit though
I been all up in the club for the year hey brain
I been killin' shit don't mind me
I'm just top flight
I could sure use a Sprite
I'm thirsty as fuck
Who gettin money?
That's brain
Who make decisions?
That's brain
Who make the hits?
That's been brain
Who run the whole operation?
That be brain
(Brain, can you just get back to the issue here)
Uh, can you just remind the brain?
(You're such an idiot, we're talking about God and if he exists)
Don't call brain names
The brain couldn't recall
But if I'm not mistaken this bitch to my left
Guaranteed there's a god
(I believe in a god, yes)
So god never wrong
God never wrong, right?
Yeah, that's like the whole point
(Brain just get there, please)
Hold up
So god made the earth
And god was like hold up, this shit is boring
It need more shit
God was like Imma put dinosaurs on that bitch
Dinosaurs on that bitch
Then he like why I put dinosaurs on that shit?
What is your brain even saying?
Can he get to the point?

Hold up brain you just did it
God ain't wrong what the fuck was he thinking
About what?
Bitch, the dinosaurs
He made the Earth for them
But then he like nah?
Dinosaurs are just blah?
What's your point?
I'mma cook up some blondes?
Like he was way off
I don't look like a dinosaur
Ho them things 35 feet
I'm like 5 foot 11
But on Tinder I'm 6 foot
Seen that Brachiosaurus
That thing fuckin' neck go to heaven
And that's just an expression bitch
There ain't no heaven
Ha, funny
I'm just messin' but if he ain't wrong
I guess this the exception
Can I talk now?
Go ahead
Look
Everything in life has purpose
You, chickens, a midget at a circus
What?
I don't interpret
She like that's not for me to determine
So dinosaurs purpose was to just die?
That's not for me to determine
But ok
I'm just a person
Okay, but think of the root of the argument girl
View how we started this girl, like you don't believe in the aliens
You confine God to earth girl, I find that shit silly salient
I just don't presume to know the plan
Bitch me neither but that's not what I've been sayin
But what are you sayin?
Why can't God fuck with aliens?
Why can't Earth just be like a fucking small side project for this guy?
Ok, look we just don't see eye to eye
Yeah but logically like you don't believe in your side
Yeah but you're like bringing up fucking dinosaurs
Like we could have shared the earth with them nobody knows
Yeah, there is hard soil evidence girl
Like what's next you don't fuck with Pangaea?
She like lets change the subject
Ok
(This bitch don't know about Pangaea, uhm)
Brain leave it alone
I'm starving, are you hungry by chance?
Oh my god I'm so hungry
Yes, do you wanna get a pizza?
Fuck yeah. fuck yeah, I'm on it
Also I'm sorry about that whole interrogation thing
Come on dude I'm a grown up
I'm capable of having intelligent conversations
Okay, I just fuck it
Okay back to this pizza I lean pepperoni
Ugh
Sausage?
How can you eat that shit?
No, no, no, this not Dominoes
This legit, is high quality meat and shit
No, no, I'm vegetarian
Oh right, well we can get half pepperoni
And half of whatever you like
Uh, ew, I can't have that shit
In the same box
Seriously? You're that against meat?
No, I'm that against us being gluttonous
Thinking that animals live on this earth to get eaten
Okay, is it how we treat them?
Uh, that sure doesn't help
Ok
She like I'm not opposed to us hunting
But now we not trackin' them down
We just breed them to eat
That's disgusting
You should honestly read on the subject
Alright hold up
Just because we're not running around with a bow and arrow
Doesn't mean we're not hunting these chickens
We just decided the place to do our hunting intelligently enough
To manipulate these animals and get them to do exactly what we want
That's my point we just incubate animals
Instead of just letting them live how they come
But, that's just your God at work bitch
Why we go hard on earth
What you think would happen right now
If you left my place
And there were like three wolves waiting for you
Wolves?
Bitch, they would tear your ass up
Viciously
Like they would eat your titties
And your pussy
That's what they do
And your face and shit
Humans are smarter bitch
That's what we do
She like apples to oranges
Bitch that phrase don't make no sense
Why can't fruit be compared?
She like I'm gonna leave
There's just all of these conflicting principles

Lil Dicky,"Hello, how can I help you?
Hi, my name’s Dave Burd, I have an appointment today
It’s probably under 'Lil Dicky,' actually
I’m a, I’m a rapper, so
Okay, and who are you here to see?
Uh, Snoop Dogg? Says here Snoop D-o-g-g
Oh, yeah. He’s right down the hall
First door to your right
Give him a knock and he should be right with you
Thanks. It’s uh, this door right here, right?
Mm-hmm, thank you

Grab a seat
Thanks I’m Dave very nice to meet
Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg
Let me just check your sheet
No problem, sir, let me just say
I’m a big fan of the shit that y’all make
I can’t lie, I been thinking about this all day
All good, there’s a reason that we called, Dave
let me start with your background
Where you come from?
Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond
Before that
Oh, you talking bout my hometown?, yeah

I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around
So real shit you ain’t never had to struggle for much
I wouldn’t say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap
Elaborate
Well I ain’t never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad
I’m cool and I can get whatever job I wanted
But the job you wanted wasn’t all that bumping
Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
Know you been racing them rats, you ain’t been making them raps
Boo hoo what a hardship
How you paid to get the rap shit started?
Man, my Bar Mitzvah money
But don’t diss me buddy, I wasn’t one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must’ve wanted this a lot, I had something to choose
Look at that, I can say there’s something to prove up in your ass
Yeah, I guess
That’s enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?
Oh my god, it’s the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I get a forum to project myself
It’s never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It’s kinda healthy
Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypothetical's
Sure
In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
Uh, I wouldn’t do shit
And I don’t even get what that got to do with this?
Shut the fuck up, rap's like life
If you wanna do this, then you won’t get far acting like a little bitch
Nah, that’s my niche!
Don’t get offended by this, but that’s the market y’all missed
That’s the target I’ll hit
And that’s the heart of my pitch
I wanna do this whole thing different
What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different?
Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know
Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time
But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right?
Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know
You don’t know if it could be working even better
And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
I don’t mean any disrespect by that
I’m just saying I have a different background
Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant

So what are your biggest strengths?
Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing
For example, I can be like ain’t nobody fucking with Lil Dicky
When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
Ripping this shit like it’s never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer
Alright, alright, I get it
Top of that, lyrically I’m pretty damn clever (go)
Got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe Neville (whoa)
And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (oh)
You can say I’m pretty smart how I know better
And y’all been winning like Pistorius, it’s no feat
Bro, I can go on and on
I’m taking over and they mad like father-in-laws
Okay enough of the punchline, that ain’t showing me you different from the other guys
Well I don’t know if they can run it like that
But ain’t nobody else doing funny type rap
What’s that?
Well I can tell a story about my morning
Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence
Like the 14 year old Topanga
Oh this shit like a joke to you?, I don’t get it
Nah it ain’t like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
Like, as a guy
So when I get up on the mic I ain’t finna just lie
Real recognize real, right?
Yeah, I guess. So what you trying to do?
Five years from now, tell me bout the due
Well, I don’t care about the money
Like, it’s the respect that I’m wanting
Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats
Where they gotta bring your boy up every debate
I don’t wanna leave the game the same
In a nutshell, what’s your legacy?
Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap
With the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap
Yet, the fans of rap started recognizing anti-rap is ironically one of the real brands of rap left
That shit sound pretty damn complex
I guess, I wanna be the best
I just wanna do it my way
And turn the whole game sideways
And show people you ain’t gotta be resigned to the highway
You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight
I ain’t mad at that
Well thanks, man, that’s my plan of my attack
Just let me in and I’mma rap the plaques
And I ain’t about to win them back to back
I’m bout to win them like it’s back to back to back to back to back
Til I stop rapping
You ain’t even sold a damn album yet, true
That’s a lot of talk from a wily vet
Let alone a young rook nigga
You misread me
Nah this ain’t a book nigga
Well that’s one of my flaws, I’m too competitive dawg
No, you just fucking repetitive dawg
I get it, you trying to be better than all, but you ain’t shit until cheddars involved
I get that I gotta prove myself
No shit you ain’t done shit
But think about that though
Only doing this a couple of years
One tape and I’m like this?
This shit is aight for your first shit
But you don’t know if it’s your worst shit
You don’t think finding out would be worth it?
It might be, it might not
But I’mma put your ass to work, kid
Wait, like, like I have the job? Like really?
Well one more thing, let me see if you could put a hook together
What would you do for the hook for this song?
You want me to make a hook up right now?
Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself?
Alright, uh, okay, man do the hook

I’m bout to be professional
Homie, I’m professional
Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing?
Nigga, that shit is garbage man
Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it
But I’m not good at thinking of things on the spot like that
Don’t y’all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes?
Sometimes, but you know, that was some next level Dogg shit right there
Yeah, you know, I’m just way better when I get to think things through
Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing
Whatever man, you trying to smoke a blunt?
Right now?
Yeah, sure

Dope, Juanita, bring some weed in here, please, thank you
(You got it, Snoop, I’ll be right there)
Thanks, Juanita, super nice woman
Nigga, why does everything you say sound so soft?
Uh, I really don’t wanna be spoken to like that, so
Whatever, Thanks
(Hey, I got y’all y’all weed)
Damn, that’s some great looking weed, It’s just so early
(Can I get you guys anything else while I’m here? coffee? tea? head? bottled water?)
D-Did you just say head?
(Yeah. You ain’t never got no head before?)
I mean, Just feels like A lot, right now (ok)

But what kind of tea do you guys have?
(We got mint, raspberry, earl grey, English breakfast)
Actually, I’ll take head
(I knew your little dirty ass wanted some head.)",Professional Rapper,2015

Up in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know
And you too must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono
It's like I hit the lotto
I had to hit the wall though
I couldn't see it for a minute
Shit was hidden, Waldo
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy
I'm just prayin', I don't
It's just I know
It's just I know

I saw the world like, ""Hold up""
Damn near fakin' on the side
Let me take you on a ride
Let me tell you bout the one who couldn't take the 9 to 5
Use to take the 95 down to Richmond
Bumpin' Jigga up in the ride
Use to think along and drive
'Bout my drive
Used to wonder why
Used to wonder when the world'l see like I'm seein' mine
Use to whine
Use to wanna shine
Used to wanna dine
Used to talk to bitches in my mind when they were walkin' by
""Girl, what's happenin'? Girl what's happenin'?""
I ain't really 'bout to get involved that's what's happenin'
Errything I knew was unevolved like a Baptist
Layin' on my matress
Prayin' I could have this, and
Now when I get Tinder matches
They think they've been Catfished
Now I been controlling how we livin' like a facist
Now I got this weight up off my shoulders like a strapless
Remember this shit was hapless
Remember the day it happened
Aw, you the shit Dave, you be killin' everything you did
Got the whole world talkin' all about what you did
Got your old girl talkin' all about what you is
Got your old world lookin' like it's his you ain't here
I been fuckin' for the fuck of it
And one of the bitches I been fuckin' with
Been wondering how I can work this much and stomach it
She wonders what I want from it
I said, ""We don't gotta get into it""
She like ""Nah, just do it""
She a psychology student
She always followin' up
Find the guy to be amusing as fuck
Usually I'll answer her truthfully
But truthfully, I'm unusually used to being unusually good at internalizing when music is not provided
But I humor hoe
Ask her if she ever saw the Truman Show
She like yeah
I like well, when I saw that shit I was convinced I was livin' like Jim
A similar situation where I was the basis of everyone's entertainment
Like really up in the basement talkin to y'all
In the mirror because I thought Lil David was some American hero
I know it's selfish and all
But I just felt it's my call
I was a ten year old then
By 2010 I was wrong
I'm like

""Aw, damn! Aw, damn!
You the motherfucker though""

I just need you to imagine
Bein' stuck up on the land without a captain
When everyday is average
And everyday you feelin' like a captive
And feel like somethin' seriously lackin'
And then you fear what could happen if you just leave it on the table like napkins
But, yo, you really fearin' hitting them rappin's and leaving everything behind
Cause you don't know what that horizon brings

Tell 'em I'm gone (Yeah)
I just pretend I ain't scared (Go)
Don't even know I was there (Go)
Don't even know if I care
Cause girl this is Truman approachin' the wall
Until I'm me I am nothin' at all
Until I'm free I will not see beyond
I had to be who I was all along
Ay

I think I mighta broke it down
Hoppin' on the fuckin' steps like ain't no around
Open up that door, you bet, ship ain't goin' down
Guess the only thing left is to take a bow

Hoping that my pitch is strong
Now she's like ""let's do some bumps""
Ew, chill I don't do that (Ew!)
Poured a rail and she blew that
Now I'm scared, I look pussy
Spark the blunt 'cause I do that
She was sniffing that Tom Hanks
I was just sipping Chris Brown
She keep on sniffing that Zeus (Coke)
I keep my eyes on the ground
She like ""don't knock it 'till you try it""
That's some bullshit (yeah, I know)
Just do a line of this Betsy Ross
I started thinking, can't deny I'm a pussy
Like as a child I was so dissmissive of the baked potato 'till I tried that shit
Now the baked potato is my favorite kind potato
Now she got me wondering what else I left on the table
Twenty-eight, I still ain't done no anal (true)
And I'm unusually skeptical
But man oh man this bitch was raw
So I asked her for some Molly
She like ""start with Miley""
I'm like ""give me Molly""
Crazy 'cause I

I see this brother shit we doin', this shit ain't workin' (Shit ain't workin', no)
God put me on this Earth for a purpose (For a purpose, yeah)
The toughest nigga in the room, they be workin' (They be workin')
Like they'll turn me to snake, but it ain't worth it, nuh (Worth it, no)

And I'll cut you off, ain't comin' right
Night time, hungry, hold my tummy tight
Can't repeat what I seen them summer nights
They don't wanna see us come alive

How the niggas who went Hollywood stay rappin' 'bout the trenches?
Had to cut niggas off who was all in their feelings
I told him cut his bitch off, seen her ridin' with them niggas
And I find that shit crazy, they hate with who begins 'em
Yeah, I'm so 10 toes, I'm who they fuckin' with
Them niggas talkin' bad about me, tell 'em suck a dick
I told my brothers that we blood, I don't know who my cousins
And if you is, you hang with them, you know what it is
I swear I'd go back to jail for all my brother kids
I swear I'd go back to jail to see my brothers live
Shoot you, then follow the ambulance, make sure you dead for real
Your parents rich, you silver spoon, my family ain't left a will
And we ain't doin' no sneaky talk, their ass had left for real
And why he talkin' out his chest like he is made of steel?
Them niggas ain't worried 'bout no shooters, them niggas made to kill
I put my heart inside my music, I got pain for real
Jackson lost his grandma, I got pain for him
Made me call my grandma way more
And since she changed my life, I gotta change yours
You say you like my niggas, but I hate yours

You different (Different)
Got you some lil' money, actin' different (Actin' different)

I had talent, you ain't believe me
Then you tried to come around like this shit was easy
When you not around, that shit like Mario without Luigi
Put her in that St. Laurent, I took her out that Bebe
Told my mama that I'm famous, see me on the TV
And I gotta play for keeps, I know my vultures need me
That Perky got me E.T., I got her suckin' weewee
I know some niggas tear your face off, GP
I elevated
Had to go and take off, I never waited
On God, I love your ass to death, I never hated
And you ain't come from the bottom, you by the basement, uh
Me and you was splittin' chicken wings from Harold's Chicken
Me and you, goin' house to house for Thanksgiving
Me and you, said the drugs give a strange feelin'
Me and you, me and you, me and you
Uno, dos, tres and, one, two, thee blessings
Goin' to different cities, we don't ever check in
All my shooters different, they gon' give us leverage
You leave, you can't get back in

Heard a gunshot, walked up out
My motherfucking door, what's happening with all this madness?
What niggas got going on to make me jump up off this Madden
In my Gucci flip-flops, tan khakis, niggas sagging
Niggas pulled up on me, matte black G wagon
I'm like shit, the fo' fif's still in the house
And usually niggas shoot from from where you from, come out they mouth
Got a nigga heart beating like a cutlass truck
But my mama raised a G and she don't fuck with punks
Niggas rolled down the window, couldn't tell who it was
Waving off the chronic smoke, is they Blood or Cuz?
Haha, it's my little cousin Jordan and he's solid
We went up last night, nigga said he forgot his wallet
We was bumping E-40 (yeah that Hurricane)
(Went through ten or twelve bottles of that Sluricane)
We had six white bitches and a gang of weed
You know them blonde hair, blue eyes, they aim to please

Where you going fool?) Compton college to pick this bitch up
We both in Impalas (Make the motherfucker hiccup)

'Cause we done fucked every bitch in the Golden State
Now tell me, how many bitches wanna fuck this nigga?
Stuff dick in her stomach until that butt get bigger
And we both fuck Kianna, you ain't know that though
(She put a hole in the condom, I don't know that hoe)
Conversating with my nigga at this long ass light
Made a left at Alameda, Eazy bust that right
(I'm gone cuz!) Aight, hit a switch and I'm outie

Take all that bass out your voice, homeboy this is Cedar
(My bad Chuck, let a nigga hit the weed)
Nah, take this quarter piece and drop it off at the trees
Watch the Fruits though, tell that nigga Soo Woo though
You can take the rag, don't get a scratch on my coupe though

So So Def
Yeah, yeah

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why?  Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game
Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings

Lil Fee,"I thought I heard your voice amid the noise on the street. 
I imagined it at best, but the knot in my chest still skipped a beat. 
I cannot concentrate or think at all of late for the thought of you, 
Though it's been so long since the day I found you were gone when I came to. 

Llast night, I saw your face. but something was wrong that I could not quite place. 
Suddenly I began to realize: the eyes I did not recognize. 
I woke up with a start and a pounding heart, gasping for air. 
I thought you were a ghost, or a dream at most, but you're everywhere.

There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine

Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness

Off with his dreads, keep the mag' in my clothes

Hit the spot with the most hoes at the sideshow, abouts to plot
Spin donuts, you know I'm macking, a straight up nigga
Catch me spinnin', you can tell I was there cause I clocked smoke when I was finished
I seen five-O, and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin' he'd be nice and all cause I gotta 185 in the hood

Lil Greenwood,"I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
'Cause my lovin' baby done left this town. 

If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway. 

Oh, that St. Louis woman, with her diamond rings, 
She pulls my man around by her apron strings. 
And if it wasn't for powder and her store-bought hair, 
Oh, that man of mine wouldn't go nowhere. 

I got those St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, 
Oh, my man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. 

I love my man like a schoolboy loves his pie, 
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his rocker and rye 
I'll love my man until the day I die, Lord, Lord. 

I got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, Lord, Lord! 
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me.

But I really wanna let niggas know what's happening though

I want the world to see,

See we smoke and go hoeing cause the bitch ain't never shit to me
and pussy stay selling, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thugging off on the stereo
Killing 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothing, we keep getting more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top
Hit hit the switch and smash down the block
And oh yeah this Long Beach so you know when you see a nigga
And don't never get the wrong idea nigga
(Yeah, nigga what?)  Holla at 'em

I keep my khakis creased, hat tilted to the East
On a bitch I remain the beast, none the least

With the cool name, this nigga here's a fool man
Go on and do yo' thing, gang-bang
in the hood and in Hollywood

Get to showing me around they house, then he slide me in the back
and had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out man

Look, I don't play no games
Like these other fraud cats, I won't say no names
I saw you peeping me, hopping out the Range Ro' thang
With my piece glistening, like a rainbow cane 
But anyways I'm Lil' O, the Fat Rat with the cheese
From H-Town Clutch City, Southside of the tree
You can hop up in the truck, or we can slide in my V
I'll let my dog drive it, that was him following me
But I just leave him the Range, and we can hop in the Benz
On one condition, you gotta let me hop in them skins
Cause your ass look like, it could possibly win
The big butt competition, at the Holiday Inn
She started to grin, laugh said boy you wild
Is them alligator shoes, or is them crocodile

In fact I saw you in Miami, on Memorial Day
You was deep with them Houston boys, hogging the lane
And ever since that moment, you been all in my brain
I told her yeah that's how we do it, when we step out of town
So we can break a nigga neck, if he step out of bounds
But that ain't what we about, all that plexing with clowns
We'd rather ball get some broads, and get to sexing em down
But look here, not to sound like I'm some head honcho
But this club too packed, let's burn off pronto
Look Pocahontus, let me be your Tonto
That's when her friends, really jumped in my Convo

Cause the back of his Benz, say six o'clock
And she knew that I could dress, cause my 'fit was hot
I had the Burberry shirt, with the matching shorts
Then she said she ain't get it, since her man been locked up
And said she want to playa, that can tear some cot up
Spank her all rough, have her ass all popped up
No strings attached, when we done just hop up
I said well I'm the one boo, I'm no impostor
You dealing with a certified, Braeswood mobster

Or take you on a lake, for crab cake and pasta

Lil Herb,"Thousand lives ago
We were young and we didn't know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice
Headed back to the light
But be careful don't drown in the gold
I know it glows but it's cold

I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones?
And Four C H'd, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces
The concrete matrix, street organizations
They gave violations, hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces
The hustles was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us
The era of Reagan, the terror of Bush
Crack babies, momma's a push, we were the products of Bush
I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
A bad ho to BBB do me, you heard of flukey?
Stokes it was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation
Diamonds, blind enough so real shit we facin'
Forties wasted on seats, Dion makin' the beats
When they air it out on at the parties we escapin' the heat
I could break it down like whatever you need
He squinted his face and rolled the weed

You know they don't see sometimes
That in the neighborhood
It's the exact same thing
It's the same thing over and over again
Feel me?

Have you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred?
Folly boy, O block, east side
Where it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride
Can't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'?
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying
Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign
I've been out there three days and I got shot at three times
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind
I know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up
But they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper
Where I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major
Small crib, big fam, mom was workin', granny raised us
No food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit
Same niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with
Better watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit
Hungry take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit
I came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it
Feds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean
You ain't never seen the shit that I seen

If it ain't one thing it's a motherfucking another
Word to my granny and my daddy, and my mother
Whether standing on the corner, or bouncing in the six-deuce
When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose

And I was a fool, don't make me have to grab my strap and go
Rat-tat-tat-tat, nigga slap to a motherfucker face he fall

Check this out, it's a Dogg Pound thing
You know who I am you know my motherfucking name, who am I?

Makes me want to hit that ass up with the Dogg Pound

Don't sleep while I creep peep out my technique
I forgot, I'm out of sight so you can't see the
MC of the year, you hear and you fear
I got something for them niggas in the front and the rear
I handle the sides, did a drive by in the who-ride
I'm satisfied now everything is really alright
You know when I come nigga I come wicked
Don't need no permission, motherfucker I'ma kick it
Niggas sweat my shit I wet em up with the biscuit
Lick em up shot, it don't stop, till them all drop
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks
Just stop, rotting on the next niggas jock
I'm strapped with my glock on your block
And ready to let loose on the first imitator that I spot

Sitting here chopping game, my nigga Bad Azz
Niggas get the misconception of us
cause we so cold at what we do
But I really wanna let niggas know what's happening though
You feel me?

[Chorus]
Now I don't want anybody
to get the wrong idea about me
I don't have nothing to hide
I want the world to see,
I'm a gangsta gangsta
Gangsta niggas do your dance
(C-Walk, C-Walk homey, yeah)
Gangsta bitches wave yo' hands

See me, I'm bout my money my paper I'm bout my dollars
Popping collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers
See we smoke and go hoeing cause the bitch ain't never shit to me
and pussy stay selling, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thugging off on the stereo
Killing 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothing, we keep getting more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top
Hit hit the switch and smash down the block
And oh yeah this Long Beach so you know when you see a nigga
And don't never get the wrong idea nigga
(Yeah, nigga what?)  Holla at 'em

[Chorus]

I keep my khakis creased, hat tilted to the East
On a bitch I remain the beast, none the least
Police try to cuff me and stuff me in the back
of they patrol car, cause I'm a former parole star
With the cool name, this nigga here's a fool man
Go on and do yo' thing, gang-bang
in the hood and in Hollywood
Record company executives think it's all to the good
Get to showing me around they house, then he slide me in the back
and had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out man
I'm down with P, and D-R-E
A real nigga from the motherfucking L.B.C.
I just look like this, I stay down for the twist
I'm real with this, deep as abyss
I gave you a pound, then I gave yo' wife a kiss
I had to dip cause y'all was full of that bullshit

Now holla if you with me
Tell them hoes come and get me

Just a bunch a niggas lying around the first of the month
Getting paid getting high off of weed and blunt
That's how we ball from the south to the bay we don't play
Riding dirty with tray

A million we will make
Independent to this day
Sixty platinums in the plate
And I a thug till I break

Oh shit he's got a strap in his hands does he know what to do with it
Well yet and still you gots tokill for there's much to kill
Hands to experience been caught up in a raw deal
Flex my weight
From cans of beans to potato and steak
In got hungry and couldn't wait to demonstrate
Oh sucky now

Check therecords to see how many patterns that fell down
See I got hungry enough to go get it
'cause my family was doing bad
Who without it

Chorus
Damn that beats by the pound I want the whole enchilada
He don't need no ambulance God knows he don't need no doctor
Dig a deep enough hole and throw his body right in it
And they pay us to send a message and we gonna damn sure send it
It's the X-files top priority risk
'cause you might see out of that type shit
From hoeing to jacking to macking (macking)
Dealing to looting that's really what's happening
Player don't know nothing about getting his hands dirty
Up early in the morning cooking chicks to birdies
No sense to no dollars ( no dollars )
Nohustle than why bother? Huh?

Lil Italy,"[Chorus]
What you gone do, when they come for you?
When the feds is knockin at your door?
Better tell your baby mama, grab the kids
Run to the bathroom and flush the dope

Well, uh, it's self-explanatory, on what you should do
And if you was in the same situation, it'd be hard for you too
Well don't panic, keep it together, and make your way
We prepare for the DA police, and the feds everyday
And it's a must we keep supplyin, with that fried ice cream
And if anything go wrong while I'm gone, then baby do your thing
When you get to flushin, don't trust, nobody else
Pay attention, it's a must you play them cards that you dealt

It all happened so fast, like a flash
Feds bustin in like ???
I had to think fast, out the back room I'm rushin
To the bathroom, and start flushin
Quit passin no discussion
I ain't catchin no case, washed away, go down to the hall
No evidence ??? knows, it's evident that we control
Lettin 'em know that we on top, and we got, to step on our toes
While I'm, stackin my cheddar (...?...)
Po-Po's, because they think they sick, uh
No no, I gotta get my scrilla, nigga

[Chorus x2]",What U Gone Do,1999
Lil James,"[Chorus:]
Gripping on wood grain
Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

Gripping on grain, while the fifteen's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
'Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to seventy one, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Lights, camera, action it's on
Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the hardest pit of the litter
Down south, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

[Chorus: Repeat 4X]

We gonna swang, we gonna bang
We gonna grip on wood, baby - 4x",Grippin Grain,2000

Lil Jon,"Once again up in that south from my motherfucking mouth
And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Buster me and me's clicks, always making those hits
We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks
Getting in trouble from the sounds of my trunk
And keeping it crunk, keeping it crunk

[Chorus]
(What, What)
Now drop them bozs' on 'em [Repeats]

Nigga bozs' bout to turn out the show
Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

[Chorus]

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

Now right now I want all my hard niggas to follow me, follow me

Big momma knock ya out with one aight
It's all to the good
'Cause nobody watchin' over our neighborhood

But wait a minute
I came to get with sherry or bennett
Cause she so cute
And I love it when she wear them daisy dukes

[Hook: x16]

I was at a jam the other night
Seen big momma, she was lookin' tight
Iced out, grill in her mouth
Flake in her hair, representin' that south

On the floor she was shakin' that thang
Poppin' that thing, damn, twerkin' that thing
Big momma off the chain
She will show ya know shame cause she true to the game

And ya know she serious
And the way she bounce got a playa delirious
And I know she ready
Gotta dance so crunk even though she heafty

And when we left the club
I seen big momma's caddy sittin' on them dubs
And the trunk with the block beater
I was sittin' right behind her in the two-seater

[Hook: x16]

Ooh look at big momma, ooh big mama!
Big momma droppin' that thang, ooh big mama!
Big momma big and beautiful, ooh big mama!
Look at big momma with them daisy dukes, ooh big mama!

(Brat where are you at?) 



[Da Brat] 

You know its So So Def 

Cause I'm the be	 to the are A 

T the most eligible bitch today 

And these niggas want to ride with a dime like me 

They say they like the way the system pound in my jeep 

I got two twelve's that bump from wall to wall 

So loud that he headlights blink on and off 

I laugh when people watch I don't stop I shine 

It's attractive to motherfuckers that love to grind 

I sparkle from the rims to the chain to the watch 

To the rings to the ears to the wrists to the glocks 

To the parts in the braids 

Shorties that stop to watch throw on the shades 

Cause Da Brat got gleam for days 

Sunroof open let the sun shine in 

Baking the fuck out of me and all my friends 

In the backseat, stay in the front 

Ain't no room in the trunk 

Just a devastating woofer that bump 

You know!

So So Def is the place and we 

Ain't never gon stop

Nigga we ready for you (We ready!) 



[Da Brat] 

Uh I keep the windows down 

So when I hit the stoplight 

All the niggas standing around spot what they like 

They shoot me the 'Come Here' finger 

But the music's so loud I just smile 

And act like I don't see 'em 

I've done had one or too many shots of Tequila 

But when it's set to crunk I need my liquor 

Loud and rowdy naturally 

Pull up to my truck and smile 

But you ain't proud of me 

I left you in the rearview with a look of disgust 

And a mad mug cause your windows almost bust 

I can't fathom the thought of my seats not rumbling 

And people catching whiplash when I past in front of 'em 

I'm flashy and I don't care if you know 

From the see to the H-I-see-A-G-O 

I'm fresh to death no matter how I'm dressed 

It's even hard for the cops to put me under arrest 

Irresistibly huggable and lovable when 

I gotta wiggle myself out of the trouble I get in 

I'm Da Brat officer he turned and laughed 

And said stop disturbing and got an autograph

Roll up a fat one and pass it around 

Lots of niggas hear the sound now they flagging me down 

Get attention when I drive by cause I'm so fly 

Shorty the pimp represent the West Side of Chi 

Know the haters watching 

I love making 'em sick 

I tear the roof off this mother like Parliament 

People ride with me just to feel the bass in their chest 

And be reminded of how it sounds So So Def 



[JD] 

See what we do other niggas can't 

That's why for ten long years 

I've been making 'em dance 

You know? 

Me and Da Brat it's family boy

I clock the hoes, lock do's and drop the 'bows
I rock the shows; pop lock and knock yo nose
You Bia' Bia', I grab my .44 and mop the flo'
I 'Mop & Glo'; the Feds tryin to stop my dough
They claim they caught me at the docks with a flock of snow
I bring the pain, cock back and swing the thang
Yo' girl mad cause she told me don't even bring the thang
And then I told her, I said it's cool, get at me
And then my voice got raaaassspy
'Cause I was smokin' on some Cali and my eyes was dazed
I was in the zone, coulda thrown up them tre's
And if you lost, Lil' Jon's got some Eastside ways
So stop actin' like a Bia if yo ass ain't blaze

I know he wanna run but he can't he assed out
Punched him in his chin and then he passed out
Woke up with his pockets turned inside-out
Always hit them weak motherfuckaz right in they mouth
You better stay out the way and act like you ain't havin' shit
'Cause niggaz will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch
You little bitch, that's what the callin' you
You'd be a damn fool to act like you ballin' dude
Mindin' yo business, they grabbed you by yo collar
You feel like Marvin Gaye cause they make you wanna holler
But since you can't run, you might as well fight

Gonna see who's life is shortest
Regaurdless this whole world to me is garbage
Tryin' to reap my harvest
I'm starvin' livin a life of ballin'
I'm still tryin' to find my callin'
And make a change, look into my eyes all you see is pain
Look up in the sky all I see is rain, ain't no sunshine
Call me a monkey, but look I got Kay Nine bloodlines
With P-9's and semi-autos, ain't guaranteed tomorrow
Maintain my burrow
I represent the slums, ate the crumbs
Now I'm reachin' for a new height
Nothin' but love and we glued tight
Played and renew sight
Hustlin' for food type

Ain't no tellin' what a bitch will do
For the doe, She'll probably get on four and fuck the crew
Down south, Up north be the same ass bitches
Man locked up but mama watchin' the children
Talkin' bout my neck my back
Bitch you better learn how to chop rocks if you wanna get with Crack
Ughh, I been in love once, at least I though that
till I fucked around and hit a broad back
Got burnt, Now you figure the rest
Dick hurt like I'm pissin' baguettes, now I'm livin' depressed
Should have known better than to trust a hoe
Especially she wanna know how much doe you hold
Cause there ain't too many real bitches
If you got one hold on, don't wanna be nobody's meal ticket
And you know it don't mean shit to me
Cause you know, Bitches ain't shit to me
What

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
You see the problem is them busta ass niggas you been fuckin' with
Always bought ya shit, But never taught ya shit
Did he ever tell you some things that a player do
And made you aware that life is more than a hair dew
Boy I tell ya, Best to deal with them real niggas
And stay far away from fuck niggas
Don't be a sucker, Hell at least not from nothin'
All this suckin' and fuckin' a bitch better have somethin'
I need something that is compatible
Not nothin' young and dumb and full of cum, But one that's edible
I bet a, Nigga like T Double
Get it wetter, Suck and fuck 'em better than the average nigga
I need a girl that's into tryin' things
So I can put it in her mouth, Fa real ain't into mind games
I know she's a mama girl and I'm a street nigga
Once we get together, I'll bet you she'll sleep better

Catch me wit picolo riding on them thangs
Word of mouf there's a drought on the streets
So who ever sitting on them k's is looking at some cheezle
But don't let them boys find out where the safe house is at
And if its where you lay your head, what kinda safe house is that!
You don't deserve to hold weight you deserve to get robbed
Your the first to turn state
Those who got snitched on relate to
No matter what you do heffer damn gon' hate ya
That's just mother nature
Ain't she a mother
I know these bitches named bullets and they loved to date ya
Or better said they love to rape ya
From the bottom to A-town the game is ours now!

[Chorus:]

WHAT WHAT AAAA LETS GO!

I from the land where you name it everything's crooked
Watch what you do 'cause, everything's looking
Man these streets got ears and eyes
And they want to know its all who what when and whyz
So when you see me on them twenty fours spinning
You know the cut me a serious check
But for now I'm still grindin' fiending for a legging
That's some serious shit ya
I'm involved in some serious shit ya
I'm like TI,I'm serious bitch
I'm giving Miami a facelift
Why'all just face it
Don't believe its wrong just taste it

[Chorus:]

WHAT WHAT AAAA LETS GO!

When I came in Mami you know you nasty
Them bitch ass niggaz want to blast me
Still punkn' gettin' crunked off that crunk juice
Hatin' 'cause your girl on me and she hate you
We gotta do nigga what cutlass dropped down on d'z
If you pump it relocate your soul from the streets
Remember me lil g A-town to the O [OOOO]

Get your hatin dawg, my twentyfo's keep spinning

You can do it up and down and round and round
As long as that pussy ain't stiff
Dance and make all the niggaz look at that shit
Like a stripper at a club in the ATL
Lil bitch tore it up and started raisin hell
I remember Magic City before the freakness
Before the police started all the weak shit
All them big hoes, get loose with it
All them skinny hoes, let Bruce Bruce hit it
Let a nigga fuck tonight
Damn right bitch, fuck my wife
You my slut for life
You know all I do, is count that cash

She's so fast she's got a 454 in her ass
You never gonna win that race
Put on a seatbelt and don't let her sit on your face
She might kill you in the morning at 2:14
Doin' the pussy pop like she from New Orleans
It's been a while more than 10 years past
When you close your eyes you can still see her ass
Her momma used to dance like that
Bouncin' that ass with her hands on her back
I saw her grandmomma do it with a baby in her arms
Put her hand on a car and started swingin' it hard
Every nigga at the party want to get with the bitch
Look like she was fucking an invisible dick

You don't have to be naked to dance like a stripper
Just wiggle that tail like your name is flipper
Do it like a dolphin on top of the water
Take it down to the ground and pop it harder
You been hangin' around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin' like in Memphis, Tenn
Get it girl, I like the way you bounce
She must have learned that deep down way in the south
You from the west coast where you learned to do that dance
I'm about to stick my dick through the back of your pants
I wouldn't pass up a chance to grip your cheeks
Fall in that ass and keep me for a week
Now all that booty, is that for me
It's lookin' so fat, we at the party
Lets hit the bar and drink, Tequilla shots
Find a spot on the floor, lemme see it drop

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more
Twerk that monkey lemme see you get low

Jumping out of the Jag
24's still spinning with a dealership tag
Brand New
Bright leather guts and pearl blue
These hoes they choosing like a lucky horseshoe
But that's alright cause I don't pay these hoes no mind
As I stroll to the front of the VIP line
Straight in I go, headed straight to the bar
I got a superstar status, so I guess I'm a star
Haters checking me out
Now tell me what's that about?
I'ma chill to the point haters checking me out
Sipping on the Crystal
Bitches want to get wild
Popping X and smoking dro' on the verge of my style

The Embassy Suites downtown, room 112, my darling
Bring your friends so we can let this party begin
And bring a box of Magnum rubbers so we can fuck till the end

And while she choosing hard, guaranteed I'ma take her
So shake the saltshaker, the dro' is the vapor
I ain't got love for niggaz cause all they try to do is cake her

Why would I trust a bitch?
Always gonna dog a bitch

Or riding on a nigga cock

Sitting on a mill, but I'm pimpin still
Riding round the track, like Goldie in the Mack
Still I'm Don Coreleone pimping hoes from my realm
Mesmerized by the words coming out my mouth
So I'm flushing money quickly out these bitches' bank accounts
After that I bounce
To another ho, in a totally different city
for a whole other show
They say, ""why you don't call?"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
""You always out of town"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
""You probably in the club"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
You bout to make me break your neck, I have to ask your ass again
I'm Don a.k.a ""stay pimpin hard""

Every inch of the verb
Every inch of the curb

Better believe it (please believe it)

Who the fuck is that? it's ice cube motherfucka'
He's a maniac, no I'm a fool motherfucka'
Old school motherfucka', blow through a motherfucka'
What you heard about a nigga so true motherfucka'
See I'm ugly and prettay, I'm polished and grittay
Shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
See, niggas get shittay when I come to their cittay
When I hit the spot that bitch they like, she cummin' with me
Cause I got an ego big as to, but I'm not an eagle
Bitch, I roll with rigo 'cause gangstas don't dance we boogie
I told you motherfuckas kobe didn't take that pussy
Get money, get paid, you can beat that shit
Even if the da is a piece'a shit
Colorado got movatos, don't eat that shit
Another white bitch lyin' on thee black dick
I keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'lacs
Give niggas flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
When I hit the tar mat, it feel like a carjack
Niggas get out and vanish like star treks
So fuckin' incredible, I'm so fuckin' credible
No matter what happen, I'll never turn federal
And that's my report comin' straight from cali

Now we about to show ya how wild it gets
When a girl at the party when she backin' it
Now this girl dance freaky 'cause she passionate
If I ask for some chips, then she stackin' it
She don't need no introduction, she's a diamond of daw
And I don't mean no janitor, the way she mopping the flow
Tattoo on her backs saying 'ready to go'
Man this girl must get pimped away I'm ready too hoe
I'm going to take you out to ghetto girl around the globe
Freaking in the kitchen girl, go somewhere around the stove
In the chumps we chilling in some hotel robes
I put her towels on her body and massage her toes
There ain't nothing like some sex on a Friday night
But then again nothing like some sex in any night
After that gotta go got appointments girl
I'm a doctor, I got other clients girl
Now listen up close, I won't say it again
Skip a dog y'all cat is a man's best friend
Lil' Jon and Luda on the first class flight
From ATL we about to get it crunk tonight
Where we going?

Hey Kelly!
Oh damn! There go expensive Chris
At the bar behind all the most expensive shit
And his car always got the most expensive kit
So his gun always got the most extended clip
Hey! Luda Luda, I'm built to last
Nicknamed double barrel and I'm built to blast
Since your girl ain't a freak, well you gotta convince me
Cause I'm all up in the fifth getting straight Lewinsky
And smoking some of that ""Kill Bill""
Ten Mil motherfucker I'm still trill
Can't party with the women that like it dick
Refuse to cut my hair like Michael Vick
Dirty bird even judges say the birds are dirty
We the reason that the clubs start closing early
Walk up and watch the crowd start moving quick
And I ain't gotta pay the DJ to play my shit

[Chorus]

[Lil' Jon]
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
With the bull pimp cup man I'm sloppy drunk
I don't broke into club it's the king of crunk
Let the anal way find, and and the woofers blow
Throw some ass in my lap and I'm good to go
I spread a shined out bottle, crack a beer
While the ladies are all rubbing my neck and beard
No need to even ask it, who's the boss?
When the dreadlocks slam and the roof come off
The crunk juice got me up all night shit
And in last year making that bite shit
Not an essay calling me Loc De Niro
Stunned with my hell day, Oaklezero
Fresh by the front and I'm ready to play
Got the dog but I knew my had to lie (ok)

90 other time I would say it's over
Since the party so live, I can keep it going
Shit don't stop till six in the morning
Come seven o'clock a nigga still ain't yawning
Baby girl leaving now on her toes
Hangover, wait a minute girl you leaving your clothes
And tickets gonna sell for a major show
If yousa a hater at the booth and the booth is closed
And move out the way I'm a Luda fan
Up north, dirty south, west eastside man

We want to see you shake your booty in the place right now

Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings,

And I'll be settin' separate plays,
So on all these separate days,
Your legs can go they separate ways

Cause I know how to handle your fake ass
I'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash

See you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh

The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
And that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler

And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em
Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest

Owwwwww!!!! yeah! my niggaz 
Throw your hands in the air right now man 
Feel this shit right here! Scott Storch nigga 
Yeah Khalid I see you nigga 
Show Big Pun love! Uh! Yeah! Uh! Yo! 

[Verse 1: Fat Joe] 
I don't give a fuc* about your faults or mishappens nigga 
We from the Bronx, New York, shit happens 
Kids clappin, love to spark the place 
Half the niggaz in the squad got a scar on their face 
It's a cold world and this is ice 
Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life 
Got the Phantom in front of the buildin, Trinity Ave 
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad 
As a young'n - was too much to cope with 
Why you think ? mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit Shoulda been called Armed Robbery 
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny 
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle 
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble 
Came out the gate on some Flow Joe shit 
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo kid! 

[Chorus: Fat Joe] 
Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants 
And do the rockaway, 
now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants 
And do the rockaway, 
now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 
(Come on!) 

[Verse 2: Remy Martin] 
are to the Eazy, M to the Wizzi 
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay fizzi 
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-40-fizzive 
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die 
With a matchin jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion 
My niggaz in the club, but you know they not dancin 
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies 
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies 
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us 
And we - walk around the metal detectors 
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section 
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it 
Said he - liked my necklace, started relaxin 
Now that's what the fuc* I call a chain reaction 
See ""Money Ain't a Thing"" nigga, we still the same niggaz 
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga 

[Repeat Chorus] 

[Verse 3: Fat Joe] 
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now 
And that G4 can fly through any weather now 
See, niggaz get tight when you worth some millions 
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings 
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit 
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit 
If Five-o boy come, then they'd proudly squeal 
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Pharrell 
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya 
These faggot niggaz even made gang signs commercial 
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin it up 
B2K crip walkin like that's what's up! 
Kay keep tellin me to speak about the Rucker 
Matter of fact, I don't want to speak about the Rucker 
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this 
My niggaz didn't have to play to win the championship, come on!

King of Harlem ain't nobody made me leave
Who else could take 5 years off
Cold turkey come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate then its their loss
Come up in the Rucker with all my Jake's on
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Ma$e call em' wanna get their mase on
You hot 16 I'm a very great song
Been beating on the DJ before the Ma$e song
You play Clake Kent you better have your cape on
Plenty homes mansion many rooms

You don't want no problems with the boogie down Bronkster
You don't want no drama with the blond bomber
Original don dotta of the blond bottle
The model from white America
Then Joe the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Ma$e back to represent everything else in between including the
Percentages of the press we don't
The best from each coast
The midwest to the dirty dirty
Even further to Miami
All the way back to Californ-I-a
It would probably be best right now if I warned Dre to get on the horn and
Tell him about the storm coming all our way
So tell him pack grab a gat right now get on the floor I'll wait
Shake that ass a little more my way
But baby I don't dance not that I can't there's a pistol in my pants

Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants

Ayo, Remy pop but i'm hot,
Like an out of state spot,
And any body think i'm not,
You're found in a vacant lot,
You don't really wanna run wit the one chick who smoke dutchess for lunchess,
The castle hill I ain't luncheon,
Now its on it 4 the terror squad, pun, prospect, sunshine, geddy, crack and Remy Ma,
It's the hottest chick, in this game want it,
Mah 16 so mean, put 20 g's and my chain on it,
Quik to flip,
I ain't the average chick,
Im packin' a mac in the back of the 45 pass 6,
And you know I got enough goons to crush a country,
Any dude disrespectin' Pun he better play the run c,
Bring your mans, and then we hands all him,
Then we pull timbaland trample 'em, then we pull the cats in them,
Lean back 'cause I aint ever worry, see I'm forever glory, smackin' up any chick in my territory

Lil Jon,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got

And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks

Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

taken out the game 

And to my brother Kevin Miller  rest in peace fool 



Verse 1 



Growing up in the Calliope  New Orleans to be exact g 

I had to pack a gat I thought somebody was out to kill me 

I'm paranoid I toss and turn in my sleep g 

My best friend done turned into my motherfucking enemy 

19 years old gold fronts and a mean mug 

I hooked up with my little cousin Jimmy 

learned to slang drugs 

A lot of shit done changed in my fucking neighborhood 

This fast cash got the P living no good 

I'm deep up in this shit and ain't no turning back 

Me and my cousin ?? say I got him for a fucking sack 

I told him check his bitch, but he didn't here me though 

He didn't believe that his bitch was out smoking dope 

Now I gotta stand on my own 2 

I came in this world by myself 

that's the way I'm gone die fool 

One year later and my cousin doing life on a case 

I moved to Richmond California just to fucking get away 

Bumped into my partner King from New Orleans 

He couldn't find a job and I'm back to slanging amphetamines 

And everything was cool for a fucking while g 

Til I went to this club and this fool tried me 

We in the back with some bitches counting hundreds 

Til these suckers walked up and said jack 

these niggas from the country 

We didn't have no gats, I had to make a g move 

Connects and head butting, that's how I did this fool 

King G hit this boy with a upper cut 

30 days in the county, but we didn't give a fuck 



(Chorus) 



Anything goes 

Life's a trip, but that's how the game goes 



Hood riding, homicide 4 deep with them gats cocked 

Ready to put some fools on they back 



1, 2, 3 a nigga slanging keys 

but why you have to mess with P 



Hood riding, homicide 4 deep with them gats cocked 

Ready to put some fools on they biggety back 



Verse 2 



Released from the county on a PO 

The only way to get back on my feet is slang that diggety dope 

Hooked up with my partner, my cutty mac 

Two days later I'm back rolling motherfucking black 

Lexus coup with a droptop Benz 

And in the glove compartment you'll find about 33,000 ends 

I ain't tripping cause the game get deep though 

Got a phone call, couldn't sleep bro 

They say my little brother died back in New Orleans 

Pop pop boom and it killed him, here him scream 

But I ain't tripping cause mama still here a cry 

In Richmond one day the P is gonna die 

And if I do I guess I'm going out like a g though 

Like the movie on the motherfucking Untouchables 

So when I go out, I know I'm fucking living wrong 

They betta take me out like fucking Al Capone",Anything Goes [*],2006
Lil Jon,"I've been tryin to call you baby, where you at?
I'm out here on the block thuggin
After this, you ain't gon' have to want for nuttin, ya heard?

I've been waitin' on you, for all night long
Thinkin' 'bout what I'll do when you get home
Boy I'll cook for you, massage you too
And give you that freaky good lovin' if you want me to

[Chorus:Repeat x4]
It's all good shorty, this be the hood shorty
Paradise straight up the road through the wood shorty

Wanna take you to, paradise cause the hood is hot
We done seen so many people in the hood get shot
And I, don't wanna see my baby cry
Anything happen to you I'm down to ride or die
And, I know the kids come first
But I love puttin' money in your Louis Vuitton purse, can you feel me?
Girl you lookin' beautiful
Let's get your nails done, on a plane or a boat
You deserve the finer thangs
Like Jaguars, minks, and diamond rangs
A mansion with a big piano
We can live like the Black Sopranos
They say all good girls love thug niggaz
I guess that's why I'm so in love wit'cha
Let's ride, let's ride
Me and you we can thug to the other side

[Chorus]

I want it, I want it
I really really want it
I'm gonna, put it on ya
So tell me that you want it
I need it, I need it
I really really need it
I'm gonna, put it on ya
So tell me that you want it

Put you in a bubble I Bentley with the matchin' top
Hit the mall shawty, you can shop 'til you drop
I told you I'ma change your world
Designer names, you that kind of girl
Diamond rangs with the Rolex
You need a dress, Liz Claiborne can drop into the pro-jects
You put my name on your body and I'm feelin' that
You told me never let the hood hold you back
You was there when I needed ya
Now, I don't mind {?} pleasin' ya
Girl we used to thug together
On the block, even hit the club together
Wakin' up to cool-Aid and Crist'
Now you got the ice the size of Hershey's Kiss
I went to jail, youse the first to come visit
Now I'm home, anythang you want, girl go get it

[Chorus]

I want it, I want it
I really really want it
I'm gonna, put it on ya
So tell me that you want it
I need it, I need it
I really really need it
I'm gonna, put it on ya
So tell me that you want it",It's All Good [*],2006

Lil Jon,"Once again up in that south from my motherfucking mouth
And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Buster me and me's clicks, always making those hits
We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks
Getting in trouble from the sounds of my trunk
And keeping it crunk, keeping it crunk

[Chorus]
(What, What)
Now drop them bozs' on 'em [Repeats]

Nigga bozs' bout to turn out the show
Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

Now right now I want all my hard niggas to follow me, follow me

Read over the dier
Reap while I stay
Getting Rich-ard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away
Cause I got priors
Its hard to stay rollin' when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire
Flyin' down sunset
Motivated to win
Like I ain't won yet
Take shit over
Hell naw I ain't done yet
I L-B-C y'all bringin' that a G boy
Tonight its going down like free fall
Chevy bouncin' up and down like a fuckin' see saw
Trippin' off hate no hee haw
All blacks locs on the loc
Actin' like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to da mean dogg
When I bring it to you
You be like what you mean dog?
Then we go back and forth like its ping pong
Knowin' I should just ring ya bell ding dong
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxes
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors
I'm gone then you suddenly hip hoppin'
Shit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like an m n m
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin' Slim so Shady but ain't talking Eminem
So fuck you him and him
I was gang bangin' before a nigga entered in
No facade I went from the yard to a 3 car garage
To instant manaj's just vintage, relentless
I mean this I promise
No Suge, No Dre, Ida did this regardless
And that's what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucka', this crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin' 40's still a big deal
Ponytail still swanging, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I wont be faded
Nigga! So buzz on that shit
Back flip back to plack shit
Blue red white to black shit
But for the green I send a whole motherfuckin' team to clack shit

The time has come she get a gold medal
I see you in your high heel shoes, stilettos
Tell me where you go mommy, keep a bad chick that's right for some
And I smoke tree so please don't rile me
What I mean when I say I think of you highly
'Cause your body so good, writing out cheques gotta thank my hood
And I won't fail my mission
Seen a video, she a real life vixen
I'm in the fast lane, see my tail lights glisten
Batman man, you can bail like Christian
Yeah I bring the life, but you gotta be willing
Say that new Diplo so appealing

So take a sip of this
I know it's real good
Just move your body now, if it feels good
Turn the bass up, I know they like that
There go shorty now, I'll be right back

Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency
Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency

We get it in and also go dance
I been in and out of her pants
Shorty wanna roll with me with no man
Back to the program, here we gon spend it out, shorty bend it out
Chillin' with Aoki we in the house
Emergency no they heard of me
And shorty on fire in the third degree
She like me, yes we like trees, I rained on her
And she known to keep a clean white-tee
Said I got to keep it brisk like Ice-T,
Coco you can get it if she like me
And we like he, they said we need I.D.
But do you really when you headed to the V.I.P.
More money, more problems yup B.I.G.
You gotta get it how you live before you D.I.E and that's that

Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz,"Once again up in that south from my motherfucking mouth
And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Buster me and me's clicks, always making those hits
We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks
Getting in trouble from the sounds of my trunk
And keeping it crunk, keeping it crunk

[Chorus]
(What, What)
Now drop them bozs' on 'em [Repeats]

Nigga bozs' bout to turn out the show
Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

[Chorus]

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

Triple beams and things and T-Mobile paint ya
Told myself, I need to stop pushin' hop
I need to stop pushin' hop so I can buy a WingStop

Smokin' so much 'dro that our lungs feel like they collapsin'

To blast your punk-ass
And is you bleedin', only to give Satan a damn good

Reason to play with me, look bitch I'm sayin'
You don't listen 'less that tec-9 sprayin' yo' ass
Glass breakin' in your home boy, thinkin' you fast

But y'all don't listen 'less I'm cussin' and bustin' the shit

How come she can't leave home without gettin' cussed out
Every time you get mad, you say get the fuck out

Come by the house and get nasty

Tryin' to reap my harvest
I'm starvin' livin a life of ballin'
I'm still tryin' to find my callin'
And make a change, look into my eyes all you see is pain
Look up in the sky all I see is rain, ain't no sunshine
Call me a monkey, but look I got Kay Nine bloodlines
With P-9's and semi-autos, ain't guaranteed tomorrow
Maintain my burrow
I represent the slums, ate the crumbs
Now I'm reachin' for a new height
Nothin' but love and we glued tight
Played and renew sight

Try to figure me out dawg, I'm light but I'm heavy
Yellow lemonheads in the bessie of the presi'
And yeah, anybody can rock but d-block rock steady (d-block!)
Fed's don't need no warrants 'cause y'all all informants
So I get higher than new york insurance
Try to keep shit clean like florence
Moved on up on the east side 'cause I never lost endurance
And it's all real niggas, if I ever get a license to carry
Shit, that's a license to kill niggas

I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's
I raise tools, make crews make decisions confused
All spectators can say is, ""this lil' nigga's a fool""
A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
Better prove, you niggas pussy as the moulan rouge
So who guardin' who, you know who to you know what
To you know where, goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair
'cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
Now you know I ain't no ?, I got ten folk there
They ain't powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
Got you runnin' for your life without a minute to spare
Catch you dead to the granite, melt the grease in your hair
When I go, them boys is gonna be indecent affair
Guarantee you nah a real nigga breathin' accounted
At your funeral, just your parents and the preacher was there
Hollow, television name-dropper reachin' for help
So I ain't gotta say a word, pimp you beatin' ya'self
You gon' get what you deserve for disrespectin' the game
Any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
When that other man ain't even present
And deny it when somebody ask him about it
That nigga's a lame, you like to lie on the mic
Hide behind fame, I was a g when I came
That's the way I remain

Who besides the egyptian-walker, fuckers have a conniption
My existence persistent to bring foes misfortune
I dassle 'em, like the alderman, billy dee in mahogany, minus the perm
From the tiniest sperm that the mightiest the almighty can muster
Project prophet, chronic blockage gives alzheimer's to youngsters
Amongst them is me, can't remembers my beefs
With who? for what? they screw-face me up, my boo laced me up
Bolinsiaga, flimsy condo with bimbos in south of kalan gro in pimp mode
The inf' glow on his clothes and you know it's over
Hammer hit pin, pin hit shell, from the shell the slug gonna chew ya
Try not to lose me, I try not to lose'ya
Mama say mama sa mu makasa, fly to cuba
To chill with some politi-kill niggas who ill
'cause y'all niggas are losers, don't get comfortable nigga
Say hello to mr. bad guy, get that cash par, I'm the last don
You'll ever know so, here you go y'all can take these thoughts
Anyway I'm chargin' emcees a late fee cost
So when y'all done with my style, please break me off
But never make nas mad just in case cross
'cause ah, lately y'all don't make me happy
To calm my nerve I need the herb gnc don't carry

Who the fuck is that? it's ice cube motherfucka'
He's a maniac, no I'm a fool motherfucka'
Old school motherfucka', blow through a motherfucka'
What you heard about a nigga so true motherfucka'
See I'm ugly and prettay, I'm polished and grittay
Shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
See, niggas get shittay when I come to their cittay
When I hit the spot that bitch they like, she cummin' with me
Cause I got an ego big as to, but I'm not an eagle
Bitch, I roll with rigo 'cause gangstas don't dance we boogie
I told you motherfuckas kobe didn't take that pussy
Get money, get paid, you can beat that shit
Even if the da is a piece'a shit
Colorado got movatos, don't eat that shit
Another white bitch lyin' on thee black dick
I keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'lacs
Give niggas flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
When I hit the tar mat, it feel like a carjack
Niggas get out and vanish like star treks
So fuckin' incredible, I'm so fuckin' credible
No matter what happen, I'll never turn federal
And that's my report comin' straight from cali
Ice cube is the shit on this motherfuckin' grand finale",Grand Finale,2004

If I ask for some chips, then she stackin' it
She don't need no introduction, she's a diamond of daw
And I don't mean no janitor, the way she mopping the flow
Tattoo on her backs saying 'ready to go'
Man this girl must get pimped away I'm ready too hoe
I'm going to take you out to ghetto girl around the globe
Freaking in the kitchen girl, go somewhere around the stove
In the chumps we chilling in some hotel robes
I put her towels on her body and massage her toes
There ain't nothing like some sex on a Friday night
But then again nothing like some sex in any night
After that gotta go got appointments girl
I'm a doctor, I got other clients girl
Now listen up close, I won't say it again
Skip a dog y'all cat is a man's best friend

From ATL we about to get it crunk tonight

Hey Kelly!
Oh damn! There go expensive Chris
At the bar behind all the most expensive shit
And his car always got the most expensive kit
So his gun always got the most extended clip
Hey! Luda Luda, I'm built to last
Nicknamed double barrel and I'm built to blast
Since your girl ain't a freak, well you gotta convince me
Cause I'm all up in the fifth getting straight Lewinsky
And smoking some of that ""Kill Bill""
Ten Mil motherfucker I'm still trill
Can't party with the women that like it dick
Refuse to cut my hair like Michael Vick
Dirty bird even judges say the birds are dirty
We the reason that the clubs start closing early
Walk up and watch the crowd start moving quick
And I ain't gotta pay the DJ to play my shit

[Lil' Jon]
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
With the bull pimp cup man I'm sloppy drunk
I don't broke into club it's the king of crunk
Let the anal way find, and and the woofers blow
Throw some ass in my lap and I'm good to go
I spread a shined out bottle, crack a beer
While the ladies are all rubbing my neck and beard
No need to even ask it, who's the boss?
When the dreadlocks slam and the roof come off
The crunk juice got me up all night shit
And in last year making that bite shit
Not an essay calling me Loc De Niro
Stunned with my hell day, Oaklezero
Fresh by the front and I'm ready to play
Got the dog but I knew my had to lie (ok)

Since the party so live, I can keep it going
Shit don't stop till six in the morning
Come seven o'clock a nigga still ain't yawning
Baby girl leaving now on her toes
Hangover, wait a minute girl you leaving your clothes
And tickets gonna sell for a major show
If yousa a hater at the booth and the booth is closed
And move out the way I'm a Luda fan
Up north, dirty south, west eastside man

Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff

Car grills so big you can cook a steak on

Been beating on the DJ before the Ma$e song
You play Clake Kent you better have your cake on

You don't want no problems with the boogie down Bronkster
You don't want no drama with the blond bomber

Then Joe the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Ma$e back to represent everything else in between including the
Percentages of the press we don't
The best from each coast
The midwest to the dirty dirty
Even further to Miami
All the way back to Californ-I-a
It would probably be best right now if I warned Dre to get on the horn and
Tell him about the storm coming all our way
So tell him pack grab a gat right now get on the floor I'll wait
Shake that ass a little more my way
But baby I don't dance not that I can't there's a pistol in my pants

Took a down south brother to bring your boy out
As the wheel keeps spinning
I can hear Niggars thinking Crack got one hit then he out
No Joey bring them semi's out
Force you and yours to pour a little Henny out
So much rappers acting in the game
I had to tell them put the mic away and run and get your Emmy's out
Lean back mother fucker
This here's a three peat we back at the Rucker
It's good coke crack preach it to your brother
The mic more rap and preach you mother fucker

And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama

I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes

And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping

Second time we storm 'em

They tried to test the man
But the man was really a man
So its the plan

Lil Kal,"[Chorus]
It's my country, you can say what you, wanna say about me
But at the end of the day I'll be countin' my mo-ney
It's like a dream - yeah, it's like a dream - yeah
Cause at the end of the day I'll be countin' my mo-ney

It's the Emzah-A, are-Rzah-Kayah
Like the internet, I am here to stay-ah
Been a long time, I know it's been years
""Oops! I Did it Again"" like Britney Spears
Like +The Matrix+, I Keanu Reeves
Ring around the collar and doo doo on the sleeves
I'm explosive, like, dynamite
I should be on ""Entertainment Tonight""
Or ""Access Hollywood"" or ""Soul Train""
I'm so on fire, I fart propane
Don't use Rogaine, got a head full of hair
'Cause the brother on the mic is so debonair
I'm so cool, the Fonz say ""EYY!""
'Cause I'm the best MC from around my way
Never listen to what haters say
I just stay focused like Kobe in L.A.

[Chorus]

I'ma do it, like I never have done it
Never got drunk and never got blunted
The {?} in my ear, they cost about a hundred
If the record's a hit, you know the Biz spun it
Super educated master rap techniquer
Ill funk freaker every day of the week-ah
Whether it's Kim, Agnes, Monique or Tamika
My unique physique make 'em all weaker and weaker
'Cause I'm hung, like +Mighty Joe Young+
They all get sprung, from the joy that I brung
I drive a Hummer, I'm hot like Donna Summers
I'm one of the first human (rum-a-pum pummers)
No matter what they say, I always sound flyer
Than anyone you heard, or even de-sired
Yes it's me, I'm the Original be-I-Z
M-A-are-K-I with the E

[Chorus]

The beat don't stop 'til everybody's gone
I'm old school like a bag of Bonton
Like the Mary Jane Girls I go ""All Night Long""
Hit you in the head like El Kabong
My style is masculine, far from feminine
I got soul like James Brown and Rakim and them
I don't know what you came to do
I came to rock the house for you
From sunny California to Kalamazoo!
Been rockin' parties since ninety-two
I know you heard that 'Reality Bites'
But I'm +Liver+ than the show called 'Saturday Night'
I stay on, looks like, city lights
Chicks cling on me like ballerina tights
Like Minnie Mouse and Courageous Cat
You can't beat that with a baseball bat!

[Chorus]",Like a Dream,2003
Lil Kal,"This is a story about without a doubt
When I'm done, you will all scream and shout
They always say time is on our side
If it is, why is it a rough ride?
If I could save time or return to the past
I would bring back the good times, hate to last
Like when I was the size of Jay-Z
Back when Ra was still with Eric be	
Remember when friends was friends, and LL had a Benz?
And cell phones and beepers was the new trends?
When Koch was the mayor and Reagan was the Pres?
We listened to what other enemies said

[Chorus]
I wish there was somethin' made, or somethin' designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin' made, or somethin' designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time

I know why'all remember goin' to Great Adventure
On Labor Day on the Beach in Virginia
The beginnin' of the summer, at Jones Beach
When t-shirts, were ten dollars each
Didn't matter if you had a Lex, Beamer or a Benz
As long, as you had room for, all of the friends
Mr. Softee came through, or the Good Humor truck
When ice cream, was less than a buck
If it was up to me and I could turn back the clock
I'd bring Masterdon, Buffy, and Scott LaRock
So please listen to my song and rhyme
If I can turn back the hands of time

[Chorus]

If I could turn time back in a rhyme
I'd bring back Bird, Magic, Jordan in their prime
Remember the days OH, remember the days
When they had the high-top, fade craze
Want back Big Daddy Kane, Fresh Prince and Kid & Play
""Ohhh, what a beautiful day!""
When parties was parties, and clubs was clubs
You could tell the real MC's from all the scrubs
When havin' your own style and originality
And your character and real personality
But I have to go, and off I sign
If I can turn back the hands of time

[Chorus]

I wish there was somethin' made
Bring back Aaliyah! (Jam Master Jay)
I wish there was somethin' made to bring back Biggie and Tupac
I wish there was somethin' made to bring back Scott LaRock
I wish somethin' bad, I wish there was somethin made
to bring back, Left Eye (Barry White)
I wish there was somethin' to bring back my man Dahsil Masterdon
I wish there was somethin' made to bring back my man Keith Cowboy
My man B.O., my man Step from Baltimore
I wish there was somethin' to bring back

They told me I can't talk about ice no more
But they ain't tell me I can't start another fight no more
I get it crunk in the club, niggaz get drunk in the club
When I perform me a hoe, niggaz get jumped in the club
But I'm used to that shit, so it ain't no need to run
And just because you gotta gun don't mean that's the only one
So if you came here to chill nigga, just chill and shit
'cause you ain't gotta act like that I know you feelin' this shit
I bet, I bet I could hit with Juicy, Paul and Banner
I gotta holla at peaches, when I hit Atlanta
'cause I'm fresh and I'm clean, with baugettes in my ring
I got my name on my jersey like I play with that team
I'ma H-Town nigga and we bang (SCREW TAPES!)

Fuck a dollar bill, I live for the slaves that got killed
From the white sheets walkin', snitch nigga talkin'
Dump him in the ditch and let them dogs start barkin'
Like WOOF!, nigga stop beggin' me please
How you gon' walk and talk shit if I blow off yo knees
I'll have ya walkin' like a parrott do, stick foot pussy you
The boys play the law, so I'll kill them holla maker's too

Now I'ma M-Town reppa, like no other
Mask on my face cause I ride undercover

And stick the barrell down ya throat until you start to throw up
When I roll up, it is a hold up
Ain't nothin' funny don't breathe
Cause all I want to hear is ching-ching

Get cocked, leave a nigga shot in the parkin' lot

Lil Keke Da Don,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

*Talking till the End*",Intro,2011
Lil Keke Da Don,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge",Outro,2011

To you I shall forever give thanks like a billion

Going at the head is like hair and a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the stone

Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
F*** with me, I will peel like the house's pain
Let's go, n****s don't see me cause I'm better than both
The only time I will depend is when I'm seventy years old
That's when I can't hold my s*** within so I s*** on myself
'Cause I'm so sick and tired of s***ting on everybody else
I'm tryna tell you like I saying something

Let the motion of your body be the key, 'cause we
be the motherfucking G Funk family
Now, I'll play the G in this deadly game
Snoop Dogg is the name Dogg Pound's the game
If it ain't one thing it's a motherfucking nother
Word to my granny and my daddy, and my mother
Whether standing on the corner, or bouncing in the six-deuce
When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose
Cause back in the days, on the side where it's at
A nigga had to have a fat stack
And I was a fool, don't make me have to grab my strap and go
rat-tat-tat-tat, nigga slap to a motherfucker face he fall
Can't none of y'all niggaz see the Doggy Dogg
Cause I'm one rude bwoy comin with the wickedness
So shut the fuck up, and listen while I'm kickin this

Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)

Now you can look to the Sun, and spot the moon
And see Snoop Doggy Dogg step into the room
With the G funk, he funk, she funk, we funk
Follow me, follow me, listen to the words that a nigga,
I come down with the wickedness
One rude bwoy comin with the darkness (blam!)
Close your eyes 'cause you can't see me
I quit school cause of recess you fuckin B.G.
I'm shaking up the party, like Lodi Dodi
Is he the dopest? Ya better ask somebody
When, then, send, some gin
And a pack of zig zags now let the games begin
In nineteen-motherfucking-ninety-three
I'm fucking up every nigga known in the industry
Check this out, it's a Dogg Pound thing
You know who I am you know my motherfucking name, who am I?
(The S-N-Double-O-P) nickname (Silky Smell) last name (D-O-double-G)
The behavior and the flavor that I found
Makes me want to hit that ass up with the Dogg Pound

Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)

Now just back up, don't act up, I pack up much heat
Any battle I'm in, I win, I can't be beat
Don't sleep while I creep peep out my technique
I forgot, I'm out of sight so you can't see the
MC of the year, you hear and you fear
i got something for them niggas in the front and the rear
I handle the sides, did a drive-by in the who-ride
I'm satisfied now everything is really alright
You know when I come nigga I come wicked
Don't need no permission, motherfucker I'ma kick it
Niggas sweat my shit I wet em up with the biscuit
Lick em up shot, it don't stop, till them all drop
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks
Just stop, rotting on the next niggas jock
I'm strapped with my glock on your block
And ready to let loose on the first imitator that I spot

Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)",Pump Pump,1993
Lil Malik,"Now... who got the beat that makes ya bump? 
And who got the bump that ya thump? 
Well, I got the funk that makes ya bump 
So we gon funk this motherfucker right on up 
Well here's a toast to the boogie while I step on in 
So put your lighters in the air and let the smoke kick in 
I got the motion, the potion 
And once hit the groove everything is in motion 
We coastin through the neighborhood and lookin around 
And all of my homies on lock down, we keep it underground 
Man, I done found the only way to put mine down is to dip, skip with the homies from the Dogg Pound 
Sup, Bow-Wow, how my nigga feelin? 
Oh, I'm on the money mission to get a pocket full of millions 
Like Sicilians, we do it mafioso 
Doggy style, Dogg Pound, Death Row is the logo 
I do it by my lonely cause I'm true to the code 
Plus I die with the homies cause that's all I really know 
Who started with me, who departed with me 
Through thick and thin we heartless-ass G's 
Regardless, let's see with biphocles, let's try the locals 
And why'all wonder why they despise my vocals 
I fooled you like crystals, rap spittin like lips do 
When I dismiss you, me and my click, fool 

[Chorus:] 
May I (may... I), may I funk with you? 
(repeat x4) 
To be a high rolla, you need a pistola 
And about a half a key of some Coca Cola 
Now that I got older, I got a little colder 
And I don't trip to get a chip off my nigga's shoulder 
Million dreams of a gangsta, being like Cagney 
A bowlie for Snoop Doggy 
Ain't no follow-up, man, I'm a general, so when I put it down I gots to be so orignal 
I'm quick to bust, just like Daz Dillinger 
But that's the little homie, I'm the big homie, Snoop Don Corleone 
Spit three words up in lightning 
As long as I'm bouncin with this I know you like it 
Fo' sho tho, you can't take my fo-do' 
I'm layin around in the DPG in a grey photo 
Get pushed around downtown in the back of a car 
The Double are from the Durwood store 

[Chorus:] 
Well in verse three, the worst see? 
After part two, know when I stop the clock there be a heart, too 
And just the two of us, gonna show you how we do, 
I thought you knew we bust 
I demolish, stay polished, no time to rust 
No dividing, multiplying cause it's never too much, like Luthor 
Cause ya see ain't no loser 
that can get the scoop on the supa-dupa Snoop 
I refuse the tactics, you ain't used to drastics 
I choose to mash like Land Cruisers 
You know I isn't the bomb digga-dee, bomb-beeze 
They can't get with the D-O double G 
You no MC slash master of ceramonies 
Runnin thangs, pullin strings callin Snoop pesky 
Lesson, blessin', stressin' manifest me 
Don't want to test me, I'm guaranteed to let it rest, see?
