II Loc,"Damn. 
I'm broke. 
My feet hurt. 
(Inside the mind of a car jacker) 
And that bitch is slippin'. 
It makes me wanna, creep. 
It makes me wanna, creep. 

Damn  I'm such a G it's pathetic 
Here comes the big headed 
Nigga that's dippin' 
Sippin' on Courvoisier 
Goddamn I must havta floss today 
Now pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary 
So I'm chasin' bitches like Tom chased Jerry 
I'll put the pedal to the flo-uh 
In my two-tone Ford Explo-uh 
You know how it's done 
Sounds bumpin 
Ain't that somethin'? 
Jumped on the 110 
She's flyin' in the Blazer 
Like ""Go Speed Racer"" 
But I ain't gonna chase her 
Like Racer X 
But I won't flex 
Til it's time to have sex 
So when you want to get together? 
Cause you know a nigga like me 
Is down for whatever 

And I'm down for whatever 

When I was little I didn't want to be like Mike 
I wanted to be like Ike 
Cause 
Papa Was A Rolling Stone in the sixties 
And he liked green like Bill Bixby 
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty 
Pokets never skinny 
Played let's get it on in the living room 
And hwne he gets drunk you better give him room
Cause he'll turn the party out sayin', ""This is my motherfuckin' house"" 
And y'all gots to go 
Through the door 
And if you can't find the door 
He'll help you with the four-four 
Talkin' much shit on the grass 
And straight down to blast 
I'm still in my p.j.'s 
He's in a turtleneck sweater 
And we down for whatever 

And I'm down 
Solid Pro is down for whatever 
The Don Jaguar is down for whatever 
And it don't seem to stop 

Now 
I don't talk a lot of shit 
But when it's time to get busy with these hos, let's go 
Cause I'd rather see a skinhead dead 
Then my niggas wearin' blue or red 
Cause I got the gift 
To hit these hos swift 
And I'm smellin' like a fifth 
Of somethin'
Yeah, that's right 
I'm standin' in the store 
Koreans 
Act so nice 
Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells 
Doughnut
And you know what? 
I'm Cool Like That like Digable Planets 
But don't take a nigga for granted 
Cause whether it's a verdict of the L.A. four 
You just don't know 
That this rappin'-ass nigga will change with the weather 
And be down for whatever 

And I'm down 
Creep. 
And I'm down for whatever 

Ice Cube, devoid of pop 
And I will never dance for you trick-ass niggas 

It makes me wanna, creep. 
It makes me wanna, creep.",Down for Whatever,2004
II Nations,"And we ride all through the night
You can't find no sleep tonight
In the end, where we begun
Hardly healed, too far to run
Over anybody new
Like a child
I'm holding on to you

I'm holding on to you

This familiar getaway
echoes of our yesterday
After everything we need
Left in distant memories
And there's nothing we can't lose
Like a child
I'm holding on to you",Papercuts,2015
II Sense,"Look what you're doin' to me
I'm utterly at your whim all of my defenses down
Your camera looks through me with it's X-ray visions
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in the circuity

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down
Automatic, automatic

What is this madness that makes my motor run
My legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command

My hands perspire and shake like a leaf
Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure, they tell me

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down
Automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic

Look what you're doin' to me
I'm utterly at your whim all of my defenses down
Your camera looks through me with it's X-ray visions
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in the circuity

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down
No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

II Tru,"[Jhaz]
Now if you feel me, just let me know
Put your hands way up in the air, and holler ""Ho!""
It's new breed of female kickin' the Northcoast flavor
Rhymes that'll fade ya
Listen close to save ya
Well it's the new era
Now, check my Northcoast side
Everybody hollerin' ""Cleveland"" all of a sudden now
Down with the Northcoast, they said from the beginnin'
Even though I know they just caught on, see I done ?
Bumpin' comin' from downtown on my way to the Clair
Northcoast playas steadily puttin' it in the air

[Brina]
Clair's makin' paper
Cleveland bum rushin' the industry's map
Door's sittin' wide open for us trues
Comin' through with the Mo Thug camp
Many skills'll get ya hands in the air, bobbin' your head
Guaranteed to split that wig up
Females makin' moves from the Land
Puttin' it down for the radio
Northcoast comin' up
A sista done told you exactly what's 'bout to go down
Two trues, they takin' over

[Hook: Jhaz]
Now if you feel me, just let me know
Put your hands way up in the air, and holler ""Ho!""
It's the new breed of female kickin' the Northcoast flavor
Rhymes that'll fade ya
Listen close to save ya
See this here click?
We gon' get the sales the most
'Cause we be mighty Mo Thug comin' at ya from Northcoast

Are you ready?
'Cause we ready...

(Hook)

[Brina]
We all about flexin' styles
it's a twenty-four seven rap vibe
Northcoast, follow me on this journey
I'll make it a hell ride
For your, bump II Tru all you want, your CD changin'
Roll through the hood, get smokin', livin' it up
In the streets, they play us
Mistake us for bein' soft on the physical, but I still throw blows
Females respected
Whatyou expect comin' from the Northcoast? 

[Jhaz]
You see we roll gold ones, flex with big diamonds
St. Clair, Cleveland on the map
That's how find us - blazin'
Steadily comin' up with new tracks
Even the haters be bobbin'
Talkin' this just 'cause they beats phat
Expert females with the beams
So listen close: this is how we be kickin' it
Come on up to the Northcoast

[Brina]
In Cleveland, see the ""Heart of It All"" known to be off the hook
Nightclubs showin' trues much love - every night get booked
Parlay all through Ohio
Roll deep with the Mo Thug family - nothin' but representers
Makin' it known up in this industry
Feel me, tape sales on the rise
And nationwide support for the North
Competition gettin' nothin'
Better withdraw yourself from this sport

Are you ready?
'Cause we're ready

(Hook)

[haz]
Now we can smoke blunts with Optimos or Swishers
It don't matter
A little Hennessy, bet not step to me, 'cause I be badder
And I gets madder when punks choose
Out of all the many Mo Thugs, they want to test us trues
But see they still lose, take you for whatever you want
We got the pump for your trunk, so ain't no doubtin' us pros

[Brina]
Beatin' you down in the Northcoast, dog
Brina puttin' it down, comin' from the Land
Styles to make a fortune
Got you wide open
Feel this clan of intelligent ballers
Can't stop us from clockin' them dollars
'Cause we can create some of them scripts
That'll make you realize who got the power
Up in this rap game, Cleveland rippin' these charts to pieces
Any doubt in your mind, competition ain't ready for the female sistas

[Jhaz]
And we givin' out shots to all the hoods in the Land, even suburbs
They caught you trippin', but we ain't shady, man
And you know, all of St. Clair got love
'Cause that's where all of my peoples choose to thug
And, yeah, I be braggin', but Jhaz tend to boast
But a sista put it down in the Land for the Northcoast

Are you ready?
'Cause we're ready...

(Hook)
I want to get high, so high

[Brina]
Nigga, first thing in morning 'fore I even get up
I gots to start off my day to a fat-ass blunt
Step out the house on the get-high-creep
'Cause when I'm good and fucked-up
I'm a smash some peeps, and ain't nothin'
Like smokin' when you're a fool
Find the next, get a hot spot, jump in it 'til ya pull
Ridin' on the Clair, 'cause over there they can smoke it
And while I'm on the topic
Here's a shot to all that know me

(Hook)
[Krayzie]
Smoke, smoke, smoke
Smoke up the whole thing, better believe it
That's how we get weeded, so nigga
Quit tryin' to budget your but
'Cause it's a whole lot of thugs and niggas gettin' high
So don't go smoke a blunt, and you got a ounce in the ride
Nigga, come off that reefer, 'cause I go broke everytime
Indo slow blowin' my mind
Still I proceed to hit that shit - it's wicked, sticky
Smoke one with your thugsta, thugsta
And show me you can smoke with the thugs
Because I'm gonna get you high
If you want to get higher, come ride
I will fly you

[Jhaz]
? puff, 'cause really it ain't ?
Ain't wastin' no herb by lettin' it burn, let me hit that sticky
Nothin' but the Moet in my cup, the sticky packed in the blunt
My cap is too thick, so I'm constantly blazin' another blunt up
We smokes all day, when the sticky runs out
Gotta roll to the hood for a stress sack
Gotta get that blaze on still, gotta keep them wig-splittin' back
Bump these hardest tracks, rappin' on the album of the century
They the thugs that got it before these trues make moves
And history, strictly on a mission to have a good time
Freestyles and rhymes, smoke dimes
Shots out to any true that gotta bag of this here, now

[Layzie]
Oh, how I love my green leaves, nigga
Givin' nothin' but respect, and I really ain't picky
I fuck with the stress, but I got four-fifty on the best weed
Tonight, we gettin' higher than high, let's all get lifted
P.O.D.'ded and tweeded, that indo needs to be seedless
So you know I'm fiendin', now am I wrong for smokin' this on 'til the dawn?
? in infamy done brought me back the bomb, and it's on
So what I'm a do is I'm a twist it up and hit the sticky for you
Smoke and choke with II Tru - they keepin' it platinum
Makin' it happen for the Land, smokin' and movin' as we speak
Tryin' to teach the world to be a thug in harmony
Nigga, we keepin' the bomb-ass weed
Blaze it up, nigga, what?
Mo Thugs is 'bout the music and bud, equal love

[Jhaz]
Can I blaze, man?
Pass me the Swisha, Optimo, Philly Blunt, or the House of Windsor
Twist ya head back, snap, crack, inhale the smoke
Then, pass it to the left, so the next man can toke
Loc, homie, I'm cool on that water
Just bring that sticky and this drink, do me fine, playa partner
Miss bitch the shit, 'cause you can't smoke for free
And naw, smokin' weed don't make a sister horny
Ignore the silly ones
Keep on thuggin' for life
Place the lighter to my blunt, 'cause it's time to get high

[Krayzie]
Call up my family, let 'em know the reason I blow
Celebration, we done slapped the platinum back at you hoes
So, you know it's on (it's on)
So, how my niggas had to show me, homie
I'm fucked-up 'til the morning sunlight
Lick and twist another Swisha soon as I get up
And then right after breakfast puff another
Fucked-up
Wonder if it's good for my health
'Cause ain't known a muthafucka that done O.D.'d on weed yet
So, bring your blunts and some Hen and some herb
My nigga, fuck what ya heard
My Mo Thug niggas splurge

[Brina]
Better learn to ? mo, much love
Got thousands from Cleveland to Cali
That's how we roll, follow 'em
Once humongous blow up even more, when we crash the show
We shuts 'em down underground, clown from town to town
Bring a box of fifty House of Windsors
We about to blaze this pound of the real sticky
Bum rush in my lungs with a cloud of smoke, puff 'em
'Bout ready to exhale before me mind blow
E-Z Wider, Swisha, or Philly, don't matter really
'Cause it smoke the same
You know the procedure: two hits, then pass to the left when we blazin'
All my trues who toke and roll in the Clair all day long
We some representers, bumpin' on these here thug songs

So you better change your location

[Tombstone]
Mo Thug be the love
Slug for the perfect picture
Chronic bud to save your struggles
So somebody suffer, scriptures
Time to rip ya, hit ya really good
I'll split ya, ditch ya
Gotta put ya in my hall of flames
And damn, it's shame
Listen up tight you can hear the storm, it's a hurricane
Bone, II Tru, Hustla'z, and Shifters (We are the soldiers!)
Bustas, no need to be runnin' from trues
Sucka, get murdered with skills
The ? to peel ya, straight up from infantry
Wars begin, we done sayin' they playin' to win
But we got it all within
So roll with the sheets, 'cause the thugs, they creep
Go and step on the ? with the midnight streets
Where they playin' for keeps, so fake soldiers...

[Mo! Hart]
Late hours of the eve
Now brothas out schemin'
Tryin' to break your heart
Gotta alleviate the problem before it even start
Sit relax and never losin' my composure
Brotha done told ya, better beware
'Cause this Mo Thug click got plenty of soldiers
Just open your eyes and realize
It's gonna be Mo Thug 'til I die
Never esitate don't flip
I can pin you all in them disguises
So if you want to come test
Definite action must proceed
But before it goes down
I gots to alert the rest of my family

[Jhaz]
why'all want no lovin' to a sister flowin'
Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

[Souljah Boy:]
It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em
Make me had to do a one-eighty-seven (one eighty-seven)
With a MAC-10, reactin' like you really want to know what's happenin'
Down with buckin' why'all with me strap and best a be duckin'
'Cause I'm blastin' real fast when I see fake-ass O.G.'s

[Ken Dawg]
I'm ridin' real; Mo Thug is where I be
I'm down with Ken
So put 'em up as I cock the pistols
Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

[Tony Tone]
It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off
So many want to roll, but don't know how we stroll
They never know we're good go
So let's make our dough, for sure

Let a sista nip this in the bud
You can't face me, this playa
Hell of a rhyme, sayin' these family scriptures
The last to remain by sneakin' up on you, backdoor

Like I told ya we need peace (Dear Lord, can you help me?)

But ain't no soldiers, this lunatic get the chrome
Now they get gone (on the dark
'cause the gat flipped) with them roll
And handlin' them demons makin' me crazy
Knowin' that Gates can't be fucked with
When I'm swangin' them thangs

Now what you gonna do when that won't get better, man?
You playin' within the game
That's why we done train and prayin' everyday
Family never divided
You heard it before, but this time you can buy
Some bustas fell off, we leave 'em behind
I'm mean we tried, but they could not fall in line
So this is what we've done, hell: eliminated haters, every one
Keepin' it real, makin' a mill
How do you feel? (I just want a mill, mill)

Don't you wonder why niggas that hate me die?
With my family multiply
Scriptures be puttin up the tracks
Takin' a journey deep on the darkside
If you want fuck with
You better have the heart to handle the pressure

My Lord will stand and hold in his hand a light at the river for me

To this deep silent river I have come on my knees 
I'm afraid for I know I've sinned
But the beckoning light leads me on through the night
To the waters where my soul may be cleansed

Repeat chorus 

I can hear His voice saying come unto me 
Dip your wings in the misty tide
Then we'll pass o'er deep and you'll never more weep
In your home on the other side 

Repeat chorus ",Light at the River,2002
iiO,"I'd wake up, and make love to you if i had you
I would touch you so much, but I'm not allowed to
What I hate is to wait, but in this case I'm patient
I'm discreet, I'm not weak, I just need the moment

He wants me, he wants me not
I want everything he's got
If I leaned over and tried to kiss you
Would I be wrong, after so long to kiss you

Would you pretend, we're only friends, if I kissed you
At least I can dream of you in a scene, when I'd kiss you
On one hand, we are friends, but still my mind wanders
Through side streets and alleys, I just keep growing fonder

To stop me is not easy, can't stop a lion from hunting
I'm focused, I won't miss, there's no control of some things",Kiss You,

I lose my mind 
But when you're around, I take for granted

And sometimes I'm out of control 
Baby, you know how I am, at the end, you're always mine

But I need you, I can show you 
Just let me be when I'm crazy, 
At the end you're still my only.

You got my heart. 
When you come back, I just want to kiss you

Password
Am I paralyzed?
Cause I need you ever after

Why are you holding your breath in an ocean
Where the abyss is infinitely deep
Skiing mountains dangerously steep

Collecting all the dainty roses
Envisioning the one who proposes
I pray your garden's always filled with seeds
That it's not bothered by the stem of the weed

You keep your jewels in a safe
And only one set of keys
Careful to only bestow
The one who gets on his knees

You're confusing lust for love
Learn it will be gone
Don't believe in what is wrong

Keep your eyes open

No! They're so different
Only love remains

Lust is all a game
Once you learn the truth
All will come to you
Chastity, I hope you're listening

The point I'm making is the one you're missing
I'm only telling you so that you don't have to
Make the decisions that I once had to
I'm not a preacher who has practiced

I'm not a teacher but you are still an apprentice
My only fault is that I see this view
You're not guilty, you're beyond your youth
If you're not prepared for this ride

I say you should close your eyes
These fields of no innocence
You couldn't bare this blackened side

In a city where the walls are filled with sound
Basting off the floors
Listening to your own thumping in the bass

The wizards play sirens
People march, some chant with the sound
A lot of the tourists are smaller then their shell
Funny they forget how small they really are in that grand city
Some even forget where they came from

The gatekeepers, they don't own the key
They're merely robots that depending on how they feel on that day
Extend their arms to remove and replace
The rope that let's the quest in and out

Fill it with adrenaline
Medals made of gold not
silver
Challenge the races that
others can't win
Audit me, however you may

never pronounce
Wild-child like you

Young reckless offspring
That's out of control
Blasting me up
Up... up... I go
Rebel, Am I?
Who... me? Oh no...
That's how a rebel

While all the others
tweak
That's how a rebel walks
While all the others talk

Gotta jump in, no wetting
your feet
Lead in ferocious

Of the incense fills the room
Roll the curtains, welcome

Slip my veil off, as our eyes

Notice
How the slippery lips will
Cross

Now... Don't stop now... Don't
Stop now

Teasing
Slowly pleasing, gentle

Consumed in
All of you and your
Demands

iiO,"Sometimes it's all about you
Sometimes it's all about me
And everything that we see
Is what we want it to be

If it's all a theory
Can you tell me clearly
What it is exactly
That you still won't tell me

What I need is a story
Even if it's just a story
What a way, what a day
To walk away

What a way, what a day
To walk away
I stood waiting for it
For an end I almost knew

Counting every moment
Isn't patience a virtue?
But if I held my breath
I would've fainted so fast

If I crossed my fingers
It'd be too long to hold back
There was the slide that I saw
A love without any flaws

But there is no such thing
It's a gold you can't touch
I'll stay waiting for it
I'll put all my time on break

Until I see the full page

They even wonder why and how I'm looking so well

While others question right down to my own religion

I'm a levi I fear Jah and live
Whether rain or sunshine

Holy from the wombs of the early morning spring
Thou art the dew of Thy youth Jah Jah say Jah
Thou art the rod of the strength out of Mount Zion
Sit theyself down at thy right hand children
And I will make you rule right round the midst of the heathen

Meet me face to face in Isaiah chapter 45

Oh Israel don't you judge condemn another man
Only yesterday while I was a child

Funny how love can change a man
I man baptised Serfie Selassie
I'm the sword of the Trinity
Unto all tribe I'm still the Levi
Why the personality
Towards the same Jah glory

That how for my spirit flows
There in distant regions
While in my spiritual searching
I found the true tree of life within my mouth
And this I have to share with
Friends and strangers no doubt
I hear distant sound
And I write to what is found
I tongue is like a pen of a ready writer
I only speak of things
Pertaining to my Jah and Kings
And of the life of Him
Of whom all things and I dwell and live in

He said blessed are the pure in spirit
RASTAFARI
For theirs is the Kingdom of Zion
The dwelling of my Father's pavillions
Blessed are they that mourn
RASTAFARI
For they shall be comforted
Within the devineness of my Father's hands
Blessed are the meek
For they shall inherite the earth
And possess the heathen under their humble feet
Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness
For they shall be filled with such spiritual blessing
I am I am I am I am what thou sayest that I am
That is what I am


Blessed is the man that walketh
Not in the council of the ungodly
Nor standeth in the ways of sinners
Nor sitteth in the seats of the scornful
WHAT I AM
But his delight is in the Lord
IS WHAT I AM

And in his law do I am Serfie Selassie
Meditate all the days of my life continually

Zion Hut Chapter 2

I often sit alone within my wildertones
Watching my father designings
Whithin the lights on the clouds
Exploring I gloriest heavens
Within Jah signs in my silence
Receiving my Fathers blessings within His own times
I acknownledge all things only unto Him
For His given power I find I'm solid bound
Day unto day utter speeches in many places
While nights unto nights showeth He I His knowledge
For the goodness of myself in whom I'm all well paid
I am I am I am
What thou seest that I am
That is what I am What I am

Jah is love Oh love let Him be love

For they shall obtain mercy
And be the saints for everlasting
Blessed are the pure in heart
For they shall see Jah
In earth as it is Mount Zion
Blessed are the peace makers
For they shall be called

Blessed are they which persecute
For righteousness' sake
For theirs is the Kingdom of Mount Zion

Planted by the river of waters
That bringeth forth his fruit in his season

To be done, it's no fun
Bring forth your potions sistrens and bredrens
I believe that heaven's now come
Let's not tore he, 'cause her hurt is ready
Something has got to be done

I said the earth need some moulding
I'm gonna dig and dig some holes in
And bring forth some fruits, oh Lord
Trees bearing fruits
The earth need some moulding
Let's bring forth some fruits, oh Lord
Trees bearing fruits

Said I'm planting some seeds with the singers
Still a chance speak louder than words
To all players of instruments
That only for desire the talent is given
Responsability we must carry
Help those who cannot help themselves
To build in solid foundation

I said the earth need some moulding
I'm gonna dig and dig some holes in
And bring forth some fruits, oh Lord
Trees bearing fruits
I said the earth need some moulding
I'm sending out the warning
Just laugh the rainbow
The cover not that show...

Oh moulding...
Oh moulding...
Oh moulding...

It's not the thing you talk over with friends
You never see it coming until it begins

But something stepped in between us
It's taken all of our time alone
In her heart love remains, but is seldom shown

So why does she cry herself to sleep at night?
Why do I have to work so hard to make things right?
To fall in love came naturally
To make it last is so hard, you see
I'm caught in between the two sides of love

A kiss goodbye, a kiss hello 
You wonder why she get's lonely
You've got to show her, don't tell her
She's your one and only, yeah

So why does she cry herself to sleep at night?
Why do I have to work so hard to make things right?
To fall in love came naturally
To make it last is so hard, you see
I'm caught in between the two sides of love

We make promises, promises
And late at night you make big plans
Someday we'll run away and leave the love demands, yeah

So why does she cry herself to sleep at night?
Why do I have to work so hard to make things right?
To fall in love came naturally

Because I walk in His gladness
On His merry merry road
I've got to carry Jah heavy load
I've got to back up myself
Against false evidence
I've got to carry Jah heavy load
I've got to pick up where them say
Jah Jah left off and gone
I have to carry Jah heavy heavy load

in my meditation when I reason with Him
Clearly in my visions of dreams
He reason with me
I feel Jah Jah heartically
Oh I know what I do believe
I believe in Jah-Jah truth and rights


I've got to carry Jah heavy load OH
I've got to carry Jah heavy load OH


This rumour situation that is spreading across the nation
Trying to dim the lights
Been precious in my Father sight
Saying that Rasta Father
Trodding this earth no longer
But in Zion is my Father's Throne
And I know the earth is his foot stool


I've got to carry Jah heavy load OH
I've got to carry Jah heavy load OH

I said its heavy every day OH

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""

When I would want to love some one

And these are the words he said to me

One of these days you're going to reach eighteen
And all the boys ya see is gonna call ya a queen
You'll smile, and blush, and hold your head up high
But the same little boys will make you cry
So the best thing to do when you reach this age
Is to be a good girl, remember what I say

You make 'em wait, and pick your dates
Woah oh make 'em wait, pick your dates
Before you make a big mistake

You know when true love comes your way
There won't be much that you will say
He'll walk right up and take you by your hand
And he'll lead you right straight to the preacher man
So the best thing to do when you reach this age
Is to be a good girl, remember what I say

You make 'em wait, and pick your dates
Woah oh make 'em wait, pick your dates
Before you make a big mistake

Just because they treat you nice
Doesn't mean they want a wife
Take your time, pick your friends
True to love never ends
Though the dog will have his way
In the end you will say
Remember your old father's words
Don't you be no fool now girl

I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beating for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say the more my work gets done

`Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man
Yeah gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me, I love you
Shine a light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine a light shine a light
Shine a light won't you shine a light
Philadelphia freedom I love you, yes I do

If you choose to you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city
Some others choose the good old family home
I like living easy without family ties
Till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

It's easier than learning your A-B-C's,

Come on, baby. Jump up. Jump back. 
Well, now, I think you've got the knack.

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now.

Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control:
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul.
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion.

Ike & Tina Turner,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe,2005

I made my bones shaving Sharon Stones in a school zone
One way ticket from the projects to a pool home
Trapping, balling, and rappin is the hoods holy trinity
I sold a pack 'fore I lost my virginity
Surrounded by speed freaks and weed geeks
Quiet down, listen up when g's speak
Return of the body catcher, the crown's been captured
Caught up in the rapture, I slaughtered a bunch of rappers
Ain't no Tarzan in the marshland
Fumes from the meth cook turn me into the swamp man
Get the red wine out
White lines in Amy Winehouse
Walk fine lines in hindsight
Coulda made some better choices
I didn't always have to listen to the voices
Thug in my bloodline, mud pies and drug buys
The dead live on and love dies

Ill Bill murder futuristic like Paul Laffoley
Haul your casket away
Assassins'll spray
Reptilian like a cannibal's brain
Horrifying like dying in a two-passenger plane
Nosediving, fire in the sky, showers of flame
Houses of pain on cypress hills and mountainous terrain
Even a lion chills after an ounce of sour to the face
I'm the lightning that the Vikings worshipped
The sight of when a rifles bursting
Write subversive
I'm a decisive person
Liquor on a bullet wound, feel the Henny sting
Everything is everything
I'm a Heavy Metal King
Been labeled intelligent, irreverent, malevolent
True indeed, plus a veteran
On point like the Devil's chin
Surrounded by apparitions & statues of smiling death
Assassins with pistols capture your dying breath
Like you stepped into a horror flick
Kill you then resurrect you in the middle of a blizzard of hollow tips

'Cause I weight two hundred pounds
All the girls they love me
'Cause I know my way around

Ike Turner,"Why' know, every now and then 
I think you might like to hear something from us 
Nice and easy 
But there's just one thing 
You see we never ever do nothing 
Nice and easy 
We always do it nice and rough 
So we're gonna take the beginning of this song 
And do it easy 
Then we're gonna do the finish rough 
This is the way we do ""Proud Mary"" 

And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river 
Listen to the story 

I left a good job in the city 
Working for the man every night and day 
And I never lost one minute of sleeping 
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been 

Big wheel keep on turning 
Proud Mary keep on burning 
And we're rolling, rolling 
Rolling on the river 

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis 
Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans 
But I never saw the good side of the city 
Till I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen 

Big wheel keep on turning 
Proud Mary keep on burning 
And we're rolling, rolling 
Rolling on the river 

If you come down to the river 
I bet you gonna find some people who live 
You don't have to worry if you got no money 
People on the river are happy to give",Proud Mary [Encore],2012

If I've done something wrong
I'd take it back

What happened to our happy home

What am I doing here
Wearing your favorite dress
I've tried everything

Ikeman,"[3] - I'm going to vauco in my black seville
I follow two my behind a truck with half a mil
I make my first stop at my homeboys ranch 
I ask him ""what's in the bag"" he says ""two acres of plants
It's easy going in but hell gettin out
I want to make this paper and I think I know how
surprise surprise I done made it back home
in an ice cream truck ""who want to buy a snow cone""
  
Hook - repeat 2X

I'm going to the valley
Vauco the valley
I'm goin to the valley what you think fo
  
[4] - From Texas to Cali we get our ye from the valley
We be hustlin on blocks moving in and out the alley
We call it medicine that's what you need when you get sick
Sometimes it's hard rock sometimes it's white pearl brick
Across, across the state line just me and my girlfriend
From powder to pine I got money on my mind
Stop wasting all my time and get me over to the spot
Unload all the cargo and meet me at the docks
  
[5] - Going back to the valley staying on top of my game
Meeting up wit my bitches snow white and mary jane
Only thing that ever mattered to me 
Stacking dollars shit we making a week
Who the cowards who the killas who's the niggas wit scrilla
Felt all up in they pockets rocking fo' niggas that try to kill us
Then maybe later you bitches bother me 
You wanted to pay you too late don't bother calling me
  
[6] - Going to the valley fo' soldiers in a caddy 
And in the back of the caddy got fifty pound of smally
Tryed to jack but can't catch me
I just keep that paper stacking
Always packin never slacking 
leaving you hoe ass niggas unhappy
Chopping burs when able, fucking hoes on the table
Watching cable in a Sable, Dope House is the label
Selling em three for ten to my closest friends
Rolling back to H-towm big body Benz
  
hook
  
[7] - Houston Texas cowboy wit a dime and a fiesta saddle
And I'm moving mo weight then a whole herd of cattle
I grip up the grain blowing up the panhandle
mobile phone on scramble cause rap hustlin is a gamble
Brick moving these H dudes gonna keep you grooving pursuing
Shit, hell on my surella ice water lyrical good fella
SPM got the hook up, say watch out 
I hit the highway, let twenkies crawl
I'm going to the valley
  
[8] - Man I'm flipping up to Mexico to hit some licks
In a Navigator bus bringing back some bricks
Get to checkpoint now I'm past the border
tell my guy alemar to play some more
Fat money cause we in the mix
I got that white girl and that stinky bitch
Better ryders and roamers can't really ask 
""We going out T?"" ""Bitch I'm headed to the valley
So I'm out about to make some money
Pull up to a trailor wit about 800
Unload it I flip it get paid let's ride
Chunk a deuce to the guys and I'm back to Southside
Cruisin wit a couple of pines
Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house
  
[9] - Cruisin to the valley checking up on me campos
Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops
Flying real low to avoid the cops
Weighing my weed on a digital beam
Wrapping it in a plastic quick so I can make my green
My windows are tinted so nobody sees in it
Wit mary jane and snow white the sky's the limit
  
Hook

[10] - My package is small, stack em in the entire wall
Fuck the chotha must be loca
Everything a nigga want make it to the border wit the motha
Pockets rising better quit sizing me up
But these coffe beans fucking the smell up
What's up, back in the city 
de bull lada I'm talking pronto
Call me the head honcho start a new revloution
like a back poncho 
He yah see yah wouldn't want to be yah
Gots to flee, start the G
Switch the ride I'm headed back to the valley

They want to know what it is all about
They way that we roll down south
Start baby wit dope house josie wells gonna 
there ain't nuthin funna then being and outlaw runna 
stunna pimpin in a humma millennium smuggler
Dope game juggla, no nuts no glory
Real mobsters, they never worry
but we ain't home yet so don't get happy
we ain't paid Officer O'Malley
Thinking of my profits going to the valley 
It's all cavi
  
[12] - I'm flipping to the valley federalies
Fucking wit michael decodie motorcycles
?? cruises my disciples 
I'm the type to crew smoke two and synas
wit my G's I'll hunt you 
like Arnold hunts Sarah Connors
Primadonnas big tymers, playa, and rob reports
benz sports,courts, naked hoes, lascivious resorts
I get short my last resort tell L
to keep the Cali cause little down wit his essays 
parlaying down in the valley

[13] - I'm a creep 59
to the end of the rainbow land of the llello
Dope fiends on my payroll, got rocks to blow
behind the stop and go they holla 
goodness graious great balls of snow
Don't speed or trip when you see the lights
cause they can tell you're nervous just by looking in your eyes
in H-Town the business in booming
but it won't last long if you don't know what you're doing

Got me creepin for mi ruka and my boys blowing swishas

L be's moving by the ton
Packed up in tanks under the trunk, 59 to 77 
Collecting my lot not even sweating, back on 35
wit my cheeder just gettin mine
You know me your boy O-Z
Never left lonely wit out my G see
One trip cocks a flip

The risk is live it to your life, and live this
The dreams oversees the world is yours to for
Take what you can get and pass that on to more people

No snatches, no ranches in Texas and Kansas

And lately I been peepin I been creepin while you sleepin
Instead of seekin like I'm fiend ya for the dope to even keepin it
I'm in a Lincoln thinking throwed cause my homie gets the throwed
Up off the dope, but with a home, sixty G's and twenty fours
Stupid hoes to spit the game, give me the pussy then slang
For your weed and your change and if you bleed then we the same
So we can bust or we can spray, it ain't no trust up in this game
So I'm a jack and I'm a slang and I done tried but I can't change, but..

Iker Gastaminza,"Un 5 de Julio del año 1986
Llego al mundo Bull and Raice
En un pueblo de la costa norte de la isla Corl Carolina
El chamaquito conoció el lado oscuro de la isla
Viendo como los panas se mataban en el cacerio por kilo o por libra
A veces solo por poder o por guía
Y una noche sintió una música en el huesos
Y en su sistema sanguíneo
Y el chamaquito entonces tubo esta misión
Vivir de la música brother no es imposible
Cuando de la música es que deseas vivir

Any solo dream ya vivo en el siglo 25
Mami sin dinero, papi no es precinto
Y yo me acuerdo en las noches me pasaba pensando
Algún día seré rico o moriré tratando

Pero ahora todo es diferente
Ahora le gusto a la gente
El que estaba pichando
(Lo digo mamando)
Su carrera esta en peligro
(Lo digo mamando)

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Tienen que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Y hay que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Ahora no hay break

Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Un 3 de Octubre de 1980 llego al mundo en el seno de una familia humilde
El chamaquito fue criado por una madre soltera
El chamaquito jamas permitió que eso se convirtiera en una dificultad papi
El chamaquito agarro lo mejor que pudo de la experiencia
Y con la música como norte
El chamaquito comprendió si misión en la vida
Que la vida a veces esta llena de depresiones tropicales
Y que never stop five and the level
Y dios no the raith papi
Ahhh

Jaja
Cuando empece en esta cuestión fue sin mirar atrás
Sin saber que el camino es duro pero hay que luchar
Con un entendimiento y mientras canto pasa el tiempo
Veo como mi carrera gira, oh que bien me siento
Ahora se, que lo que cultive ha rendido frutos
En absoluto no fue en vano como lo disfruto
Y solo es el comienzo (Colega me escuchas)
'Toy viajando el mundo entero, intenciones tengo muchas
Muchas puertas que toque, mil estudios visite
Sentía que me quitaba, pero nunca me quite
Y aquí estamos, dos seres humanos que se juntan
Dejando de que hablar, hay muchas preguntas
Gracias al señor por la fuerza que me diste
La madre que me pusiste, la familia y lo que hiciste
Contesto sus preguntas con la dura realidad

And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door

And everything still turns out
Bad, and all your secrets are your own

People saying that you're no good for me,
""Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you""

If you loved me baby you'd deny it,
But you laugh and tell me I should try it,
Tell me I'm a baby, and I don't understand

But you know that I'll forgive you,
Just this once, twice, forever,
'Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back,
Just as long as we're together.
And you do

[Chorus]
I don't want your freedom,
I don't want to play around,
I don't want nobody baby,
Part time love just brings me down.
I don't want your freedom,
Girl, all I want right now is you.

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you
But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once twice forever
'cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together

I give you everything you need

E ripenso a quante volte ho annebbiato i miei pensieri
Con la peste dentro al cuore, a dettarmi le parole

Ho vinto tutto non mi battono neanche nei film
Qua tutti sono il meglio

Si sale senza che ti abbiano eletto
Più grandi sono I sogni, più grandi sono i rischi
Ma porta a casa il risultato prima dei tre fischi
Siamo realisti, volevi meritocrazia non so che dirti
Brindiamo alla follia di giorni tristi
Cin cin la tecnologia ha reso tutti artisti
Ora una foto vale oro più dei dischi
Sì, sì, non c’è democrazia restando zitti
La vittima è la musica
L’accusa l’ha rinchiusa a Sing Sing
Cerco l’accordo fra cuore, cervello e portafoglio
E l’ho già messo in conto, morirò di orgoglio
Fino ad allora fatti un viaggio nel mio mondo

Lo sai, non è importante il come

Marciando verso chissà dove

Questo sono io lo sai
La mia vita non la cambio ormai
Fuori dalle maglie della rete
Nell’anima ho botte date e prese
Questa è la mia identità
Cattiva come la volontà
Di un Padre Nostro senza cieli
Ho messo l’inchiostro nei miei desideri

E puoi bruciare questi soldi tanto con o senza
Mi sveglio ancora tutti i giorni come alla partenza
Come se avessi un’occasione e fosse questa
Finché ho la voce non importa se esce croce o testa
Ho visto le speranze scivolare come anguille
Fra palazzi popolari a schiera con dietro le ville
Cresciuto con la fame di essere uno fra i mille
L’odio sulle papille, il fuoco nelle pupille
Questa musica puntava il dito, Zio Sam
E trovare pace nello sfogo è il mio giardino zen
Lo sa Dio se la vendetta è meglio dell’amore
Spesso un “per sempre” dura un paio d’ore
La vita è arte, rivoluzione
Come farne parte è interpretazione
È la mia visione frate, esci a piedi vieni e vedi
Ma non basta che mi segui serve che ci credi
Non basta che mi segui serve che ci credi

Tensión en aplastar mi ambición
Sigue así ya verás
Mirá el reloj es mucho mas tarde
Que ayer te esperaria otra vez

No lo hare, ya no lo hare
Donde esta nuestro error sin solución
Fuiste tu la culpable o lo fui yo
Ni tu ni nadie, nadie puede cambiarme

Mil campanas suenan en mi corazón
Que dificil es pedir perdón
Ni tu ni nadie, nadie puede cambiarme

Vete de aquí, no me pudieste
Entender yo solo pienso en tu bien
No es necesario mentir
Que fácil es atormentarse
Después, pero sobrevivire

Se que podre sobrevivire
Donde esta nuestro error sin solución
Fuiste tu la culpable o lo fui yo
Ni tu ni nadie, nadie puede cambiarme

Mil campanas suenan en mi corazón
Que difícil es pedir perdón

Ma nascono da sé 
Son le cose che succedono 
Ogni giorno intorno a noi 
Le canzoni basta coglierle 
Ce n'è una anche per te 
Che fai più fatica a vivere 
E non sorridi mai

Le canzoni sono zingare 
E rubano poesie 
Sono inganni come pillole 
Della felicità 
Le canzoni non guariscono 
Amori e malattie 
Ma quel piccolo dolore 
Che l'esistere ci da

Passerà, passerà 
Se un ragazzo e una chitarra sono lì 
Come te, in città 
A guardare questa vita che non va 
Che ci ammazza d'illusioni 
Con l'età delle canzoni 

Passerà su di noi 
Finiremo tutti in banca prima o poi 
Coi perché, i chissà 
E le angosce di una ricca povertà 
A parlare degli amori che non hai 
A cantare una canzone che non sai come fa 
Perché l'hai perduta dentro 
E ti ricordi solamente 
Passerà

In un mondo di automobili 
E di gran velocità 
Per chi arriva sempre ultimo e per chi si dice addio 
Per chi sbatte negli ostacoli della diversità 
Le canzoni sono lucciole 
Che cantano nel buio

Passerà prima o poi 
Questo piccolo dolore che c'è in te 
Che c'è in me, che c'è in noi 
E ci fa sentire come marinai

In balia del vento e della nostalgia 
A cantare una canzone che non sai 
Come fa 
Ma quel piccolo dolore che sia odio, o che sia amore 
Passerà

Passerà (passerà), passerà (passerà)
Anche se farai soltanto la la la 
Passerà, passerà 
E a qualcosa una canzone servirà 
Se il tuo piccolo dolore 
Che sia odio o che sia amore 
Passerà",Passera,2005

La vuelta y crema, andamos disfrazados de unidad fea
Un arresto, te secuestro, y vas de rabo a la candela 

Papi yo me busco el peso, pregúntale a Omi 
Tengo money en par de países, loco un par de Shorties 
Ahora tengo par de pesos en efectivo 
Me mantienen vivos, los billetes se llevan conmigo 

Benjamin es mi mejor amigo, Jackson es mi primo 
Washington mi compadre y fui a la escuela con Lincoln 
Revolucionario como Duarte en Santo Domingo 
I'm a king, en puertorro Luis Muñoz Marín 

Yo siempre he sido un soñador, quise ser compositor 
Luego me convertí en cantautor 
Quería ser un liricista, puñeta artista 
Y me convertí en inversionista 

Al envidioso digo Tranquilo Bobby 
Matarte es mi hobby, en el crotch como Kobe 
Pa' las mujeres soy seguro un orgasmo 
Duro y dulce, me llaman el durazno 

Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos 
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando 
Con un combo de locos que no están jugando 
Andamos sin miedo y por eso 

Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos 
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando 
Con un combo de locos que no están jugando 
Andamos sin miedo y por eso 

Hacen reuniones pa' setiarme, dicen que quieren cazarme 
Mamenme en el bicho, de ninguno voy a dejarme 
Aborrecido, harto de odio, damos fuego con los palos también 
Que pasó? no te gusto? yo no soy un billete de 100 

To' van pal casco, pa' que les de asco a los fiscales 
Te vamos a procesar con los metales (rascabolas) 
Y a los títeres de embuste, diles que hagan los ajustes 
Que andamos borrando hocicos con par de fulles 

Baja al trabajo y otro carro que hoy vamos a desmantelar 
que te pillemos en la avenida en su madre se va a cagar 
Esto no es relajo, lambe bicho, demuestre su hombría 
A sangre fría si te agarro, pa te voy a dejar de día 

Puro malianteo, ya salieron Los Menores 
No riegan veneno, pero papi sin cojones a mi me tienen 
Mucha tormenta es lo que viene 
Con música hija de puta es que Ñengo se mantiene, so cabrón 

Ya estoy manso muchachos o ¿quieres ver como me agacho? 
Le engancho el peine a mi macho y sin pensar te la respacho 
Ustedes son queso con nachos pai dime, ¿tú estás borracho? 
Acho en cualquier sentido te esparracho 

Las pacas y los billetes las he visto en purrucha 
Hago todo lo que quiero, y si no quiero escucharte, ya 
Yo mando a regar la voz, los burros estoy dando dos 
Se te adelanto, lo siento lechón, llegó Navidad 

Jingle bells, el panzón como Santa Claus 
Mi pipa y la glock, siempre sujeta en el calzon 
Bebo date un resbalón, que me has dado la impresión 
Que tu tienes mucho combo, pero no con corazón 

Ya Los Menores salen pa' la calle 
Lo más que suenan en la calle vivo se han quedao' 
Las cosas ya no son iguales 
Y del caserío no salen 

Pa hablarte claro, ustedes están dando asco 
Mientras yo ando por ahí, wheeliando en la moto sin casco 
Millonario, cabrón yo estoy tirao' pa' atras 
Lo que cuesta el carro tuyo, vale un canto de mi Four Track 

Soy el terror de muchos, el chamaquito incorregible 
Él que a los 22 tiene 3 casas y convertibles 
Él favorito de la calle, y del genero el más terrible 
Que entierra a los demonios y a los muertos los revive 

Soy yo, el que la sigue llevando 
Él que le han tirao' la mala y como quiera esta matando 
Él Titerito, el que sigue comandando 
De to' ustedes el más que está facturando

But 알잖아 핑계같아도 하루도
널 잊은 적이 없어 난 알아
알면서도 그래 알면서도
너를 만나는 게 두려웠어
쉽게 바뀌어버린 마음보다 만 배 더
깊게 박혀버린 사랑이란 것도
나도 똑같다고 말할만큼은
아니지만 할만큼은 했어 나
그래야만 했었나 싶어도
되돌리고 싶어도 잘가 Good bye

Alzarsi a mezzogiorno e non dover incontrare ogni mattina un caporeparto

E scendere in piazza a bere un caffè
Comprare un quotidiano
Per conoscere gli ultimi scandali del paese che
Non cambia, non cambia, non cambia, non cambia, non cambia, non cambia mai

Let’s take a low cost flight and low profile sneak away from them all
Fuggire da Varese sbadigliando aperitivi
Scappare da Caserta a gambe levate
Andare a quel paese dall’altro capo del mondo dove il cielo non finisce mai
Dove l’oceano in tempesta è così bello, che fa paura guardarti neglio occhi
E dirti che ti amo ancora, forse più di prima, amica mia
Scappiamo via da un paese che non cambia, perché non vuole cambiare
Non cambia perché non vuole

Non cambia, non cambia, non cambia, non cambia, non cambia
Non cambia, non cambia, non cambia, non cambia

Ma sì, certo, ma sì, come no
Potrebbe andare peggio
Che ne so io
Potrebbe piovere

Per questo canto e canto te
È stato tanto grande e ormai non sa morire
Per questo canto, e canto te, canto te
Per questo canto, e canto te",Canzone per te [2015 Version] [Version],2015
Il Volo,"Chiudo gli occhi e penso a lei
Il profumo dolce della pelle sua
E' una voce dentro che mi sta portando dove nasce il sole
Sole sono le parole
Ma se vanno scritte tutto può cambiare
Senza più timore te lo voglio urlare questo grande amore

Amore, solo amore è quello che sento
Dimmi perché quando penso, penso solo a te
Dimmi perché quando vedo, vedo solo te
Dimmi perché quando credo, credo solo in te grande amore
Dimmi che mai
Che non mi lascerai mai
Dimmi chi sei
Respiro dei giorni miei d’amore
Dimmi che sai
Che solo me sceglierai
Ora lo sai
Tu sei il mio unico grande amore

Passeranno primavere,
Giorni freddi e stupidi da ricordare
Maledette notti perse a non dormire altre a far l’amore

Amore, sei il mio amore per sempre, per me.
Dimmi perché quando penso, penso solo a te
Dimmi perché quando amo, amo solo te
Dimmi perché quando vivo, vivo solo in te grande amore
Dimmi che mai
Che non mi lascerai mai.
Dimmi chi sei
Respiro dei giorni miei d’amore
Dimmi che sai
Che non mi sbaglierei mai
Dimmi che sei
Che sei il mio unico grande amore
Che sei il mio unico grande amore",Grande amore,2015
Il Volo,"Io son sicuro che, per ogni goccia
Per ogni goccia che cadrà, un nuovo fiore nascerà
E su quel fiore una farfalla volerà
Io son sicuro che, in questa grande immensità
Qualcuno pensa un poco a me
Non mi scorderà

Sì, io lo so
Tutta la vita sempre solo non sarò
E un giorno io saprò
D’essere un piccolo pensiero
Nella più grande immensità
Del suo cielo

Sì, io lo so
Tutta la vita sempre solo non sarò

Per me che sono nullità
Nell'immensità
Sì, io lo so
Tutta la vita sempre solo non sarò
Un giorno troverò
Un po’ d’amore anche per me
Per me che sono nullità
Nell'immensità, l'immensità, nell'immensità",L'immensità [2015 Version] [Version],2015
Il Volo,"Mille violini suonati dal vento
Tutti i colori dell’arcobaleno
Vanno a fermare una pioggia d’argento
Ma piove, piove sul nostro amor

Ciao, ciao, bambina, un bacio ancora
E poi per sempre io ti perderò
Come una fiaba, l’amore passa
C'era una volta poi non c’è più

Cos'è che trema sul tuo visino
È pioggia o pianto dimmi cos'è
Vorrei trovare parole nuove
Ma piove, piove sul nostro amor

Come una fiaba, l’amore passa
C'era una volta poi non c'è più
Cos'è che trema sul tuo visino
È pioggia o pianto tu dimmi cos'è
Vorrei trovare parole nuove
Ma piove, piove sul nostro amor

Ciao, ciao, bambina
Vorrei trovare parole nuove
Ma piove, piove sul nostro amor",Piove [2015 Version] [Version],2015
