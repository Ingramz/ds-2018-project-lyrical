Jenna Ushkowitz,"Those school girl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know they still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who was taken you from crayons to perfume
It isn't easy but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I'd write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high

To sir with love
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What can I give you in return
If you wanted the moon

I would try to make a start but I
Would rather let me give you my heart
To sir with love",To Sir with Love [Version],2010

Jenna Ushkowitz,"God rest ye merry, gentlemen let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Savior was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father a blessed angel came
And unto certain Shepherds brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not,"" said the angel
""Let nothing you affright 
This day is born a Savior of pure or Virgin bright
To free all those who trust in Him from Satan's power and might""
O tidings of comfort and joy (comfort and joy)
O tidings of comfort and joy

Oh, joy (tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy)
Oh, joy (tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy, comfort and joy)

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas all other doth deface
O tidings of comfort and joy

Jenna Ushkowitz,"It's the most wonderful time of the year.
With the kids jingle belling,
And everyone telling you,
""Be of good cheer,""
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

There'll be parties for hosting,
Marshmallows for toasting and
Caroling out in the snow.
There'll be scary ghost stories and
Tales of the glories of Christmases
Long, long ago.

It's the most wonderful time of the year.
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing,
When loved ones are near.

Are the clanging chimes of doom

So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this? (oh my)
I missed my mom and dad for this? (oh my my)

When I see stars (oh, come on!)
When I see, when I see stars, (oh, come on)
That's all they are, when I hear songs (oh my my)
They sound like a swan

So come on!
Oh, come on!
Come on!
Oh, come on!

Well, that is it, guys, that is all (oh)
Five minutes in and I'm bored again (oh whoa!)
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands (oh)

This one is not for the folks at home (oh)
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go (oh whoa!)
Who the heck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun? (oh)

My heart is breaking for my sister 
And the con that she called love
But when I look into my nephews eyes

Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things 
That can come from
Some terrible lies, yeah, ah whoa!

The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream (oh!)
I just had about you and me (oh whoa!)
I called you up, but we'd both agree (oh come on!)

It's for the best you didn't listen (yeah!)
It's for the best we get our distance, oh! (oh come on!)

I met a girl crazy for me
Met a boy, cute as can be

Tell me more, tell me more
Did she put up a fight?

Took her bowling in the arcade
We went strolling, drank lemonade
We made out under the dock
We stayed up 'till ten o'clock

Well-a, well-a, well-a,
Tell me more, tell me more
But you don't gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more

He got friendly, holding my hand
Well, she got friendly down in the sand
He was sweet just turned eighteen
Well, she was good you know what I mean

How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?

Just like a shattered glass, in pieces on the ground
Some days you wanna scream, but you can't make a sound
But you're not alone

Here comes another day, here comes another fight
You'd rather give it up, than give it one more try
'Cause no one understands, the way you feel inside
You're not alone

Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated, mistreated
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me, you'll see
You'll be so much stronger
(You'll be so much stronger)

It's only temporary, but it feels like you're stuck
Like no wishing well could ever change your luck
They say when one door closes, another opens up
And you walk right through
Yeah you know what to do

Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated, mistreated
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me, you'll see
You'll be so much stronger
(You'll be so much stronger)

You might have to bend, but you're not gonna break
Wipe the tears from your eyes and the fear off your face
You know deep down inside you've got what it takes

Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost

Jennette McCurdy,"I found a picture of my mother in her bell-bottom jeans
Flowers in her hair and two fingers up for peace
In that Polaroid she smiles, a grown up baby boomer
Maybe momma walked down the wild side, walking on the moon
And what will they say about us?

I've heard stories about my grandpa, child of the great depression
How growing up broke creates a deep and dark impression
He sits in a rocker down at the Veterans' home
Even when I go to visit, he's still rocking all alone
And what will they say about us?

They'll call us generation lost or generation greed
Or the connected generation to a plasma screen
Or a generation why, enough is not enough
Or maybe they'll call us generation love, generation love

We are children of divorce and victims of dysfunction

We spell check of course and GPS the proper junction
We've gotten pretty good at shifting all the blame
But I think I hear an old song calling my new name

Generation love, not generation lost or generation greed
Or the connected generation to a plasma screen
Or a generation why, enough is not enough
Or maybe they'll call us generation love
Oh, generation love

When they open up our time capsule a hundred years from now
Maybe they will look inside and see we figured out
How to live with less and give ourselves away

Just maybe they'll call us, just maybe they'll call us

We are a brand new generation of love
We are a brand new generation of love, oh",Generation Love,2012

So she sex with no average man
Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide

The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the grounds to Apollo
And then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power

Lanceros con casaca, monarcas de otras tierras
Fanfarrones que llegan inventando la guerra
Milicias que resisten bajo el ""no pasarán"" 
Y el sueño eterno como viene se va 
Ahí está, ahí está la puerta de Alcala ahí esta ahí esta 
Viendo pasar el tiempo 
La Puerta de Alcalá

Todos los tiranos se abrazan como hermanos
Exhibiendo a las gentes sus calvas indecentes
Manadas de mangantes, doscientos estudiantes 
Inician la revuelta son los años sesenta 
Ahí está, ahí está la puerta de Alcala 
Ahí esta, ahí esta viendo pasar el tiempo 
La Puerta de Alcalá 

Un travestí perdido, un guardia pendenciero
Pelos colorados, chinchetas en los cueros
Rockeros insurgentes, modernos complacientes
Poetas y colgados, aires de libertad ahi esta la puerta de Alcala
Ahí está, ahí está viendo pasar el tiempo 
La Puerta de Alcalá 

La miro de frente y me pierdo en sus ojos
Sus arcos me vigilan, su sombra me acompaña
No intento esconderme, nadie la engaña
Toda la vida pasa por su mirada

Tan atento y arrogante

Sólo sabe hacer sufrir

Es un gran necio
Un estúpido engreído
Egoísta y caprichoso
Un payaso vanidoso

Inconsciente y presumido
Falso enano rencoroso
Que no tiene corazón

Lleno de celos
Sin razones ni motivos
Como el viento, impetuoso
Pocas veces cariñoso

Inseguro de sí mismo
Soportable como amigo
Insufrible como amor

Dadivoso y agradable

De pisar bien por el mundo
Sólo sabe hacer sufrir

No es igual que estar contigo
No es que este mal, ni hablar
Pero le falta madurar, es casi un niño

Blanco como el yogurt
Sin ese toro que tu llevas en el pecho
Fragilidad de flor
Nada que ver con mi perverso favorito

Sin tus uñas
Arañándome la espalda
Sin tus manos
Que me estrujan todo cambia

Sin tu lengua envenenado
Mi garganta
Sin tus dientes que torturan
Y endulzan yo no siento nada

Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no
No es la misma cosa
No hay estrellas de color rosa
No destilan los poros del cuerpo
Ambrosía salpicada de te quieros

Hacer el amor con otro no, no, no
Es como no hacer nada
Falta fuego en la mirada
Falta dar el ama en cada beso
Y sentir que puedes alcanzar el cielo

Quise olvidarte con
Él, quise vengar
Todas tus infidelidades
Y me salió tan mal

Que hasta me cuesta
Respirar su mismo aire

Los mechones
De tu pelo negro crespo
Tus caderas afiladas y escurridas

Esa barba que raspaba como lija
Y tu sonrisa retorcida son
Lo mejor que hay en mi vida

Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no
No es la misma cosa
No hay estrellas de color rosa
No destilan los poros del cuerpo
Ambrosía salpicada de te quieros

Que no puedes olvidarme
En este mundo
Nadie es indispensable
Tú puedes ser feliz

Sin mí y yo sin ti y aunque
Me digas que yo
Soy toda tu vida y como

En todo lo que hay vida
Existe muerte y yo no quiero
Ser la muerte para ti

Podrás pensar
Que me dolió que me dejaras
Y es muy cierto
Y como tu comprenderás

Todo es de tiempo sufrí
Bastante que juré nunca volver
Aunque me digas
Que sin mi tu vida es triste

Eso debiste haber
Pensado antes de irte
Te juro que por ti ya
Nada puedo hacer

Y aunque me digas
Que me quieres y me quieres
Y aunque hoy me pidas
Que regresé y que regresé

Juré que nunca volveré
Y no volveré

I just walked in to find you here with that sad

I should made you leave your key
If I'd had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Just turn around now

And you see in me, somebody new

Que solo amas por interés
Que has engañado mas de tres

Que es muy fácil caer en tu red,
Que eres abil para convencer,
Que eres buen amante
Y mal amigo
Que mientras te aguante
Seguirás conmigo.

Y apesar de todo
Cierro mis ojos y oídos,
Con rabia, con puños y gritos
Cierro mi casa quien te ofende.

Te prefiero a ti
Culpable o inocente.

Y apesar de todo
Afronto las miradas
Que me clavan como espadas
Ignoro a quien no entiende
Que te prefiero a ti,

Amor, dicen que eres
Pura falsedad
Que tarde o temprano
Veré la realidad.

Dicen que en ti no hay amor
Que el interés es tu prioridad
Pero apesar de todo
Ami no me conversaran
Por que así te quiero yo
Y así te quiero amar.

Lo que no puedo escuchar,
Lo que no quiero ni pensar
Por que saben que me duele
Sea o no sea la verdad.

Eso ya lo se
Que besas con quemaduras
De veneno y miel
Que me has cambiado no hay duda
Lo se también y me gusta

Por eso voy a ser, por ti, por ti, por ti
Eternamente bella, bella
Con un hechizo de gitana
Seré la princesa encantada
Que te amara por siempre
Desesperadamente, desesperadamente

Eternamente bella, bella
Y en plena noche de la iguana
Hago un hechizo de gitana
Para que sigas siempre
Desesperadamente enamorado de mi

A morir por mi
Por que ten vendes tan caro
Dime ya que si
Tras esos lentes tan negros
Que demonios piensas

Así es la ruleta rusa
Échale valor
De que te sirven las dudas
Has igual que yo
Si encuentro algo que gusta
Lo tomo y no me lo pienso

Así fue

Yo me propuse no hablarte y no verte,
Y hoy que has vuelto de eso no hay nada

Que planché y se arruga al compás de su riza,

Ya se fue la hija del pueblo 
La mujer de los huevotes 

Y no me lloren mis plebes, ustedes nada mas colecten 
Regalías y mis muchachos del grupo desatado que siga 
La fumadera 

A todas mis enemigas 
Que quisieron imitarme 
Se acabo su pesadilla 
Pero siempre han de envidiarme 
Siempre fue la preferida 
No pudieron alcanzarme 

Amores tuve a montones 
Se que me van a extrañar 
Los que mis labios tocaron 
Se los van a saborear 
Pero el amor de mi vida 
Es el que mas va a llorar 

A mi familia querida 
Mis padres y mis hermanos 
Se muy bien que en la otra vida 
Volveremos a juntarnos 
Para reír y gozar 
De lo mucho que triunfamos 

Y no me extrañen mis jefes que su hija la rebelde 
Por siempre vivirá 

Ya me voy a otro concierto 
Voy a cantar con Adán 
Un dueto tengo pendiente 
Por allá con su papá 
Saúl Viera y Selena 
También me recibirán 

Que en mi lindo Playa Larga 
Haya una ultima parranda 
Que me canten mis hermanos 
Mi madre flores reparta 
Mi padre fotografías 
Y mi hermana lea mi carta 

Tomen tequila y cerveza 
Que toquen fuerte las bandas 
Suelten por mi mariposas 
Apláudanme con sus palmas 
Por que así es como celebran

There's a fine, fine line
Between a lover, and a friend.
There's a fine, fine line
Between reality, and pretend;
And you never know 'til you reach the top
If it was worth the uphill climb.

There's a fine, fine line
Between love,
And a waste of time

There's a fine, fine line
Between a fairy tale, and a lie.
And there's a fine, fine line
Between ""you're wonderful"" and ""goodbye"".

It isn't such a crime

Jennifer Batten,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Have you seen a dark cloud fight a silver line ?

You may not know a thing about me

We´re alive
Take a breath because, we´re alive
Take a breath, we´re alive

Help me laugh with angels who just want to get me high
Let´s drive down this highway and leave our fears at home,
And let this twisting , winding road decide which way we go

You may not know a thing about me.
I don´t know a thing about you
But let´s enjoy the view

Take a breath, take a deep breath
Take a breath, take a deep breath

Jennifer Brown,"In the middle of the night she struts around
A yellow taxi to the heart of downtown
Black stockings and a cocktail dress
Purple eyeshadow

It's so hard for her to meet a man
With a secret they women, understand
But her emotions are much deeper than...
The underground freak show

Now if a man feels like a woman
Does that make him less a man
If he hides the truth inside his painted hands

[Chorus]
No esta una chica
Un chico un chico
No esta una chica
Un chico un chico, claro

After hours under candlelight
She pulled a vision in a suit and tie
Masculine with a willing smile
They went home together

""You know I am, different than you think I am.""
He leaned over by the bedside stand
The suit and tie had a gun in his hand
An affair to remember...

Jennifer Brown,"She was only 16, didn't know the first thing about life.
Just tryin' to do right and just doin' her Momma wrong.
And her Daddy walked out, he was talked out, no more hangin' about.
Tryin' to keep his happy face on, guess Papa ain't that strong.

And he left his little girl in the middle of the night.
She was calling out his name after hearing them fight.

Daddy's gone, Daddy's gone, movin' on.
Leavin' Momma at home.
He found another woman.
Now he's gone.
Daddy's gone.

When she turned 21,
she found the big city life and the neon lights,
and drinkin' it up 'til dawn.

Met her boyfriend Bill, who couldn't sit still,
put her on the pill.
And still she would wake up alone,
who can run away from home.

Bill was calling up his girl in the middle of the night.
Said, I'm not your old man who ain't doin' you right.

[Chorus]

At the age of 65, she was the single mother of nine.
Every now and then she would praise her Momma to the Lord.
With tears in her eyes, 
She'd remember that night after hearing them fight.

She would never trust a man, no, never again.
With the graying in her hair and the wisdom of age.
She would try to forgive the man no one could save.
No one could save her.

You pick me up when i fumble the ball

Like a bastard prince who thought he deserved the world

You were trusted with my love and now you avoid me
You got busted fooling around and now you ignore me

So when I tie you up and then go down you might not scream
I want to be crazy and not care about what people say

Nobody has to know that I want you to be my slave

[Chorus]

Don't go to sleep I just might call
To throw you up against the wall

I want to be the girl who smiles standing by her man
But secretly I want you kneeling when I raise my hand
I want to be pink and flowers every hour of the day
And when the nightime comes I want to change the role I play
And you leave your senses and your confidences

[Chorus]",Two in the Morning,1999
Jennifer Brown,"La la la...
When I saw you, I thought I knew you.
But that's too easy for me.
Just a glass of red wine,
Is like a key to the inside,
You can run but you can't hide.
I don't want to say no more, no more.

[Chorus:]
I just can't tell you I love you.
It's gonna take some time.
I've built these walls all around me.
Let's see if you can climb.

And I don't, I don't know why they're so high.
But I can't tell you I love you.
Please don't touch me.
Please don't judge me.
Just go easy on me.
But my confession is that I want you.
Maybe that can launch you over to the other side.

[Chorus]

I used to be the kind who just surrendered.
But I learned love is never real for the pretenders,
And I'm no pretender.

[Chorus]",Walls,1999
Jennifer Brown,"
Ooo ooo

VERSE

Sitting in my bedroom
Thinking of a love gone
Wondering why it went wrong
Over again

You didn't really know me
But it feels like you owe me
But I guess at least you showed me
Not to do it again

BRIDGE
'Cause I've been knocked out
Found out
About something to turn around
'cause I got to find the one thing that will get me over you

CHORUS
So, one day you gotta find me angel
Someone to save me
Someone to put me back together again
One day you gotta send me an angel
'cause I'm back at the beginning
But I'm holding out for more
This time

ooo oooh hey yeah

VERSE
I'm tires of being lonely
I'm getting to it slowly
I'm running out of patience
Running out of strength

There's gotta be a reason
For everything I'm feeling
But I think I've learned my lesson
Never do it again

BRIDGE
'Cause I've been knocked out
Found out
About something to turn around
'cause I got to find the one thing that will get me over you

CHORUS
So, one day you gotta find me angel
Someone to save me
Someone to put me back together again
One day you gotta send me an angel
'cause I'm back at the beginning
But I'm holding back for more
This time

I'm not unbreakable
But what I'm trying to say
Is that I don't think I am capable of doing this alone

CHORUS X 2
So, one day you gotta find me angel
Someone to save me
Someone to put me back together again
One day you gotta send me an angel
'cause I'm back at the beginning
But I'm holding out for more
This time













",Find Me an Angel,2003

Love is a rocket
Focusing me to fly

blast off with me baby
All we need is the clear blue sky
Take a look at my eyes
Let me look at your eyes

I'll take the window
And you can take control
Steer me up to heaven
Far away from the fears I know

leave a trail of love smoke
Just like a dusted road

houston look here I go again
When I'll be home again god only knows
Houston please don't wait up for me
Turn off your technology, the lights and the show

if I'm forgotten
Houston we have a problem

satellites of doubts can surround me
From being hurt many times before
So touch me like a healer
Show me stars never seen before

lift me of the floor
That's what love is for

houston look here I go again
When I'll be home again god only knows
Houston please don't wait up for me
Turn off your technology, the lights and the show

if I'm forgotten
Houston we have a problem

if my heart breaks and worlds collide
At least I'll be on the other side
I'd rather will and risk it all
And wonder if we'll ever fall

houston look here I go again
When I'll be home again god only knows
Houston please don't wait up for me
Turn off your technology, the lights and the show

if I'm forgotten
Houston we have a problem

You were just a thing
Weren't supposed to feel it and you noticed
God damn fool what bring
Though I can't conceal it you know

it's not easy
Even if I try to hide it
I'm open again

cause you've stolen the one thing
That you weren't meant to take
And you've pulled on the one string
That you weren't meant to play
Now it's broken
And it's twisted
And you know it's not ok
You've stolen my heart today

swallows flew around here
They're all dissappearing and you're leaving
Your voice inside my ear
And though it's hard to hear it it's still ringing

it's not easy

So I'm walking away

too bad cause I want him back
Too bad cause I'm all distracted
Feel bad should have told you that before

one chance is all you get
Got to leave me a little respect
Cause you know what my heart is for

Sipping on my latte
See you across the way
Damn I didn't know how much I missed you
A part of me hesitates
But I know it's too late
God there's just no way I can resist you

ain't it kinda funny that
Everytime I'm over you
Then you come around
You get under me
Try to pull me back again

even though in my head I know it's wrong
Just a look and my body says it's on
Still feels so good inside
I've got trouble in mind
Even though it may not last that long
And I know it'll be the same old song
Still feels so good inside
I've got trouble in mind

lying here in my bed
I'm watching you get dressed
All you say is see you when I see you
So here we go again
But I can't help but my smile
Cause you're the something I like getting into

you won't catch me when I'm falling
And I know you won't be calling

No breakfast in the morning
No flowers on my doorsteps

You lift me from myself
You take me somewhere else
Is this something I am dreaming?
Never wake me if I'm sleeping

take me with you to your universe
Slowly lift me to your own world
Because lying in your arms is sweet surrender
And I never had a love so tender and complete

you feel me with just one look
You read me like a book
Overcome the fears that I have hidden
It steers me back towards the rhytm

take me with you to your universe
Slowly lift me to your own world
Because lying in your arms is sweet surrender
And I never had a love so tender and complete

let me glide along with you towards the heavens
Let me float between the living and the dreaming

take me with you to your universe
Slowly lift me to your own world
Because lying in your arms is sweet surrender
And I never had a love so tender and complete

And I stare at my face
And it feels as cold
As the air in this place
There's a look in my eyes
That even I haven't seen before
So I'm thinking of you
While I'm looking at me
And I'm trying to be someone
You want me to be
And it's pushing me closer
To making you sleep on the floor

Someone tell me how can you
Love somebody when
You don't feel a thing?
When you gonna make
Up your mind?

Chorus:
Because when I look in the mirror
I say ""You'll never know
If you don't know by now""
I'm asking when will it be clearer
Coz the reflection's staring back
At me and I don't know who I am
Any more

It's the end of the day
And I'm fading away
Like the sound of the words
That I'm trying to say
And I don't even know
How we got this far
Now I'm alone in the dark
And I don't have the heart
To tell you I'm happier
When we're apart
And I think to myself
That we were close but no cigar

Someone tell me how can you
Love somebody when
You don't feel a thing?
When you gonna make
Up your mind?

Chorus:
Because when I look in the mirror
I say ""You'll never know
If you don't know by now""
I'm asking when will it be clearer
Coz the reflection's staring back
At me and I don't know who I am
Any more

I think it's time for me
To take control of this
So I can recognize myself again...

Welcome, Monsieur, sit yourself down
And meet the best innkeeper in town

Plus some little extras on the side!

Three percent for sleeping with the window shut

How it all increases, all them bits and pieces

And your heart leads the way

And love the way love's supposed to be
Never with hurt or pain
And never with something else to gain
And isn't it strange it seems so clear
That you have nothing here to fear
But somehow the morning light
Fades all the things you see at night

The new world waits inside your dream
And your heart knows the way
But isn't it nice to let it go
On to the life you'll someday know
And let the real world fade away

Once you're there
You'll know that you're inside
You can't turn back
When you open your eyes

The new world waits inside your dream
And your heart knows the way
But isn't it nice to let it go

And let the real world fade away

We've only got today
There's nothing I want from you
Not a word you have to say

You are all I need
And all I can defend
All I need to hold on to
If the world should end

In my imagination
I could not have made this up
In a world stranger than fiction
Ours is no fictional love

I can see the you
Under your second skin
I can feel your heartbeat quicken
Quicken and then slow

There's nothing else I need to know
And there's nothing
You need to pretend
If the world should end

And the sky tonight is luminous
For all the wrong reasons
And every doorway is hiding something
And if this world should all come crashing down
I wouldn't care at all

And if there's no tomorrow
I'll have today again
There's no time for sorrow
When there's no such thing as time

I am not what I've been sold

Are the ones who start the fire
And the lawless make the laws
And every preacher is a liar
And the ones who damn the innocent
Well they own the nightly news and front page

An old man said to me
It's not who but what you know
And knowledge isn't wisdom without control
Better still to be the changes
That you want to see
But they come slow, I know

And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
I can't, I can't

For every heart that bleeds
Will color your world red
And the sorrow in the night
Will be the blue you cannot shed
But your strength will be a vision
Beyond visibility
And the gift you have within
Will give you new eyes to see

That you can rise above
Swing through the skies above
And you shall rise above
Yourself

Know that I'll be watching
Know that I'll be waiting
Standing on the precipice
I can soar away from this

And you can rise above
Free your soul
Open your eyes up
Rise above yourself and take control
And you can rise above
The need to love
Yourself
To release yourself and rise above it all

And you can rise above
I will be there
Open your eyes up
You were never alone
And you can rise above
Inside your dreams
Yourself
I’ve been watching and waiting for you

And you can rise above
Open your eyes to love
And you can rise above
Yourself

And every heart that bleeds
Will color your world red

Will be the blue you cannot shed
And your strength will be a vision

Jennifer Hamlin,"Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul

To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch

I wanted love and here it was

Has given me a wonderful idea

You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!

You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

That I'm for you and you're for me,

Losing at backgammon!

Who said I could do it all alone
How many good friends have I already lost
How many dark nights have I known

Walking down that wrong road
There was nothing I could find
All those years of darkness
Looking for some light
But now I can see

I am changing
Trying every way I can
I am changing
I will better than I am
But I need a friend
To help me start all over again
Oh, that would be just fine
I know it's gonna work out this time
Because this time I am
This time I am

Though you never knew it was a view I've been dreaming

Just to find I have found what I searched to discover
I've come much too far for me not to find
The love that I said could never be mine

It's like I don't mean nothing
Like glass unclear
Almost like you can see straight through me
I got questions but no answers
So tired of being confused and I
Don't wanna stay right here and I
Gotta find my wings and fly

[Chorus]
I gotta find me another way
Cause I don't wanna stay another day
Time for a change in my mind
I've opened my eyes I'm changing my life
And now I'm gonna live my life for me
Cause this ain't how it's supposed to be
No more standing in the back of the line
Cause I'm invisible for the last time

Why can't you see me
Do I really even matter
You changed me completely
And I remember how it used to be
I got question what's the lesson
I'm tired of being confused and I'm
I'm gonna take my chance and fly
I'm taking back my life

[Chorus]

This can't be it for me
This can't be all I'm made for
And all my time wasted in this life
It's my time to shine
No more feeling insufficient
I'm gonna make my own decisions
It don't matter what you can or cannot see
I'm doing this for me

Jennifer Hudson,"Whoa, whoa, 
One, two, three, four

Whats up girl? let me holler at you for a second. 
I just want you to know all of those other girls they never meant anything to me, 
Your the only one for me

You turned me on, sounds so good talking fast. 
But before we go on there's something I must ask, 
Not about your past cause I don't care who came before me,
No my maturity is bigger than that. 
I am more curious bout what you truly want, 
Do I since sincerity or just good talk, 
I don't care about the room or mill 
But be understanding how you truly feel for me, 
And yea I want you sexually

[Chorus]
But I ain't talking bout that,ain't talking bout them,
(Ain't talking bout her) ain't talking bout him
(I'm talking bout trust) I'm talking bout truth
(I'm talking bout me) and what I'm giving you
(This is my heart) please take care
(This is my heart)always be there
(This is my heart) something you cant take
So whatever you do please don't break my heart

Some girls are satisfied with clashing heads
And some girls are happy just to have a man
But my heart has my word to never put her in the way of harm
So you know I like your charm

[Chorus]

One night ain't gone get you no where, 
There's so much to learn and what you dedicate to me is what you'll get back in return, 
Now my bedroom game is sick, and that's only the half of it,
(I need love), I'm tired of the same, (give love) and no games

I was out in the cold
Seemed nothing could heal this
This hole in my soul
You reached out your arms to me
Held out your heart to me
Pulled me back from the edge
Thought I reached the end.

When I was drowning
When I was so confused
You you you pulled me through
I was in the shadows
Lost, nothing left to lose.
You, you, you pulled me through.

You gave my faith back
Faith was so hard to find
You gave me my life back
You were my lifeline
The love that you gave me
Is love that has saved me
Your strength is what made me strong
You held me and I held on

When I was drowning
When I was so confused
You you you pulled me through
I was in the shadows
Lost, nothing left to lose.
You, you, you pulled me through.

Out of the dark
Into your arms
Into the light
Your love saved my life

When I was drowning
When I was so confused
You, ooh you, you (pulled me through)

What do you want to say?
Now love is a little number
That you can wear each day
As long as you let me be the accessory
Simply send me on my way

I look good in love

When it's been out of sight and out of mind for such a long time
That's how one forgets
So I reached in the back of my closet and pulled it out
And I tried it on and it still fits

So I covered the pain up with lots of MAC make-up
But I can't help but blush
'Cause I'm in love
All dressed up in love

And I'm dressed up in love
And I'm cool in the summer, warm in the winter
I'm all dressed up in love

People are looking, some even staring
I don't know it, when they ask me what I'm wearing
This or that, it's made for any weather
My friend and I sit down and we both make it together

Now if you really want one of your own
I hope your shoes are made for walking

You still look the same, but you don't hurt like me
Look at my reflection, somewhere my affection
Disappeared, isn't here, nothing left to say
Memories they fading, but I'm the one who makes them
So I keep the love close to enough to say

What if this life is all that we're given
We just can't stop living, scared of what we'll see
'Cause in this world, anything can hurt you
Push you, then forget you
Stole my history

But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go, what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me
Even if I say goodbye, start to cry, do or die
I remember me, I remember me oh oh

I tell you what my name is
And ain't nothing gon' change it
'Cause what you are is what you are
Even if your memory's flawed
I go to places, trying to find familiar faces
They don't show, but I still know
They don't have to look for me
I dream about, I dream about
The place where all the broken pieces fit together

'Cause in this world, anything can hurt you
And it push you, then forget you
And stole my history

It don't matter where I go, what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me
Even if I say goodbye, start to cry, do or die
I remember me

Now all that's left of these hands, this breathe
I've said goodbye to so many things that tears wont cry
And I take this pain, this joy, and rain
'Cause all that matters now is
In this life anything can hurt you
Push you then forget
Erase your history

But I remember me, I remember me
It don't matter where I go, what I'm told, now you know
I remember me, I remember me
Even if I say goodbye, start to cry, do or die

Jennifer Hudson,"Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
Momma used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers out on his old porch swing

Says he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
How ya keep from going crazy
He said I'll see my wife and son in just a little while
I asked him what he meant
He looked at me and smiled, said

[Chorus]
I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what I can see
Oh I believe

Few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Getting all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said oh by the way child, old man Wrigley's died.

Later on that night, I laid there thinkin' back
Thought 'bout a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man who looked me in the eye, said

The chapter or the verse

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the gettin's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood

Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

And don't wipe off sweat it makes it better

When you want a thing more than you should
You would fall, you would crumble
By picking up the pieces from the storm

That was when you said you least expect it
That was when you asked, ""How did we get this far?"" So far
That was when I wanted to correct it
But I guess there's nothing wrong with being wrong at all

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat and do it all the same way
And I won't justify
One more time

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat every single word we said
And I won't justify
One more time

And it's fine to complicate it
Complicated's all I've ever known
I was there, did you see me?
Frozen in a flash, put on the wall

Now is when I guess I least expect it
But I will never ask, ""How did we get this far?"" My God
Even if I doubt for just a second
I can still find the right in being wrong, so wrong

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat and do it all the same way
And I won't justify

And here I am, useless, battered and torn

Nothing is impossible, impossible for me

I see his blood, redder than any wine shed just for me
Shed just for me, I trust he will return for my release

Pour another cup of coffee
And watch it all crash and burn

Connor finished the milk!

It's a puzzle, it's a maze
I tried to steer through it a million ways
But each day's another wrong turn

I better head out​

If Connor's not ready, I'm leaving without him​

Does anybody have a map?
Happen to know how the hell to do this?
I don't know if you can tell But this is me just pretending to know
So where's the map?
I need a clue
'Cause the scary truth is

I'm flying blind
I'm flying blind 
I'm flying blind
I'm flying blind
And I'm making this up as I go

Jennifer Laura Thompson,"Guys like you and me we're just the losers
Who keep waiting to be seen, right?
I mean no one seems to care or stops to notice that we're there
So we get lost in the in-between

But
If you can somehow keep them thinking of me
And make me more than an abandoned memory
That means we matter too
It means someone will see that you are there

No one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to fade away
No one should come and go
And have no one know he was ever even here
No one deserves to disappear
To disappear
Disappear

It's true
Even if you've always been that barely-in-the-background kind of guy
You still matter

And even if you're somebody who can't escape the feeling
That the world's passed you by
You still matter

If you never get around to doing some remarkable thing
That doesn't mean that you're not worth remembering
Think of the people who need to know

They need to know

So you need ​to show them (I need to show them)
That no one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to be forgotten

No one deserves to fade away
To fade away

No one should flicker out or have any doubt
That it matters that they are here

No one deserves (no one deserves)
To disappear to disappear
Disappear

When you're falling in a forest
And there's nobody around
All you want is for somebody to find you
When you're falling in a forest
And when you hit the ground
All you need is for somebody to find you

I'm calling it the Connor project

The Connor project?

A student group dedicated to keeping Connor's memory alive
To showing that everybody should matter

We have to do this. Not just for Connor, for everyone​

'Cause no one deserves to be forgotten

No one deserves ​To fade away 
We're calling it the Connor project
The Connor project?

Imagine a major online presence 
A massive fundraising drive

And for the kickoff event: an all-school memorial assembly

I didn't realize Connor meant this much to people

Oh Evan, this is wonderful!

No one deserves to be ​forgotten
No one deserves to fade away
No one deserves to disappear
No one deserves to disappear

No one should flicker out or have any doubt
That it matters that they are here

No one deserves  (no one deserves)
No one deserves to disappear

To disappear

No one deserves ​(to be ​forgotten)

To disappear, disappear
To disappear, disappear

Jennifer Laura Thompson,"Why should I play this game of pretend?
Remembering through a secondhand sorrow?
Such a great son and wonderful friend
Oh, don't the tears just pour

I could curl up and hide in my room
There in my bed, still sobbing tomorrow
I could give in to all of the gloom
But tell me, tell me what for

Why should I have a heavy heart?
Why should I start to break in pieces?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?

Why should I play the grieving girl and lie
Saying that I miss you
And that my world has gone dark without your light?
I will sing no requiem tonight

I gave you the world, you threw it away
Leaving these broken pieces behind you
Everything wasted, nothing to say
So I can sing no requiem

I hear your voice, I feel you near
Within these words, I finally find you
And now that I know that you are still here
I will sing no requiem tonight

Why should I have a heavy heart?

Why should I say I'll keep you with me?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?

Why should I play the grieving girl and lie
Saying that I miss you and that my world has gone dark without your light? (I can see your light)
I will sing no requiem
Tonight
'Cause when the villains fall, the kingdoms never weep
No one lights a candle to remember
No, no one mourns at all
When they lay them down to sleep

So, don't tell me that I didn't have it right
Don't tell me that it wasn't black and white
After all you put me through
Don't say it wasn't true
That you were not the monster
That I knew

'Cause I cannot play the grieving girl and lie
Saying that I miss you And that my world has gone dark

I will sing no requiem

I will sing no requiem

I will sing no requiem tonight

Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be draggin' her feathers around in the snow
Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the Tangipaho-down Louisiana
Where a two-tiin' Jaybird
Met the divine Miss O

I'd like to ruffle his plumage

Messed around with that big guy
Till he singed her wings
Forgivin' is easy-it's a woman like, now and then

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Alone where we have walked together

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

March up to that gate and bid it open.

Jennifer Lopez,"Dime por qué lloras
De felicidad
Y por qué te ahogas
Por la soledad
Di por qué me tomas, fuerte así, mis manos
Y tus pensamientos te van llevando

Yo te quiero tanto
Y porque será
Loco testarudo, no lo dudes más
Aunque en el futuro, haya un muro enorme
Yo no tengo miedo
Quiero enamorarme

No me ames, porque pienses que parezco diferente
Tú no piensas que es lo justo ver pasar el tiempo juntos
No me ames, que comprendo la mentira que sería
Si tu amor no merezco, no me ames, más quedate otro día

No me ames, porque estoy perdido, porque cambie el mundo
Porque es el destino, porque no se puede, somos un espejo
Y tú así serías lo que yo de mi reflejo

No me ames, para estar muriendo
Dentro de una guerra llena de arrepentimientos
No me ames, para estar en tierra, quiero alzar el vuelo
Con tu gran amor por el azul del cielo

No sé que decirte, esa es la verdad
Si la gente quiere, sabe lastimar
Tú y yo partiremos, ellos no se mueven
Pero en este cielo sola no me dejes

No me dejes, no me dejes, no me escuches, si te digo no me ames
No me dejes, no desarmes, mi corazón con ese no me ames
No me ames, te lo ruego, mi amargura déjame
Sabes bien, que no puedo, que es inútil, que siempre te amaré

No me ames, pues te haré sufrir con este corazón
Que se llenó de mil inviernos
No me ames, para así olvidarte de tus días grises
Quiero que me ames sólo por amarme
No me ames, tú y yo volaremos uno con el otro
Y seguiremos siempre juntos
Este amor es como el sol que sale tras de la tormenta
Como dos cometas en la misma estela
No me ames
No me ames
No me ames",No Me Ames [Ballad Version],1999

Yo, look, clown, I come through to put it down
Keep thinkin' that you hard; take a look around
I got soldiers stationed up to bring pain
And when it go down, my hos do the same thing
We all in the same game; we all willin' to bang
Ain't nobody going against the grain, so take aim
B.R.'s evasive; cut all the faces; catch all the cases; this real
You rather bet 'cha life than face me
I mean, I got this rap game locked with more cake than Tastee
Black the feindest
The title I hold I won't relinquish
And this type s*** you should distinguish
And one phone call, and I'll extinquish
I mean this; you seen this
Blue steel fo'fo'; the caliber - Excalibur
I'm a destroy my next challenger
B. Rob, high post emcee
Quick to spray Raid on the roach emcee
So don't be apporachin' me without the cross and rosary
Who this n**** 'pose to be? 
I blast him in the open beef
Damn, Black, how you do that der?
'Cause we don't care
I'll take 'em there

[Chorus]
Last night, I dreamed of some more dough
Some crystal, sixty thousand, and ten dimes of 'dro
(I'll take 'em there)
That's when I realized I'm dreaming
Too late now
Guess I'll finish what I started, baby

[Black Rob]
Y'all n****s heard the first verse; no doubt s*** bangin'
Verse two make sure none of y'all left hangin'
Got honnies lovin' this s*** too; girl, I'm wit' chu
Long as you know my pants don't fit chu
Money good look; understand why he shook
S***, I'm rich; face all up in the Guinness Book
Check all the records I set; it's major
Check that the sets I wreck with flavor
F*** that Cajun; guns stay bond c***
Boiling hot; hold s*** down like Fort Knox
Man, knock the rhyme unorthodox
What'cha barely understand, s***, I did with the L.O.X.
Give me the props; I'm tryin' set a mark this year
And bring the equipment out to the parks this year
So y'all could see how it used to be
I'm lookin' towards the future, see
Black here to stay
It's time y'all got used to me
Puff said Black ain't tryin' to fit in
Up and down the coast; can't count the spots I've been in
Put'cha bid in

[Chorus]

[Black Rob]
I hit arenas, swinging notice if my name was Teddy Pender
Hot beats and hot rhymes tossed in a blenda'
I want ch'all to feel hardcore; nothin tenda'
Blessed this mic for as long as I remember
Y'all can't see the Rob
Uh-uh, y'all must be stupid
If I owe Sean Combs any money, then I recouped it
I looped it; this fly s*** from Nebodaga
Me, and Yogi, and Hard Pierre from You don't Know Me
I dare you to come against me, run against me
Use your gun against me
You finito, finished
I've seen wild cats diminished, foldin' for
Bad Boy's known to ball
Internationally, I'm sayin' actually
I have to be the next cat to go and sell a million records casually
So, prepare yourself for the storm
Nineteen-nine-nine, it's on
And I'm just gettin' warm

What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
How, tell me how will I know
Will my heart make me believe it so
Or can I trust the way I feel
If you could read my mind
You see how hard I've tried
Still I can't decide

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
Oh, tell me could this be love

Do you know if it's true
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky
And do you know if you can fall for
Just a moment
Is a moment for all time
Why, why am I so unsure
Is that love knocking at my door
Or the sound of my beating heart
If you could read my mind
You know I just can't hide
What I feel inside

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
Oh, tell me could this be love

Grammy nominations and platinum plus ain't nothing baby

We got chedda, I'm twice as rich
Make you bite your lips, Jenny you know you like unless
Nice and thick, if you ever leave me I'd slice my wrists
Treat you like a bitch, never that
We got beef where my niggaz at
Streets is where I'm living at

Where the glock, that's the sounds of the mini mack
Where we at, uptown where its really at
Here me yack, I want the mansion, the yacht
Advance on the spot, we can dance till we drop
Let my hands slip a knot

Joe you the don

Jenny you the bomb
Any man disrespect, good as gone

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me
That everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of my fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened up for me
That's why I'm feeling

I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh no
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine

Better run when you see me coming through the back door
Crack smart, I give it all for my brother
There's to things I don't share
That's my money and my mother

I love honeys since the paradise for real
Seis caps some steel, this better scrap for real

Shut up your grill
You know we never fight
It's your world girl, set it off right

Con el fuego de tu amor

Quiero junto a ti volar
Ser tu vice why algo mas

Lo que nadie a ti te supo dar
Eso te lo doy a ti

Que sea tuya hasta el final

All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight

Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever

I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew, I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Gone are the days when the sun used to set

Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew, I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight
(Tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms

Jennifer Lopez,"Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you there's no open door.
What are you hoping for, do you know?

Once we were standing still in time,
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned,
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?

Come and let me show you just how much I feel inside
I got so much love
Oh baby, when I get near you
Ooh, I can't control what I'm feeling

I got so much love to give that I would probably want all the time

I gotta have your love, Carino
Need to feel your touch, Carino
Never get enough, Carino, Carino

I wish that I could spend all my days
And nights wrapped in your arms
Spending time with you 'cause all I see
In this world is me and you and no one elase, ooh
I want you more and more
Oh baby, please understand me
I think that you deserve me
Cause I'm the type that would give you all the love
And affection that you need

Uh, uh, well
Sugar
here's another one
And another day

Move to this, let me see you jump and twist
Pump your fist 'cause you know it's hard to resist
As long you know you're rollin' with the love
specialist
Feel the pow, let me put the groove in your hips
The night is young, so let's go roll with the fun
You got some gun, check it out, gimme some
'Cause I'm about to play an old girl like a drum
She shackatack, poor soul settle down

Girl, what you gon' do with all that body
{Shake it up all night}
Careful with that thing before you hurt somebody
{Tell me what you like}
Do it, baby

How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling on your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay
Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim
And you tell her baby no way

But she caught me on the counter
""It wasn't me""
Saw me banging on the sofa
""It wasn't me""
I even had her in the shower
""It wasn't me""
She even caught me on camera
""It wasn't me""
She saw the marks on my shoulder
""It wasn't me""
Heard the words that I told her
""It wasn't me""
Heard the screams getting louder

R-U-L-E
Blowing back on this Mary Jane I'm analyzing the game
(And the game don't chose me)
Bring pain to pussy niggas and pussy Holes they one in the same
(Ever since you told me)
There's only room for two, I been making less room for you
(Now only GOD can hold me)
Hug me, love me, judge me, the only man that hoves above me
Holla!

I met so many men,
And it's like they're all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain!
And when I'm feeling sexy
Who's gonna come for me?
My only problem is
Their insecurity

Are you tired of bein' alone? (Yeah yeah)
Sick of arguin' on the phone (Yeah yeah)

Now they been looking at me smiling at me
Laughing like we wasn't happy
But not knowing that we growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin' straight thuggin'

Now if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all I won't take your cheating on me
Tell me who can I trust if I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me you'll have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me babe

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me, tell me baby
And if somehow you knew that
Your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby

You say you want my love and you got to have it all
But first there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you tryin' to get with me and I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do give myself to you I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me (what would you do babe, tell me right now)
And if somehow you knew that
Your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby (don't you lie to me)

If you had my love

Would you comfort me (comfort me, tell me baby)

Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from ""Casino"" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo hand
All I know, when Nas was yo man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

Money, cars for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me ""This ain't right""

I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to say

Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start

Did the best that you could do

Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be OK (I need to be OK)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Be leaving without you (Leaving without you) {Huh, this life is crazy}
So now it's time for me to make that move

Huh check it
Yo nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right?
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat
I'm slow caught

Clearing up all the clouds of sadness and the rain
So pure you and healing was the love you bring
I knew inside (it felt so right)

For me, I've struggled, all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

I will, love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again, again, again

I was scared to let go and trust your love
After what I'd been through I have had enough
Whispering through your eyes you never said a word
But something said
(You're heart's safe)

For me, I've struggled, all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again, again

A friend is what you always have in me
I'm so grateful for the man you turned out to be
And it doesn't matter who you happen to meet
You'll forever be (a secret part of me)

Always be by your side

I have dreams about the way we used to kiss
About the way you used to hold me
And say nothing would ever harm me

Oh how you charmed me
Made me smile when I was down
Big pimping around the town (you and me)
Whenever they'd see you (they'd see me)
A lover and a friend to me you were how did it end
How it hurts
To not have you in my life
When I wanted to be your wife

You never know what you have
Till it's gone, treated you wrong
For so long, now you're gone away
But the love still lives here (still)

I still got love for you (still)
After all we've been through (still)
I gave my heart to you
And baby you're the only one (the only one)

There's other men than you (still)
They can come close to you (still)
Once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one

A good man you were to me
Always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me
Didn't matter, what, when, or where
(You were there)
I never thought we'd part
From the arguments we'd start
When I just wanted to get some attention (sorry)
And I'm sorry baby for bitching (if I could)
Take back the words
That I said to make you leave
I'd be down on bended knees
Asking you to please forgive me

You never know what you have
Till it's gone, treated you wrong
For so long, now you're gone away

I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from

I'm down to earth like this
Rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and lovin' it
Rumors got me laughin' kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first and can't forget to stay real
To me it's like breathing, yeah

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got

Jennifer Lopez,"Could wait all night and day
To go to a party
Sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
'Cause my song he's gotta play
And when I hear that beat
I get my body up out my seat
Grab a guy and move my feet
He's playin' my song

Play, come on
Play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come one DJ
Play that song
You that it turns me on
Just turn it up and turn me on

I don't care if everybody gone
Turn it up
'Cause it turns me on
Keep dancin' all night long
It feels so good that it can't be wrong
I get the chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops better press rewind
Let me hear it
One more time

Play, come on
Play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on

Distantes de todo
En la oscuridad donde no haya más
Que ver en tus ojos 

Escondemos de la multitud
Del absurdo día a día
Donde todas esas cosas que perturben
No estén más en nuestras vidas, en nuestras vidas 

Para que estemos solos amor
Y el universo se nos quede en un abrazo
Donde se esfumen esas dudas
Y esos miedos que nos quedan del pasado 

Para que estemos solos amor
En un día sin fin
Sin preocuparnos más
Del que podrán decir
Donde durmamos abrazados
Y si entonces nos sorprende el amanecer
Saber que estés ahí
Que estamos solos 

Escapémonos por necesidad
Nos debemos tanto
Si el amor esta, no hay porque esperar
El donde o el cuando 

Escondemos de la multitud
Del absurdo día a día
Donde todas esas cosas que perturben

The day that I first felt the power of you
Inside of me, such a strong feeling
There comes a time in everyones life
When you know, and everyone around you knows
That everything is changed,
You're not the same, it's a new day

Oh what I want to know is,
Are you willing to try
There's gotta be more meaning to this
Than what meets the eye

You said these walls were here to protect us, but it's still not a home
All these questions that are burning inside with answers I'll never know
'Cause you're the only one who knows how you feel, but you're not letting me know

What is it, love
Can I help you
I see where this has gone and what it's coming to
I look to you
Enough

I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
You know you owe it to me
How can you think we don't need you
I'm tired of running away from my fear and the day
That our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward you're leaving

Sitting here inside an empty room that was filled with us
Only boxes to define what was left of what we used to call love
It's sad that after all of this time, you have nothing to say
Ooh, and the only thing that you could've done, you choose to walk away

I'm thankful, love
I don't hate you
'Cause I'd rather live and know than what you put me through
I needed you
Somehow

I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you

Jennifer Lopez,"You had a dark, sexy vibe about ya
And in a strange way you turn me on
The way you look said a lot about ya
As if you really didn't give a unh
I told myself not to fall for you
'Cause I can see that you don't follow rules
I should've just walked away
But your eyes were telling me to stay
Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on

It's like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like

A real rebel kinda fella
The kind that I would never trust
I could read what your mind was thinking
It's like you still didn't give a hey
It's funny how those kind of guys
Have a way of getting what they want
And even good girls though they try
You see they just can't soon stay away
Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on

Jennifer Lopez,"Right here
Something in the dark shot glasses, you know
Something that you can lean to
Something that you can ride to
Something that you can step to
You know

Sometimes real love can be
Not seen 'cause you're thinkin'
What's right in front of you
Can't be the one for you

Then one day you realize that
There are feelings that you can't hold back
And you're so caught up
Now that's all you think of
Crazy how

All that talk of us not able to last
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand

I got you
And nobody can come to change a thing
'Cause you gotta know
You got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud

I got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see I've got you
You got me

I got you

Things are often said to
Doubt what I feel for you
But words that people say
Won't take my love away
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright
But why they say some things that ain't right
I never know but please understand that baby, it ain't nothing

All that talk of us not able to last
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand

I got you
And nobody can come to change a thing
'Cause you gotta know
You got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud

I got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (you got me, baby)
I got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (you got me, baby)

So that's all that people can do
Never mind all the love, all that you
Gotta do is simply love, trust, and just stay focused on us
Together we'll get through whatever if we
Don't let speculations make situations up
We'll be alright

I got you
And nobody can come to change a thing

Well maybe you were blind and cannot see
The feelings I have for you, you don't understand
The things that I've gone through
To paint a perfect picture just for you (picture for you)
I've even told your friends, but that won't do
Well baby, you have to know, I can't wait no more

See baby, I'm trying to make you see (trying to make you see)
This is not pretend or make believe
I wanna be the woman that you need
Just let me get close to you, take me in your heart
Every day I want you more and more (want you more and more)
Never in my life was I so sure
These feelings I have I can't ignore
So baby just let me know
All I'm trying to say is

You just how much I care for you

Like yesterday I still can hear your voice, you promised to be
Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there
Well, it's been a while
And here we are lookin' back on times that we shared

I still imagine us being young and so in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Feels like it's always just been us

I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around
Still around (yeah)

I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days
You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made
I sing your favorite song inside my head when you're not with me
Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me

I can imagine us being old and still in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Makes me smile, we're still in love

And your father looked at me like I had three heads
(And I will never forget the day)
Heh
We were so in love

You were so beautiful and so young

You better gimme some of that funk

Pulled up, at the red light
Cutie crept up on my left side
Window down, waitin' for my reply
Not a word, I saw it in his eyes
Tell me somethin' good baby he said, ""Whatever you wanna do""
(For real?)

He pulled to the curb, hazards flashed bright
I got out with a catwalk shine
Short skirt, golden brown thighs
Gucci heels, four inch high
He touched my face smiled and said, ""Whatever you wanna do""

Now I, I said, I usually need
Some time to get inside
So I don't know why
You and and me feel so right
Maybe we need tonight

(Whatever you want)

We sippin, music on loud
Conversation, your lollipop mouth
You open up, sweet things come out
Whisper to me, ""Oh what you talkin bout?""
I said, ""I think you know"" he said, ""Whatever you wanna do""

You stand up, takin' my breath
It's your song so you do a two-step
I turn away, move my hips slow
Your thoughts, fully exposed
Now we better stop playin' I said, ""Boy, what you gonna do?""

Now I, oh I, usually take
My time to get inside

The club was far from empty 
It was crowded at the entry 
I slide right through like how I do 
This girl began to tempt me. 
She said her name Shaiyeeda 
I could tell her mama feed her 
When they tight and when them jeans don't fit 
I'm L, nice to meet ya. 
I could feel my body yearnin' 
The room just started turnin' 
Didn't wanna go out on the floor 
But this girl was so determined (Let's dance)

I'm sweatin' just a little 
On the dance floor in the middle,

How we lust for one another 
We barely know eachother 
Yet we're whilin' like we're lovers (uh huh)

The strobe lights are flashin' 
The hustlers throw cash n 
The bar tender keeps splashin' 
Her moves were so erotic 
Her games were so hypnotic 
I bet this girl could stop it 
But she continued to pop it 

You know I know you like it, 
Let me hit you on your sidekick 
Cause the after party is at my body, 
Meet me, you're invited

Her lip gloss 
Her hips toss 
Back and forth 
Side to side and 
Up and down 
She touched the ground 
It turned me out.

Lord help me douse this fire 
This internal inferno, 
Hotter than a shot of cuervo

Belly dancin' in a circle

Just feeling more confident
Just using my common sense
Just trusting that I'm loving it

I can't refuse an offer, so benevolent
Can't assume he's gonna use me
And after him, never call again

Don't be afraid

This is your day

It's time to be brave, say I'm not afraid
Not anymore, I used to be calm
Now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page

Thanks to the power of love
I can love because I am brave
I am brave
I am brave, yeah
Ooh, ooh

I heard him say
This thing movin' too fast for him
It's a feeling that I'm straddling
Foolishly adamant

But it's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
'Cause the same way you scared of him
He's scared of bein' hurt again

It's time to let go
Let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know we might never part

Baby, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
This is your day
This is your day

Thanks to the power of love
I can love because I am brave

I wouldn't take back
Anything that I've gone through
Now I pray for strength
For anything that I'm gonna do

Whether joy or it's pain
I'm still okay
I'm gonna be all right 'cause I'm not afraid

In finding something real

When they say ""I love you""
Then I only dumb up

Woo, woo

Through the bumpy roads the others bite the dust 'cause
They be thinking there in love when their in lust, but
Cliche breakin' up so easy
I'm about to throw a curve ball honey
People let the stormy weather push them out
Back against the road it's easy to be over
Don't sweat the little things wake up
Stay together, it's a new break up

Everyday I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep lovin'
Toe to toe, we so strong and on and on we up and runnin'
Not a day goes by without dreamin'
Not a thing goes out just keep reachin'
Through the storm we stay warm and on and on we keep on lovin'

This time is in our favor
This time comes second nature
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy we done started something serious 'cause
Romance is underrated
Stay together, that's the new trend

Through the bumpy roads the others bite the dust, and
Seems like everyone's giving up, when
These days breaking up is so cliche
Hear 'em screaming out, ""Baby no please stay""
People wanna always hurry up and wait for
Somebody better than the person they won't stay for
Don't sweat the little things wake up
Stay together, it's a new break up

Everyday I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep lovin'
Toe to toe, we so strong and on and on we up and runnin'
Not a day goes by without dreamin'
Not a thing goes out just keep reachin'
Through the storm we stay warm and on and on we keep on lovin'

This time is in our favor
This time comes second nature
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy we done started something serious 'cause
Romance is underrated
Stay together, that's the new trend

Hey, yeah

And though there will be the nights of fights and we must face it
It's like a roller coaster, ups and downs we'll go
As long as we hold tight and never act complacent
Remember how we built this then our love is never done

Everyday I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep lovin' (keep lovin')
Toe to toe, we so strong and on and on we up and runnin'
Not a day goes by without dreamin'
Not a thing goes out just keep reachin'
Through the storm we stay warm and on and on we keep on lovin'

This time is in our favor
This time comes second nature
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy we done started something serious, 'cause
Romance is underrated
Stay together, that's the new trend

Vienes envuelto en el silencio
Vienes detrás de una mirada
O en el temor de un beso

Detrás de las pequeñas cosas que
Me hacen sentir la emoción de creer
Entras en mi tan sutilmente
Invisible como el aire mismo

Me asaltas why jamás me adviertes que
Es el amor el que abraza esta piel, esta piel

Amarte así es pleno why es total
Amarte es todo
Amarte así es locura why libertad
Amarte es todo

Amarte hasta llenar mi vida
De sueños why de fantasías
Amarte así me da seguridad
Why quien puede contra tu boca

Que me hare hasta pedir auxilio
Why quien puede con tus detalles que
Me hacen vivir why sentirme mujer, mujer

Que los dias se van why es dificil otra oportunidad para estar asi, para volver a amar Quedate junto a mi, quedate junto a mi Ven apresurate, ruego

No lo pensemos mas, que los dos nacimos para soñar why no quiero estar sola un minuto mas Quedate junto a mi, quedate junto a mi Ven apresurate, ruego

Es tan necesario que estes de mi lado La distancia puede lastimar mis fuerzas Puedo resistir con mucho empeño pero el miedo me doblega

Este miedo a verme nuevamente sola A pensar que tanto amor ha sido en vano Es por eso que te necesito en mis dias why en mi espacio

Por los dos por lo que siempre hemos luchado Por todo lo que pasamos apresurate mi amor Por que vuelvan los minutos, porque no quiero perderte Porque vivo de ilusiones porque sueño con amarte hoy

A pisar sin ver los pasos,
A dejar que las heridas 
No sanaran bien.
Quizas por impetuosa
He dejado tantas cosas 
Que eran parte del camino
Parte de crecer.
Quizas porque tan solo he sido una,
Que ha sido enamorada de la Luna,
Tan solo eso ha sido mi pecado,
El de seguir mi corazon a todos lados,
Seguir mi loco corazon a todos lados

Chorus
Why he amado como ama una mujer
Que ve en su hombre el paraiso,
Si me entregue lo hice total
Why si falle volvi a empezar
Why a levantarme en el camino
Why he amado como ama una mujer
Que el alma no la ha abandonado
Why que lo intenta un dia mas
Why que ha soÃ±ado con soÃ±ar
Why por amar se ha equivocado
Why por amar se he aquivocado

Quizas no ha habido espacio 
Para ver bastante claro
Que al final de la jornada 
Tuve que perder.
Si me ha llevado el viento
He vivido mis momentos
Why al final de mi conciencia 
Solo tuve fe.

why solo por seguir esta locura
De la pasion que rapido se esfuma,
Tan solo por creerlo nuevamente
Por no caer why a veces no desvanecerme
Por toda la necesidad de hacerme fuerte.

Ahora que si me lo creo
Me duele vivir why pensar
Que elegí en vez del cielo el infierno

Que si me muero por dentro
Me alejo de ti hacia la oscuridad

Que la luz que iluminaba este sueño no se puede ver más
Y el amor por más enorme e intenso un día puede acabar

Da miedo que, que te vayas
Y abandonar las cosas que no volverán
No volverán, jamás

¿Ahora que puedo decir si ya no tengo palabras?
No necesito morir para entender que es por ti que se apaga mi alma
¿Ahora que puedo decir si le converso a mi almohada?
Que estoy cansada de oir, de callar y esperar de morderme las ganas
Reconozco tu espalda, como un cobarde te marchas

Mañana cuando cruzes esa puerta no te quiero ver más
Y lleva en tus maletas las cosas que en mi vida no van
Y no creas que me quedo vencida para tu vanidad
Por amor yo me he jugado la vida y me la vuelvo a jugar

Te juro que me haces falta
En todas esas cosas donde ya no estas
Y que ya no estan, jamás

Se que esta es la ultima vez que me veras y te vere

No me puedo perdonar, sigo mi camino

Y sigo sola, conmigo caminando a solas
Mi mundo se derrumba todo
Me queda seguir, esperar y cambiar y llorar y dejarlo todo
Quitarme el llanto de mis ojos,
Alimentando esta ilusion y soportando este dolor

Caminar por las calles y ver
Que las cosas no pueden volver
Ver la gente a mi lado pasar
Sin que puedan y quieran pensar

Y tal vez sea una nueva estacion
Que me pone de nuevo en el rol
protagonico fin de terror
con el miedo de la involuntad

De mirarme y querer escapar
De creer y volver a caer
Del delirio de la decepcion
y esta vez disparaste a matar

Ya no es facil olvidar, perdi la oportunidad
No me puedo perdonar, sigo mi camino

time finalizes it that me really and I saw you

No longer it is facil to forget, perdi the opportunity I can Not forgive me, I continue my road

And I continue alone, with me walking to alone My world he collapses all he remains Me to continue, to expect
and to change and to cry and to leave it all to Remove me the crying of my eyes, Feeding this ilusion and
bearing this pain

Walking along the streets and to see That the things cannot return to See the people beside me to pass without
they being able and quieran to think

And perhaps it be a new one estacion That puts me again in the role protagonico end of terror with the fear of
the involuntad

To look at and wanted to escape to believe and to fall again From The delirium of the decepcion and this time
you shot to kill

No longer it is facil to forget, perdi the opportunity I can Not forgive me, I continue my road

Aunque todo lo que ve se terminara

Aunque ya nunca volviera a amanecer

Si de pronto en el silencio me encontrara

yo me iría trás de tí lo sabes bien


Why si fueras tú mi ultima esperanza

Tras tu huella mi camino buscaré


Creo en eso que el amor te lleva al cielo

De pedirte en el naufragio sálvame

Creo en eso de esperar el día nuevo

Que lo nuestro es para siempre ya lo sé

why que importa si el destino se indignara

O si alguien dijera que este amor no puede ser

In a way that I don't know

'Cause this boy's fire
It's got a hold of me
Didn't have to know from your body
Put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale, on me

Gotta call a cab
If I don't need gonna have me
With every young stunna' in the hood wanna have me
Uh, so much of him I couldn't surrender
'Cause I know where this could end up
And with that right now I can't play
I know I drive him loco
But that's just the way
You make a mama's hips go

This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck
To come and get me

Jennifer Lopez,"Ayer los dos soñábamos con un mundo perfecto
Ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
Porque en los ojos nos espiábamos el alma
Why la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada

Ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero
Ayer tú me juraste que este amor seria eterno
Por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente
Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente

Qué Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empañaste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Why confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Como permiso para así romperme el alma

Qué Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Why nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Why con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

Mañana que amanezca un día nuevo en mi universo
Mañana no veré tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
No escuchare palabras de arrepentimiento
Ignorare sin pena tu remordimiento

Mañana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
Mañana ni siquiera habrá razones para odiarte
Yo borrare todos tus sueños de mis sueños
Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos

Qué Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empañaste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Why confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Como permiso para así romperme el alma

Qué Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Why nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Why con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

why confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Como permiso para así romperme el alma

Qué Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Why nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras

People told me,
I should write a love song
""Girl you sound so angry,
You could use some variation""
But I'm lonely
Negative relations
I've been hurt so many times
I don't have the patience

But I've wished for so long
For someone to come and show me
Lead by example
'Cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age
I'm so tired of the game
I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way?

What if I never find and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same?
Status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love

What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love?
What is love?

'Cause if you told me
What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely
What is love?
Please show me
What is love?

I've had blind dates
Hooked up with some real flakes
I've gone out with church boys
Musician's are the worst
I've tried so hard
'Cause I'm just so die hard
Tried my best to play the part
Wish you could see inside

But I've wished for so long
For someone to come and show me
Lead by example
'Cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age
I'm so tired of the game
I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way?

For the past three years
On Valentine's Day
Christmas is no exception
Birthday's with naughty presents
Been back and forth, same action
I just need this to happen
I'll be singing love's praises
If you would show me

What if I never find and I'm left behind?

Jennifer Lopez,"You must be thinking how did I get here
And I wonder if you've been here before
So many things I want to ask you, and know about you
You seem like you are ready to run
Stand right up and walk out that door
Oh yes you've been here before
But for this moment you're all mine
So let's just take it one step at a time

One step at a time
No need to rush
Let's keep this time for us
And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast

I would spend my lifetime wondering why
He chose me for you and you for I
You have things to teach me
I have a feeling inside
I have this vision of three of us
Holding hands
Through a valley and jumping towards the sky

But one step at a time
We will take it one step at a time

One step at a time
No need to rush
Let's keep this time for us
And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast

How can three become one,
You're the greatest thing tha I've ever done
I wanna create a world
You will always want comeback to
And here's my wish for both of you

He makes me happy when he smiles
He makes me sad, he makes me mad

Nothing left for me to mend, oh

And I still couldn't see

I'm gonna give you my heart

Was in place full of pain
With a broken down heart in despair

And made it hard for me to care, oh

Put back all the pieces and made me whole

No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)

I'm down to earth like this
Rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing, kid
Love my life and my public
Put God first
Then can't forget to stay real
To me it's like breathing

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)

It take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, now assets
You get back what you put out
Even if you take the good route
Can't count the hood out
After a while, you know who to blink with
Just keep it real with the ones came in with
Best thing to do is stay low, LOX and J. Lo
Act like they don't, but they know

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)
Don't be fooled by the rocks
That I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block

If you think its a joke, go head and laugh
Created my own lane, created my path
Graduated at high school just not with my class

Hated algebra, but I loved to multiply
So I took my letters and made 'em numbers right
Will you evaluate, Jennifer baby let's celebrate

This is for my singles ladies and single mothers
Raising babies working hard
I know the feeling, I used to live it
My mother worked two to three jobs
That's what this song is dedicated
To all the women out there motivated
Always finding ways to make ends meet
All my women out there innovative
You name the game, and they've played it
They've heard all the stories, so save it
All my women with power meet me at happy hour

But they never meant a thing to you
So don't you call my name, all my info changed
It's such a shame, what a shame
Now I'm breaking chains, breaking chains oh
And I don't play no more, baby this is game over

Broke your heart so you could feel it
Think we're gonna think we're really through
Me and you (this is)
Tears fall down, feels like it's raining
Somewhere walkin' feel the pain in you
Only you (someone took)

Someone took my emotions,
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions,
I feel good, 'cause I don't feel bad

All I ever wanted was your time
Right now I
Don't even have the patience
I'm tired of waiting for you
I just wanna let go
You tryin' to change me mind
But the answer's still no
Who are you
You don't mean nothing
You ain't worth nothing
When I tell you something
You don't learn from it
I got my bags at the door, Passport to go
When I leave, you gon' come running
You did it yeah
I got no feelings left
I'm so numb, you're so dumb
It's over, it's over

Someone took my emotions
Someone took my emotions

Jennifer Lopez,"If the day comes that you must leave
Let me be the ground to your feet
If the day comes that you feel weak
Let me be the armor you need
Oh, if you falling in love is a crime
And the price to pay is my life
Give me sword, bring all the knives
Hand me the gun, I will not run
And when they spare everything but my pride
Don't you worry, boy, don't you cry
But when they ask, who was the one
Who got you love
Let it be me

If you ever made your last breath
Let me be the last word you say
And if right comes, but you choose left
I will be the first to forgive
Oh if heaven is a beautiful place
But those gates don't have enough space
And they lock you out, spare you no flame
I will come down, if they’re on my wings
And when the angels call me a fool
For giving all grace up for you
I won’t look back
But when they ask, who did you love
Let it be me

Let it be me that you think of
When everything tells you to give it up
Let it be me that will anchor your soul
Until the clouds fall out of the sky
And the snow falls down in July
Let it be me, that you think of
Let it be, the one that you love
Until the flowers don’t blow in May
And forever runs out of days
Let it be me, let it be me
The one that you love

Let it be me
Let it be me

Let it be me, let it be me
Let it be me, let it be me
Oh let it be me",Let It Be Me,2014
Jennifer Lopez,"I've been tossing and turning
All this hunger is burning
I need something to feed my soul

I race my thoughts to the morning
I got this need that's growing
Wake you up just to make me whole

Your body is heaven and it feels like home
And those sweet lips, I can never let you go

I'm never satisfied
Honey my appetite
It's keeping me up at night
I'm going crazy for more of your love

I need you all the time
You bring me back to life
I'm going crazy
For more of your love

Raven hits every time I leave you
There ain't nothin' else I can do
I follow anywhere you go

Your body is heaven and it feels like home
And those sweet lips, I can never let you go

I'm never satisfied
Honey my appetite
It's keeping me up at night
I'm going crazy for more of your love

I need you all the time
You bring me back to life
I'm going crazy
For more of your love

One taste is never enough
I'm losin' my mind
I can't stop thinking 'bout your sweet love,
All of the time
I don't know if I'm gonna make it alone
Make it alone

I'm never satisfied
Honey my appetite
It's keeping me up at night
I'm going crazy for more of your love

I need you all the time (all the time)
You bring me back to life (back to life)
I'm going crazy
For more of your love",Never Satisfied,2014
