And I give her my heart, / she says ""no, no, no, / no, /
'cause your / only a friend to me, /
More like a brother to me."" /


She's a pretty little girl / who says ""no, no, no, / no,"" /
Just a little girl, / and she knows I love her so, /
If I / ask her to walk with me, /
She shakes her head at me. /


She's a pretty little doll / who says ""no, no, no, / no,"" /
All the night-time through, / she says ""no, no, no, / no."" /
If I / ask her to walk with me, /
I know she'll never say ""oui."" /

Saint Etienne,"Took a trip down Anita Way
Had to go on the 1st of May
Didn't have much to celebrate
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Doot do do, doot do do

Get yer kicks all around the world
Give a tip to a geisha girl
Fit your bit with a piece of pearl
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Doot do do, doot do do

Sold the ground to a PLC
Moved the club out to Newbury
Sod the fans and their families
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi

Picture-house built in '23
It's a place out of history
Pulled it down for your cash money
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Heart failed in the back of a taxi
Doot do do, doot do do

Let me put you in the mood, let me try to break on through.
You know that I will.
Let me take you back again, let me climb aboard that train,
Leave time standing still.


Chorus -
Listen while her lover plays the bass,
Lets groove a little now.
Listen while her lover plays the bass,
Lets groove a little now.


As you slowly play your tune, an your smoke fills up the room.
I'm closing my eyes, an the radio's still on, an I'm dreaming of song.
I feel hypnotised.


Chorus x 4.


So lets groove a little now.
Let's groove a little now.

take me away
Away from the window
Keep me in chains
Hide me in shadows
Don't want no lights
Shining on me
Experiments failed
Now sunshine blinds me

when I was young
They took me from home
Chained me to darkness
There's no light in my soul
Now I am older
Become of age
Vengeance inside me
Has grown into rage

long live disciples of night

church bells ring louder
I am on the street
Signal detectives
Who will never find me
For I live in the graveyards
Imbedded with souls
I never existed
And that leaves you cold

C'est merveilleux il n'y a rien d'mieux
Pardon Mamzelle fait's donc Monsieur.

Le lend'main dans l'métro la fillette
Par un beau jeune homm' se vit serré' tell'ment
Que celui-ci de peur qu'ell' rouspète
Lui murmura très timidement :

Refrain :
Pardon Mamzelle fait's donc Monsieur
Répondit-elle d'un air gracieux
Alors d'plus belle et fort de ça
Vous pensez si le jeune homme en profita !
Pardon Mamzelle fait's donc Monsieur...
Ah ! quell' poitrine elle est divine...
Malgré moi je l'écrase un peu
Pardon Mamzelle fait's donc Monsieur.

Voyant combien elle était gentille
Dans sa garçonnière alors il l'emmena
Mais avant qu'il ne la déshabille
Pris de pudeur il lui murmura :

Refrain :
Pardon Mamzelle, 
Fait's donc Monsieur...
Répondit-elle 
D'un air gracieux
Chemis' jarr'telle 
P'tit pantalon
Tout cela dégringola...ce n'fut pas long !
Pardon Mamzelle 
Fait's donc Monsieur...
Et joie complète 
Souffrez que j'mette
Que j'mette au jour mon grand...amour !
Pardon Mamzelle 
Fait's donc Monsieur.

Mais Angèle se montra si tendre
Que deux heures après l'pauv' jeune homm' sur le flanc
A plusieurs fois mêm' dut se reprendre
Ne pouvant pas aller plus avant :

Refrain :
Pardon Mamzelle 
Fait's donc Monsieur...
Répondit-elle 
D'un air gracieux
Ces chos's nouvelles 
Me plais'nt beaucoup...
Pourquoi ne m'en donnez-vous qu'un avant-goût.
Pardon Mamzelle 
Fait's donc Monsieur...

I press you, caress you, and bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember the rambling rose you wear in your hair

Wipe sorrow's tears away

Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side

Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du
Du har inte en aning, du har inte en aning, aning
Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du
Du har inte en aning, att jag tänker på dig precis just nu

Hej jag heter petter är 33 nånting, vet knappt ut eller in, jag fattar ingenting
Jag e fylld av begär, varje dag det tär
Helt förblindad av mig själv och min egen karriär
Jag dricker för mycket, men det förnekar jag
Om du frågar mig om sanningen så tvekar jag
Saknar röka gräs, ba en liten gås
Jag hade nog torskat på droger om jag inte fått en psykos
Nog torskat på det mesta om jag inte hållt mig I skinnet
För det kostar o festa när du trollar med sinnet
Brukar skylla på trycket men jag krökar för mycket
En vinare varje kväll, det är så långt ifrån nykter
Försöker mörka mitt sätt men det blir ofta fel
Du kanske känner igen mitt problem
Det är då jag hatar mig själv, för jag e patetisk och vaknar upp 
I hell och ba känner mig så dekis

Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du
Du har inte en aning, du har inte en aning, aning
Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du
Du har inte en aning, att jag tänker på dig precis just nu

Hej jag heter petter jag är egocentrisk
Totalförändrad men på skalet identisk
Kan dö för min fru men det är inte sanningen nu
Jag kommer springa in I väggen o ba ramla itu
Innan jag fattar va som hänt, vilka broar jag bränt
Går 12-stegs programmet, dom o alla ja kännt
Brukar va svartsjuk som få, men de va värre då
När du lämna mig ibland blev hela världen grå
Jag vet knappt va som e bra med mig
Varför du kämpar på o ba vill va med mig
För jag träffar min familj för lite o när jag ser dom så jobbar 
jag konstant o ägnar knappast tid med dom
Jag tänker mest på pengar o mina framsteg
Men sanningen bakom ridån är nåt jag ibland ser
Det är då jag hatar mig själv, för jag e patetisk
De är som o leva I hell, fan vad jag e dekis

[Chorus]
Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du
Du har inte en aning, du har inte en aning, aning
Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du
Du har inte en aning, att jag tänker på dig precis just nu

Hej jag heter petter, mitt liv är som ditt
Vet inte om du sett det, men de liknar mitt shit
För jag ser allt svart på vitt, alltid missnöjd med nåt
Grubblar över saker som jag nog aldrig förstått
Deprimerad mellanåt, de jag bär på e svårt
Jag tycker synd om mig själv när jag jobbar för hårt
Lovar o inte håller, det som driver mig finns där
Jag gillar dom som delar mitt synsätt o flyger I min sfärd
Kanske tappat det helt, spelat för många spel
Målat in mig I ett hörn, fått en törn
Det är då jag hatar mig själv, å kommer på det
För jag har ingen jävla aning om vafan jag håller på med*

De felicidad
Y por qué te ahogas
Por la soledad
Di por qué me tomas, fuerte así, mis manos
Y tus pensamientos te van llevando

Yo te quiero tanto
Y porque será
Loco testarudo, no lo dudes más
Aunque en el futuro, haya un muro enorme
Yo no tengo miedo
Quiero enamorarme

No me ames, porque pienses que parezco diferente
Tú no piensas que es lo justo ver pasar el tiempo juntos
No me ames, que comprendo la mentira que sería
Si tu amor no merezco, no me ames, más quedate otro día

No me ames, porque estoy perdido, porque cambie el mundo
Porque es el destino, porque no se puede, somos un espejo
Y tú así serías lo que yo de mi reflejo

No me ames, para estar muriendo
Dentro de una guerra llena de arrepentimientos
No me ames, para estar en tierra, quiero alzar el vuelo
Con tu gran amor por el azul del cielo

No sé que decirte, esa es la verdad
Si la gente quiere, sabe lastimar
Tú y yo partiremos, ellos no se mueven
Pero en este cielo sola no me dejes

No me dejes, no me dejes, no me escuches, si te digo no me ames
No me dejes, no desarmes, mi corazón con ese no me ames
No me ames, te lo ruego, mi amargura déjame
Sabes bien, que no puedo, que es inútil, que siempre te amaré

No me ames, pues te haré sufrir con este corazón
Que se llenó de mil inviernos
No me ames, para así olvidarte de tus días grises
Quiero que me ames sólo por amarme
No me ames, tú y yo volaremos uno con el otro
Y seguiremos siempre juntos

Como dos cometas en la misma estela

Cuando Cuba sea libre, vamo' a celebrar
Somos una sola casa, los de aquí why los de allá
Cuando Cuba sea libre, vamo' a celebrar
Why seguro que muy pronto voy a poder regresar

Esperando, esperando:
Reunirme con mi pueblo
Una fiesta que seque es su llanto why cumpla sus sueños

Todos bailando felices brindando al destino
Dejando atrás tantos años de anhelos perdidos
Será el momento de juntos sanar corazones
Para aquel hombre que es libre no existen temores

Cuando Cuba sea libre, vamo' a celebrar
Yo conozco a más de uno que por mi camino va
Cuando Cuba sea libre, vamo' a celebrar
Siempre mantenla presente, no la vayas a olvidar
Cuando Cuba sea libre, vamo' a celebrar
Un pregón en Santa Clara lo repiten en la Habana
Cuando Cuba sea libre, vamo' a celebrar
Un son le quiero ofrecer a la tierra que me vio nacer

Por allá en Pinar de Río, vamo' a celebrar
Los aires libres de la Habana, vamo' a celebrar
En las playas de Matanza, vamo' a celebrar
Con caña why café de Las Villas, vamo' a celebrar
Afina los cueros Camagüey, vamo' a celebrar
Se oye el son allá en Oriente, vamo' a celebrar

Nunca olvides el camino de tu patria why tus amigos

Sal Da Vinci,"Dimenticarsi
Ora che le distanze sembrano dividerci
Forse è passato troppo in fretta
Questo illudersi
Toccare il fondo di una storia
Per ricredersi, viversi
E ritrovarsi
Senza paura di tornare sui tuoi passi
Anche se poi lungo la strada quei rimorsi
Faranno a botte coi ricordi
Scrivendo ancor di bianco
Le notti senza tempo
Nella mia mente ancora c'è
Quell'immagine di te
Che non so lasciare andare
Quello che voglio ormai non c'è
Apro gli occhi e sento che
Forse è tutto da rifare
Dimenticare
Fai come vuoi
Se c'è un temporale passerà
Vado via
Mi asciugherò
Sotto il cielo che mi porta a casa
Com'è triste questa tua città
Fai come vuoi
Ma fai la cosa giusta
E mettici l'anima
Se ce la fai senza di me
Dovrò imparare a fare come te
Basta sentirsi
Solo parole
Per riempire quei discorsi
Per ritornare sul perché
Ci siamo persi
Cercando una ragione nuova
Per confondersi
Chiedersi cosa rimane
Lampi di luce in una storia senza fine
Le mani fredde in una notte da scaldare
Mi mancheranno quei tuoi occhi
Scrivendo ancor di bianco
Le notti senza tempo
Nella mia mente ancora c'è
Quell'immagine di te
Che non so lasciare andare
Quello che voglio ormai non c'è
Apro gli occhi e sento che
Forse è tutto da rifare
Dimenticare
Fai come vuoi
Se c'è un temporale passerà
Asciugherò queste mie pene
Con un'altra, forse dieci, cento
O aspettando che ritorni tu
Fai come vuoi
Ma fai la cosa giusta
E mettici l'anima
Se ce la fai senza di me
Dovrò imparare a fare come te
Vado via (per sempre)
Vado via (ovunque)
Non ti lascio la mia nostalgia
La mia strada ora è tutta in salita
C'è da vivere senza di te
Fai come vuoi
Se ce la fai senza di me
Dovrò imparare a fare come te",Fai Come Vuoi,1995

Sal Salvador,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1963
Sal Salvador,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

Sal Salvador,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

We were playing kiss and tell then 
I watched you fly away

Well there's a diamond in my car
And it's shining like a star
I feel I'm coming home to you
'Cause there's a message in my soup
And it could be like yesterday
I wish you'd never gone away
And it's shining like a star
I feel I'm coming home to you",Motorbike to Heaven,1995
Salah Ananse,"You said you couldn't leave me after all that we'd been through
I believed you when you said we should both try something new
I was drowning inside here with a love that was so true
But you laughed right in my face and there was nothing I could do
Once I took a walk across the hill to see what I could see
I saw a light falling from the sky and land beneath a tree
The light it gave was oh, so bright that it took away my care
I ran back to the house to tell you but you were not there
When you've loved someone dearly it's so hard not to regret
Memories that have faded, suddenly you can't forget
I know I was not dreaming when you walked right out the door
Just a feeling that told me my love was gone for evermore
When you think you've found the key, the door just slips away
And so you walk the floor all night until the break of day
Somewhere in your mind you know that things will be alright
Because everything in life is equal just like the day and night
You said you couldn't leave me after all that we'd been through
I believed you when you said that we should both try something new

Tumbling and falling down the avalanche, ooh

So be quiet tonight
The stars shine bright
On this mountain of new fallen snow
But I will raise my voice into the void
You have left me nowhere to go

I love you so much and it's so bizarre
A mystery that goes on and on and on 
This is the best thing and the very most hard
And we don't get along

After countless appeals
We keep spinning our wheels
On this mountain of new fallen snow
So I let go the catch and we are over the edge
You have left me nowhere to go

I'm riding shotgun down the avalanche 

Sometimes you make me lose my will to live
And just become a beacon for your soul
But the past is stronger than my will to forgive
Forgive you or myself, well I don't know

I'm riding shotgun down the avalanche, ooh
Tumbling and falling down the avalanche, ooh

So be quiet tonight

Growin' up, didn't want to have nothing to do wit' you.
Make you hittin' everybody went to high school wit' you.
Want to play you close and jump in the pool wit' you.
I don't know what to do, but this much is true,
And in the hood, they all like to knock your career,
And turn right around when you hot a gear.
I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear;
That the man upstairs, he control this here.
And it's funny how soon as the money piles,
Everybody want to play with that brother now.
Run me down, but when the dough gets low, only a few friends roll, you know.
And Mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife,
Said ""Lynisse, please do something with your life.""
And how it's gon' play out, I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

And I remember when, I used to feen for calls;
When I hit number one I had to scream out calls.
Used to see my Mama strugglin', worn from work;
Told her when I made it big she never gonna work.
I used to wish at night that my brothers in the street,
Hustlin', shit, they would live to the light,
And see another day somehow, find another way I vow.
To all my soldiers I hold you down.
From standin' in the rain, to the rovers now.
I'm screamin your name, to warn you that the rollers is around.
To on-stage, throwin' it down.
No matter where you at, represent your hood.
No matter where I'm at, I'm representing my hood.
And how it's gon' all play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

I've opened up my eyes to a brighter day,
Nobody in the block gave their life away.
We all tryin' to take it easily,
And everybody want to make it seems is free.
Today it's all good, and it seemes so strange,
Since you look up in the hood now, things done changed.
Kids they used to be wheelies for blocks,
Is out ridin' their bikes, doin' wheelies for blocks,
And bitches on the bench, still gossipin', who's she slidin' in,
Who's she slidin' with, outside partyin'.
Old timers in the back playin' dominoes.
Kids freestyling, all kinds of flows.
Girls flow through with designer clothes.
It's day now, but you know how night time goes,

But no no no, I'm tired of this fight
I'm tired it's over, over

So turn back all the clocks and set your sight
Tell me do your wrists feel right?
With blood mixed in your pain,
Once they heal you won't feel the same
And this mishapen road, will let you go, why don't you go?
Step back, leave me now, please leave me now, my thoughts are sour
I'm scared of what I'll do tonight,
With clouded thoughts of angered spite

This argument achieves nothing but the worst towards everything,
We fought so hard now,
So dry your pretty eyes
They're sparkling tonight
Through the pain and shame and even though we are through
I still feel the same, I still feel the same
I can't ignore that we don't work
The only thing I do is hurt and,
Tear apart your fragile heart
And leave you needing more from silence

With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for

From that day, we'd never ever part

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

For all the times a look, said all we had to say
You played your part so well, a modern Romeo
You came on Cupid's wings and then you flew away

When you touch my face, when you call my name
I burned with desire, when you touch my face
When you call my name, I burned with desire
But you left me in the rain

For every sleepless night, forever in your arms
For every hour spent, lost in the reverie
You broke your promises, no shame and no regrets
You burned the bridges too an endless mystery

When you touch my face, so beautiful
When you call my name, my name
I burned with desire, when you touch my face
So beautiful, when you call my name, my name
I burned with desire but you left me in the rain

Dime piece, that's what she is
Sexy sexy, sexy sexy

[Big Moe]
Fell up in the club nigga see this cutie pie
See what's going down on a Friday night
I was on a drink so a nigga feeling fine
She was over there giving up the freaky eye
Stepped to her, with the drink in my hand
Do you have a man, or do you have a girlfriend
You never know, you might be creeping
So what you think little mama you and I
I know you heard this once too many times
So what you sipping on, little Chardonnay
Can I but you another drink if it's okay
(Every little city I go) everybody know my name Big Moe
(You looking good head to toe)
You a dime piece baby for sure

[Chorus: x2]

[Big Moe]
Fell up in the club once again the next night
(What you was blowing Moe-Yo man)
Tripping on the X or jar so tight
I wish that I would of hit the light
(Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling)
She was the finest broad in the club that night
(She was like music)

[Tyte Eyez]
Baby you must be from Tennessee
Cause you the only ten, that I see
A straight up, dime piece from your head to your feet
A nigga can't help or put you in the diamonds on me
We at the bar buying drinks I'm really digging your style
Small waist, bow legged straight white pearly smile
It'll only be a while 'fore I'm getting your digits
Best believe every time you see me, a dime with me see man

[Chorus: x2]

[Isis Re]
Even though you checking me
I've been checking you too
So don't cross the law, you a dime for sure

Salim,"Kevin, this is Daryl from Long Beach
Man uh, I was wondering if you could uh, play a song for me
Me and my lady goin' through a few thangs, see
And I'm not feelin' very well right now

Yeah, I hear ya, I know how you feel
I've been there, hell we've all been there
For you and all you playas who got bumped off the playin' field
This is the song for you
187.4 on your F.M. dizzal, W-BALLZ

[Repeat: x4]
A dirty ho's drawls
That was the cause of it all

Pimpin' hustlin' playin' hoes is all I know
With my homeys on the mash and a pocket full of cash
What more can a nigga ask for
With my strap in my lap and my niggas back to back
A motherfucka' didn't wanna see me
Then along came his girl, finest woman in the world
That broad been to my knees

[Repeat: x4]
A dirty ho's drawls
That was the cause of it all

(Now I, don't trust no hoe
And do you, know that's how it goes)
I never thought you were the one
That would try to get a nigga like Ms Spunk

[Repeat: x4]
A dirty ho's drawls
That was the cause of it all

I know you're all in big ones from the start
I really didn't need to, play your heart
But you still have the good looks, DPG blood
You're the only one that, I love 

Make me wanna climb up D-P-G
Make me wanna moan make me wanna scream
Make me wanna climb up D-P-G
Make me wanna moan make me wanna scream
Make me wanna climb up D-P-G
Make me wanna moan make me wanna scream

See as I say it, something about the power of the pussy
It even breaks gangsters down
Bitch tricked me out of my players license

[Repeat: x4]
A dirty hoe's drawls 
That was the cause of it all

I'll get over you
I gotta get over you
Before I've been a fool

Salim,"Oh no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

What if I said, love was a lie though
It was more like hate with a eye closed
And the other eye had the eye rolled
That's contempt and ignorance, I know
But what do I know?
Only thing that I seen was the inside of a blindfold
And you just as blind as me
So how I look? Asking you where do I go
I and I keep high hope alive though
That loves not a lie it just likes to lie low
Likes to hide right there in plain sight
And you just got to find it with your eyes, closed
And in the dark, see the part, of your partner, that's the heart
If you die it's like apartheid
We can bring it back to the

It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
No, it's not designed to make you feel love
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
Oh no, yeah

On second thought leave apartheid in the grave
But the heart part, that can be saved
The hard part's making sure it don't break into little sharp pieces that are hard to replace
Hard to find spare arteries these days
In decent shape, and know things decay
And at these rates you're gon' need to be paid
Like 3D wage just to see D. Wade
To the place that sells these parts
That you couldn't keep safe from the street art
So why would we waste our art on your mistake?
When you was driving reckless, didn't pump these brakes
Hate to have to shoot you down
A fine running heart makes a soothing sound
It's junkyard love in your future, pal
Didn't appreciate now, bet you do

It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
(Yeah, yeah, make you feel)

And in the futuristic love will be reduced to physics
Computer digits made by robots
That use statistics, algorithms, and group logistics
The mood-resistant downloadable thing that's used specific
Easily updated with few commitments
Can find it's way home if you forget it
Say, maybe on a starship tour
Heard a knock at your starship door
It was the girl that you had met at the starship bar
Had a dance on the starship floor
But then you got starship sick
So you had to run to the starship store
And then you got those starship pills
But when you came back she wasn't there no more
She says, ""Hope you got a starsuit at the starship store
Maybe we can take a trip to take a look at the stars around parsec 4""
And it was the most beautiful thing you both had ever seen in your lives before
And she pulled out her love, so you reached down in your starsuit for
But your pockets empty, now the moments passing
It'll probably never happen like this again
I guess it didn't work out for you in the end

It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
Oh, no, baby",It's Not Design,2017
Salim,"Thank you! Uh, check, check

When you got popped up and you got locked up
And the block shot up and your girl knocked up
And your kids be like, ""Who gonna watch us?""
Your mama, they Nana
When you ball too hard or your money got spent
So you got kicked out, you ain't have no rent
But you still had a place where you could go
Tell me where you went, your mama

Soon as they let me outta jail
Went straight to my mama's house
Need someone I can talk to
And a little more time to work all these dramas out
That lawyer money, that bail money
Those letters in the mail never fail you, homie
Who visit when niggas don't visit?
Man she the realest
Boy let me tell you somethin' you better love your mama

Said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches
And I love my car
More than I love my heart

Yeah, now some mamas might be your confidant
Some mamas just good for shoes
Some mamas might be your drinkin' buddy
Some mamas might not be cool
Some mamas might wait 'til you get home
Some mamas might come up to your school
And fuck you up in front of your friends
'Cause you don't make the rules
Really thought that you was doin' it today
Now you sittin' there lookin' all stupid in your face
When you get home just tell her you're sorry
And put on this song, start movin' to the bass
Boy cut that shit off
Goddamn, mama, they made this song for you
Said through the party and the problems
Gotta honor my mama
So that's what I'm tryna do

Said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches
And I love my car
More than I love my heart

Now some might think their mama ain't perfect
She is
All in her face, better get in your place
You're one of her goddamn kids
Now some might think their mama ain't worth it
She is
Gotta help her out no matter what it's 'bout
No matter whatever she did
Now some might think their mama ain't here
She lives
She lives
She lives

Salim Grant,"(Bad Azz talking)
I hear everybody say they put they heart into they music
Blessed with the time, I want to share this piece of my life with y'all
I mean all y'all
I dedicate this to the whole wide world
And everybody who's in love with life, feel me, you know what I mean
(Life is full of hard times and then you die)

I gotta thank God for real life 'cause man invented violent death
My generation's in love with sin, I want to live
I want to see some more kids, Martini, stress, a little head
'Cause my son ain't here and only God cures fears
Ain't no woman 'bout a dollar, 'cause what we need, we got it
Even God gave it to us, so one of his people bought it
See change, that's ??? ??? favor this time
He sent the angel to sprinkle some flavor on this rhyme
Sent the poor folks, rice, chicken wings and hope
And for Christmas all the kids got brand new coats
I got a letter from my uncle in jail, he said he love us
Ain't no life in this hell, and only friend is God above us
I told him 'hold on', Pac said 'life goes on'
And what's the price of freedom, if they was wrong we could teach 'em
Damn, you don't know the strength of together
We in the house of smiles if outside this bad weather 'til the sun comes

(Chorus)
In the ghetto we hang all day, play all night
Gotta give thanks for life
In the ghetto it's on all day (it's on), just keep it tight
In the ghetto we hang all day, play all night
We gotta give thanks for life
In the ghetto it's on all day (it's on), just keep it tight

I gotta thank God when I wake up and pray before I go to sleep
And hustle all day, 'cause life ain't cheap
The cost of living is an arm and a leg, so crawl around
Tryna' eat and get back on your feet
If you could sleep, you could try this everyday of the week 'til you deceased
You could sacrifice your life to see peace, with all the grief
Can't buy you a minute of sleep, so stay up
Smoke a blunt and get drunk, like us, don't give a fuck
Thugged out all night, 'til the sun come up
Ridin doubles on a bike, probably playin with my life
Sayin 'that's the police' when we see some headlights
They dead right when they tell you that life ain't long
But keep it tight, and it'll be aight
And I don't lie about nothin, know the truth about me, I be for real
If I lie, you don't know how I feel
It's hard to love the place
somethin you ain't never had the structure to feel

(Chorus)

Before I go I want to leave this here, with your acceptance
This experience here, has really sharpened my perception
And I'd love to stay, but we all gotta go
Take ya patience, it's a while before you reach ya destination
It's a lot of love here, it's just mixed with all the hate
And I been waitin, I ain't seen no fallin stars or no comet
I was lookin for a sign he said 'I'm it'
I hit the blunt and dumped the ashes and told the homeboys 'stop it'
What gangstas gotta do as saviors and prophets
Nothin, ain't no connection at all
Except the fact that we created by the All Mighty God
That ain't enough to stand up and clap your hands for this song
'Ain't no supportin Him by myself, I can't stand up for the cause'
Damn, you don't know the strength of together
Didn't wonder when they talked about the power in numbers
I'm the ghetto and I love the hood, what you wonder

(Chorus) 2x",It's on All Day,2001
