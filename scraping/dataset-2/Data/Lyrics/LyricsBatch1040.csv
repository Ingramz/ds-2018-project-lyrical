Stanley Clarke,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1982
Stanley Clarke,"One day the boy decided
To let them know the way he felt inside
He could not stand to hide it
His mother, she broke down and cried

Oh, my father
Why don't you talk to me now?
Oh, my mother
Do you still cry yourself to sleep?

Are you still proud of your little boy?
Don't be afraid
(Be afraid)
You don't have to hideaway

The boy, he was rejected
By the people that he cared for
It's not what they expected
But he could not keep it secret anymore

Far from home now
Waiting by the telephone
There's a new world
You can make it on your own

Are you still proud of your little boy?
Don't be afraid
(Be afraid)
You don't have to hide away, no

Don't be afraid
Love will mend your broken wing
Time will slip away
Learn to be brave

Don't be afraid
Love will mend your broken wing
Time will slip away
Learn to be brave

Oh, my father
Why don't you talk to me now?
Oh, my mother
Do you still cry yourself to sleep?

Are you still proud of your little boy?
Don't be afraid
(Be afraid)
You don't have to hide away, no

Don't be afraid
Love will mend your broken wing
Time will slip away
Learn to be brave

Stanley Clarke,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you",Overjoyed,1986
Stanley Clarke,"Funny how time flies when you're having fun... Oh baby
Funny how time flies when you're having fun... Oh baby

Just when it seemed the fun began... ooh...F

Funny how time flies when you're having fun
Funny how time flies when you're having fun

But time never ends... Let's find the time
To get together once again... someday soon

Stanley Clarke,"Through all these years
You've always been there
And we've been through hard times
Still somehow you care

Fighting through our fears
And holding back the tears
I still love you
More and more each day

I'm searching for the words
The right things to say
And I knew right from the start
We'd never ever part

Oh, sweet lady
You've become my everything
Ooh, baby
You're the light inside of me
Sweet lady
Now forever we will be together

Our love has grown
As our lives have changed
Just like the southern spring
Pushing back the rain

And the seasons come and go
But one thing remains for sure

Oh, sweet lady
You've become my everything
Ooh, baby
You're the light inside of me
Sweet lady
Now forever we will be

And one thing I know for sure
You're worth fighting for

Oh, sweet lady
You've become my everything
Ooh, baby
You're the light inside of me
Sweet lady
Now forever we will be

Sweet lady

",Lady,1990
Stanley Clarke,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru,2000
Stanley Clarke,"Woo!

Politix, heh heh
Check it out
Check it, check it

Yo, I grab mothaf***** and throw 'em across the room
Hit 'em with the boom, bam, Gotti
Might body slam a n****
Drop that cat even if he is bigger
See, I know more Kung Fu than Hoof Digger
And I smack a n**** before I squeeze the trigga
Let me hit ya with a smack to the grill
And move you back to the real
You suckas act like ya thrilled
Your whole style's chump, tryna front like you dumb
Huh, what, you just a drunk f***** punk
About to get your nose broke, nobody likes those folk
Watch out for them brothas with them swelled flows
You tryna get away, we stickin' you like velcro
I'm steady steppin' over all the posers
I spit the cool lyrics and it froze ya
Just for a second made ya think
Realize we on a break, no time to blink
The future's now, products of life and times
Be responsible and use your mind
'cause I'm quick on my feet like a kick from Jack D
That you did not expect, now there's pain in your neck
Shake it off, yo, you gon' live
Just pay more attention to the gifts we give
Bout to get swung on, bringin' violence to me
I ain't f***** with why'all, so don't be f***** with me
You could get swung on if you ain't actin' right
Did you ever think you would get smacked tonight?

Swingin' on 'em
Left rights, right lefts
Upper cuts

Yo, whatever bulls*** you could bring some
My Kung Fu's weigh a ton, about to swing one
Rock you, knock you and I sock you
Lock you, stop you, chop you, trick and drop you
I swung with Kung, but now it's time for hip-hop fool

A fight scene at a club, ain't enough love
Dope beats get hug, focus precise, this thug
All chromes, why'all swept under the rug
Bodies drug, sucka what, show love
Styles and tactics are not ?efwitable?
Don't attempt.. you want to limp
Futuristic flow, quite terrific like the glow in the baby's eye
We be them guys

Get swung on, bringin' violence to me
I ain't f***** with why'all, so don't be f***** with me
I figure to treat a n**** like a punchin' bag
If he disrespects my space and gets up in my face
Yo, back up, you better back up
Do I gotta hit you?
And get into an altercation with the n***** with you?
I catch that little faker with the hate naked
I swing (bump bump) like we in Jamaica
Yo, we all got fists but why'all got dissed
Whatever, whatever n****, it's all Politix

Stanley Clarke,"He sits in your room, his tomb with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
You know that he has no intentions
Of looking your way unless it's to say
That he needs you to test his inventions

Babe, come, crawl out your window
Use your hands and your legs, it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him anytime you want to

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels?
When I try to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
Yeah, if he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it

Babe, please crawl out your window
Use your hands and your legs, it won't ruin you
Now how you gonna say that he will haunt you?
When you could go back to him anytime you want to

He look so righteous while your face is so changed
As you sit on the box that you keep him on
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views and their face is so bruised
Come on out, the dark is just beginning

Babe, please come out your window
Use your hands and your legs, it won't ruin you
How can you say that he will haunt you?
When you can go back to him anytime you want to

You got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend
If you won't come out your window
You got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend
If you won't come out your window

You got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend
If you won't come out your window
Yeah, a lot of nerve to say you are my friend
If you won't come out your window

Come on, please come out your window

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Stanley Holloway,"There's a famous seaside place called Blackpool
That's noted for fresh air and fun
And Mr. and Mrs. Ramsbottom
Went there with young Albert, their son
A fine little lad were young Albert
All dressed in his best, quite a swell
He'd a stick with an 'orse's 'ead 'andle;
The finest that Woolworth's could sell
They didn't think much to the ocean
The waves they were piddlin' and small
There were no wrecks and nobody drownded
'Fact, nothin' to laugh at at all!
So, seeking for further amusement
They paid, and went into the zoo
Where they'd lions and tigers and camels
And cold ale and sandwiches, too
There were one great big lion called Wallace
Whose nose was all covered with scars;
He lay in a som-no-lent posture
With the side of 'is face on the bars
Now Albert 'ad 'eard about lions-
'Ow they was ferocious and wild;
To see lion lyin' so peaceful
Just didn't seem right to the child
So straightway the brave little feller
Not showin' a morsel of fear
Took 'is stick with the 'orse's 'ead 'andle
And stuck it in Wallace's ear
You could see that the lion din't like it
For givin' a kind of a roll
'E pulled Albert inside the cage with 'im
And swallered the little lad - 'ole!
Now Mother 'ad seen this occurrence
And not knowin' what to do next
She 'ollered ""Yon lion's et Albert!""
An' Father said ""Ee, I am vexed.""
They complained to an animal keeper
Who said ""My, wot a nasty mis'ap;
Are you sure it's your boy 'e's eaten?""
Pa said, ""Am I sure? There's 'is cap!""
The manager 'ad to be sent for;
'E came and 'e said ""Wot's to-do?""
Ma said ""Yon lion's et Albert
And 'im in 'is Sunday clothes, too!""
Father said ""Right's right, young feller-
I think it's a shame and a sin
To 'ave our son et by a lion
And after we paid to come in.""
The manager wanted no trouble;
He took out his purse right away
Sayin' ""'Ow much to settle the matter?""
Pa said ""Wot do you usually pay?""
But Mother 'ad turned a bit awkward
When she saw where 'er Albert 'ad gone
She said ""No, someone's got to be summonsed!""
So that was decided upon
And off they all went to p'lice station
In front of a Magistrate chap;
They told what 'ad 'appened to Albert
And proved it by showing 'is cap
The Magistrate gave 'is opinion
That no one was really to blame
And 'e said that 'e 'oped the Ramsbottoms
Would 'ave further sons to their name
At that Mother got proper blazin':
""And thank you, sir, kindly,"" said she-
""Wot, spend all our lives raisin' children
To feed ruddy lions? Not me!""",The Lion and Albert,1993

I'm an ordinary man,
Who desires nothing more than an ordinary chance,
to live exactly as he likes, and do precisely what he wants...
An average man am I, of no eccentric whim,
Who likes to live his life, free of strife,
doing whatever he thinks is best, for him,
Well... just an ordinary man...

BUT, Let a woman in your life
and your serenity is through,
she'll redecorate your home,
from the cellar to the dome,
and then go on to the enthralling fun of overhauling you...

Let a woman in your life,
and you're up against a wall,
make a plan and you will find,
that she has something else in mind,
and so rather than do either you do something else that neither likes at all

You want to talk of Keats and Milton, she only wants to talk of love,
You go to see a play or ballet, and spend it searching for her glove,
Let a woman in your life and you invite eternal strife,
Let them buy their wedding bands for those anxious little hands...
I'd be equally as willing for a dentist to be drilling than to ever let
a woman in my life,

I'm a very gentle man, even tempered and good natured who you never hear complain,
Who has the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein,
A patient man am I, down to my fingertips, 
the sort who never could, ever would, let an insulting remark escape his lips
Very gentle man...

But, Let a woman in your life, and patience hasn't got a chance,
she will beg you for advice,
your reply will be concise, and she will listen very nicely,
and then go out and do exactly what she wants!!!

You are a man of grace and polish, who never spoke above a hush,
all at once you're using language that would make a sailor blush,
Let a woman in your life, and you're plunging in a knife,
Let the others of my sex, tie the knot around their necks, 
I prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition than to ever let a
woman in my life

I'm a quiet living man,
who prefers to spend the evening in the silence of his room,
who likes an atmosphere as restful as an undiscovered tomb,
A pensive man am I, of philosophical joys,
who likes to meditate, contemplate, far for humanities mad inhuman noise,
Quiet living man....

But, let a woman in your life, and your sabbatical is through,
in a line that never ends comes an army of her friends, 
come to jabber and to chatter and to tell her what the matter is with YOU!,
she'll have a booming boisterous family,
who will descend on you en mass,
she'll have a large Wagnerian mother, with a voice that shatters glass,

I've grown accustomed to her face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs

Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" ev'ry day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

Before Aremus, I used to date this well to do ugly bootlegger
He used to like to take me out and show me off
Ugly guys like to do that

Once it said in the paper
""Gangland's Al Capelli
Seen with cute red-headed Corenne""
That was me, I clipped it out and saved it

Look I'm gonna tell you the truth
Not that the truth really matters
But I'm gonna tell you anyway

The thing is see, I'm older than I ever intended to be
And all my life I wanted to be a dancer
In Vaudeville, ooh yeah
Have my own act, but no, no, no
They always turned me down

It was one big world full of no, life
Then Amus came along, sweet, safe, Amus who never says no
You know, some guys are like mirrors
And when I catch myself in Amus's face
I'm always a kid, you could love a guy like that

Look now I gotta tell you
Now I hope this ain't too crude
In the bed department, Amus was zero
I mean when we went to bed
He made love to me like he was
Fixing a carburetor or something
I love ya, honey I love ya

Anyway to make a long story short
I started fooling around
Then I started screwing around
Which is fooling around without dinner

I gave up the Vaudeville idea
Because well, after all those years
He sorta figured opportunities just passed you by
Ooh, it ain't, oh, no, no, no, no, babe, it ain't
If this film guy gets me off
And with all this publicity, now I got me a world full of yes

The name on everybody's lips is gonna be Roxie
The Lady raking in the chips is gonna be Roxie
I'm gonna be a celebrity that means somebody everyone knows
They're gonna recognize my eyes
My hair, my teeth, my boobs, my nose

From just some dumb mechanic's wife
I'm gonna be Roxie
Who says that murder's not an art
And who in case she doesn't hang
Can say she started with a bang

I gotta get me some boys
I'm gonna get me a whole bunch of boys
They're gonna wait outside in line to get to see Roxie

And I'll appear in a Lavaliere that goes all the way down to my waist
Here a ring, there a ring, everywhere a ring-a-ling
But always in the best of taste

I'm a star and they love me and I love them
And they love me for loving them
And I love them for loving me and we love each other
That's because none of us got enough love in our childhood
And that's showbiz, kid

She's giving up her hum-drum life
I'm gonna be a Roxie

He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me

Through the mist, through the woods
Through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast he's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home 'til he's dead
Good and dead

Kill the Beast

Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage to the sticking place

We're counting on Gaston to lead the way

Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow
For in times like this, they'll do just as I say

There's a beast running wild, there's no question
But I fear the wrong monster's released

Sally forth! tally ho!
Grab your sword, grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go

We don't like what we don't understand in fact it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the Beast

Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger's just increased
Raise the flag, sing the song

And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong

I could die, I could die, I could die,

Stanley Turrentine,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still

And he never gives an answer

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Y el pavimento adquiera un brillo de charol
Que tu sonrisa me devuelva la ilusión que ayer perdí

Que grande es sentir mi corazón latir así, henchido de emoción
Poder oír tu dulce voz, besarte con pasión y acariciarte
Y no perder ni un solo instante y ser para ti un gran amor

Running away could lead you further astray

Stanley Wayne Mathis,"Zazu, why am I not loved?
I am that rare and awesome thing
I'm every inch a king
Yet I feel a twinge of doubt
As I go walk about

Hey, boss!
When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide?

Reggie who?
Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored

Hey, boss!
Oh, what is it?
We got a bone to pick with you
There's no food, no water
Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no
stinkin' entrees!

Oh, you and your petty complaints. You don't know what real hunger is. 
Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being

I had that once. It was worms
No, no, no... it's like an itch... deep, persistent, profound
That's it-- worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is
hunker down and scoot
Thanks for the tip. Ingrates! If it weren't for me you'd be beating off
buzzards for your next bite! 

Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?
It doesn't matter if it's fresh
I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in

Are you blaming me?
Oh no, it's the lionesses
You are so adored
Oh, you are so adored

That's more like it
But what I'd give for one more hit
Of wildebeest kielbasa
Or maybe hornbill on the spit...

Oh, how I miss Mufasa
Mufasa?! Mufasa?! How dare you! I told you never to mention that name! 
Note taken. I shall never mention ""M-m-m"" again
Even in death, his shadow looms over me
There he is!
No! There he is!
And there!

Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting
headaches! 

I am perfectly fine!
I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered
I am reviled
I'm idolized
I am despised
I'm keeping calm
I'm going wild!

I tell myself I'm fine
Yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am, no you're not
I tell myself I'm fine

No you're not, yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am
No you're not
Yes, no, yes, no, who am I talking to...?

Oh, pull yourself together, Sire!
Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu...?
Yes, Sire?
Nobody loved me, there's the rub, not even as a cub
What did my brother have that I don't have?

Do you want the short list or the long?
Whatever!
Well, he had adoring subjects... a loving family... a devoted queen... 
That's it! I need a queen!
A what?
A queen, man! A queen! Without a queen, what am I? A dead end, no line, no
descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will
be mine! Immortality will be mine!

Scar
Ah, Nala... Your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My how you've
grown

Scar, you have got to do something. We're being forced to overhunt
She's got those assets feminine
You're the king. Control the hyenas
I have to make her mine
You're destroying the Pridelands
Nobility in every gene
If we don't stop now.. Don't you see...
She has to be my queen
...there's still a chance for things to be all right again... 
Come, sweet Nala
It's written in the stars

What are you doing? Are you listening to me?
We'll create a host of little Scars
What are you talking about?
Tell me I'm adored
Get away from me
Tell me I'm adored
Oh, Nala... you know how I loathe violence... One way or another, you will
be mine

""Man does not eat by bread alone.""
Some philosophies are clear...

Sally:
"" Leave your message at the sound of the tone.""

Schroeder:
Some take a lifetime!

Sally:
Mine take a minute!

Schroeder:

To complete his brilliant Ninth Symphony...

Sally:

Schroeder:
(spoken)I can't stand it!

Sally:
(spoken) "" I can't stand it!"" I like it!

Je t'envoie mon décor
Je t'envoie mes sourires des jours
Où je me sens plus fort
Je t'envoie mes voyages
Mes jours d'aéroport
Je t'envoie mes plus belles victoires
Sur l'ironie du sort

De mon village à cent à l'heure
Où les docteurs greffent les cœurs
Où les millions de gens
Se connaissent si mal
Je t'envoie comme un papillon
À une étoile

I follow two my behind a truck with half a mil
I make my first stop at my homeboys ranch 
I ask him ""what's in the bag"" he says ""two acres of plants
It's easy going in but hell gettin out
I want to make this paper and I think I know how
surprise surprise I done made it back home
in an ice cream truck ""who want to buy a snow cone""
  
Hook - repeat 2X

I'm going to the valley
Vauco the valley
I'm goin to the valley what you think fo
  
[4] - From Texas to Cali we get our ye from the valley
We be hustlin on blocks moving in and out the alley
We call it medicine that's what you need when you get sick
Sometimes it's hard rock sometimes it's white pearl brick
Across, across the state line just me and my girlfriend
From powder to pine I got money on my mind
Stop wasting all my time and get me over to the spot
Unload all the cargo and meet me at the docks
  
[5] - Going back to the valley staying on top of my game
Meeting up wit my bitches snow white and mary jane
Only thing that ever mattered to me 
Stacking dollars shit we making a week
Who the cowards who the killas who's the niggas wit scrilla
Felt all up in they pockets rocking fo' niggas that try to kill us
Then maybe later you bitches bother me 
You wanted to pay you too late don't bother calling me
  
[6] - Going to the valley fo' soldiers in a caddy 
And in the back of the caddy got fifty pound of smally
Tryed to jack but can't catch me
I just keep that paper stacking
Always packin never slacking 
leaving you hoe ass niggas unhappy
Chopping burs when able, fucking hoes on the table
Watching cable in a Sable, Dope House is the label
Selling em three for ten to my closest friends
Rolling back to H-towm big body Benz
  
hook
  
[7] - Houston Texas cowboy wit a dime and a fiesta saddle
And I'm moving mo weight then a whole herd of cattle
I grip up the grain blowing up the panhandle
mobile phone on scramble cause rap hustlin is a gamble
Brick moving these H dudes gonna keep you grooving pursuing
Shit, hell on my surella ice water lyrical good fella
SPM got the hook up, say watch out 
I hit the highway, let twenkies crawl
I'm going to the valley
  
[8] - Man I'm flipping up to Mexico to hit some licks
In a Navigator bus bringing back some bricks
Get to checkpoint now I'm past the border
tell my guy alemar to play some more
Fat money cause we in the mix
I got that white girl and that stinky bitch
Better ryders and roamers can't really ask 
""We going out T?"" ""Bitch I'm headed to the valley
So I'm out about to make some money
Pull up to a trailor wit about 800
Unload it I flip it get paid let's ride
Chunk a deuce to the guys and I'm back to Southside
Cruisin wit a couple of pines
Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house
  
[9] - Cruisin to the valley checking up on me campos
Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops
Flying real low to avoid the cops
Weighing my weed on a digital beam
Wrapping it in a plastic quick so I can make my green
My windows are tinted so nobody sees in it
Wit mary jane and snow white the sky's the limit
  
Hook

[10] - My package is small, stack em in the entire wall
Fuck the chotha must be loca
Everything a nigga want make it to the border wit the motha
Pockets rising better quit sizing me up
But these coffe beans fucking the smell up
What's up, back in the city 
de bull lada I'm talking pronto
Call me the head honcho start a new revloution
like a back poncho 
He yah see yah wouldn't want to be yah
Gots to flee, start the G
Switch the ride I'm headed back to the valley

They way that we roll down south
Start baby wit dope house josie wells gonna 
there ain't nuthin funna then being and outlaw runna 
stunna pimpin in a humma millennium smuggler
Dope game juggla, no nuts no glory
Real mobsters, they never worry
but we ain't home yet so don't get happy
we ain't paid Officer O'Malley
Thinking of my profits going to the valley 
It's all cavi
  
[12] - I'm flipping to the valley federalies
Fucking wit michael decodie motorcycles
?? cruises my disciples 
I'm the type to crew smoke two and synas
wit my G's I'll hunt you

Primadonnas big tymers, playa, and rob reports
benz sports,courts, naked hoes, lascivious resorts
I get short my last resort tell L
to keep the Cali cause little down wit his essays 
parlaying down in the valley

[13] - I'm a creep 59
to the end of the rainbow land of the llello
Dope fiends on my payroll, got rocks to blow
behind the stop and go they holla 
goodness graious great balls of snow
Don't speed or trip when you see the lights
cause they can tell you're nervous just by looking in your eyes
in H-Town the business in booming
but it won't last long if you don't know what you're doing

Got me creepin for mi ruka and my boys blowing swishas

me and Mr. Smokee, playin' the lo-key
puffin; on L's, I never fell for the ohkee...

[MS]
...Doke! when your plan goes up in smoke
like a Bob Marley spliff being smoked to a roach
but on the contrair, if I smoked an ounce a day
it'll only make a mess when I bounce this way

[Tek]
The jail scene ain't workin' no more, got me punchin' a wall
fam put a block on the phone, won't accept collect calls
and to top it all off, heard my co-defendant turned canary
stutter steeping through the house lookin' all scary
I'm just waiting to face him in the mess hall
thinkin' 'bout the Tyson loss, gettin' my reps off
and the niggas in the world that I used to roll with
don't even write scripts, that's the ohkeedoke shit

[CHORUS]

[Starang]
Niggas say Starang's smooth, just like ice without cube
I'm nice without dudes, on my motherfuckin' track
niggas call me Starang, others call me Jack
but if you call and I'm not home, you can call me back
but no matter where i'm at, I always rock the show
the niggas next up on the mic, y'all niggas gots to go
Phantom of the Opera, yo I blow scenes North, South, East
West, fuck your chest dukes, get it out your mouthpiece

[Tek]
(I was) laid back sippin' Beck's, gently cleaning off a black Tek
JP's cuban link got my neck laced (shine baby)
steal the show like a thief, blow without a trace
see so many wannabe's steadily tryin' to be me
act grimy, crimies constantly scheme how to fi me
out to get the bonus, becoming assed out like the homeless
no disresepct intended, but it's a fucked up world we live in

[MS]
My lust for hip hop got me strivin' for perfection
and when my inner glow shine, you vision my reflection
and now chumps had to get a closer glimpse at it
as sweat trickle down your face, you break into a panic

[CHORUS]

(phonecall 1-900-GET-DA-BOOT)

Smell my balls!

Yo what up, b****, I'mma tell you a tale
'Bout how Ash Ketchum got his a** sent to jail
Beat the Elite Four, won the tournament war
But he just couldn't get the same rush as before
Fat and depressed his life had gone south
So he turned to Pikachu and then he punched him in the Meowth
He felt so alive, he felt so real
He beat all his Pokemon, with his fists of Registeel
He got arrested for domestic violence
It was a crazy motherf***in' Cacturne of events
He said that Pika's bruises happened on the stairs when he fell
They called some Granbulls*** and threw that b**** in a cell

Rock on
This is a f***ed up tale of Pokemon, gone wrong, gone wrong
That's right
This s*** is tight when Egoraptor's at the mic
B****

Ash was in trouble as soon as he arrived
He Magnemite not make it outta prison alive
His lawyer ran in with a big state trooper
Bringin' fiery news, like Charmanderson Cooper
""It's your lucky day, Pika posted your bail""
So Ash found his little friend outside of the jail
But Pikachu was different, he had mentally snapped
Ash was Chandelured into his deadly trap
Pika pulled out a gun, and then he said with a cry
""Suck a yellow dick, bro, I choose you to die""
""Don't do it!"" yelled Ash ""You know I've got your back""
But Pika pulled the trigger, shot him twice in the sack

Holy f***
I don't know if you've been shot in the nuts
Spoiler: it sucks
And oh, Squirtle, gotta catch 'em all
But they might just ruin your balls

Hey what's up, old man

I see that you're embarking on another epic quest
You're gonna use your ocarina to rescue the princess

I can always count on you for help and friendly advice
Though I've never seen a sword of quite that shape or size

Welcome to couples' therapy. I am Dr. Wily

Don't question it. Shut up. Just tell me the problem over this hot beat

Okay

Well, you see, Doc, I got a pretty nice life
A mega house with two kids and a hot mega wife
But I got a little problem with my android bride
When it comes to making love she's never satisfied

We've been fucking for decades, sex has gotten routine
We gotta spice that shit up, I'm not a total machine
I'm sick of all the romance and the cuddles and the love
It's time to get dirty and do all the weird stuff
It would be seeming to me that the problem here
Is you don't listen to your wife, she is being clear

But she says the same thing like a tape recorder

Quiet, the doctor is talking, there must be order
(Sorry, I'm not evil anymore)
You must beat the Robot Masters to acquire skills
And then use them on your wife when she is getting drilled
Maybe she likes shocks from Elec Man's beam
Or get burned by fireballs
She's a freaky man's dream

Is that what you want, hon, a Robot Master?

Get out and do it you stupid bastard
Your marriage would be healthy like pure spring water
Now leave my office before you are slaughtered

Fine I'll kick ass if it saves my marriage
For the satisfaction of my lady's undercarriage
First I'll take out Fire Man, not much of a test
Oh, your weakness is ice? I would've never fuckin' guessed
Now Ice Man is here, this shouldn't take up too much time
Oh, is your weakness fire? You just blew my fuckin' mind
I cut Cut Man and he's gonna need stitches
Bomb and Elec Man just went down like little bitches

Wait, you douchebag, I'm gonna end your life
I am Mega Man Zero and I'm here to plow your wife
I bring sex moves from the future and my skills are vast
Like my Super Double Ultra Mega Nutbuster Cum Blast. (oh!)
Women can't resist my blonde, flowing locks
I'll slap a stamp right on my package
And deliver your wife the cock
My shiny armor is red, the color of victory
While your fruity suit is blue, like your balls will soon be

Wait, what are you doing?

Mega dick, activate!

So Mega Man harnessed all the powers of the masters
And killed Zero with his mega laser schlong blaster
And then he banged his wife until she screamed ""Yes more""
Then she loved him again cause she's a shallow whore

Starcastle,"In the splitting of the sun,
Suddenly beckoning these to come
Melting all the senses numb 
Sensibilities defiled,
Vulcanous creatures delight, burn wild
Tearing at the Fire Child 

Lost in time 
Shattering the mirror's new design
Broken colors falling through the line
Scattered faces unto the night 

In the impulse of delight
Those remaining will catch the sight
Eager to renew their flight 
With the dawning of the child
Vulcanous creatures return, burn wild
Glowing with the Fire Child",To the Fire Wind,1974
Starcastle,"Just as we turn
To the wind our eyes have
Lost their chill
Clean as the motion of time
Across my brow
Though the minutes
Just of what they are not now
The stars have gone to guard
The open sky

Just as the voice of the sea may writhe
Stars alike
So may the rivers of dawn
Reveal our days
Turning visions to explore the
Creature's ways
The time has come to gaze into the sky

Turn the light of life upon the fountain
Kindle everything
Demons of the pine within the billion
Fires in the bay
Praise the hour of new delight
Tear the silence of shallow light
Call the watchers of summer light
Read the mornings name

Come the fury shattering the stillness
Wind the open way
Reach the stars were swallowing the fullness
Ours is today
Praise the hour of new delight
Tear the silence of shallow light
Call the watchers of summer light
Read the mornings name

Golden wonders fill
The edges of the sky
Reach the fibers in
The timber of our lives
Such as the wilderness
Be under our eyes
As we turn the to the colder light
Of dawn

Turn the light of life upon the fountain
Kindle everything
Beavers of the pine upon the billion
Fires in the way
Praise the hour of new delight
Tear the silence of shallow light
Call the watchers of summer light
Read the mornings name

The flooding hours fill me
Turning our eyes upon the floor
The glowing waters thrill me
Melting ourselves within the glow
The flooding hours fill me
Turning our eyes upon the floor

Turning to reach the fountain
Fire of the morning
Watchers of the morning
Fire of the fountain",Fountains,1977
Stardeath and White Dwarfs,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you get's me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

I can feel you breathe
Washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

Caught up in the touch

Very hard to explain why you're mad, even if you're not mad""

Leave but don't leave me.

And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be.

Run, rabbit run.
Dig that hole, forget the sun,
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave.",Speak to Me/Breathe,2009
Stardeath and White Dwarfs,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
And shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.",Time/Breathe (Reprise),2009
Stardeath and White Dwarfs,"Lovely Rita meter maid,
Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 

Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two. 

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid, 
Where would I be without you, 
Give us a wink and make me think of you",Lovely Rita,2014

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

For Your glory to fall
For Your presence to fill up my senses

A thirst for discipline
A hunger for things that are deeper

Could You take me beyond?
Could You carry me through?
If I open my heart?
Could I go there with You?
(For I've been here before
But I know there's still more
Oh, Lord, I need to know You)

For what do I have 
If I don't have You, Jesus?
What in this life 
Could mean any more?

You are my glory
You are the lifter

Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa.","Mona Lisa [From Captain Carey, USA]",2004
Stargazers,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2007
Stargazers,"Evening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you
My happiness

Every day I reminisce 
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
My happiness

A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then

Whether skies are grey or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you

Hiding away the demons controlling thoughts controlling feelings

Staring Back,"So what will I do when the size of the world makes me ponder destinations? And the blood inside keeps beating me, saying if I leave you now, there is still a chance to forget. After that will anything else make sense? Tell me how you think it is, does it move you? I will listen. 

Your shining eyes don't look my way, but when the night falls I can see them, I still feel them. My polar devices seem to pull magnetically, contrived to watch me spin. Leave you now? Still a chance to be strong. After all is done I still feel the sand on my feet and the world in my hands, and the echoes of that night will remain. So why can't I understand? I could weigh your remarks, I could try to balance out all the miles between us now. Branded by your gentle fire, tasted what I still desire. Branded. 

If I leave you now, I know I'll never forget. Nothing to regret because the light that you gave me will always shine inside, no need for me to lie. And the time that remains is not pointless anymore. Release my hand and fly. 
Punishment no longer makes sense",The Problem With Fire,2002
Staring Back,"You always wanted songs of celebration
On how to seize the day
But you never think
That I'd be coming your way

For the sake of both of us I stand
This time I can't

Leave me out this time
You might fall down this time
You know and I might even find you

You can't give me what's mine
I need this for myself
And right now you're not helping
So now we're through

I know it's not what I said that matters
It's what I do, so what does that say
When I do anything for you
Guess we're back to square one
Feels like it always ends this way

When moment you
Raised my patience
The next I''m too slow
And you're sure to let me

You might fall down this time
You know and I might even find you
You can't give me what's mine

I need this for myself
And right now you're not helping
So now we're through

Starland Vocal Band,"I don't wanna hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know there's life below me
But all that it can show me is the prairie and the sky

And I don't wanna hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire

And I stood on the mountain
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn, I watched it burn

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

Well, you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive
I've come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they move down out on ninety five

And pretend that it's the ocean
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean
Baby, do you know what I mean

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham

Starland Vocal Band,"Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been 'when it's right, it's right'
Why wait until the middle of a cold dark night?
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be there any way

Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ingite
And the thought of lovin' you is getting so exciting
Sky rockets in flight

Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always though a fish could not be caught who wouldn't bite
But you've got some bait a waitin' and I think I might try nibbling

There's time to make love
 
I came, I saw, I conquered

O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

And soon miss fanny bright, was seated by my side

He got into a drifted bank and we got upset

O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack, you'll take the lead

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile

Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,

You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Brothers
But what makes us mad
Are the things that Joseph tells us of the
Dream's he often had

I dreamed that in the fields one day,
The corn gave me sign
Your eleven sheaves of corn
All turned and bowed to mine
My sheaf was was quite a sight to see
A golden sheaf and tall
Yours were green and second-rate
And really rather small

This is not the kind of thing
We brothers like to hear
It seems to us that Joseph and his
Dreams should disappear

I dreamed I saw eleven stars,
The sun the moon and sky
Bowing down before my star,
It made me wonder why
Could it be that I was born
For higher thing than you?
A post in someone's government,
A ministry or two

The dreams of our dear brother are
The decade's biggest yawn
His talk of stars and golden sheaves
Is just a load of corn
Not only is he tactless but
He's also rather dim

There's only one of him

That is, we think they won't come true
That is, we hope they won't come true

All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis: 
He holds all the patent monopolies, 
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions.

The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.
And you'll all say: 
Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn.

[Chorus: x2]
And we all say: Oh! 
Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire,

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

Heightens each sensation...

And stirs imagination
Silently the senses 
Abandon their defences

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Starlite Orchestra,"Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon miss fanny bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we got upset

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack, you'll take the lead

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light

I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much

Do you still remember, how we used to be
Feeling together, believing whatever
My love has said to me

Ever searching for the one

The touch of your skin, giving life from within
Like a love song that I'd heard
Slippin' through our fingers, like the sands of time
Promises made, every memory saved
Has reflections in my mind
Hasta mañana, always be mine
Viva forever, I'll be waiting

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

From Heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

These hollow points tryna cop a feel
In the trees like a baby panda
Paranoid I’ll spray the hammer
I’m in my house up all night just starring at my surveillance cameras
I’m warning you no warning shots
I’ll pop your ass and you’ll learn your lesson
Stressed out
Still counting money cause that’s best antidepressant

I think too much I know, but we been through way to much
Not her, my dog, one of the only people I trust
Told him I had a ring picked out and a tux
We was eating off of the same plug
And I see about any nigga he got beef with cause that's love

I am always get money fuck des hoes from the start
Now he say he boutta throw it all away for this broad
Fuck he mean, must be out his mind
He to focused on the pussy should be focused on the grind
Don't he know one slip of the lip'll have us both doing time
Say my nigga bugg'n out and he don't recognize the signs

I remember jumping out I was next to him firing
I ain't have nothing to do with that shit
But I was riding like that shit was mine
Everything I jeopardize, Jeffery Dahmer inside
How it's eating me alive, if I was weaker I'd cried
I wanna look him in the eye just to see if he a lie
But I leave it be and be quiet you know me and my pride

From the bottom we came that's my brother I swear
And you'll have me at your throat if you dare touch a hair
But it feel like something ain't right
Like he ain't all the way there
It feel like something done changed it bothers me cause I care
Now he might be actin funny bout that bitch real shit
Say he think shes a angel I think she with the shit
I don't trust that ho, fuck that ho, why he go and love her fo
If the truth was medicine I think he need a double dose
How we go from balling screaming money over bitches
Now he taking care of hoes got 'em all up in our business
Fuck is up

Fucked us up

I got money on my mind
I know that's my nigga but if he fuck this mission up
Then I gotta get him touched
I hate it but lately he been loafing, he too caught in his emotions
Put his faith in that bitch when they ho ain't worth a token
We not seeing eye to eye it ain't over til it's over
And the way this shit been going look like I'm gon have to smoke 'em
(What the fuck)

On the low I been unfocused I'm just hope no one notices
Tryna play my cards right but things got wild as the joker is
The things I love I'll kill for call my bluff with no poker chips
Got this chip on my shoulder which
Brings me to this lick im bouta hit
Knew him since we was kids everything we got we split
But when the sack hit then it's over with

Ride or die like a motorist
Now I'm on some solo shit
The plug say we cop 'em as a team or ain't no more bricks
Fuck it, talk him in to moving on this last sack
Soon as we go pick it up we hit the cut ""bla bla""
Im just trynna eat this is how it gotta be
Turned his back on all this money for a bitch I use to freak

Need a bed time story to read before I put this nigga to sleep
Ask her if he every tried her and I know she wouldn't lie to me
She just said I shouldn't trust him never said she didn't fuck em
I'mma catch him when he bring his money step to him and flush him
And it's nothing, blood money spent faster I just laugh
Its everything I love is in the past
And everything I love don't seem to last
I shouldn't have even asked
Cross him out and blame it on the cash, blood on my sleeve, brain on the dash
Dome him quick fast dont forget the bag
Hurry home to my honey my other homie hitting that (fuck is up)

Step Brothers

They shooting up movies
They shooting up schools
Young black fools
Ain’t the only ones that suit up with tools
Exercising my 2nd amendment and pleading the fifth
With A fifth
This my second this Remy
I drink, I don’t sip
And the reason is this
It’s fucked up out here
So we out here fucked up
If you make it out then you lucked up
Trying to save ourselves coming from
What we raised ourselves
Stuck between a rock and a hard place with the razor and scale
Turn wine back to grapes and it's raising hell
Breaking down bales
Just to make bail
Catching sells off a cell until you in a cell
I’m just trying to prevail
But only time will tell
Well, niggas telling over time
It ain’t no telling
I ain’t lying
Ain’t trying to go out like my homies did
I keep that on me and I put that on my homies kid
Wonder if I gonna be missed
If I did a lonely bid
Got homies in the pen who only focus keeping a phone hid

I respect the time I keep my sneaks on tight
Head-on collision hope the seat belt right though
Might be locked up tomorrow but we free tonight
Praying to god I get a leash on life
Leash on tight
Only right that we know
And please don’t judge us for the path we chose
Looking up to heaven; no one sending me signs
Only if this was a movie I would press the rewind

He got that strap in his bag
See he get bullied at school
Young nigga shot dead in his class
He put his school on the news
Now put yourself in his shoes
Walking away didn’t help
He got no friends to defend him
He got to fend for his self
And he to skinny to fight
Running away just ain’t cutting it
His daddy ain’t home
His momma still struggling
She juggle three jobs
And get no help from the government
You don’t know nothing about him
But you trying to sucker him
Heart of a giant
I’m sorry he will never back down
And they gonna keep pick on him till one day he blacks out
And reach in that book bag and he pull that mag out
Now he get the last laugh and you’re just the class clown
Tool on deck
Yes I can’t help that
When momma was stressing
I hit my block like a tailback
See we trying to make it don’t got no suits
Just got cases
And I need more than this dope money to leave to my babies

I respect the time I keep my sneaks on tight
Head-on collision hope seat belt right though
Might be locked up tomorrow but we free tonight
Praying to god I get a leash on life
Leash on tight
Only right we know
And please don’t judge us for the path we chose
Looking up to heaven; no one sending me signs
Only if this was a movie I would press the rewind

Last time I checked, I deposit it
Teller tell you that it's obvious
That I’m getting lot's of it
I’m bossed up
I swear it cost so much that's why it cost to even talk to us (yea)
Make sure you get your offer up
Anything I do, I do it all for of us
Got a family that’s depending on me
I’m gambling or I’m spending some of it
All my niggas stay in to something
Got a short fuse that extended on me

Still sleeping on us
You’re in a coma
Don’t believe me
Just wait a moment
My brain cells got paper on them
This 40 glock got a laser on it
Gun you down, spray you up
Balling out, not laying up
Thumb it through, with no paper cuts
If your money talk, it ain’t saying much
My momma thinks I’m a loss cause
Fully automatic, fuck a guard dog
I rock G-shock, no Audemar but I’m still flashy as a cop car
In the grass like a lawn dwarf
Star, I got ya back like a lumbar

Okay, pour a deuce
Pop 1 bar, I’m gone but I ain’t going far
My driver need to be designated
She give me brain
Free education
They pass me bills with no legislation
Going back to Cali
My weed medicated
Keep asking me like everyday
Wassup with that stepbrothers
They either respect it or love it
Now we do it for the check of it
Woke up and said fuck it
Bout to open up my next budget

Now watch how our checks double
A nigga got drive like a lex bubble
Fuck you, pay up no discussion
Ride through the city with a toaster oven
Rob the game like it owe me something
Bruh, I’m going in keep the motor running
My bitch blowing like Etta James
In my truck I got mary jane
Feeling lucky no horseshoe but I run this shit like Edgerrin James
Neva changed, go figure
My brother faded like old pictures
We are not the same see the big difference is you’re softer than a roll of tissue
I know these rappers so frightened cause we handle bars like bicycle
I had to bring them so nice with it that my ink pen drip ice sickles

As soon as I finish rolling up this blunt, I’ll get right with you
So accurate with the heat, I feel like Mike Miller
The fn my lil light pistol shoot chopper bullets look like missiles
And more money and more white bitches that follow order I’m high Hitler
Eastside guerrilla I throw it up like a coin liquor
My money tall but I’m a short nigga
Got so much game I need a sports ticker
Of course nigga we killing this shit
Call the mortician we still in this bitch
As real as it gets I been dealing with splits no divorce nigga
Grind hard no choice nigga
I’m a underdog no forfeiting
Just me her and no intermission
She catch more kids than an orphanage
Live everyday like it's 420
I’m disoriented like the orientals
Had the cookies in the plastic no fortunes in it
No chorus but it’s going on like 4 minutes
Fuck it, Trip go and end it
Bout my commas like a run on sentence
I know I’m a trip no pun intended
Life’s a bitch, you keep playing with it till me and death come pay a visit
And my bullets are like jury duty, in other words anyone can get it
I slap your bitch with my magic stick and treat that bitch like a sack of shit
Dry your eyes, it’s a crying shame but I ball harder than catchers mitt
I’m sitting phat your majesty
I’m getting blowed like allergies
I grind hard no acid grease
I’m flipping pounds like balance beams

I hear family this, and we the best, and it's a movie
Meanwhile, they in the office tryna' stick it to me

I get paid cash anyway, so don't misconstrue it
I'll gladly go back to pitchin', I don't give a shit

Many-a-lives didn't survive to this stage 
'Cause the rage of another brother got him popped 
Shot him and he dropped, like a beanbag 
Mean motherfucker with a rag and some jeans that sag 
They signify your death by crossin' out your tag 
Then they go and brag that they took another life 
Never to think, do a brother got a mother and a wife? 
Trife when a nigga do the work of the Klan 
That's what you're doin' when you ruin the life of a black man 
Attack plan on self 
The man's got the family jewels, so I guess we're buryin' wealth 
All because we've been taught to despise what's black 
Open your eyes you oughta realize the fact 
That you've been gettin used like a trick 
You think you're mighty, but yo, whitey got your head sick 
See you were fed thick pieces of swine as a baby 

It only help to drive your mind crazy 
Now your blind days be over 
No more standin on line, tryin to find Jehovah 
Let us rewind to a time we was right and just 
Nowadays we just fight and bust 
One another in the back over crack, a carjack 
Will get you killed, watch the blood get spilled 
To the scale, then watch how fast they build the jail 
Now they got you holdin' on to a cell, well...

Did that name-game shit right from the go get 
Shorty want an autograph, can I sign it at the end 
Oh I think I'm all of that now, so now it's fuck Brand Nubian 
Should I call you a bitch, or should I maintain? 
I'm just here with my lady, and you came witcha man 
This would force him to front, and I'm sure he don't want it 
Over some old bullshit, when I'm quick to pull shit 
Live dad, everything is everything 
I got a lotta shit to do I can't afford to catch a charge 
I'm a product of the streets, and I couldn't make no peace

We to close can't stop praying now 
Though there seems there's no one to this pain 
Every time I close my eyes I pray for rain 
I pray for rain to wash away the strain 

You couldn't understand how much the pain weight 
So in the hood we love the rainy days 
Cause subconsciously we know the suns coming 
We love the winter cause we know the summers coming 
Remember I got locked the same night my son was coming 
All I could do is pray that they don't take me away 
And lord knows I have the angel's on my side 
They search the car I had the hammer in my ride 
A miracle on Flatbush Avenue I still made it back 
To say push when she was having you 
A newer version a younger me I want him to go to school 
And raise him motherfucka free I swear some places I don't want him to be 
I swear some things I don't want him to see but new booty daddy
Loves you truly and the nights you don't see me you know daddy's on his duty

Diapers all fo that shiting and all them pampers 
Grandma laid up with all of that cancer lid paint flaking constantly chipping

When the spotlight shines and the camera gets me with a sick pose

Took the champagne glasses, please fill 'em up

At the red light and Harlem was the settin'

It started with the dealin' and dreams of four wheelin'
Comin' up I ran a amuck in the streets
Chasin' the fast bucks, stomach touch gotta eat

Now we orderin' breakfast, I'm sittin' at the table
Stackin' up my pancakes the syrups on maple
I gotta watch my brothers 'cause Cain can turn Abel
Gotta watch the money 'cause the thing can turn tables

Blowin' smoke through the pipes, gettin' ghost through the night
This is fast life livin', pick a coast if you like

The day we cell dope, the night is velvet rope
Party with the chicks from the club with hella smoke
Whips that we valet soon as we hit Cali
Call the more buckets, ask the waitress what's the tally

Doin' sunset the Porsche Caberlay

And outside, smelling like nothing but formaldrahide
It's an everyday suicide, R.I.P. to the ones that died
Wake up before you get caught up don't keep on selling your soul
Until your life fall up, you got to try to find

[Chorus]
[Lil' Keke]
We living in a world that's dirty and so shife
You trying to figure out this the game that's called life
These days is cold and got me searching for my soul
Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold
I'm looking out my window for some, sunshine
I'm trying to give it up cause I swear it's my time
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz
Talent and skills is what I'm bringing
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing
Push play on the deck, to let my mind collect
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat
This the ghetto, and that's all I know
Another episode from the young don and Ro
If the family is tight, then everything's alright
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight, uh

[Chorus]
[Z-Ro]
Seem like I can't stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins
Cause I ain't having none of that riff raff to get back and blood
Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your 'cause
I wish I was, able to socialize with why'all
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from why'all
It's how it be though, Lil' Keke and Z-Ro we on the grind 
Long as they talking about us, we know we staying on they mind
Don't hate us congratulate us, why why'all turning up why'all nose 
Cause it's been we be spittng straight be burning up why'all glow
Want to take it away from pin and pad and pick up a gun
You better repent my dog it's over, you done better try to find

Starr,"[Chorus]
We to close can't stop praying now 
Though there seems there's no one to this pain 
Every time I close my eyes I pray for rain 
I pray for rain to wash away the strain 

You couldn't understand how much the pain weight 
So in the hood we love the rainy days 
Cause subconsciously we know the suns coming 
We love the winter cause we know the summers coming 
Remember I got locked the same night my son was coming 
All I could do is pray that they don't take me away 
And lord knows I have the angel's on my side 
They search the car I had the hammer in my ride 
A miracle on Flatbush Avenue I still made it back 
To say push when she was having you 
A newer version a younger me I want him to go to school 
And raise him motherfucka free I swear some places I don't want him to be 
I swear some things I don't want him to see but new booty daddy
Loves you truly and the nights you don't see me you know daddy's on his duty 

[Chorus]

What's a poor mans pickle survive threw the poor pull a truck upfront 
And drive threw the store had to be a felon hated being proper 
Read the book of life and Satan was the author still I was the cooperative 
Rather be in Rykers the bugger had my baby momma running threw them 
Diapers all fo that shiting and all them pampers 
Grandma laid up with all of that cancer lid paint flaking constantly chipping 
Mama with that dark rum constantly sipping I vow to my name a bad transmission for getting in the game that's a bad transition 
One flick one night I'm ally ally out sin free for getting you a place with a g 
A couple heavy shots ima newer man ready go and get paper the hustler 
With the confetti

I can truly understand how life can drain all the passion from a man 
With just one chance it can change his circumstance 
And get the money baby lets get the money baby

They wanna take this from us why
Cause we young black rich and famous, I wouldn't trade it for the world

This is the life
When the champagne spills and the Rollie on a nigga wrist glows
This is the life
When the spotlight shines and the camera gets me with a sick pose

When the night time falls and the cash shuts everything down

Took the champagne glasses, please fill 'em up

That's the breeze from the gutta
We make cheese cop V'S and burn rubba
The latest coop V's got the ladies loopy
Indulged in the world so we spend the paper loosely

Life in the lime light, pretty, pretty bitches
My ice shine bright, break bread wit my niggaz
The feds takin' pictures, we call 'em paparazzi
I tell my possie vogue strike a pose
I hop up in the Rolls, blunt, I'm gonna smoke

Prayin' to God is there Harlem up in heaven?
Gazin' at the stars Ferrari engine rarrin'
At the red light and Harlem was the settin'

I'm married to a gang but didn't come for the weddin'
It started with the dealin' and dreams of four wheelin'
Comin' up I ran a amuck in the streets
Chasin' the fast bucks, stomach touch gotta eat

Now we orderin' breakfast, I'm sittin' at the table
Stackin' up my pancakes the syrups on maple
I gotta watch my brothers 'cause Cain can turn Abel
Gotta watch the money 'cause the thing can turn tables

All I need in this world of sin is just me and the pearl twin turbo
Blowin' smoke through the pipes, gettin' ghost through the night
This is fast life livin', pick a coast if you like

The day we cell dope, the night is velvet rope
Party with the chicks from the club with hella smoke
Whips that we valet soon as we hit Cali
Call the more buckets, ask the waitress what's the tally

Swipin' all da cash, lightin' up the grass
Four Seasons stays, more reason for us to play
Doin' sunset the Porsche Caberlay
Or the red eye flights like the Jedi Knight in Star Wars

That he'll appear

And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

And in a little while
He'll take my hand

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

When every living breath was another new dawn
Like the time I was 5 at the top of Peak Hill

				",This Charming Man,2001
Stars,"Come around and say you love me
Hang your heart and lights above me
Is that too much to ask for
When the night descends upon us
Take a shower, dry your hair by the furnace
I'll watch you from the corner

Telephones and old typewriters
Words of love along the wires
Lets make it work tonight
Telegraphs and birds that fly
Through air so still you hear me sigh
Lets make it work tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Then furious you threw the picture
I cap in hand, an awful mixture
That kind of hard love is the worst
I try to speak
But you don't hear me
When your gone
You still feel near me
For awhile
For a little while

I try telephones and old typewriters
Words of love along the wires
But nothing is working tonight
I try telegraphs and birds that fly
Through air so still you hear me sigh
But nothing is working tonight

Please let's make it work tonight
Please let's make it work tonight

What the man say is true
All he's been telling you

In from the Cote D'Azur

We die
Each day and every night
Follow the swallows' flight
And we drank champagne like it was rain

Try to outlast the day

I don't feel guilty and I don't feel sad
This motherfucking life is the best he's had
I said I've been there, sonny, and it ain't that bad
I took my hits from the shits back when I was a lad

So long ago and even though I tried
I couldn't make him see
The life that he had cast in front of me

I couldn't make him be the very thing I needed

Except for a month back in '84

Gazing at a shadow on the window sill

I couldn't make her see
I wasn't quite the man she thought I'd be

Cast me dreams on a fishing rod
I was tired but now I'm strong
I woke up, I rose,
I wrote this song
Back once more to entertain you
Here with the bride of the man who loved you
It gets dark and I get restless
Taken and I didn't
Always left me breathless
Hear it again
I'm glad to be here
With pop songs and why do I feel fear?
When parties die at 3 AM
Why I always have to wind 'em up again?

This is my big comeback
Angel, saboteur comeback
Come on!
Dust off the eight track
And let me in, let me in

Slept right up
And hear my story
I've dug ditches on the road to glory
I've painted signs on the path of fame
Cul de sac; ""Turn around, don't come this way again!""
So introduce and a pat of wine
And now that I'm holding you I should be fine
I'll call you when I'm back in town
The sun is cold and it's going down

That's the price I pay
For being shameless

And that's the price I pay for coming back

To know the ending.

Keep everything.

Fuck you Hollywood,

I'm the glorious one.

You'll be looking for your lover in the midnight sun
And you'll perish for your lover when the frost has begun""

And nobody was listening so I wrote this song

And danced as windows shattered
For the island, for the thrill of it
For everything that mattered

Oh, how could anyone not want
To rip it all apart
Oh, how could anyone not love

And that was where I lost you
You had to finally walk away
Because of what it cost you

In line to catch the morning train
You looked like you'd been suffering
Like you'd never really loved the plane

Not finally diminish

They pray no one has to see them fall

The one with the empty looking eyes
Come closer, you'll see me

Saturday nights in neon light

Cash enough to make me well

I love when you tell me not to speak
I owe you, but I know you
You'll have me back but it's gonna take a week

What now, kid? Which way, love?
Will we ever make up and be friends?
Good news is my shoes is
Lined with all my nickels and my tens

Let's do that, just feed me
I hate when I have to get to sleep
You despise me and I love you

And everybody only wants to fight

Old pale memories of someone you knew
Keep crawling through the back of your mind, stealin' time
And in the daylight, you're crossing all your wires
You never knew just how to put out a fire
And the closet's been shaken with bones
Little reminders that you're out on your own

I wanted to call for nothing

When we go down, you're so ferocious
When we go down you lost the courage
When we go down, you're so ferocious

Blanket of cloud, the sky hovering
Winter is long and forgiving
You melt your doubt and fall into me
I find your mouth and try to hold it

Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it

You bring your love, you know it's homeless
But we'll both rise, we're falling
The summer arrives, the garden's alive
With the mud and the mortar, we're gonna save it
