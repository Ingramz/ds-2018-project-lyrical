John Raitt,"When you walk through a storm
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Tho' your dreams
Be tossed and blown
Walk on
Walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Tho' your dreams
Be tossed and blown
Walk on
Walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone",The Highest Judge of All/You'll Never Walk Alone,1993
John Raitt,"But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be

If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know how I loved you
If I loved you.

Well, anyway, you mean you don't love me.
That's what you said, isn't it?

Yes!
I can smell 'em, can you, ah?
The blossoms. The wind brings 'em down!

Billy there ain't much wind tonight
Hardly any.
You can't hear a sound, not the turn of a leaf
Nor the fall of a wave hittin' the sand.
The tide's creepin' up on the beach like a thief,
Afraid to be caught stealin' the land!
On a night like this I start to wonder
What life is all about.

And I always say two heads are better than one to
figure it out.

I don't need you, I don't need anybody helpin' me.
Well, I got it figured out for myself.
We're not important. What are we?
A couple o' specks with nothin'
Look up there

There's a hell of a lotta stars in the sky,
And the sky's so big the sea looks small,
And two little people, you and I
We don't count at all.

You're a funny kid, you know?
I don't remember meetin' a girl like you.
Hey, you're tryin' to get me to marry you?

No!

Then what's puttin' into my head, babe?
You're diff'rent, alright! I know what it is...
You have doped me with that little kid's face, right?
You've adjusted me!
I wonder what it'd be like

What?

Nothin'.
No, I know what it'd be like.
It'd be awful! I can just see myself-

Kinda scrawny, and pale
Picking at my food,
And love-sick like any other guy.
I'd throw away my sweater, and dress up like a dude
In a dicky and a collar and a tie.
If I loved you.

But you don't!

No, I don't!

But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be
If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say

I wouldn't!

John Raitt,"Hey there, you with the stars in your eyes
Love never made a fool of you
You used to be too wise

Hey there, you on that high flying cloud
Though she won't throw a crumb to you
You think some day she'll come to you

Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She has dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care

Won't take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things too clear
Are you too much in love to hear

Is it all going in one ear
And out the other

Those left-over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day!
 
Here's that rainy day 
They told me about 
And I laughed at the thought 
That it might turn out this way! 
 
Where is that worn-out wish 
That I threw aside,
After it brought my lover near?

John Raitt,"If ever I would leave you
It wouldn't be in summer.
Seeing you in summer
I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sunlight,
Your lips red as flame,
Your face with a lustre
That puts gold to shame!

But if I'd ever leave you,
It couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn
I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle
When fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn
And I must be there.

And could I leave you
Running merrily through the snow?
Or on a wintry evening
When you catch the fire's glow?

If ever I would leave you,
How could it be in springtime?

You may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
And somehow you know,
You know even then
That somewhere you'll see her
Again and again.

Some enchanted evening
Someone may be laughin',
You may hear her laughin'
Across a crowded room
And night after night,
As strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter
Will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it?
Who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons,
Wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening
When you find your true love,
When you feel her call you
Across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side,
And make her your own
For all through your life you
May dream all alone.

John Raitt,"When I take you out, tonight, with me,
Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek through their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd care to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

Would y' say the fringe was made a' silk?

Wouldn't have n' other kind but silk.

Has it really got a team of snow white horses?

One's like snow,
The others more like milk.

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and you'd never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we ride back home in the surrey,
Ridin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, 'til it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and just keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.

Like no business I know

Everything the traffic will allow

The sheriff that escorts you out of town
The opening when your heart beats like a drum
The closing when the customers won't come

That your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that your pa and ma have parted

I guess he'll call me the ""old man""
I guess he'll think I can lick
Every other feller's father
Well, I can!
I bet that he'll turn out to be
The spittin' image of his dad
But he'll have more common sense
Than his puddin-headed father ever had
I'll teach him to wrestle
And dive through a wave
When we go in the mornin's for our swim
His mother can teach him
The way to behave
But she won't make a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill!

Bill, my boy Bill
I will see that he is named after me, I will.
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And tough as a tree, will Bill!
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

I don't give a hang what he does
As long as he does what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes!
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack.

He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well.

Aha-ha-ha-ha!
He might be a champ of the heavyweights,
Or a feller that sells you glue,
Or President of the United States,
That'd be all right, too
His mother would like that
But he wouldn't be President if he didn't wanna be!

To boss him or toss him around!
No fat-bottomed, flabby-faced,
Pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

And I'm hanged if he'll marry his boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnette...

Hey, why am I talkin' on like this?
My kid ain't even been born, yet!
I can see him when he's seventeen or so,
And startin' to go with a girl
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound
On the way to get 'round any girl
I can tell him
Wait a minute!
Could it be?
What the hell!
What if he is a girl?
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?
A bum with no money!
You can have fun with a son

From her faithful dad
She has a few
Pink and white young fellers of two or three

Gets hungry every night and she comes home to me!

I got to get ready before she comes!
I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums

And whisper it over and over:

Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop

Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

Of the girl who taught me there was so much in this world worth living.

The promise never harvested in fallow fields shall lie.
In a shallow grave of stubble field and half-remembered lies.

How can a bed of roses hurt so much to lie upon?

Tried to stick, tried to stand, but I never could land.
Decided nothing works out anyway.

What's more, this never happened before

Mine to hold as I'm holding you now and yet never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear

Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep
I dreamed a dream and I thought it true
Concerning Franklin and his gallant crew

With one hundred seamen he sailed away
To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Where we poor seamen do sometimes go

Through cruel hardships they mainly strove
Their ship on mountains of ice was drove
Only the Eskimo with his skin canoe
Was the only one that ever came through

In Baffin's Bay where the whale fish blow
The fate of Franklin no man may know
The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell
Lord Franklin along with his sailors do dwell

And now my burden it gives me pain
For my long lost Franklin I'd cross the main
Ten thousand pounds I would freely give
To say on earth that my Franklin do live",Lord Franklin,1971

(Lay the bent to the bonnie broom)
Two daughters were the babes she bore
(Fa la la la la la la la la la)

alternating with each of the lines below>

As one grew bright as is the sun,
So coal black grew the elder one.

A knight came riding to the lady's door,
He'd travelled far to be their wooer.

He courted one with gloves and rings,
But he loved the other above all things.

Oh sister will you go with me
To watch the ships sail on the sea?

She took her sister by the hand
And led her down to the North Sea strand.

And as they stood on the windy shore
The dark girl threw her sister o'er.

Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam,
Crying, ""Sister, reach to me your hand!

""Oh Sister, Sister, let me live,
And all that's mine I'll surely give.""

""(It's) your own true love that I'll have and more,
But thou shalt never come ashore.""

And there she floated like a swan,
The salt sea bore her body on.

Two minstrels walked along the strand
And saw the maiden float to land.

They made a harp of her breastbone,
Whose sound would melt a heart of stone.

They took three locks of her yellow hair,
And with them strung the harp so rare.

They went into her father's hall
To play the harp before them all,

But when they laid it on a stone
The harp began to play alone.

The first string sang a doleful sound:
""The bride her younger sister drowned.""

The second string as that they tried,
In terror sits the black-haired bride.

The third string sang beneath their bow,
""And surely now her tears will flow

Till a sailor came there one night to lay
And that was the beginning of my misery

He called for a candle to light him to bed
And likewise a silk handkerchief to tie up his head
To tie up his head as sailors will do
And he said my pretty Polly will you come too

Now this maid being young and foolish she thought it no harm
For to lie into bed to keep herself warm
And what was done there I will never disclose
But I wish that short night had been seven long years

Next morning this sailor so early arose
And into my apron three guineas did throw
Saying take this I will give and more I will do
If you'll be my Polly wherever I go

Now if it's a boy he will fight for the king
And if it's a girl she will wear a gold ring
She will wear a gold ring and a dress all aflame
And remember my service in Rosemary Lane

While I stroll on down
On down the highway

The cars won't stop for no one
They don't think that you're just rolling down
They think you're an OAS spy
Gonna shoot them as they go by

No cars, they won't stop
Won't stop for no one

Strolling down the highway
And I'm gonna get there my way
Dusk till dawn I'm walkin'
Can hear my guitar rocking?

While I stroll on down
On down the highway

John Renbourn Group,"One morning fair I took he air
Down by blackwater side
Twas gazing all around me
The Irish lad I spied

All through the fore part of the night
We lay in sport and play
Till this young man arose and gathered his clothes
Saying 'Fare thee well today
That's not the promise that you gave to me

When first you lay on my breast
You could make me believe with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the West

Well then go home to your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill
And think on your own misfortune
That you've brought with your want and will.",Blackwaterside,1977
John Repucci,"I am a man of constant sorrow,
I've seen trouble all my day.
I bid farewell to old Kentucky,
The place where I was born and raised.

For six long years I've been in trouble,
No pleasures here on earth I found.
For in this world I'm bound to ramble,
I have no friends to help me now.

It's fare thee well my old lover.
I never expect to see you again.
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad,
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.

You can bury me in some deep valley,
For many years where I may lay.
Then you may learn to love another,
While I am sleeping in my grave.

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face, you'll never see no more.
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore.",Man of Constant Sorrow,2001
John Reuben,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girlies
From upper class America
To minimum wage employees
Wherever you are, wherever you're at

From Columbus Ohio to your point on the map
It?s that kid John Reuben, mic checkin? one, two?n
MCs get the boot when they claim to be the shoe in
Nothing new

Everybody wanna be a superstar MC, As for me
I find better things in which to place my energy
Diverse family, we up and at ?em full fashion
Been locked up in the lab mixin' up this contraption

Smackin' the mic with verbs and nouns of life
I utilize my time right
To hold it down and keep it tight
And then decipher that I step through

Yeshua equals life so I don't separate the two
True peace 'n joy
More love to the connector
Illuminate your town as we hit your sector

Everywhere we rock, everywhere we go
Every type of thought, every type of show
We got divine inspiration
We got divine inspiration

Well, let me come into the track, yes, y'all
Bring it on back, yes, y'all
One time for the mental piece release
Mos def John Reuben will decrease

Christ increased inspired lyrics hit your soul direct blow
How we communicate, graf DJ and break
Take a minute, now listen and dissect the intuition
More than ear candy but yo, I dwell in submission

To Heavenly powers, hours on end I spend
Lookin' for creative combinations to blend
Now that's a good combination
That's a good combination

Everywhere we rock, everywhere we go
Every type of thought, every type of show
We got divine inspiration
We got divine inspiration

In the place to be bringin' it out like
Like dots, I connect my rhymes to the spot
Warp speed like I'm trekky, to bang heads of block
To rock, to petrify, combust with mad rush
More cool than that J to bring that cold crush

Transcend, runnin' through this whole scheme
Seen with raps, stay fresh, more ultra to the V
I'm clutching microphones and roamin' through them zones
And melodies I release serk ambassadors and vocal tones

Shooting missiles from the lab, I contract, bust verbal raps
Ripping, torn through, and spilling into laps
Douse lyricals with divine divinity
To rise above the normal mediocre plain MC

Let me introduce 'cause I feel' I'm rev'd and heated
In a state of mass destruct MCs like they never existed
Seein' stars, like I'm spangle in your banner
Christian manner, be-boy for Christ, roaring like I'm Judah

Everywhere we rock, everywhere we go
Every type of thought, every type of show
We got divine inspiration
We got divine inspiration

John Reuben,"Spoken
What, what? what's the fuss?
You know what, man?
Yeah?

You pay five bucks to come in here to just stand in the back and act like you're to hard to enjoy yourself
Well actually, I didn't have to pay
To each his own correct then don't select my flavor
While I see them in the back critiquin' my behavior

Trying to take create n' shape me to fit this mold
He yelled out sellout but maybe he wasn't told
So let me tell a shallow mind why we do what we do
I create for the Creator not to impress you

Challenge your thinking but not to test you
You might not like me, I'll still say God bless you
And address the issue it's all love and respect
And honestly bro, I don't think that's too much to expect

But too many times, the shallow mind will keep you caught
You can't escape from thinkin' all you ever been taught
Is that you walk this way
You talk this way

You front this way
You pose this way
You act this way
Na na, that ain't me, I got to be who God created me to be

Do not tell me what I can and cannot do when I rock
Why is it as humans we cling on to only what we know
Never expandin', steppin' out that comfort zone
We rock alone and the roam in ignorance

Turn back around and use it as a defense
For shallowness this seems to be a concern
'Cause not knowin' is an excuse for those unwillin' to learn
Alright I need all the people to the front to the back

To back to front, lets get down, we gonna do it like this
Do not tell me what I can and cannot do when I rock
Original material, my crew non-stop
We keepin' it fly, we turnin' out

Y'all feel us on that? No doubt!
Do not tell me what I can and cannot do when I rock
Original material, my crew non-stop
We keepin' it fly, we turnin' out

Y'all feel us on that? No doubt!
Do not stereotype the individual
'Cause what you hear in your stereo is not the typical
Stereotypes get broken down, we're non-provokin'

New levels of thought to leave the shallow mind open
Cats aproachin' me without no lack or no clue
I understand though bro, see someone's been trainin you
To think like you think and act like you do

Its getting old, not like it should have ever been new
But as long as shallowness exists, I shal persist
To rip apart the whole structure and expose the nucleus
Shallowness exists, I shall persist to rip apart the whole structure and expose it for what it is

Lack of understanding, Lack of communication
Lack of a desire for expanding education
Lack of inspiration, Lack of innovation
The fact you can't respect another man's creation
Lack of motivation, Lack of restoration
The fact we lack unity and enjoy separation
Lack of destination 'cause you know what I feel
I feel that humans lack the ability to be real",Do Not,2000
John Reuben,"Death whispers words of defeat in my ear
My God I draw near, my God I draw near

God of creation here I stand
I've left Babylon to find out who I am
I've traveled I've struggled I've failed in vain
My own ability will never see eternal gain
God of creation it's you whom I seek
Lord I feel strapped and tied down and my strength is weak
Oh Lord when I cry out please hear what I speak
Bring life to my body awaken this sleep

Death whispers words of defeat in my ear
My God I draw near, my God I draw near

When all vanishes and I stand in this place to face the truth for what it is
With no human escape to hide behind just my soul and God and I find it mind blowing
Knowin' that humanity and a mere mortal man like me
Can have my slate cleaned of mistakes and the chance to put on immortality
Even though darkness has hardened us in deception and spoken otherwise
Man I refuse to take in that nonsense, and I refuse to buy into these lies
These lies of pain, these lies of shame, these lies of complete dysfunction
This lie of hopelessness that will make a person feel like they're nothing
This lie that will make me feel like my struggle is one too much to fix'n
Isn't that what darkness wants for me to play the role of a victim
But I'm a child of light and no longer am I bound by slavery
I say oh death were is your sting
And oh Hades where's your victory?

Hear my cry oh God
Attend to my prayer
From the end of the earth I will cry to you
When my heart's overwhelmed I will cry to you
Leave it to the rock that is higher than I
For you have been a shelter for me
I will abide in your time forever
My God I draw near, my God I draw near

Death whispers words of defeat in my ear
My God I draw near, my God I draw near

Will I make or break love or hate
Now tell me who's the fake n who's the snake man
Who can I trust so many promises I seen bust
Justice never accomplished right so I gotta let that go
And keep movin yeshua illuminate my path
And keep me tuned in so much negative around for me
To still get consumed in, but I still have peace
In the misdst of confusion I still have peace in the midst of confusion

Even though I know my life has purpose
I find myself down n' out feelin' worthless
And defenseless against them that rise against me
But I still call no man my enemy
'Cause competition is none no competitors
Matthew 5 44 has got me prayin' for predators
Turnin' cheeks on the regular so throw your dart
And chances are you'll hit the heart
But never take me apart because I'm found in yeshua
So who can be agaist me that's what I thought

To be honest bro I really don't know how to treat ya
Greet ya with a pound but you want more than dat
And to be honest I really don't know how to act
I hear the blah blah blahblah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah blah
Man I watch your ego spoil for thinkin you're
Fresher than all else

Face full of perspiration from sweatin' yourself
Lettin' yourself act like a fool man look
I don't care about your personalized hip-hop rule book
Took another man's thoughts on rules for the microphone
How can I respect your opinion when it's not your own
Known fact you have an ego you need to lose it
'cause if you're so real why you tryin' so hard to prove it
It should just be and if it is then we don't need
A constant reminder that you're the dopest mc

So you're the illest so you're the dopest
So you're the slickest man why you tellin' me this
In one ear and out the next all I keep on hearing is
Blah blah blah

Hello there ego can I call you out for what you are
John doe status but you're fronting superstar
More like super far from reality
But I guess it's trendy to make it look like actuality
Now let me see too many claim where they want to be
And not where they're at
I'll call your front and all those who got your back
Let it be known clone mimicks nah you won't last
You don't have a future 'cause you didn't have a past
So in the present please don't get perturbed

If I pay no attention to you and your pointless idle words
'Cause time is precious and I have better things to do
Than waste my energy on hearing you brag about you
Recyclin' hip-hop the same old same old
How you're so fresh and all else is stale n' old
It's getting old plus man I've heard it all before

John Reuben,"Well I'm a John Reuben from the land or corn
Columbus, Ohio that's where I was born in
By mom Kathleen on January 14
1979 I entered the scene lookin' like

Hello mother girl what's goin' on
One moment I'll be here and then the next I'll be gone
But while I'm chillin' out there's somethings I'd like to see
Like some sanity, some family and some diversity

Well look at me in a flash my time's passed and I've aged
Adrenaline within me has got me up on the stage
Lookin' for ways to amaze and light up the place
It was me and nine other MC's called the showcase

Ten immature young bucks run amuck
Throwin' out whatever's clever and just hopin' it stuck
What what what's goin' on there moving to the beat
I guess that's why we have no choice but to keep

We makin' fresh vibes bringin' fresh songs
Man we keepin' it fresh hopin' that y'all come along
Goin' with him, her, he or she

We makin' fresh vibes bringin' fresh songs
Man we keepin' it fresh hopin' that y'all come along
Goin' with him, her, he or she

I'm sayin' him, her, he or she
A John Reuben gotta lotta somethin' for everybody
Step into the party tardy in fashion
Up in here this year quite clear with a passion

To make it happen and I'm loving life fact
See God is good and I won't backtrack
But move forward bendin' words in ways not thought possible
See any beat is rockable this feelin' is unstoppable

Because the mind is full of creative energy
I'm not leavin' tonight until my brain is empty
Thoughts pour out as I skillfully explore out
Routes n' patterns in which to flex raps

I'm gatherin' kids from all directions, multicomplexions
You feelin' this then add a pound to the collection
Another session yes I'm there move back
Bring in the boom sti cat to boom ta boom cat
Like that we keep it simple n' fresh like yes y'all yes

We makin' fresh vibes bringin' fresh songs
Man we keepin' it fresh hopin' that y'all come along
Goin' with him, her, he or she

We makin' fresh vibes bringin' fresh songs
Man we keepin' it fresh hopin' that y'all come along
Goin' with him, her, he or she

I got eight bars to fill in
So it's time for me to start skillin'

N' it's time for me to start illin'
Party people in the back cold chillin'
All people get live n' all people get live n' energize with me
All people get live n' energize with me

John Reuben,"Trained to fail before I could walk
Now I'm undoing 20 years of lies I've been taught
Not always easy let the past be forgot,
When memories keep you caught
Let's travel back, now hold up stop, why
'Cause if I dwell on the past I get focused to who I'm not
I strive to stay away but that ain't easy
When who I was wants to control my destiny testing me
Man, it's got me tripping
Its in these moments of despair I feel my foundation's slipping 
Its starts ripping leaving me broken
Now I'm completely confused and I'm vulnerable and open
I try to run, but who am I running from?
See, what within myself this battle has come 
So basically, You say it's up to me
'Cause I'm my greatest ally or my worst enemy

I stepped out of my body to let God slide in
Although I'm still dressed in flesh I spiritually died in
Alive in Christ, a new creation started breathing
Life exists and through this came completion
Life exists and through this came completion

Get your mind body and soul under control 
Who am I? Identify
Who are You? All is new

I feel like my soul keeps challenging my spirit
And my spirit keeps challenging my soul
Which ever one I choose to exercise the most
Will be the one to obtain control
Man, I feel like I got multi-personalities
I dabble in multi-mentalities
My own thoughts hold me captive in a world of confusion
As the monipulation increases gradually
Now If a lies placed before me and I buy into it
Then am I responsible for the deception?
If I have no acceptance
Who's to blame for these feelings of rejection?
Man I bring these feelings of confusion
I challenge all that my heart believes
I'm the one that drags my past up from the grave
Telling myself I",Identify,2000
John Reuben,"Man it's hard lookin' back an now able to see in
Wishin' to God sometimes that I could do it all again
Strugglin' can start to take it's toll
16 years old tryin' to change what you can't control
And it's not your fault but tell me what can you do
When things fall apart and everybody's lookin' at you
With two fingers pointed screamin' get it together
But who's in the mix to show me any better
So whatever I'm runnin' on my own solo
Tryin' to make things happen off the little bit I know
And I guess I'll get what I get but yet
I don't want to live my life full of regrets

To the future in the palm of God's hand 
To the past as of now
That I can't understand
To the future uncertain unclear
To the past I left to bring me here I stay I pray

The earth rotates and my world keeps spinnin'
Feelin' like I never started but it's all endin'
And I stand here lonely a million familiar faces
But yet no one truly knows me
So I'll try to move on and I'll try to know how
But the truth is I'm really just runnin' from the now
I can't handle it I feel like the future's all I got
Don't want to deal with my past
I choose memory block to stop how I feel don't want to be
Real with it, run from reality in attempts to deal with it

And I'm secure enough to admit my insecurity

Broken reality lookin' to leave this mind-state 
But the more that I leaave the harder it is to come 
Back 
Now I'm livin' out these lies that I call my trap 
And I call it that 'cause I didn't do this intentionally 
What I now call my trap I used to call my fantasy 
And why do I fantasize in order to leave the reality 
Of not being able to relate personally or socially 
Sometimes I wonder what it would feel like to be 
Respected 
But until then I'll dream about bein' accepted 
I wonder what it would feel like to be respected

All wrong no right no one no sun no light this life 
This fight I'll hide inside no matter where you go you 
Can't escape what's inside 

man somebody get me out of this place 
Of lonliness hopelessness depression and disgrace 
At this pace I'm on the verge of self-destruction 
With nothin' to go on but my self instruction 
So what then does that leave me 
I try to communicate with the world, but none of you 
Out there could perceive me 
So instead of words I began to express through action 
So anger n' rage became my mere satisfaction hate 
Fills my being I'm seeing no means of release 
So I escape into my fantasy where I live in peace 
Here I can be anybody I want to here I can be anybody 
I choose to 
Here in this place I feel good there's no restriction 
This place is so good that it's become my addiction 

I say I'm not lost but why am I searchin 
I say pain don't fade me but then again why am I 
Hurtin' 
I say I won't show emotion but yet 
I can't hide these eyes that have been stained by 
Tears 
I say I can't be held back but yet I've been in the 
Same place for years 
I say I wanna feel free but somethin' keeps me bound 
I say I wanna go higher but my feet haven't even left 
The ground 
Man I told y'all I didn't care but then again why is 
My heart heavy 
I told the world to bring it on but deep down I knew I 
Wasn't ready 
I said I couldn't be deceived meanwhile I'm walking 
Into the same old traps 
I said I couldn't be broke as I watched my world 
Collapse 
As I watch my world collapse 
Watch my world collapse

But now the choice is still yours can you see
What I mean?
You see we seek like in abundance

i get anxious and feel the urge to run 

[Chorus]

sometimes you feel like no one can stop you 
and other times you feel like you have nothing to offer like right now 
i might be scared to death of death and tomorrow 
i won't even care about my next breath left in the dark 

mad i can't see somewhere between pride and apathy 
and i continue on and press past the chaos i feel i just wish for one moment 
it would all stand still for real i wish the world would just stop 
and let me catch my breath return to that place of child 

like rest in attempts to gain more sometimes you come up less 
it's got me wanting to get away i guess were all looking for a place of simplicity 
but it's a complex world and you can't hide from it's activity but it sure would be nice 
to leave the world around so i run towards the sun to shed the earth that surrounds

John Reuben,"[Chorus]
Reuben, what is he Dipidy doin'

This ego was quick to say he was better than me better be correct
Before you step and try to sever my integrity please
You MC's need to quit it
I mean do you really think that you're the only ones that get it
And what is it we don't get huh?
Maybe that empty book bag that you sport as a gimmick
To the Timberland boots that have never been scuffed
All the while you're still hollering rugged and rough
I call your bluff you're just like the rest of them
The only difference is you follow a less popular trend friend
Tell me how are you going to dog the mainstream
Then turn around the underground and do the exact same thing that you're dissing
You get what I'm putting down
I say a gimmick can be found above as well as underground
And since what's real can't be defined by culture or man
I'm curious as to what makes you think that you can
(Sing along!)

[Chorus]

Ideas start occurring and words start stirring
Never would I suggest this to be the best
It's just I like putting words on mics
It's something I like to do something I find nice
Don't need to dominate or inflate my confidence
Got no problem giving MC's complements
But some get mad at me like they want to battle me
Upset because I made their hip hop happy
Actually I think you tough guys are corny
And my LP comes with a foolproof warranty
If you buy it and don't like it feel free not to listen
I'm not sure about a refund but you're welcome to diss it
Because I don't will not and won't ask you to
React to the beat if you ain't feeling it
But perhaps maybe you are in that case
It goes one for the treble two for the bass
Arrogance mixed with ignorance will and can bring forth a man
That don't really understand but claims he does
And you know what, that?s not good
[No that's not good]

[Chorus]

You know what? Y'all got to be kidding
Man, some of y'all treat art like it was some sort of religion
Following the rules one two and on through
To the point you don?t create art, art created you
Y,all got to be kidding man
Some of y,all treat hip hop like it was some sort of religion
Following the rules one two and on through
To the point you don?t create hip hop, hip hop created you",Doin',2002
John Reuben,"I screamed to God out of frustration
After another day of waking and hating the fact
That I'm still where I'm at, what's the point of all of this
'Cause I'm not seeming to find it

Is it meaningless? I search the reason behind it
Because these moments seem to drag on forever
And these years on end seem to have never been this
Desperation has formed repetition within to insecure, to pretend
And I'm too weak to defend

Here it comes again all in my world
Again left with no direction, no beginning, no end
The days blend together and the weather never changes
Numb to the outcome but yet not quite painless

Aimless to whether or not I made a mistake
And if so, how far is too far? Before it's too late
Should I wait but then what would be too long
To reverse the effects if I was wrong

Hindsight is a beautiful thing
When you can look back
And see what patience
And time can bring

Is it a must that I'm here?
Is it a must that I stay in order to look forward?
Must I look away? We're moving towards a new day
Unsure of what tomorrow will bring our way

I'm not even quite sure of what this day holds
I say we travel the unknown and watch it unfold
Hold today close while still reaching for tomorrow
Through the test of time, I've seen joy overcome sorrow

So with every trial I endure with hopes
To mature into what I was created
For more than life itself, I want life itself
Press past the present until forever is felt

And take hold of the hidden mystery wide-eyed and open
I now see differently, if it's to be then give me the strength
To be content and find peace in knowing
One day it will all make sense

Hindsight is a beautiful thing
When you can look back
And see what patience
And time can bring

Learning to accept the unexpected
Because the unknown wasn't here for me to correct it
So I let it go and stopped trying to control the impossible
Simply put tossed in the shuffle
At a young age just like everyone else

So I don't feel sorry for you or for myself
Love is bigger than that
And I'm not below or above the way it moves
Even though the things it does to my train of thought
Can bring about doubt and uncertainty

Patience tends to not agree with my psyche
That's more than likely, just some pride in me
Fighting expectations of where I think my life should be
Selfishly I forget, so quickly let me never forget

Lord, break me in humility
Some sort of amazing grace on me
As I look back upon my life
And where You've taken me

Hindsight is a beautiful thing
When you can look back
And see what patience
And time can bring

Hear the call, peace fall from trial to triumph
I want your hand in it all
Allow me to know where to stand in it all

John Reuben,"You ever felt somethin' you couldn't explain? 
No definition, no name. 
Just a feeling. 
No definition, no name.

I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different, I said,
I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different, than I, than I... 
I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different than I pictured...hold up.
I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different than I pictured it.

And then there was me:
Analyzing life more than I was living.
Anything possible good,
I destroyed before the chance was ever given.

See, if I never have anything, 
I'll never have to lose anything; 
but then again if I never had anything worth losing 
I guess I lost everything.

Either way, you could say, 
Pain will become a result from both,
So actually I'm giving in to the very thing that I fear the most: 
Losing it all, 
Everything,
Completely unaware, 
That a fear of failure was the one thing that was taking me there.

Fear of life, 
Fear of love, 
Fear of man, 
Failure to relate
How I and God, and His voice to me
Would even begin to translate. 

So I wait 
To escape
This condition of rationalizing my own destruction. 
But I keep on listening to the voices that don't deserve my discussion. 

I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different than I pictured it. 
I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different than I pictured it.
I looked at her, she looked back at me.
Her face looked different than I pictured it.
I looked at her, she looked back at me.

John Reuben,"Let's get it done right
Everybody in the place
Is welcome tonight
So let's run the night

Hot coffee keep me awake for goodness sake
It's late and now I'm feeling it, I've got so much on the mind
With the need to unwind, leave the day behind
Now are you feeling it, there's nothing wrong with that, right?

Everyone needs a break in life, so I'm going to take one tonight
Empty the stress and find rest instead double dose of comatose
Drain my head and go brain dead, I went blank
I thank God for these moments when I don't have to think

I'm up in here while the night is near
Hey DJ Manuel, put the music in my ear
Let me hear something contagious, infectious
Play the set with freshness, ah yes
I guess the guest list includes you and I
And everyone else that chose to reply

Let's get it done right
Everybody in the place
Is welcome tonight
So let's run the night

The sun is setting, letting the night creep on
In outside in the streets, I see the folks peeking in
One by one, they start to slowly leak in, looking lovely
My friends, what a unique blend

A collection of humanity brought to one
Spot individuals ready to unleash what they got
Yes and yes indeed bring something slick
To mix up the evening from entering to the time of leaving

We kept on and must continue, keeping your interest peeking
'Cause you came seeking for more than the ordinary
Less than extraordinary, Lord prepare me
'Cause I don't want to move on illusion, hibernation

In a fantasy of confusion I choose, so I chose the life giver
'Cause how could we create without love for the Creator?

Let's get it done right
Everybody in the place
Is welcome tonight
So let's run the night

Come here folks, we're about to provoke the night
Promote the night, not just soak in the night
Take advantage of the night, speak life through the night
Driven to give them some sort of peace in the night

While I'm with them, I'm spitting wisdom hoping to hit them
Get them to listen and make the room start living, come alive
We're about to tune it right, take my hand
We're about to dance under the moon light

Let's get it done right
Everybody in the place
Is welcome tonight
So let's run the night

Hey sound man turn me up man let it surround them 
Right here right now 

It?s up to him to mix me in with my vocal blend from start to end 
No party crashin me and my fellow mc?s we keep it smashin 
Enter the place and watch the crowd start reactin 
With the all shoot back up back up Mr. Sound Man turn my track up track up 
Even though I might be the act to open up 
Show me love dear friend please don?t jack me up 

(chorus)

Sound man I trust you 
It?s a must to hop on your toys and raise the noise up 
To a volume that makes the people want to swoon free 
Up the music to consume the room 
'cause when it comes down to it 
All that we?ve got is MC?s and DJ?s 
And whether or not the man on the boards can afford to feel friendly 
To every mc never make the sound man your enemy 

(chorus)

Big headed mc?s and uptight bands all over the land 
They?re ticking off the sound man 
Ego?s on ten but in the same trend 
You?ve got sound folk who provoke and do it to them 
Not to mention the security guard who tries hard to be hard 
And takes his job a little too far 
And I understand your need for attitude
But I don?t see why we need to spare the gratitude 
So I?ll be the first to say job well done 
Thank you sound man you?re second to none

I also speak on behalf of the DJ 
And on that note I feel we?ve earned the right to say

",Soundman,2002
John Reuben,"Give the band a round of applause join the cause 
As me and Man child flap our jaws and rap raw, huh
Got to be optimistic 
We twist it different your paradigm is shifted 
And it's positively terrific audibly 
We flipped it awkwardly 
How do we did it done it dang it or do I mean do it 
Keep it fluid let's move it 
I make people music, music sweet music 
Every now and then you have to renew it 
Still the formula stays the same we just like to mix the elements 
And watch them rearrange because change is good 
It keeps perspective keen 
But trying to be different don't really mean that you're doing anything 
That hasn't been done still 
The style is identical to none 

[Chorus]
Oh yes and the band plays on 
Every where we go it's the same old song
See I know there's really nothing new under the sun 
But yet I want to do it like it's never been done 

I'm not even sure what's next 
I'll let my thoughts collect and do my best to connect 
Without begging for your respect 
Or maybe just a little what the heck 
Now, you enter in new mindset 
Yup fresh water gets the mind wet 
Are we there yet 
On point yet 
All that I am or all I can 
Until there's nothing left

My gift of gab is sort of sweet a summer night's dream
Capture the elaborate colours that life brings 
Paint a vivid picture put the pieces in their places 
Ain't many saying A through Z to make their statements 
To get your point across in 8 bars is a task 
To make them wanna hear more of your point of views advanced 
We're up until all hours of the night
Dropping the science that drives us in life
Christ and opportunities to rock the mic

[Chorus: x2]",Thank You,2002
John Reuben,"This vulnerability is killing me internally
Not feeling much stability and I wish it could be easy
But it don't seem to be and so 
I'm going to take it to the only place that I know to go
And lay these feelings in the hand of the creator
God of creation you show me how to relate to her
Mean while, I'm thanking you for lessons being learned
See my feelings have been shallow but I've watched my heart turn
Yes, she looks good, yes she looks fly

But deep down I know there's something more inside
Just like I'm praying that there's more in me
So when I look at she I just don't see naturally
Not saying physically, that I'll deny the attraction
But all in all that's just a simple satisfaction
That can be obtained through a glance of the eye
This was five years ago, man how time flies by
Beautiful soul full of spirit
I wonder if she'd hear it if I told her that she had a
Beautiful soul full of spirit
A few year later

Her mind intrigues me
It leaves me sort of sick
Wondering what makes the mystery chic tick, history thick of pages and pages
Telling stories that can't be summed up in quick phrases
She's observant so she's seen my behavior
It's got me nervous wanting to stay away from her
I pray for her daily as well as perspective, 
Battling with pride and thoughts of being rejected and that's just not appealing
It's almost enough to make you disconnect your feelings or something
And try to move on and give them to someone else 
But yet I care for her more than I care for myself
Man who needs this

I'm not even good with commitments
Plus I value my independence, in the end it's probably 
Just a waste of time spent or maybe 
There's something more to this relationship
What's the point of caring when it hurts so much
If this is what love comes with I'd rather not touch it
In all honesty the outcome is uncertain 
And I do run the risk of walking away hurting
Searching for clarity, spare me the despair
I'd rather be alone and not even care 
Than to share my trust because you can't control 
Fate so maybe I'll be alone but at least it's safe
I know that's stupid
Probably my insecurity

Or maybe god is using this to get through to me
Because in the back of my mind 
I'm always aware of pushing me towards prayer and bettering my character
Making me thing about the man I want 
To become regardless of the situations outcome

John Reuben,"Step away, keep your distance
I can't be what you want me to be
But right now there are things 
Inside I don't want you to see
So take your personal spotlight
Shine it on someone else for a while
I can't force a happy face or 
Makeshift you a smile

I can't deny what I see, what I feel or 
What's in front of me
So take your world of 
Precious moments of make believe
They never made me believe in anything
But left me with nothing to hold on to

Your quick fix and magic tricks can only 
Disguise what I was going through
And now I'm thinkin' it was when it wasn't
And now I'm tryin' to rationalize
What just doesn't come together and 
Somehow doesn't make sense
But God, how can I convince them 
When I'm not even convinced?

Everyone is thinkin' it, but nobody's sayin' it
Everyone's sayin' it, but nobody's feeling it
Everyone's feeling it, but nobody's seein' it
So how am I supposed to know what's real?

False sense of happiness
My security wrapped up in this
These control freaks seek out who they 
Can brainwash and make activists
They'd rather have me lie than bring 
My failure to the light
Keep your secrets to yourself

It's not about you but them lookin' right
No time to be ugly
Don't trouble them with your doubt and fears
Shout for joy little boys and girls
You brokenness ain't welcome here
Well excuse me while I bleed through 
And my life becomes see through
Don't ask for transparency but 
Reject what you seein' too

Everyone is thinkin' it, but nobody's sayin' it
Everyone is sayin' it, but nobody's feelin' it
Everyone is feelin' it, but nobody is seein' it
So tell me, how am I supposed to know what's real?

Everyone is thinkin' it, everyone is feelin' it
But nobody is seeing it and how
Am I supposed to feel?
How am I supposed to know what's real?

So please can somebody tell me 
How am I supposed to know what's real
When I was told and controlled how to feel?
You tell me now
How am I supposed to know what's real
When I was told and controlled how to feel?

Jesus, please tell me
How are they gonna know you're real
When we're told and controlled how to feel
Jesus, tell me please
How they gonna know you're real
When they're controlled and told how to feel?
You tell me
How am I supposed to know what's real
When I was told and controlled how to feel?

You tell me please, God
How are they gonna know that you're real
When they're told and controlled how to feel?
You tell me please
How am I supposed to know what's real?
How are they supposed to know what's real?

Hey folks, what's going on? It's John
I just got off of [unverified] com
Of course you know me I don't respond
I just like to observe how these nerds critique songs

Funny as heck it's the same old text
Someone's upset, someone didn't come correct
I know it's stupid, it's just the Internet
But that in itself is one of many aspects

You got the cat that hits up the newsstand
To receive instructions from media man
Life full of anxiety trying to keep up
Just when he's on top another trend creeps up, oh

Dear Jesus, help us, people follow blindly
Have you been given the okay to like me?

He hated Star bucks, WalMart and the recording biz
This Indie kid, this anti-trendy kid
Liked to tell me what it wasn't and school me on what it is

Two years previous he was skankin' in the pits
Oh, how quickly his identity switched
Let's get hip to the future and skip the nonsense
I'm so ahead of myself I'm in retirement

Well, me and my friends we're chillin' hardcore
Sipping decaf coffee and playing shuffleboard
Nothing to prove, nothing to lose, wanna hang with me?
Don't care what I wear and I stare aimlessly

For hours upon hours upon end
Come back to and then I'll do it again, oh
Catch me up to speed, what's the hottest trend?
It's been twenty years no wonder the 80's are in

I'm just trying to do my part and speak from the heart
Spark some insight, yo, forget being fake
Write with honesty, don't wanna hide my faith

I also don't want to use my faith as a gimmick
To tickle your emotions and make you feel terrific
I promised God to always be authentic
Past this moment it's a daily commitment

That my friends concludes the broadcast
Be careful what you commit to, things don't last
Hold on tight to what really counts
Enjoy this life before you're out

John Reuben,"Taught young, the worldâ€™s wisdom
I told lifeâ€™s a game, the earth will be your stadium
Be alert, pay attention
(One day) Even your friends will become the competition
Trust no one but do remember this, never burn any potential bridges
Know whoâ€™s who, and what they can do for you
And donâ€™t feel bad causeâ€™ in the end theyâ€™re gonna do it to you too
Remember lifeâ€™s not fair
In order to maintain, your gonna have to let you sensitivity be trained
A machine more than a human being
What you say doesnâ€™t always have to be what you mean
Tell them what they want to hear if itâ€™s to your benefit
And words beyond closed doors are insignificant
Push yourself, never be satisfied
Even if you donâ€™t get it, at least you died knowing you tried

Born, live, strive, succeed
Gain it all, bye, now itâ€™s time to leaveâ€¦
Now, all we see is now

Taught young, the worldâ€™s wisdom
Begin to pay attention and make my own observations
All of the kids working hard for admiration
Trying their best not to meet their social expiration
Kind of hard in a world this finicky
Easily praised and yet destroyed just as quickly
I guess me and this world must not be compatible, cause I donâ€™t want its approval to feel valuable

So whoâ€™s next to climb the wall of success, just to see how good the top truly gets
Chasing lies disguised as going somewhere only to arrive and realize itâ€™s really no whereâ€™
Thatâ€™s even if you get there in the first place
What an incredible let down weâ€™re bound to face when we substitute purpose for cheap counterfeit
Too busy trying to succeed in life that we forget to live it
You can live in the infinite or give in to the immediate
Gain it all but someday youâ€™ll have to leave it
This world is temporary and itâ€™s heart is selfish
Think to yourself, is this what wealth is
But now, all we see is now and now is not a bad thing but now does bring tomorrow then
Now becomes then
Moments escape, new ones replace them
Donâ€™t want to face the end still searching
Asking what in this world did I ever find worth in
What could be worse than life of wasted years
Nothing lasting, nothing true, nothing dear
I fear losing beauty in pursuit of bigger things
I fear a broken home courtesy of the American dream
Maybe thatâ€™s just me with my emotions on my sleeve, but one way or another we all wear what we believe

Born, live, strive, succeed
Gain it all, bye, now itâ€™s time to leaveâ€¦
But now, weâ€™re wasting now",Time to Leave,2003

John Reuben,"I tried to communicate, I tried to relate
Now all I want to do is escape and vanish into fantasies
I ventured out of the galaxy into the outer regions
Where folks believe in something
Much, much bigger than their demons

And aren't controlled by their circumstances
Sounds romantic, we'll dance with it slowly
In here my failures don't control me
It's a place of solitude but I'm not lonely
And it's beautiful but let's be reasonable

It's just not real, it just plays with your imagination
And for a moment or two can make time stand still
But when it's over, all you have is a memory
I had to leave 'cause the real world was calling me
I left my youth in pursuit of the truth
And gained a world of dishonesty

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

Man, it's sort of overwhelming
It didn't seem like I was storytelling
But you didn't believe me when I told you that I could see
My hopes and dreams come alive as it seems

But there's a time and place for everything
Well, I left my imagination there
Now it's only what I can touch, see, taste and hear
With my natural senses, I wish I could stretch the limits

But my defenses keep me limited from the boundaries I set
So I won't get burned again
Sure, I'd like to be optimistic but that doesn't line up well with reality
So I'll go to sleep now and dream of a younger healthier better me

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

I see your innocence and envy it
I reminisce of mine and remember it
Full of peace full of hope full of truth
I remember when I used to be you before you became me

Don't mistake innocence for ignorance
Don't mistake purity for inexperience
Don't mistake humility for weakness
I sincerely mean this

You understand more than you know
There's no goal like peace of mind
So what else are you trying to find
What's left except regret and heartache

And yes, your heart will break and go numb
Lots of times before this life is done
You'll look for answers but there's just one
Patience, one day it will make sense

But waiting is a pinch waking you up
From the worlds you've made up
The one where you dream
And the one where you gave up time
To create a new atmosphere where
The boy and the cynic can both play fair

",The Boy vs. The Cynic,2005
John Reuben,"They got me pinned against the wall
It's political and predictable
Anything you say will be exaggerated and completely blown out of proportion
Ignore them if you can but I doubt you will
They're out to control how people feel
By pushing their agenda on your subconscious
While you're unaware they start the brainwashing process

Time to call out the unwilling
The ones who need to be cut deep in order to have feeling
You're not used to facing opposition
You've done all the talking now it's time to listen

Conservative, uptight, right wing, republican
Last time I checked I was none of them
But that's the brush you wanna paint me with taint me with
Some aim to please you aim and miss
A-D-D maybe but I can't tune you out
I would change the station but your signals too loud
(And you're too proud)
To realize you're a moron
Defend what you want whether it's right or wrong
And this applies to both sides of the equation
Arrogant men in power sure are frustrating
On a pedestal you hear them ranting and raving
Proudly proclaiming what they know nothing about
I hear you talkin' loud but I will not allow
Tinseltown to show me how to run my life
Sure you can sing and dance but that don't mean 
You're qualified to give America advice

Know that something needs to happen

It's in the front of my mind

John Reuben,"Now it’s in my head 'cause they’re one step ahead
It’s under my skin 'cause it’s a little too thin
And it’s in my heart just to tear me apart

Now you’re feeding off the aggression
Misery loves company and twisted forms of affection
Meet the human heart where hostility lives
Sometimes revenge feels so good that I don’t want to forgive

And oh no, thus the cycle continues
It’s an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
Til' they’re all loose and you’re bitter blind and numb
You bark but can’t bite because you’re all gums

And is justice ever done? Are you ever satisfied?
Was it about justification or about pride?
Stay away from the truth, it might teach you things you don’t like
My insecurity is out to prove that I’m right

I don’t want your apologies, I don’t want restitution
I want to hear you’re wrong but I don’t want resolutions
I want justice but I don’t care for peace
I don’t want to be bound but I don’t choose to be free
I want for you what I feel inside of me
And as soon as I know what that is I’ll share willingly

It seems like it should be simpler
But the human condition runs from wisdom
And we’re not as bright as we give ourselves credit
We repeat the same mistakes before we can regret it

I tried to let it go but it held me in place
There’s something better but I don’t like the taste
Bitterness is easier to swallow than the sting of grace
Memories can be neglected but impossible to erase

They reappear in different ways
And most of the time we’re not even sure of what it is that we hate
We just follow our feelings into an unhealthy state
Of being with no plans of leaving

I don’t want your apologies, I don’t want restitution
I want to hear you’re wrong but I don’t want resolutions
I want justice but I don’t care for peace
I don’t want to be bound but I don’t choose to be free
I want for you what I feel inside of me
And as soon as I know what that is I’ll share willingly

If I let this go then it’s all in the past
And if I hold onto it I still have something to grasp
What would we do if we had nothing to fight about?
Out of the abundance, out our hearts, we run our mouths
And tear each other apart and inflict pain and grief

Humanity wouldn’t know what to do if we had world peace
So you can take the sign in your front lawn down, it’s a nice gesture
But mankind likes to go to our war, it’s in our fallen nature
Neighbors, nations, corporations, races insecurity
And hurt works well with retaliation

But don’t worry, it will be your turn soon
So plot your revenge as you clean your knife wound
And 'I forgive you' is not an option, it’s too uncomfortable
It’s much easier to be miserable than vulnerable
You can save that for the weak and the religious
But there is no justice or no peace, there’s only forgiveness

The less you care the more you become unaware

Is it God’s favor ill-behavior or simply man’s modern progress

It feels good to be out of control",Out of Control,2005
John Reuben,"As fast as the world is changing
It’s hard to find anything amazing
Take away the mystery
Find some comfort in the routine
We can’t control what’s behind the scenes

Old men swap conspiracies
Anything to keep it interesting
I believe it all now, faith is risky
Smart enough to confuse myself
How stupid, better get used to it

Both clarity and confusion
Are part of the movement
Open me up, shut me down
Silence is the sweetest sound
Close my mouth and think out loud
I’m in the real world now

That’s just your curiosity
Interrupting the routine
Woke up with nothing under my feet
Looking for something
Looking for something

I know in part, see in part
Spent a lot of time in the dark
Lost in the options
Now I’m listening with caution

Somewhere between imagination and fear
Unsure of what I’m trying to hear
I don’t trust loud and clear
Put a still small voice in my ear

Whisper to me quietly
So I can figure it out
Honestly avoiding noise pollution
And easy to use conclusions

Because some things
Weren’t meant to be spelled out
Still it’s the simple things that count
Close my mind and think out loud
I’m in the real world now

That’s just your curiosity
Interrupting the routine
Woke up with nothing under my feet
Looking for something
Looking for something

Superstition, true religion
The near truth can’t tell the difference
Beautifully written contradictions
Spoken with such conviction

I’ve held a lot of conversations
With well thought out exaggerations
Thin line between insanity and insight
Better hope you’re right

That’s just your curiosity
Interrupting the routine
Woke up with nothing under my feet
Looking for something
Looking for something

That’s just your curiosity
Interrupting the routine
Woke up with nothing under my feet
Looking for something
Looking for something

John Reuben,"It was different back then
Anything could happen
Ideas as big as your fantasies could imagine
Children practicing that's part of getting older
Impatiently waiting for time to move forward

Optimistic youngins running on adrenaline
At the center of the universe begging for your attention
Making a difference meant looking important
No heroes were made that day
How unfortunate
Came and went like adolescence
Took our wind and left us restless
Now we want the wind that kept us alive and feeling refreshed
They said it was of the essence
To us time wasn't precious
There it goes now try and catch it
Watch it go

Focus
Focus
Don't miss a thing
Wide-eyed open
Don't miss a thing
Can you afford your ambitions
When we arrive we'll start living

Wow, how awful the first time it felt impossible
And the world around me was no longer wonderful
I can't give back your influence
Perspective is hard to undo
Thank you for the experience...

Here's some anxiety to keep you company
As you waste your energy trying to build your legacy
Tell me what more can a man do than eat, drink, and enjoy his toil
I want to be casual but taking it easy is too stressful
Anticipation now a days looks a lot more like anxious
Time killed away our imaginations
We used to escape into fantasies and fairytales
Now we medicate

How do you feel?",Focus,2006
John Reuben,"Okay, hold up

I’ll make the music if you make it look good
I don’t dance but I think that you should

Good evening's a greeting
Goodnight is farewell
Before you go introduce yourself

There’s a story to tell
Wait to be seen staring at the big screen
One day folks is gonna know me
Hopefully sing my songs at karaoke
I’m thinking positive

Even if it’s fashionable to be the pessimist
Skipped out of style, went straight to vintage
Can I get a yes? Y'all from all the naysayers
Listen to me now or catch up to me later
Do the kids still say player haters?

I’m sorry, I forgot the disclaimers
I was told not to be so defensive
Man, was I offended
Put a mic into the crowd
Help me out now finish the sentence

I’ll make the music if you make it look good
I don’t dance but I think that you should

Good evening's a greeting
Goodnight is farewell
Before you go introduce yourself

Good evening's a greeting
Goodnight is farewell
Nobody’s leaving until

There’s a story to tell, I’m at a lost for words
Can I borrow yours? You could speak for yourself
Or ask a ghostwriter for help, I need a story to tell
To be a has been, you have to have been
On a porch swing reminiscing poor decisions

Should have done it different
Fist full of accomplishments
Slipping through your fingertips
Opportunities missed
Fifteen minutes goes quick

Off your seat and on your feet
Half full or a half empty drink
Work the room, gunshot wink
Party people in the place to be

I’ll make the music if you make it look good
I don’t dance but I think that you should good

Good evening's a greeting
Goodnight is farewell
Before you go introduce yourself

Good evening's a greeting

Even if we’re pretending
We’ll take a happy ending

",Good Evening,2006
John Reuben,"Make money, money, make money, money
Save money, money, save money, money

Left high school at sixteen, pick an identity
Entrepreneurial dreams, find yourself a strategy
Next Saturday the class of '97 is graduating
In a couple of years, I’ll grab a G.E.D

As for now we’ll just make ends meet
Put our art in the place where it’s forced to succeed
The place where your hobbies and the real world meet
Forty minute walks to work to bus tables full time

With a pair of headphones on to block out traffic going by
Forty back to make music all night
With a pair of headphones on to block out my life
Open mic nights, let the spit fly

A hundred hands reaching for the chance to try
And maybe I grew up a bit too quick
It can’t be all about the music, admit it

So if you make money, money, make money, money, money
(Make money, money, make money, money, money)
You better save money, money, save money, money, money
(Save money, money, save money, money, money)

It goes fast
(Goes fast)
No cash
(No cash)

We used to shop discount racks for brand name specials
Mix and match designer scraps to look presentable
Hated on those who appeared more successful
Sloppy and broke became the look because it was affordable

Before it was fashionable
Now kids pay good money to look poor
And get charged for the extra work
Of perfectly placed character
Isn’t that some irony? Expensively indie

Make money, money, make money, money, money
(Make money, money, make money, money, money)
You better save money, money, save money, money, money
(Save money, money, save money, money, money)

It goes fast
(Goes fast)
No cash

I was told security with a cushion, just in case
How can I plan for the future if I can’t afford today?
Rap's a game that mostly amateurs play
And there are very few professionals that are getting paid

Go on there indie rappers and find your shtick
Throw it up against the wall and pray that it sticks
We used to say no gimmicks but everybody’s got one
No gimmicks, mine is that I’ve got none

Lost the truth, marketing honesty
The rap game is a sport of psychology
Underdogs go where they find opportunity
While spoiled children romanticize poverty

So if you make money, money, make money, money, money
(Make money, money, make money, money, money)
You better save money, money, save money, money, money
(Save money, money, save money, money, money)

It goes fast
(Goes fast)
No cash
(No cash)

Better make it last

Better make it last

",Make Money Money,2006
John Reuben,"Inconsistent, my feelings change quicker
Than I can get the words out and tell you what I’m thinking
Inconsistent, I don’t have much grace or patience
I hold this grudge and my tongue no further statements

It plays out in my mind
All the lost words I could have used to describe
And even though it’s left such a bad taste in my mouth
I guess I’d rather swallow my pride than spit it out

What a miserable exaggeration
Happier said than done
What a wasted conversation
In my head everyone was listening
Everyone was interested

Failure cuts the spirit to hear
That’s why I have to let my pride interfere
I’ll take it from there
If you see me acting differently, don’t worry

That’s just me, dialoging with me internally
About the hypothetical over analytical, still what do I know
Central Ohio’s gray skies provide a lot of time to be stuck inside
Close the world out, introvert's paradise

What a miserable exaggeration
Happier said than done
What a wasted conversation
In my head everyone was interested
Everyone was listening

It’s that wishy washy, topsy turvy monotony
I’ve been here before both emotionally and logically
You know that you know until the wind blows
It’s as easy as no and as hard as no

People pleasers never win, spread yourself too thin
It’s best to just do what you feel in the end
But you’ll change how you feel for the sake of the truth
When the world you’re living in becomes bigger than you

What a miserable exaggeration
Happier said than done
What a wasted conversation
In my head everyone was interested

What a miserable exaggeration
Happier said than done
What a wasted conversation
In my head everyone was listening

I’m leaving to maximize my potential
U Haul rental packed full of the essentials
Confidence check, yes, I’m feeling special

Let’s get it, let’s get it, let’s get it started
Someday I’ll be your favorite artist
Dumb enough to be that confident
Beat the odds with a back handed compliment

Sing it like you mean it

Dream like you own it

Living large shouldn’t look this desperate
Walking on stars bums on a park bench

Trying to write the universe an anthem
Tomorrow we’re old, tonight we’re young
What could be more brilliant than to just play dumb?

The party ain’t stopping
Until we’ve outgrown it

Roaring twenties, depressed at thirty
Busy bodies move with urgency
I put my ear to the street
Somebody catch me up to speed
I want to win but I don’t want to compete

Take the good with the bad
Chew the meat, spit the fat
Own some land, pay the tax
Mini van with two and a half

Raise your glass, toast to past
It all happened a little too fast
Passionate about what you can’t get back

Sing it like you mean it

John Reuben,"Oh buddy, the freaks come out at night
Till they can no longer afford to socialize
Ha, I left the party early, what’s wrong with me?
I’m at the diner down the corner on my fifth cup of coffee

Pen in hand, trying to recreate that feeling
Staring at the ceiling, make them think that your thinking
Cigarettes and aspirin, thoughts on a napkin
Wadded up in the trash can asking

Oh, what happened to your imagination?
Let’s dance this night away
Everyone of us is born a genius
Until we got too cool to play

I said you’re trying too hard, you must not know who you are
It’s not natural, you look uncomfortable
You’re trying too hard, you must not know who you are
It’s not natural, relax a little

One for the drinks, two for the tip
Three for rent, the rest is for the government
Work all day, spend it in the evening
Overpriced drinks, room full of needy friends

Are we having a good time? Absolutely, who wouldn’t be?
You can introduce me to the moody cuties
And dudes who act like I’m supposed to know, they should be
Well, I don’t nor do I care
Stop trying so hard and put both hands up in the air

You must not know who you are, it’s not natural
You look uncomfortable, you’re trying too hard
You must not know who you are
It’s not natural, relax a little

If the kids all leave we’ll shut the place down
But until then let’s go another round
I said until then let’s go another round
Who are these kids causing disorderly conduct?

Telemarketers and bus boys trying to tear the club up
Getting rowdy, rowdy
Hey man, I ain't gonna front
If the DJ plays my record, that’s exactly what I want

Oh, what happened to your imagination
Let’s dance this night away
Everyone of us is born a genius
Until we got too cool to play

You look uncomfortable, you’re trying too hard
You must not know who you are

",Trying Too Hard,2006
John Reuben,"Put it out there ask for it adamantly passionate
With a fist in the air like an activist
Y'all need a little bit of happiness
The world’s mad enough as is, you want realistic?

This is entertainment, we decorate it
We can hide away and make a day of it
Got a lot of information, what good can you do with it?
Telling us what the real world isn’t
Doesn’t make you any more in it

I believe good things can happen
Sing along as the world’s collapsing
Crack a smile in good fashion
Take a break from the action

Universal, it’s a small world
Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal
Universal, find eternal
Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal

Y'all need to move to it, do it, don’t play stupid
You get your hands in the atmos, go on ahead and clap those
This goes out to those who know
How to let go and enjoy the show
From down the road to around the globe

What little we know I’m willing to let go, breathe slow
Optimist in a moshpit
Sit down on top of the world with a good view to watch it
Organize the chaotic
Talk to God like it’s obvious
None of which consists of politics or the apocalypse

Universal, it’s a small world
Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal
Universal, find eternal
Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal

The night is yours to enjoy, give us what we came here for
Love builds pride destroys, lift your voice and make some noise
Picket signs protest justice for the oppressed
It all feels pretty hopeless, take a moment to catch your breath

Feet on the floor, music in the air
Reality will still be there for you when the song is through
Twenty four seven breaking news
This just in but I’m not paying attention
Ignorance isn’t bliss but taking a break from it is

Cosmic meltdown, dress is formal
Universal, find eternal

Tryin' to figure out the male species
How to bring a boy down to his knees

Hey now girls, don't be believin' everythin' you read
It ain't as hard as they're makin' it seem
'Cause it don't matter if you're skinny or got meat on your bones
If you want to turn a country boy on

You got to jump up in his four wheel drive
Put them Wrangler jeans on and cut them off thigh high
Crank the Hank, find a football game and chug a beer ice cold
If you want to turn a country boy on

I don't know what's turnin' them city boys' heads
Probably high heels, short skirts and fishin' nets
All the ladies if you want to snag a down home man
I'll tell just how you can

You got to jump up in his four wheel drive
Put them Wrangler jeans on and cut them off thigh high
Crank the Hank, find a football game and chug a beer ice cold

First you got to jump up in his four wheel drive
Put them Wrangler jeans on and cut them off thigh high
Crank the Hank, find a football game, chug a beer ice cold

John Rigsby,"Oh it's raining, raining, raining here this morning 
As I sit in jail and hang my head in shame 
With a smile I try to greet each early dawning
But they've given me a number for my name 

   Many a little raindrops are falling close to me 
   Makes the streams and rivers just as muddy as can be 
   It's raining, raining, raining here this morning 
   As the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

How I wish that I could see my little darling 
And hold her in my arms just as before 
I used to tell her every day I loved her 
But now she doesn't love me anymore 

   She knew that I was guiltless of this one crime 
   And said that she'd be waiting there for me 
   But she has found somewhere else to wander 
   Where the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

Its raining, raining, raining here this morning 
And I am just as weary as can be 
I wish that I could follow all the raindrops 
Down the Mississippi toward the silver sea 

   But there's no way to prove that I'm not guilty 
   So I will have to suffer all the shame 
   Go and tell her for me little raindrops 
   That they've given me a number for my name

John Rigsby,"Heart to heart, dear, how I need you
Like the flowers need the dew
Lovin' you has been my life blood
I can't believe we're really through 

Is it true that I've lost you?
Am I not the only one?
After all this pain and sorrow
Darlin', think of what you've done 

I look back to old Virginia
Where the mountains meet the skies
In those hills I learned to love you
Let me stay there till I die

Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

John Rimel,"I saw her from a distance
As she walked up to the wall
In her hand she held some flowers
As her tears began to fall

She took out a pen and paper
As to trace her memories
She looked up to Heaven 
And the words she said were these

She said, ""Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me""
And oh I'd love to see him
Just one more time you see

All I have are the memories

The hands that run their fingers through my hair

It's this and so much more that makes me love you

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

John Ryder,"Once I believed that when love came to me
It would come with rockets, bells and poetry
But with me and you it just started quietly and grew
And believe it or not
Now there's something groovy and good
Bout whatever we got
And it's getting better
Growing stronger warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
I don't feel all turned on and starry eyed
I just feel a sweet contentment deep inside
Holding you at night just seems kind of natural and right
And it's not hard to see
That it isn't half of what it's going to turn out to be
Cause it's getting better
Growing stronger, warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
And just like a flower that takes time to bloom
This love of ours is taking time to grow
Ba da da da da da da da da da da da

John Sawyer,"They packed up all his buckles and shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call

He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

They never found her body, just her diary by the  bed
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'  she said, 'Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne?

They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

Nobody can explain it, some say she's still alive
They'd even claim they've seen her on the shoreline late at night

With a measure of faith that you need.

For the miracle you're destined to be.
True bravery is bought with sorrow.
Life is but a gift we borrow.
And all the promise of tomorrow
Waits to be revealed.

John Schneider,"Lady, morning's just a moment away, 
And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.

A little more time

And yes you can have an autograph
But if I’m with a girl or my family and friends
I don’t get that much so please don’t ask
Pick and choose, you respect me as a person, I’ll reciprocate
Tip my hat and give you dap and I will just be on my way

My eyes red, cause I’m always medicated
Now they say I made it, cause I’m elevated
But my feet planted and my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low, I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low with my head up high
And I’ma keep my brim low

Always be keeping my hat to my brow
And my head in the clouds
Shit has been stressing me so I been rolling this loud
Trying to block it all out
But I know right now that this here’s my shot
Shit or get off of the pot
Shoot for the top, ain’t no looking back
This is all I got, so I will not stop
But I sacrifice my private life
That’s the shit that drives a person nuts
But I won’t lose sight of that feeling I got way back when
When I started to write
Hit Radio Shack with my dad
Bought me a mic, best day of my life
Ever since then I just make this music
Put it out for them to hate
But I’m Superman, my skin too thick to be penetrated
So many people always been telling me that I never would make it
But I’m an artist, how many times must I demonstrate it?
Now it’s my time to take it, I made my choices
But now so many people in my ear I’m hearing voices
So if you see me while I’m out and got my hat down to my eyes
Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign

I’m just tryna live my life like I’m supposed to be
While I’m following the path that has chosen me
Now it’s everywhere I go people notice me
Feet planted with my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low, and I don’t see no haters
My eyes red, cause I’m always medicated
Now they say I made it, cause I’m elevated
But my feet planted and my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low, I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low with my head up high
And I’ma keep my brim low",Brim Low,2014

Give me an auxiliary chord, now I'm the DJ
Playing what I wanna hear, none of the Pop shit
Give me the Big L, Wu Tang and Pac shit

Blunt ride back and burn the fuck down

Put the visine in my eyes
So go and live your lives, we'll only get to do it once

John Schullman,"Lately I've been contemplating
Watching humans tear apart this fucking planet
Like they've never heard of moderation
The people running things ain't worried bout no conservation
Unless there's money in the conversation
But what happens when the soil is too toxic for the plants to grow
And all our drinking water is polluted (got the answer bro?)
All I know is humans are the cancer of the planet
Forecast: lots of global warming with a chance of snow
Hoping things will change but I doubt they ever will
Mother nature dying while we yelling drill, baby drill
So in turn the world's heating up, climate change creeping up
Hell, at least those folks at Exxon made a decent buck
Carbon footprints on the world that'll never wash away
While the ones in charge of it ignoring what we got to say
Still we gotta try, all we got is you and I
Put your mother fucking fists in the sky, come and

Stand up, stand up, if you gonna fight for what you believe
Stand up, stand up, if you ain't falling for what they teaching
Stand up, stand up, if any time your back's up against the wall
Stand up, stand up, take away my freedom, you'll give me the reason to stand up!

I don't dabble much in things that are political
But it ain't hard to see
That half these politicians running shit are criminal
They way we written history is strictly fictitiously
Still they try tricking me, telling me that I'm living free
Now keeping quiet while they take away our freedoms
(Hell, they're just the constitutional laws, who fuckin' needs em?)
And the mainstream media decides what you'll be seeing
So I'm sceptical of everything, don't know what to believe in
'Cause they lying to us right under our noses
And we know it but there's nothing we can do to control it
And it's got me losing sleep
'Cause I'm seeing shit different than when I was younger
Watching world hunger while the economy's going under
Too caught up in reality shows and cell phones
Eatin' food full of GMO's to say
Yo! I've had enough of all these lies, all we got is you and I
Put your fucking fists up in the sky, come and

Stand up, stand up, if you gonna fight for what you believe
Stand up, stand up, if you ain't falling for what they teaching
Stand up, stand up, if any time your back's up against the wall
Stand up, stand up, take away my freedom, you'll give me the reason to stand up!

See now we've got these countries beefin' with us
Like some World War III shit
Things about to change, you'd be blind not to see this
Civil unrest, the greatest country in the west
Bout' to crumble like the Roman Empire, nonetheless
Our oceans full of plastic, and the air is full of chemicals
Well, we let it happen like it's consensual
But fuck that
Educate yourselves and don't fall for what they been tellin'
Just tell them to throw there fist in the sky and start a rebellion!",Stand Up,2014

You stood on the warf and you waved them goodbye;

John Schumann,"The wind out here's like a cross-cut saw, the land is red and green
The summer sun's hanging in a pale blue sky, the air is sharp and clean
There's a frozen moment in waving grain, food for a hungry world
But we can't clothe ourselves with the check, we can barely feed ourselves

At night I lie awake and worry and the debts go round and round
Furrows in my night time forehead,
And furrows on borrowed ground

There's and old galv shed with a laughing lean, it's kept the tractor dry
I remember the day when we knocked it up with stringy bark and fencing wire
The earthen floor's been beaten hard, where the rain hasn't cut a path
I'm frightened to look because I'm beaten too and the mice run through the chaff

And I lie on my bed, staring into the red 
And the overdraft won't come down
And it's hard work keeping your family together,
Living on borrowed ground

And I don't blame your brother, son, for moving into town
It's no place here for a bright young man,
Living on borrowed ground.

And I watch all the programs on the ABC, 
After the sun's gone down
Lucy Broad's talking on ""Countrywide"",

John Schumann,"The lady from the paper asked me would I write a song for you,
I didn't know you then but now I do.
And I'm stuck in this motel room with an empty aching heart,
And the miles roll out between us and they're tearing me apart…
All I've got are tunes and rhymes - this one's for you.

May you always feel the sunshine and take time to taste the rain,
May your friends be true and caring and I hope you are the same;
And in your fleeting passage, leave a little bit behind
For the children who will follow in your footsteps, along the sands of time.

I dreamed there was a world for you, without the rush of rockets
And the thump of khaki gunships in the sky…
But there were rows of eucalyptus and trains for little boys
And tadpoles in a still black creek and playgrounds full of noise;
In my vision, fear and greed and anger were the only things to die…

May the wind blow gently through your life, may your principles be strong;
May you stand up and be counted when they work out right from wrong…
May your nights be short and peaceful, may your days be warm and long;
May your music be a service…may they pause sometime and listen to your song

And here's this little voice, reaching down the phone,
""Dad you've been away so long, when are you coming home?""

May your eyes be filled with kindness, may the seeds of wisdom grow…
May you seek for truth and beauty and when you find it may you know…
May you help feed those who are hungry, and comfort those who hurt
May you always fright for justice for all of us who walk upon the earth",For the Children,1987

And I won't go down in a firefight, with a red scarf around my head;
And I won't die a hero's death hanging from the gallow's arm;
I'll flicker out alone in an empty room with the needle hanging out of my arm.

Sunshine, Melbourne, pastel morning,
The autobank's running low,
I got a job washing dishes in a Carlton restaurant, watching the hours go…
I met her in a rock and roll joint, where the carpet sticks to your shoes

She said ""If we travel to together, there's got to be a highway code,""

I guess I would have let it slide.

And they try to put the blame on you
You can only play with the cards that are in your hand…

A little out of Nelson Bay,

The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, in a season of plenty,
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.
The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, with the sweet smell of apples,
And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time just for livin', a place for to die.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
Now the green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.

And I'm wondering why
For it never should be there at all
With such pow'r in your smile
Sure a stone you'd beguile
So there's never a teardrop should fall

When your sweet lilting laughter's
Like some fairy song
And your eyes twinkle bright as can be
You should laugh all the while
And all other times smile
And now, smile a smile for me

When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy
All the world seems bright and gay
And when Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, they steal your heart away

For your smile is a part
Of the love in your heart
And it makes even sunshine more bright
Like the linnet's sweet song
Crooning all the day long
Comes your laughter and light

For the springtime of life
Is the sweetest of all
There is ne'er a real care or regret
And while springtime is ours
Throughout all of youth's hours
Let us smile each chance we get

When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring

Somewhere in Heaven you were fashioned for me,

Dearly beloved be mine.

You were never so fair,
Dreams were never lovelier,
Pardon me if I stare.

Down the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face;
I can only say they chose the proper place.

I was never luckier in my palmiest days.
Make a note, and you can quote me,
Honor bright,
You were never lovelier than you are tonight.

And all the girlies he would take for a float.

Then he'd kiss her now and then
She would tell him when,
They'd fool around and fool around
And then they'd kiss again.

It's yours to take to keep or break,
But please, before you start,
Be careful, it's my heart.

Through the windowpane, she looked at the rain,

It's a shame it rained today.""

When the clouds go drifting by, 
We will be happy, Nellie,

Sweethearts you and I.

To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

Washing and ironing, and then if she did,
They could get married and raise lots of

And she told her father and called a 
Taxi which got there before very long,
For someone was doing his little girl
Right for a change, and so here's what he said:

Single 'cause it's always been my belief,
Marriage can bring a man nothing but

And started in planning for his wedding
Suit which he'd purchased for only one buck,

End of this story, which just goes to show,

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,

Of this great city, wondrous though it be,
I scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter.

And find a peace no other land could know.

And watch the rivers laughing as they flow.

If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so",Moonlight Becomes You (From Here Come the Waves),2003
John Scott Trotter,"There's a tear in your eye
And I'm wondering why
For it never should be there at all
With such pow'r in your smile
Sure a stone you'd beguile
So there's never a teardrop should fall

When your sweet lilting laughter's
Like some fairy song
And your eyes twinkle bright as can be
You should laugh all the while
And all other times smile
And now, smile a smile for me

When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy
All the world seems bright and gay
And when Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, they steal your heart away

For your smile is a part
Of the love in your heart
And it makes even sunshine more bright
Like the linnet's sweet song
Crooning all the day long
Comes your laughter and light

For the springtime of life
Is the sweetest of all
There is ne'er a real care or regret
And while springtime is ours
Throughout all of youth's hours
Let us smile each chance we get

When Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring
In the lilt of Irish laughter
You can hear the angels sing
When Irish hearts are happy
All the world seems bright and gay
And when Irish eyes are smiling
Sure, they steal your heart away",When Irish Eyes Are Smiling [From Top O' the Morning],2003
