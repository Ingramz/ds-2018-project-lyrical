Seinem Orchester,"Là nel Messico si sa
Sparan con facilità
E talvolta per giocar
Va per aria un bar
 
Pablo tira sui bicchier
Pedro mira il camerier
E fra tanta confusion
Nasce una canzon
 
Tipipitipitipso col calypso
Allor si mettono a cantar
“Ay ay, siam messicani”
Tipipitipitipso col calypso
Poi si mettono a danzar
“Ay ay, siam messicani”
 
Pablo ama stuzzicar
Le ragazze nel passar
Fa promesse che si sa
Mai non manterrà
 
Pedro un giorno lo trovò
Con la ""niña"" del suo cuor
Con il lasso li pigliò
Poi li trascinò
 
Tipipitipitipso col calypso
Allor si misero a cantar
“Ay ay, siam messicani”
Tipipitipitipso col calypso
Poi si misero a danzar
“Ay ay, siam messicani”
 
Pablo è un grande giocator
Vince e perde da signor
Ma dinero mai non ha
Per la verità

Ruba a Pablo il suo caval
E lo vende per mangiar
Alla fine ben si sa
Che succederà

It's you they're all waiting for
They go
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
And they say

She's so lucky, she's a star 
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?

Tus huellas se han perdido entre la oscuridad
Te estoy llamando América pero no me respondes
Te han desaparecido los que temen la verdad

Envueltos entre sombras, negamos es cierto
Mientras no haya justicia, jamás tendremos paz
Viviendo dictaduras, te busco y no te encuentro
Tu torturado cuerpo, no saben donde esta

Si es sueno de uno es sueno de todos
Romper la cadena y echarnos a andar
Tengamos confianza para adelante mi raza
A salvar el tiempo por lo que vendrá

Seis Del Solar,"La ex-señorita no ha decidido qué hacer
En su clase de Geografía
La maestra habla de Turquía
Mientras que la susodicha
Sólo piensa en su desdicha y en su dilema
Ay, qué problema!

En casa, el novio ensaya qué va a decir
Seguro que va a morir
Cuando los padres se enteren
Y aunque él, otra solución prefiere
No llega a esa decisión
Porque esperar es mejor, a ver si la regla viene

Decisiones (Ave María)
Cada día (Si señor)
Alguien pierde, alguien gana Ave María!
Decisiones, todo cuesta
Salgan y hagan sus apuestas
Ciudadanía!

El señor de la casa de alquiler
A pesar de que ya tiene mujer
Ha decidido tener una aventura
(A lo casanova)
Y le ha propuesto a una vecina que es casada
De la manera más vulgar y descarada que
Cuando su marido
Al trabajo se haya ido lo llame
Para él ser su enamorado

La señora, que no es boba
Se lo cuenta a su marido y el bravo decide
Cómo no, invitar al atrevido y ella lo cita
Cual lo acordado
Y el vecino sale todo perfumado
Con ropa limpia que su esposa le ha planchado
Y trae una flor que se encontró en el tendedero
(A lo ""Love Story"")

Dentro en casa de la vecina está el marido
Indeciso sobre dónde dar primero
Con un bate de beisbol del extranjero

Y suena el timbre, ring-ring
(y no es el Gran Combo)
Comienza la segunda del noveno

Decisiones (Ya pa’ qué), cada día (Tu verás)
Alguien pierde, alguien gana
Ave María!
Decisiones, todo cuesta
Salgan y hagan sus apuestas
Ciudadanía!

El borracho está convencido que a él
El alcohol no le afecta los sentidos
Por el contrario
Que sus reflejos son mucho más claros
Y tiene más control

Por eso hunde el pie en el acelerador
Y sube el volumen de la radio
Para sentirse mejor (bien chevere)
Y cuando la luz cambiando a amarilla
Las ruedas del carro chillan
Y el tipo se cree un James Bond
Decide la luz del semáforo comerse
Y no ve el truck aparecerse en la oscuridad

Pito, choque y la pregunta
""Qué pasho?""
Pa’ la eternidad

Seis Del Solar,"Que alguien me diga si ha visto a mi esposo, preguntaba la doña
Se llama Ernesto X, tiene 40 años, trabaja de celador en un negocio de carros
Llevaba camisa oscura y pantalón claro, salió anteanoche y no ha regresado
No sé qué pensar, esto antes nunca me había pasado

Llevo tres días buscando a mi hermana, se llama Altagracia, igual que la abuela
Salió del trabajo pa' la escuela, tenía puestos unos jeans y una camisa blanca
No ha sido el novio, el tipo está en su casa
No saben de ella en la psn, ni en el hospital

Que alguien me diga si ha visto a mi hijo, es estudiante de
Pre medicina, se llama agustín, es un buen muchacho, a veces es
Terco cuando opina, lo han detenido, no sé qué fuerza, pantalón
Blanco, camisa a rayas, pasó anteayer

Clara Quiñones se llama mi madre, es un alma de dios, no se mete con nadie
Y se la han llevado de testigo, por un asunto que es no más conmigo
Y fui a entregarme, hoy por la tarde y ahora no saben quién se la llevó del cuartel

Anoche escuché varias explosiones, tiros de escopeta y de revólveres
Carros acelerados, frenos, gritos, eco de botas en la calle
Toques de puerta, quejas, por dioses, platos rotos
Estaban dando la telenovela, por eso nadie miró pa' fuera

¿Adónde van los desaparecidos?
Busca en el agua y en los matorrales
¿Y por qué es que se desaparecen?
Porque no todos somos iguales
¿Y cuándo vuelve el desaparecido?
Cada vez que los trae el pensamiento
¿Cómo se le habla al desaparecido?

Te levantas, caminas y pisas uno de los charcos de orine
Que el nuevo perro ha dejado por toda la casa

Enciendes la luz y restriegas el pie sobre la cubierta
Que tu esposa le puso al excusado
Vas hasta la bañadera blanca, abres los dos grifos del agua
Y controlas la temperatura
Levantas la cosa esa que no sabes cómo se llama
Y que hace que el agua salga por la regadera
Te bañas, no cantas, sales de la tina
Te secas con una toalla que dice ""disneylandia""
Te subes a una balanza que da siempre pesos diferentes
Pero aproximados
Cuando te estás afeitando, suena el despertador
Tu mujer abre los ojos, mira la hora
Lo apaga, se levanta, de su lado de la cama
Cada uno tiene su lado de la cama
Cada uno tiene su lado en todo
Tú la sientes saliendo del cuarto, rumbo a la cocina
El vecino de arriba prendió el tocadiscos
Terminas de afeitarte
Te limpias las cortaditas con papel higiénico
Que se te queda pegado a la piel
Te pones el desodorante, ""24 horas de protección constante,""
Un poco de colonia para después de afeitarse
Te arde la cara, sales del baño
Pisas otra vez el orine del perro
Le mientas la madre, en voz alta
Tu esposa, desde la cocina, te pregunta qué te pasa
Tú le explicas a gritos por qué no quieres otro perro en la casa
Mientras te secas el pie con la toalla mojada que dice ""disneylandia""
Ella se aparece y silenciosamente seca con un trapo el charco de orine
Vas al closet y sacas la ropa que te vas a poner miras el reloj
Hueles el café, te vistes, no encuentras la correa
Te haces la corbata dos veces porque la primera vez
La parte de atrás te quedó más larga que la parte de adelante
Vas a la cocina, tu esposa ya preparó tu desayuno
Le hablas otra vez del perro, ella, sin contestarte
Te recuerda que hay que pagar la cuenta de la luz
Y la matrícula de la escuela de los chiquillos
Cuelgas tu jacket del borde de la silla
Y te sientas en la mesa de la cocina
Tu esposa enciende el radio
Están transmitiendo las noticias
Mientras escuchas, mojas el pan en el café
Como te enseñó tu papá cuando eras niño
Suena el teléfono, tu esposa lo contesta, es para ti, de la oficina
Hoy van a arrestar al tipo, va un carro a recogerte, que lo esperes abajo
Cuelgas el teléfono, vas a tu cuarto, abres la segunda gaveta del armario
Tu gaveta, sacas tu libreta y los lentes negros, vas a la cama
Levantas el colchón y sacas tu revólver
Vas a la cocina, tomas tu jacket y lo pones todo en el bolsillo de adentro
Tu esposa te observa, le das un beso al espacio, al lado de la mejilla
Que ella no devuelve, o sí? abres la puerta y bajas por la escalera de madera
Saltando los escalones de dos en dos
Llegas a la calle, ves al camión recogiendo la basura

Pero el tiempo del amor no vuelve más

Why un diente de oro que cuando rie se ve brillando

Como a tres cuadras de aquella esquina una mujer
Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Why en un zaguán entra why se da un trago para olvidar
Que el día está flojo why no hay clientes pa' trabajar

Un carro pasa muy despacito por la avenida
No tiene marcas pero toos' saben ques' policia uhm
Pedro Navaja las manos siempre dentro 'el gabán
Mira why sonríe why el diente de oro vuelve a brillar

Mientras camina pasa la vista de esquina a esquina
No se ve un alma está desierta toa' la avenida
Cuando de pronto esa mujer sale del zaguán
Why Pedro Navaja apreta un puño dentro 'el gabán

Mira pa' un lado mira pal' otro why no ve a nadie
Why a la carrera pero sin ruido cruza la calle
Why mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
Refunfuñando pues no hizo pesos con qué comer

Mientras camina del viejo abrigo saca un revolver, esa mujer
Iba a guardarlo en su cartera pa' que no estorbe
Un trenta why ocho esmithanhueson del especial
Que carga encima pa' que la libre de todo mal

why Pedro Navaja puñal en mano le fue pa' encima
El diente de oro iba alumbrando
Toa' la avenida, se le hizo facil
Mientras reia el puñal le hundía sin compasión
Cuando de pronto sonó un disparo como un canon

why Pedro Navaja cayó en la acera mientras veía, a esa mujer
Que revolver en mano why de muerte herida ahí le decía
Yo que pensaba 'hoy no es mi día estoy salá'
Pero Pedro Navaja tu estas peor, no estas en na

why creanme gente que aunque hubo ruido nadien salió
No hubo curiosos, no hubo preguntas nadie lloró
Sólo un borracho con los dos cuerpos se tropezo
Cojio el revolver, el puñal, los pesos why se marchó
Why tropezando se fue cantando desafinao'
El coro que aqui les traje why da el mensaje de mi cancion

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Pedró navajas matón de esquina
Quien a hierro mata, a hierro termina

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Valiente pescador, al anzuelo que tiraste
En vez de una sardina, un tiburón enganchaste

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Como decía mi abuelita
El que último rie, se rie mejor

And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true, right away

And we will live together, until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever, as one

Every thought is a dream, rushing by in a stream,
Bringing life to our kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true, miles away

Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never,
We all, will live forever, as one

Come see victory, in the land called fantasy
Loving life, a new decree, 
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

Our minds will explore together, old worlds, we conquer, forever
We then, will expand love together, as one

Come to see, victory in a land called fantasy,
Loving life, for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find, other kind, that has been in search for you,
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life, now in review
And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you,
A glowing light will see you through

It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true
As you glide, in your stride with the wind, as you fly away

Sekou,"What absurd strategy is this?
Send down a handful of warriors
Let’s see if their blood is the same color as ours

Watch me appear on the field, my mission is to chill
I'n'I think 'bout the vibes and not about the dollar bill
I been busy on my rhymes, put some on a layaway
What makes me happy like Caribbean carnival on labour day
I love my mama, the hip hop shit we kick is thick
And if you trip you jealous motherfuckers get the dick
Now we kick in the door, you never heard it before,
Raw battle reports is what ambassadors stand for,
We're making rhymes not war, droppin' lines but don't sniff 'em,
I'm chillin' with my man Max and Sekou on the spliff an',
Reminisin' about the time the Phlow used to rock,
But '98 it's Mellowbag and Freundeskreis to tie the knot,
Blowin' the spot, what, makin' hip-hop what it is
First's supposed to be the fun then later comes the biz
That's what it is when we droppin' part two
It's undisputed rebel troops achieving victories for you
Yes for you and your people, queens and not the cheap ho's,
Commons not Deebos, true friends and not the fake bro's,
We're in it for the love what is dividing us from many,
Breaking through like Shaka Zulu for the heart and not the money

What them wanna do for stop you
Mephisto can't strike we down
The rebel will come through
What them wanna do for stop you
When you're under your meditation and look through

What is this, a game?
For the lack of a better word, general
We call it war

We kick that progress report consort to make it happen
Set up forts in foreign lands expand for everlasting
The fam span across the atlas like diasporas
Escape from out the grasp ot the most wickedest captors
Hear the laughter of the Czars in the dark like Nabokov
Rebellion coup d'etat, shit is raw, cut they heads off
Those who were lost floss now living lavish
Destination be the pastures of the city of Nazareth
Catalyst the revolution move the troops from out pollution
Mobutu citizens get the boot right in they asses
Ambassador status bring the loot back to the masses
Who live like hostages, the system be abusive like the music business is
We exist in the abyss but images be marvellous like novelists
Picture this like hieroglyphics on the fines papyrus
The world is ours but is devoured by the hour
Spread the scripture like Egyptians while the wicked spread the virus
Through the lies I realize the righteous bare my likeness
But they spite us so let the weak recite this
Sow my seed amongst the captives let the fleet complete the cipher

What them wanna do for stop you
Mephisto can't strike we down
The rebel will come through

The rebel will come through

You could never ever out the fire we are walk through
What them wanna do now

Block the enemies shields
Hack holes in his plaque
And aim for the heart

Ich ritt den trojanischen Gaul im Blendwerk der Hölle
Sah die Fäulnis des Biz, blieb im Sattel wie Paul Schockemöhle
Ihr nehmt Rap wie Öde-Pus-sis
Ich mahn' Plattenmultis wie Mullahs Rushdie
Im Jahr 20 nach Guevara brach es aus uns raus wie Lava
Wir nahmen uns Land wie der Sand in der Sahara
Mach' Tabula Rasa wie Kabila in Kinshasa
Mobutu MCs fliegt zum Mars wie die Nasa
Euer erster Gehversuch war 'ne Bruchlandung
Jetzt holt ihr euch ein Reimebuch aus der Buchhandlung

Bei Gefahr bleib ich klar, wie Che Guevara
Ihr meint wir seien nicht echt wie 'ne Fatamorgana
Doch bitet meinen Rhyme wie Boxer Carmina Burana

Wasilicious, die Tradition der Famile wahrt
Mein Ego ist durchwachsen wie der Wald in Brasilien war
Ich bau' mir mein Ding zieh's durch, bis man mein Echo hört
Echauffiert euch, ich bewahr mir eure Ehrfurcht
M.C.'s seh'n uns als Verfechter einer neuen Ära
Ich bin nicht euer Lehrer, ich seh' das Ganze 'nen bisschen klarer
Kein Klugscheisser, der denkt sein Shit sei deep und stinkt nicht
Alter, mach mal Platten, jeder zweite linkt dich
Doch ich bin jung und open-minded, weiß wen
Ich als Freund und Feind hab, bereue keinen Tag
An dem ich redlich Revue passieren ließ und endlich alles verwarf
Weil erstens Ansichten sich ändern und zweitens ich das darf
Es ist in meinen Texten nachzulesen, ich frage mich
Wie lang man braucht, um sich aus der Namenlosigkeit zu lösen
Sich und sein Wesen zu offenbarn
Wo bleibt die Antwort auf die Frage die noch offen war?
Allein dieser Umstand nimmt uns schon die Illusion
Man sehnt sich nach Ruhm, Sensation will Fusion
Buhlt um die Gunst des Konsumkids, denk an den Stumpfsinn
Bevor du ""Keep it real"" in den Mund nimmst

Geblendet vom Szenario erkennt man nicht

Leb' mein Leben im Zeichen der Bandiera Rossa
Für die Posse und Beats die mich reinigen wie Wasser
Geh' auf steinigen Straßen meine Peiniger erblassen
Denn ich leide beileibe für die Scheibe, die aufliegt
Weiß nicht, ob es das aufwiegt, was ich aus dem Verkauf zieh
Lauf euch nicht hinterher für'n Platz in eurer Plattenkiste
Ich kenn den wahren Wert auch wenn ich nur im Schatten dichte
Banaler Rap ist Publik und macht uns
In Sachen Kunst zu 'ner Bananenrepublik
Nur das Gute liegt so nah, warum in die Ferne schweifen?
Wenn wir lernen und reifen, bevor wir nach den Sternen greifen
Jeder wähnt sich als Gigolo im Sakko nach Monaco
Träumt von Ruhm wie Jacko, hört er sieben mal den Gecko
Der Habit ist Deko, die Darbietung versteckt nur
Aber euer Mack-Getuh' bedarf meiner Korrektur
Wir quadrieren den Kreis gegen alle Konvention'
Und geiseln den Geist der Konterrevolution
Sind wie Chiapas, Söhne Zapatas
Feel pata pata wie Miriam Makeba
Wir schlagen ein wie'n Meteor - Junge
Du siehst Rot rennst ins leere wie 'n Stier beim Matador
Wenn wir Worte setzen Sätze bilden bildhafte Texte die entsetzten
Weil wir nach Wahrheit lechzen
Nick' mit dem Kopf wie 'n Jude an der Klagemauer
Wir bringen die Styles, die das Jahrtausend überdauern
Adieu monsieur, ton jeu est fini
Bei uns beißt du auf Granit - bon appetit

Smells caught in between, nigga doin his thing

[Verse 2 - Sekou 720]
Oh my gangstaness
All the anger in my heart who we thank for this
Yo I can't thank a soul but God and guns
Don't kill a damn fool it's a animant's steel (drugs)
It's the liquor and the bills cause a man to steal
It's the lack of Medicaid and these bitches got AIDS
And they snaggin at the why, player we too high
I ain't really into ballin and tossin my chips (uh huh)
Rather cop real estate then ride big whips
Rather trick on my wife and go real a dick or hips
Slick bitch that's strict man, she can't get shit
But she get trashed on the car hood by Hoodstock
We got good stock
and size does matter bitch, that's why we slang good cock
Back the thirty eight slug, back out (what what)
Look out the way, 'fore your whole hood shot up (yeah)

[Chorus - Black Child - 2X - w/ ad libs]
The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back
The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back
The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back

The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back
The Inc. is back, the Inc. is back
Black Child is gutter
I don't give a fuck what I sell out with a gun motherfucker

[Verse 3 - Black Child]
I got stocks in the hood, sold rocks in the wood
Pop up on your block, with the glock like its good
Got niggaz scared to cop and drop like I'm Suge
Pop if you could, watch if you would
Nigga go platinum from the federal pen
Go 150 months, and come home gettin rich again
Nigga it's sicker than, I hope you listenin
Nigga we glistenin, pop off and leave you in the dead man position
Black Child is Murder, why'all forgettin
The work I put in, the dirt I done did
On this earth niggaz lives is worthless
Unless you worth a few million, school your children
Let the game get to 'em, then they brain get ruined
Mine speak foreign languages fluently
Hoodstock exchange ain't nothin new to me
Cop and go, set 'em shoppin up to Unity
I've been ticklin clit ever since puberty
Might taste it if it smells clean to me
Mama lean with me, holler and scream with me

[Chorus - Ja Rule - 2X - w/ ad libs]
The Rule is back, the Rule is back
The Rule is back, the Rule is back
Like 'Pac said ""keep your head up man""
Like Biggie Biggie ""give me one more chance""
Haha, niggaz

[Verse 4 - Ja Rule]
I +Clap Back+ just from my mental anguish
This cash is aimless, cop the new yellow Vanguish
And I ride swervin down the westside highway
Get high like a G4 on the runway
I can't land it man with gun in hand
A hundred grand in escrow tryna expand
A million niggaz that brick, whole bricks to grams
Just leave with money, its seems like its Uncle Sam
So keep (hustlin) I done roll that comes from all the pain and the (strugglin)
(Look at here) federal agents (runnin in)
Come again, it must be mistaken identity
Like when Oswald took the rap for killin a Kennedy
We in the street, not industry niggaz
And because we're called ""the Murderers"" that don't make us killaz, now does it?
Now it's not home but still them trumpets blowin
Hold on cause the leader of this mission is a pro

Dibujarte una sonrisa es un estimulo

Solo es pulir mi sonido y burlar tus horizontes
Es r-a-p el ritmo tener

El luchar por un genero y lo echan a perder
El vivir al 100
Y cada quien a lo suyo
Enfocar mi vida por un camino mas seguro

Caballero que cabalga
Sobre un ritmo y sin espada
Vivo el dia a dia y ver el sol salir mañana

Y si no esta
Brindare por la luna
Buscare lo mio
Y nada importa

Si no esta buscare

It Is Well With My Soul
Words and Music by Horatio Spafford

When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say

It is well, It is well with my soul.
It is well with my soul

It is well, It is well with my soul.
My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought
My sin, not in part, but the whole
Has been nailed to the cross
So I bear it no more
Praise The Lord, praise The Lord, oh my soul.

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound and The Lord shall descend
Even so, it is well with my soul.","Bika Mono Ve (Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior) /It Is Well With My Soul",1999
Selah,"The blood that Jesus shed for me
Way back on Calvary
The blood that gives me strength

It reaches to the highest mountain
And it flows to the lowest valley

From day to day
It will never lose its power.

It soothes my doubts and calms my fears
And it dries all my tears

Had a little date with my baby last night
Now it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Well, it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Now it's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues

Went to all the places where we used to go
Went to your house, but you don't live there no more
Now it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Well, it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues

Went to your friend's house, but she was out
Knocked on your father's door and he began to shout, ""get out there, boy""
Early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues

Went to Dooky Chase to get something to eat
Waiter looked at me and said, ""You sure look beat""
Now it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning (early in the morning)
Well, it's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues

Seldon Powell,"Good morning heartache
You old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache
Thought we said goodbye last night

I turned and tossed until it seems you have gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now everyday I stop I'm saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new?

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight to Sunday blues

Here we go again

You're the one
Who knows me well
Might as well get used to you hanging around

Seldon Powell,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

You don't have to worry cause I'm comin'
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough, love, for me stay

Did I leave your mind when I was gone?

Seldon Powell,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,2006
Seldon Powell,"Homesick tired All alone in a big city 
Why should ev'rybody pity me,
Nighttime's falling, folks are a singin',

Dear Old Southland with it's dreamy songs 
Takes me back there where I belong 
How I'd love to be in mammy's arms
When It's Sleepy Time Down South
 

",Sleepy Time Down South,2006
Seldon Powell,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

se quedó en el pasado
Porque te has alejado
sin motivo y sin razon
Tú heriste mi corazón 
Si un día yo en ti creí
Estuve equivocada
Nunca me diste nada,
solamente una traición
Tú heriste mi corazón 
Ya ves, así lo quisiste
Ya ves, fuiste tú quién me heriste
Ya ves, ahora te arrepientes
Ya ves, dime cómo se siente
Que ya no te quiero
Que ya no soy tuya

I hold my pillow tight,

Aquí en mi alma yo de ti no quiero nada
Porque rompí ya las cadenas de tu amor
Y ya nunca nunca volveré

Porque rompí ya las cadenas de tu amor
Y ya nunca más te quiero ver
Porque rompi ya las cadernas de tu amor
Y ya nunca más te quiero ver
Porque he oldivado esos recuerdos
De tu amor y tus besos
Y espero alguien nuevo
Ya no siento más amor por ti
Ya no habrá más lagrimas aquí
Ya verás seré feliz sin ti


Porque he olvidado esos recuerdos
De tu amoe y tus besos
Y espero alguien nuevo
Ya no siento más amor por ti

Selena,"Never had time for the celebration
Singing like a woman when you're six years old
Never got to dance at the graduation
Didn't want it, didn't need it
She was on the road

No letters from home
We just kept moving on 
We were all alone, together

Simple stops along the way 
No one knows the price we paid
For the dream, for the dream
The people came from everywhere
And they all wait for her
To sing the songs one more time

So many miles, so many places
The music pulling like an under tow
Leaving smiles on all their faces
They were living the songs she wrote

No stick ball in the street
No grass stains on the knees
We were all gypsies, together

And forever in my mind
This will always be
She was the world for me 
But I no longer weep for her
All that's left is the need for her
To sing the songs one more time

Just one more time",One More Time,
Selena,"I could lose my heart tonight
If you don't turn and walk away
'Cause the way I feel I might
Lose control and let you stay

'Cause I could take in my arms
And never let go

I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

I can only wonder how
Touching you would make me feel
But if I take that chance right now
Tomorrow will you want me still

So I should keep this to myself
And never let you know

I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

And I know it's not right
And I guess I should try to do what I should do
But I could fall in love, fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

Siempre estoy sonando en ti
Besando mis labios, acariciando mi piel
Abrazandome con ansias locas
Imaginando que me amas
Como yo podia amar a ti

Am I so easy to read?
My eyes must be speaking your name
My touch must burn like a flame

That love doesn't come when you plan
Here I am
Caught up in these feelings I don't understand

[Chorus]
Is it the beat or the beat of your heart?
Is it the music? Is it body talk?
How did you move me, and when did it start?
Is it the beat or the beat of your heart?

Night falls, and I seem to change
Near you, I'm acting so strange
I know that we've only just met
But dreaming has gone to my head
You and I
See nobody else in the place
Let your smile
Answer this question you read on my face:

Sabes que te quiero why sin ti me desespero
Eres tu mi todo, why yo sin ti me muero
Eres mi alegria en cada despertar
why quiero a tu lado yo poder estar

Now, ev'rything's in black and white

Have somehow lost their light

I'll leave the porch light burning bright

I was petrified
Kept thinking how could I never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And now your back from outer space
Just turn around 
'Cause your not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with good-byes?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no now go
Walk out the door
Don't turn around now
Cause your not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me good-bye?
Did you think I'd crumble? 
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I
I will survive
For as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive
I will survive

Gotta make a move to town that's right for me
Gotta keep me movin'
Keep me groovin' with some energy

Talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it
Talk about it, talk about it, talk about moo-ving

Someone found the letter you wrote me on the radio
And it said exactly how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
It never said your name, but I knew who they meant

I was so surprised and shocked and I wondered too
If by chance you heard for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you

But they said it really loud
They said it on the air

Selena,"I could lose my heart tonight
If you don't turn and walk away
'Cause the way I feel I might
Lose control and let you stay

'Cause I could take in my arms
And never let go

I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

I can only wonder how
Touching you would make me feel
But if I take that chance right now
Tomorrow will you want me still

So I should keep this to myself
And never let you know

I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

And I know it's not right
And I guess I should try to do what I should do
But I could fall in love, fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

Siempre estoy sonando en ti
Besando mis labios, acariciando mi piel
Abrazandome con ansias locas
Imaginando que me amas
Como yo podia amar a ti

So I should keep this to myself

Borracha y apasionada, nomás por tu amor
Mira como ando mi bien, muy dada
A la borrachera y a la perdición

Tú, sólo tú
Has llenado de luto mi vida
Abriendo una herida en mi corazón
Tú, sólo tú
Eres causa de todo mi llanto
De mi desencanto y desesperación

Mira como ando mi bien por tu querer

Sólo tu sombra fatal, sombra del mal
Me sigue por dondequiera con obstinación

Selena,"All alone, nothing to do
It's lonely here without you
The candlelight is burning low
The love songs on the radio
And memories are all I have to show

Photographs, tickets for two
Promises that all fell through
Now, everything in black and white
The colors faded with the light
The stars we used to wish upon
Have somehow lost their light

[CHORUS]
Where is the feeling we used to know?
Where is the music that played?
What happened to the love that used to show?
Where did the feeling go?

Thoughts of you fill my mind
Paperbacks to pass the time
And, as I lie awake tonight
I'll leave the porch light burning bright
And miss the loving arms
That used to hold me tight

Vale más que el dinero porque sí es amor

Make you pay for all of your sins, oh

I've had my eye on you all night
I'm gonna find a way to make you mine
I know, even though

You're an outlaw

You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer

And it’s hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
It’ll be alright, they’re just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

Selena Gomez & the Scene,"Preacher man walked into the club and he said he said
""Hey girl can't you walk and not stray""
Father I'm torn and I'm selling my soul to the
Rhythm, the beat and the bass 'cause I cant
Confess my rock and roll ways
'Cause I'm so possessed with the music
The music he plays

I cant stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
Oh no I fell in love with my rock god
I cant keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love my rock rock god

Preacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said ""hey girl can't you live your life right?"" and I cried
""Father things aren't always so black and white.
Don't cast the first stone 'cause I'm not alone""
And its not like I'm hurtin' anyone
But I cant confess my rock, my rock and roll ways

I can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
Oh no I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love my rock rock god

I can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
Oh no I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love my rock rock god

No I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
I chose a path and I'm not looking back
And I'm sorry if I left the angels crying
Over me

I can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
Oh no I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love my rock rock god

Preacher man, preacher man,
Forgive me for I don't know what I do
Preacher man, preacher man
Preacher man why don't you understand

Ya nada ha sido igual, todo que era tan lindo why bonito
Sin tí ya no tiene valor

Yo te sigo queriendo, amando
Añorando tu amor
Porque todo esta frío, tan vacío sin ti

Yo te sigo soñando, llorando
Esperando verte aquí
Why ya nada me importa, solo quiero tenerte aquí

Aúnque me dicen, que otro vendrá
Nadie podrá reemplezarte aquí en mis brazos
Why en esta partida ya sé que perdí
Why hoy me rindo a ti
Why aúnque me cueste mi orgullo
Te voy a rogar que regreses a mí

Añorando tu amor
Porque todo esta frío, tan vacío sin ti

If it's any consolation, I guess I wouldn't want to be you
Can't say that I'm crazy about anything that you do
Without concrete belief, you step up to the edge and follow
Through

A fickle incision from the hand that fed you in the first

Ten million opinions in your skin color face
Contrary to popular belief, this time you caught your foot

Wash it when it gets worn, dirty, tattered, torn
Fell in love with me and wears me with pride
We bathe in ultra tide when I start to feel guilty
And everyone's jealous cause they wish they had it
I'm half a man without it
I'm the king of style
And I'll keep on wearing my marathon shirt
And I'll wear it everyday til it hurts
And I got no lady over her
Confidence-a-plenty in my marathon shirt
Once loaned her to a friend for a party and I worried all
Night like a mother does
And when she returned all wrinkled and helpless, she smelled
Of cheap cigarettes and other drugs
I'd wear her in any season
I'd wear her for any reason
The only promise in my life's that shirt of mine
And day after day, as her colors fade away, I'll remember
What she felt like the first time
Now I've come to lay you down
You can soak into the sound and I'm so elated
She can't be recreated and the water's turning brown

What more could I ask?
What more could I stand?
I'm so low that I wish I was dead
With a knife in my chest and a bullet in my head
I'm so low that I wish I was dead
Must I go on?
Sold all my friends today
I'm so low that I wish I was dead
Gave everything away
Now I'm bound only by twine and thread
Just give me time
Don't give me time to miss you
Just give me time
Don't give me time to miss you
On a short leash yet she was eathbound
So I threw her in the lost and found
Now she's scaring me
A fine charity
With a pink trombone and a tuning key
So just ignore the footprints
And just ignore the sand
My epitaph stands before me
So wear your ego to the funeral of a frightened man
Saw her standing in the doorway
Fade away

If I were dead
If I were dead she wouldn't love me anymore

I'll bet they're really great
There's something to the way you find time to create
The second album is late
Where is it anyway?
Here I am
Believe the sound you breathe
I'm in up to my knees
Disregard everything because now I'm over my sophomore jinx
You're crowding my dollar signs (make everyone sing)

X amount of dollars for my head
Should I say ""commodity""
Help me get madonna off my bed
She's just to drunk to sing
Management's explaining, entertaining to the industry
They've heard the same spiel a million times
Maybe two or three
The illusion is sealed
The band's all wrapped in chains
Wish their vibe was still real
Now it all sounds the same
And all the grooves that they steal
All the blues down on beale
Prolific wisdom english poets often write
Here I am
Believe the sound you breed
I'm in up to my knees

Or thinks about you anyway?
Does she smoke crack, burn buildings, or just plain strange?

The man in the crowd with the
Multicolored mirrors on his hobnail boots

Lying with his eyes
While his hands are busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife
Which he ate and donated to the National Trust

Down to the bits that I left uptown

Will I ever learn to talk?

When we walk around the place
Look upon the beautiful secrets
That all the artists' made.

And we still wanna stay
How fast the light has faded
Turn down the noise in the city
At night they turn the water on around the artworks

The dark downtown parade.

In the garden, In the garden.
Underneath the cherry moon
Midnight in the sculpture garden
We can make our own beautiful secret
Rose petal vermillion breezes
We can join the fabled few.

A ghost without a friend
All around the starlight found are lost and wounded men.
I know that I did some damage
I wanted to be home again
So I waited for a star my soul to mend

I waited for a star my soul to mend.
She came a long way to love me
And I'm tasting her spark
Now my lips are wet
She came a long way to kiss me
And I want to stay here forever in her light
I know that I don't deserve it
But I want to hear her sigh
I want to stay forever in her light.

Star you're a beautiful sight
Bring me you lovely light
I'll be a satellite, satellite.
Star you're a beautiful sight

Bring me you lovely light
I'll be a satellite, satellite.
And I might want you to shine
And there's a dark crater space in heaven
And there's a bright little place in my head
And darkness blows my mind
I can lie on my back and wonder
Why I've been treated so fine

I'll make love to her while we have tonight.
And make love to her while we have tonight
Star you're a beautiful sight
Bring me you lovely light

Down a wishing well.
No one could hear me calling
From where I fell.
And from above the ground
The world and all her sounds

I could faintly hear
Songs, vows, playgrounds, tears.

I fell in a wishing well
And who, who have I become?
Now the damage is done
Not even angels saw me

Bright in my eyes.
From tall starry skies.
And then a searchlight shone upon me
For all this time I prayed

Now stranger I'm afraid
You might come around.
I might call you down.
I fell in a wishing well

Now the damage is done
And who, who have I become?

I'm through with my dream come true.
Then it's just begun
And who, who have I become?
Opened my eyes and woke up twice this morning

Lately getting up has only got me down.
Maybe there's a place where I can live again
Never leave the ground.
I fell in a wishing well
Now the damage is done

(Now the damage is done)

And who, who have I become?
And it's just begun.
I'm through with my dream come true
Who, who have I become

Sellin' crystal to their women fine freaks turned flaca
Your lady say she love you but you locked inside
I heard you slipped they caught you rollin' with some dope in your ride
Your lady said she'll wait love don't come cheap
She'd rather see in the pinta than six feet deep
But can't she see that in the pinta you're a soldier
They take ya break ya make ya and mold ya
Turn you into somethin' way loco hard
Surviving scraps and jacks earning your stripes on the yard
Every night thinking about the good ol days
Look at the picture of your ruca on the wall and pray say
Por favor perdon a pecado won't you come into and save me why sabes que I'm feelin' hollow
So look into your saviors eyes and see tears
Shed for you loco and all these years

I shed a tear for his girl waitin' to see him again
It's so hard mi vida but I still try
Workin' hard to make a difference before I die

Freakas of the funk yo it's the funk freakas
The dog's out the yard and he's loud in your speakas
Stompin' with my compas or should I say my back up
Crusing in the Impala countin' feria that we stacked up
Delinquents pick the slack up I be the first to act up
Deal with all these puntos but first I fuck the track up
Do what I got to do in the quest for the paper
I don't give a fuck if it puts me in danger
Dealin' with the anger that everyone has
Sometimes it makes me feel like a psychopath
I put it on tape and you know I won't lie
I'll be down with the Habits even after I die

There must be 50 ways to let you know

Click clack goes the cuete snap goes the neck
From your canton right up to my canton
It seems that everybody want to be el mas chingon
We move alone or in packas collect ferria in stockas
We got no love for them ratas chest flesh full of placas
And would you strike me down will I feel the wrath
To protect my own another's life is lost in the aftermath
No indecisions mind state makin' moves with precision
See the good turn bad and confirm that I'm livin'
Between Heaven and Hell this be the gloomy old West
Where many souls get lost and many more lie to rest

How could I just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home take my chrome
I said yo it's on, take cover son or you're assed out

How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out?
Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway, young punk had to pay

From the slums, yo, aiyo

I examine your diameter, third eye, light the camera up
Be careful, I got four ninjas inside your parameter
Perimeter, flame burst out all sides like Gamora
My poisonous is released, gas from the canister

Raise the black fist, we keep the earth on it's axis
I make a good day move slow like molasses
Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break, I can't revive

In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four
Five clip, filled with the spiral tip

I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggaz approach me

Like the blind, death, dumb, whose mind was left numb
A non be Boy nigga couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started MC'ing, I entered the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I becoming with too much to measure

With the math of an elder and the steel of a welder
The path of tray that I had laid down and held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope

Supreme deluxe edition, cream with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison

Twenty-two year old, Dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby, moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body now, he stuck in another prison

When you see it, you better acknowledge your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours, pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw

Why try to fuck with these lecturers?
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. family and more one

The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land

He blew out the belt drive, MC's they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation

But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn

Them, Clansmen are the nucleus of hiphop
There's no room for error, M see's will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser

The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, til you're all gone

The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces and driven back

It is very dangerous to make a raid
With the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack",Advance Pawns,2007

Slit the throats of all the priests
The last smile they will ever expect
A gaping hole running right through their neck

Snakes get fat while the good rats die
All the pigs should be bled dry

All your sins will be forgiven
When your blood begins to thicken
You have no answers to our questions
God bless this great depression

The snakes get fat while the good rats die
And all the pigs should be bled dry
Who's with me?

Throw the bodies into the streets
Nothing more than rotten meat
Taught not to bite the hand that feeds
'Til it's cold and dry and no longer bleeds

The snakes get fat while the good rats die
So all the pigs should be bled dry

All the fucking clergy men
Child abusers, national front
Rapists, racists, all fucking scum

And they march hand in hand
To rape our green and pleasant land
Dust to dust, earth to earth
The new born babies drowned at birth

And there's no future for England's son
They're nine years old and they all carry guns
Take out your crowbars, take out your knives
Drain out your blood, we all deserve to die

It's time for us to take a stand
We are dying on our knees in this great fucking land
And all the martyrs they have convinced themselves
That death ain't a sin when you're living in hell

There ain't no glory and there ain't no hope
We will hang ourselves just show us the rope
There ain't no scapegoats left to blame
We brought this on ourselves, we could have been the change

So cut our throats, end our lives

Senior Master Sergeant C.E. Askew,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Seniorr Rosemary,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1993

Senking,"Walk in a corner shop
See a shoplifting cop
See the old lady with a gun
See the hero try 2 run
Nothing's what it seems, I mean
It's not all dirty, but it's not all clean
There's children paying bills
There's monks buying thrills
There's pride for sale in magazines
There's pills for rent 2 make u clean
Marvin Gaye, there's no brother, brother
Woody Guthrie's land can't feed Mother

Mothers weep, children sleep
So much violence ends in silence
It's a shame there's no one 2 blame
For all the pain that life brings
If u will just take me It might just complete me
And together we can make a stand

A waitress brings me lunch
We meet but do not touch
On TV, D.C. is selling lies
While in the corner, King's dream dies
Go 2 the counter, pay for me and my friend
A homeless man pulls out a roll, says it's on him
The mayor has no cash
He said he spent it on hookers and hash

Mothers weep, children sleep
So much violence ends in silence
It's a shame there's no one 2 blame
For all the pain that life brings
If u will just take me It might just complete me
And together we can make a stand

U will love me, I will love u

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Come on closer
See me play
The sensational game
It's the only thing I've got in my life
And I play it every day
And, well, believe it or not,
It's just, pinball
And for me it's
Claro Que Si
Claro Que Si

Come, come close to me
I tell you man you will see
I'm like happy tree
Come close and then you will see

Every ball for me's another game
For you this always looks the same
Every ball for me's another game
For you this always looks the same

Hey you, man you watch me
Might be right I am a fool
But man why don't you tell me
If you know a better tool

All the gates are lit
This is very good for me
It's like a kiss
Watch out man and you will see
Now all lights are on
Believe me man that I have won
I know for you this doesn't look a lot
For me this is the only thing I got

I really couldn't care less
If you take me a for a fool
I know you couldn't show me
Any better tool

Oy oy oy
I like my toy
Claro que si
Is yes for sure
Oy oy oy
I like my toy
A knack inside

I press the button and it's not the same",Pinball Chacha [Cha-Cha-Cha],2008

Señor Coconut y Su Conjunto,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water [Original Spanish Version],2004
Señor Soul,"I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before 
Between the two of us guys 
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say 
When I found out yesterday 
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah.
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine baby
 
I know a man ain't supposed to cry 
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself 
That you loved some one else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
 
People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
I'm just about to love my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah",I Heard It Through the Grapevine,
Señor Soul,"Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, ah ah ah ah
